Adaptive Pre-training Data Detection for Large Language Models via Surprising Tokens,"Anqi Zhang, Chaofeng Wu","While large language models (LLMs) are extensively used, there are raising concerns regarding privacy, security, and copyright due to their opaque training data, which brings the problem of detecting pre-training data on the table. Current solutions to this problem leverage techniques explored in machine learning privacy such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which heavily depend on LLMs' capability of verbatim memorization. However, this reliance presents challenges, especially given the vast amount of training data and the restricted number of effective training epochs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive pre-training data detection method which alleviates this reliance and effectively amplify the identification. Our method adaptively locates \textit{surprising tokens} of the input. A token is surprising to a LLM if the prediction on the token is ""certain but wrong"", which refers to low Shannon entropy of the probability distribution and low probability of the ground truth token at the same time. By using the prediction probability of surprising tokens to measure \textit{surprising}, the detection method is achieved based on the simple hypothesis that seeing seen data is less surprising for the model compared with seeing unseen data. The method can be applied without any access to the the pre-training data corpus or additional training like reference models. Our approach exhibits a consistent enhancement compared to existing methods in diverse experiments conducted on various benchmarks and models, achieving a maximum improvement of 29.5\%. We also introduce a new benchmark Dolma-Book developed upon a novel framework, which employs book data collected both before and after model training to provide further evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21248v1,2024-07
Advancing Vietnamese Visual Question Answering with Transformer and Convolutional Integration,"Ngoc Son Nguyen, Van Son Nguyen, Tung Le","Visual Question Answering (VQA) has recently emerged as a potential research domain, captivating the interest of many in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision. Despite the prevalence of approaches in English, there is a notable lack of systems specifically developed for certain languages, particularly Vietnamese. This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting comprehensive experiments on the Vietnamese Visual Question Answering (ViVQA) dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model. In response to community interest, we have developed a model that enhances image representation capabilities, thereby improving overall performance in the ViVQA system. Specifically, our model integrates the Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with frozen unimodal models (BLIP-2) and the convolutional neural network EfficientNet to extract and process both local and global features from images. This integration leverages the strengths of transformer-based architectures for capturing comprehensive contextual information and convolutional networks for detailed local features. By freezing the parameters of these pre-trained models, we significantly reduce the computational cost and training time, while maintaining high performance. This approach significantly improves image representation and enhances the performance of existing VQA systems. We then leverage a multi-modal fusion module based on a general-purpose multi-modal foundation model (BEiT-3) to fuse the information between visual and textual features. Our experimental findings demonstrate that our model surpasses competing baselines, achieving promising performance. This is particularly evident in its accuracy of $71.04\%$ on the test set of the ViVQA dataset, marking a significant advancement in our research area. The code is available at https://github.com/nngocson2002/ViVQA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21229v1,2024-07
GenRec: Generative Sequential Recommendation with Large Language Models,"Panfeng Cao, Pietro Lio","Sequential recommendation is a task to capture hidden user preferences from historical user item interaction data and recommend next items for the user. Significant progress has been made in this domain by leveraging classification based learning methods. Inspired by the recent paradigm of 'pretrain, prompt and predict' in NLP, we consider sequential recommendation as a sequence to sequence generation task and propose a novel model named Generative Recommendation (GenRec). Unlike classification based models that learn explicit user and item representations, GenRec utilizes the sequence modeling capability of Transformer and adopts the masked item prediction objective to effectively learn the hidden bidirectional sequential patterns. Different from existing generative sequential recommendation models, GenRec does not rely on manually designed hard prompts. The input to GenRec is textual user item sequence and the output is top ranked next items. Moreover, GenRec is lightweight and requires only a few hours to train effectively in low-resource settings, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios and helping to democratize large language models in the sequential recommendation domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that GenRec generalizes on various public real-world datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. Our experiments also validate the effectiveness of the the proposed masked item prediction objective that improves the model performance by a large margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21191v2,2024-07
Decomposed Prompting to Answer Questions on a Course Discussion Board,"Brandon Jaipersaud, Paul Zhang, Jimmy Ba, Andrew Petersen, Lisa Zhang, Michael R. Zhang","We propose and evaluate a question-answering system that uses decomposed prompting to classify and answer student questions on a course discussion board. Our system uses a large language model (LLM) to classify questions into one of four types: conceptual, homework, logistics, and not answerable. This enables us to employ a different strategy for answering questions that fall under different types. Using a variant of GPT-3, we achieve $81\%$ classification accuracy. We discuss our system's performance on answering conceptual questions from a machine learning course and various failure modes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21170v1,2024-07
Event-Arguments Extraction Corpus and Modeling using BERT for Arabic,"Alaa Aljabari, Lina Duaibes, Mustafa Jarrar, Mohammed Khalilia","Event-argument extraction is a challenging task, particularly in Arabic due to sparse linguistic resources. To fill this gap, we introduce the \hadath corpus ($550$k tokens) as an extension of Wojood, enriched with event-argument annotations. We used three types of event arguments: $agent$, $location$, and $date$, which we annotated as relation types. Our inter-annotator agreement evaluation resulted in $82.23\%$ $Kappa$ score and $87.2\%$ $F_1$-score. Additionally, we propose a novel method for event relation extraction using BERT, in which we treat the task as text entailment. This method achieves an $F_1$-score of $94.01\%$. To further evaluate the generalization of our proposed method, we collected and annotated another out-of-domain corpus (about $80$k tokens) called \testNLI and used it as a second test set, on which our approach achieved promising results ($83.59\%$ $F_1$-score). Last but not least, we propose an end-to-end system for event-arguments extraction. This system is implemented as part of SinaTools, and both corpora are publicly available at {\small \url{https://sina.birzeit.edu/wojood}}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21153v1,2024-07
Enhancing Semantic Similarity Understanding in Arabic NLP with Nested Embedding Learning,"Omer Nacar, Anis Koubaa","This work presents a novel framework for training Arabic nested embedding models through Matryoshka Embedding Learning, leveraging multilingual, Arabic-specific, and English-based models, to highlight the power of nested embeddings models in various Arabic NLP downstream tasks. Our innovative contribution includes the translation of various sentence similarity datasets into Arabic, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework to compare these models across different dimensions. We trained several nested embedding models on the Arabic Natural Language Inference triplet dataset and assessed their performance using multiple evaluation metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlations for cosine similarity, Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, and dot product similarity. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the Matryoshka embedding models, particularly in capturing semantic nuances unique to the Arabic language. Results demonstrated that Arabic Matryoshka embedding models have superior performance in capturing semantic nuances unique to the Arabic language, significantly outperforming traditional models by up to 20-25\% across various similarity metrics. These results underscore the effectiveness of language-specific training and highlight the potential of Matryoshka models in enhancing semantic textual similarity tasks for Arabic NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21139v2,2024-07
LLMs for Enhanced Agricultural Meteorological Recommendations,"Ji-jun Park, Soo-joon Choi","Agricultural meteorological recommendations are crucial for enhancing crop productivity and sustainability by providing farmers with actionable insights based on weather forecasts, soil conditions, and crop-specific data. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to improve the accuracy and relevance of these recommendations. We designed a multi-round prompt framework to iteratively refine recommendations using updated data and feedback, implemented on ChatGPT, Claude2, and GPT-4. Our method was evaluated against baseline models and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach using manually collected datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and contextual relevance, with our approach achieving up to 90\% accuracy and high GPT-4 scores. Additional validation through real-world pilot studies further confirmed the practical benefits of our method, highlighting its potential to transform agricultural practices and decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04640v1,2024-07
ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning,"Yuhui Xu, Zhanming Jie, Hanze Dong, Lei Wang, Xudong Lu, Aojun Zhou, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve a 2.8x reduction in peak memory usage while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling up to a 5x increase in batch size when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK, establishing a new baseline algorithm for efficient LLM deployment without compromising performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21018v2,2024-07
Evolver: Chain-of-Evolution Prompting to Boost Large Multimodal Models for Hateful Meme Detection,"Jinfa Huang, Jinsheng Pan, Zhongwei Wan, Hanjia Lyu, Jiebo Luo","Recent advances show that two-stream approaches have achieved outstanding performance in hateful meme detection. However, hateful memes constantly evolve as new memes emerge by fusing progressive cultural ideas, making existing methods obsolete or ineffective. In this work, we explore the potential of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for hateful meme detection. To this end, we propose Evolver, which incorporates LMMs via Chain-of-Evolution (CoE) Prompting, by integrating the evolution attribute and in-context information of memes. Specifically, Evolver simulates the evolving and expressing process of memes and reasons through LMMs in a step-by-step manner. First, an evolutionary pair mining module retrieves the top-k most similar memes in the external curated meme set with the input meme. Second, an evolutionary information extractor is designed to summarize the semantic regularities between the paired memes for prompting. Finally, a contextual relevance amplifier enhances the in-context hatefulness information to boost the search for evolutionary processes. Extensive experiments on public FHM, MAMI, and HarM datasets show that CoE prompting can be incorporated into existing LMMs to improve their performance. More encouragingly, it can serve as an interpretive tool to promote the understanding of the evolution of social memes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21004v2,2024-07
From Feature Importance to Natural Language Explanations Using LLMs with RAG,"Sule Tekkesinoglu, Lars Kunze","As machine learning becomes increasingly integral to autonomous decision-making processes involving human interaction, the necessity of comprehending the model's outputs through conversational means increases. Most recently, foundation models are being explored for their potential as post hoc explainers, providing a pathway to elucidate the decision-making mechanisms of predictive models. In this work, we introduce traceable question-answering, leveraging an external knowledge repository to inform the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) to user queries within a scene understanding task. This knowledge repository comprises contextual details regarding the model's output, containing high-level features, feature importance, and alternative probabilities. We employ subtractive counterfactual reasoning to compute feature importance, a method that entails analysing output variations resulting from decomposing semantic features. Furthermore, to maintain a seamless conversational flow, we integrate four key characteristics - social, causal, selective, and contrastive - drawn from social science research on human explanations into a single-shot prompt, guiding the response generation process. Our evaluation demonstrates that explanations generated by the LLMs encompassed these elements, indicating its potential to bridge the gap between complex model outputs and natural language expressions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20990v1,2024-07
"Entropy, Thermodynamics and the Geometrization of the Language Model",Wenzhe Yang,"In this paper, we discuss how pure mathematics and theoretical physics can be applied to the study of language models. Using set theory and analysis, we formulate mathematically rigorous definitions of language models, and introduce the concept of the moduli space of distributions for a language model. We formulate a generalized distributional hypothesis using functional analysis and topology. We define the entropy function associated with a language model and show how it allows us to understand many interesting phenomena in languages. We argue that the zero points of the entropy function and the points where the entropy is close to 0 are the key obstacles for an LLM to approximate an intelligent language model, which explains why good LLMs need billions of parameters. Using the entropy function, we formulate a conjecture about AGI.   Then, we show how thermodynamics gives us an immediate interpretation to language models. In particular we will define the concepts of partition function, internal energy and free energy for a language model, which offer insights into how language models work. Based on these results, we introduce a general concept of the geometrization of language models and define what is called the Boltzmann manifold. While the current LLMs are the special cases of the Boltzmann manifold.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21092v1,2024-07
Abstractive summarization from Audio Transcription,Ilia Derkach,"Currently, large language models are gaining popularity, their achievements are used in many areas, ranging from text translation to generating answers to queries. However, the main problem with these new machine learning algorithms is that training such models requires large computing resources that only large IT companies have. To avoid this problem, a number of methods (LoRA, quantization) have been proposed so that existing models can be effectively fine-tuned for specific tasks. In this paper, we propose an E2E (end to end) audio summarization model using these techniques. In addition, this paper examines the effectiveness of these approaches to the problem under consideration and draws conclusions about the applicability of these methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04639v1,2024-07
Enabling Contextual Soft Moderation on Social Media through Contrastive Textual Deviation,"Pujan Paudel, Mohammad Hammas Saeed, Rebecca Auger, Chris Wells, Gianluca Stringhini","Automated soft moderation systems are unable to ascertain if a post supports or refutes a false claim, resulting in a large number of contextual false positives. This limits their effectiveness, for example undermining trust in health experts by adding warnings to their posts or resorting to vague warnings instead of granular fact-checks, which result in desensitizing users. In this paper, we propose to incorporate stance detection into existing automated soft-moderation pipelines, with the goal of ruling out contextual false positives and providing more precise recommendations for social media content that should receive warnings. We develop a textual deviation task called Contrastive Textual Deviation (CTD) and show that it outperforms existing stance detection approaches when applied to soft moderation.We then integrate CTD into the stateof-the-art system for automated soft moderation Lambretta, showing that our approach can reduce contextual false positives from 20% to 2.1%, providing another important building block towards deploying reliable automated soft moderation tools on social media.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20910v1,2024-07
Automated Review Generation Method Based on Large Language Models,"Shican Wu, Xiao Ma, Dehui Luo, Lulu Li, Xiangcheng Shi, Xin Chang, Xiaoyun Lin, Ran Luo, Chunlei Pei, Changyin Du, Zhi-Jian Zhao, Jinlong Gong","Literature research, vital for scientific work, faces the challenge of surging information volumes exceeding researchers' processing capabilities. We present an automated review generation method based on large language models (LLMs) to overcome efficiency bottlenecks and reduce cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields without requiring users' domain knowledge. Applied to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly analyzed 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account, producing comprehensive reviews spanning 35 topics, with extended analysis of 1041 articles providing insights into catalysts' properties. Through multi-layered quality control, we effectively mitigated LLMs' hallucinations, with expert verification confirming accuracy and citation integrity while demonstrating hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5\% with 95\% confidence.

Faithful and Plausible Natural Language Explanations for Image Classification: A Pipeline Approach,"Adam Wojciechowski, Mateusz Lango, Ondrej Dusek","Existing explanation methods for image classification struggle to provide faithful and plausible explanations. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a post-hoc natural language explanation method that can be applied to any CNN-based classifier without altering its training process or affecting predictive performance. By analysing influential neurons and the corresponding activation maps, the method generates a faithful description of the classifier's decision process in the form of a structured meaning representation, which is then converted into text by a language model. Through this pipeline approach, the generated explanations are grounded in the neural network architecture, providing accurate insight into the classification process while remaining accessible to non-experts. Experimental results show that the NLEs constructed by our method are significantly more plausible and faithful. In particular, user interventions in the neural network structure (masking of neurons) are three times more effective than the baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20899v2,2024-07
"Effects of a Prompt Engineering Intervention on Undergraduate Students' AI Self-Efficacy, AI Knowledge and Prompt Engineering Ability: A Mixed Methods Study","David James Woo, Deliang Wang, Tim Yung, Kai Guo","Prompt engineering is critical for effective interaction with large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. However, efforts to teach this skill to students have been limited. This study designed and implemented a prompt engineering intervention, examining its influence on undergraduate students' AI self-efficacy, AI knowledge, and proficiency in creating effective prompts. The intervention involved 27 students who participated in a 100-minute workshop conducted during their history course at a university in Hong Kong. During the workshop, students were introduced to prompt engineering strategies, which they applied to plan the course's final essay task. Multiple data sources were collected, including students' responses to pre- and post-workshop questionnaires, pre- and post-workshop prompt libraries, and written reflections. The study's findings revealed that students demonstrated a higher level of AI self-efficacy, an enhanced understanding of AI concepts, and improved prompt engineering skills because of the intervention. These findings have implications for AI literacy education, as they highlight the importance of prompt engineering training for specific higher education use cases. This is a significant shift from students haphazardly and intuitively learning to engineer prompts. Through prompt engineering education, educators can faciitate students' effective navigation and leverage of LLMs to support their coursework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07302v1,2024-07
Effective Black Box Testing of Sentiment Analysis Classification Networks,"Parsa Karbasizadeh, Fathiyeh Faghih, Pouria Golshanrad","Transformer-based neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis. Nevertheless, the issue of ensuring the dependability of these complicated architectures through comprehensive testing is still open. This paper presents a collection of coverage criteria specifically designed to assess test suites created for transformer-based sentiment analysis networks. Our approach utilizes input space partitioning, a black-box method, by considering emotionally relevant linguistic features such as verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and nouns. In order to effectively produce test cases that encompass a wide range of emotional elements, we utilize the k-projection coverage metric. This metric minimizes the complexity of the problem by examining subsets of k features at the same time, hence reducing dimensionality. Large language models are employed to generate sentences that display specific combinations of emotional features. The findings from experiments obtained from a sentiment analysis dataset illustrate that our criteria and generated tests have led to an average increase of 16\% in test coverage. In addition, there is a corresponding average decrease of 6.5\% in model accuracy, showing the ability to identify vulnerabilities. Our work provides a foundation for improving the dependability of transformer-based sentiment analysis systems through comprehensive test evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20884v1,2024-07
Lyrics Transcription for Humans: A Readability-Aware Benchmark,"Ondřej Cífka, Hendrik Schreiber, Luke Miner, Fabian-Robert Stöter","Writing down lyrics for human consumption involves not only accurately capturing word sequences, but also incorporating punctuation and formatting for clarity and to convey contextual information. This includes song structure, emotional emphasis, and contrast between lead and background vocals. While automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) systems have advanced beyond producing unstructured strings of words and are able to draw on wider context, ALT benchmarks have not kept pace and continue to focus exclusively on words. To address this gap, we introduce Jam-ALT, a comprehensive lyrics transcription benchmark. The benchmark features a complete revision of the JamendoLyrics dataset, in adherence to industry standards for lyrics transcription and formatting, along with evaluation metrics designed to capture and assess the lyric-specific nuances, laying the foundation for improving the readability of lyrics.

SynthVLM: High-Efficiency and High-Quality Synthetic Data for Vision Language Models,"Zheng Liu, Hao Liang, Xijie Huang, Wentao Xiong, Qinhan Yu, Linzhuang Sun, Chong Chen, Conghui He, Bin Cui, Wentao Zhang","Recently, with the rise of web images, managing and understanding large-scale image datasets has become increasingly important. Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have recently emerged due to their robust vision-understanding capabilities. However, training these models requires vast amounts of data, posing challenges to efficiency, effectiveness, data quality, and privacy. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis pipeline for VLLMs. Unlike existing methods that generate captions from images, SynthVLM employs advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically generate and select high-resolution images from captions, creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. Leveraging these pairs, we achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on various vision question answering tasks, maintaining high alignment quality and preserving advanced language abilities. Moreover, SynthVLM surpasses traditional GPT-4 Vision-based caption generation methods in performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, our method's reliance on purely generated data ensures the preservation of privacy, achieving SoTA performance with just 100k data points (only 18% of the official dataset size).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20756v3,2024-07
JaColBERTv2.5: Optimising Multi-Vector Retrievers to Create State-of-the-Art Japanese Retrievers with Constrained Resources,Benjamin Clavié,"Neural Information Retrieval has advanced rapidly in high-resource languages, but progress in lower-resource ones such as Japanese has been hindered by data scarcity, among other challenges. Consequently, multilingual models have dominated Japanese retrieval, despite their computational inefficiencies and inability to capture linguistic nuances. While recent multi-vector monolingual models like JaColBERT have narrowed this gap, they still lag behind multilingual methods in large-scale evaluations. This work addresses the suboptimal training methods of multi-vector retrievers in lower-resource settings, focusing on Japanese. We systematically evaluate and improve key aspects of the inference and training settings of JaColBERT, and more broadly, multi-vector models. We further enhance performance through a novel checkpoint merging step, showcasing it to be an effective way of combining the benefits of fine-tuning with the generalization capabilities of the original checkpoint. Building on our analysis, we introduce a novel training recipe, resulting in the JaColBERTv2.5 model. JaColBERTv2.5, with only 110 million parameters and trained in under 15 hours on 4 A100 GPUs, significantly outperforms all existing methods across all common benchmarks, reaching an average score of 0.754, significantly above the previous best of 0.720.

Label-Guided Prompt for Multi-label Few-shot Aspect Category Detection,"ChaoFeng Guan, YaoHui Zhu, Yu Bai, LingYun Wang","Multi-label few-shot aspect category detection aims at identifying multiple aspect categories from sentences with a limited number of training instances. The representation of sentences and categories is a key issue in this task. Most of current methods extract keywords for the sentence representations and the category representations. Sentences often contain many category-independent words, which leads to suboptimal performance of keyword-based methods. Instead of directly extracting keywords, we propose a label-guided prompt method to represent sentences and categories. To be specific, we design label-specific prompts to represent sentences by combining crucial contextual and semantic information. Further, the label is introduced into a prompt to obtain category descriptions by utilizing a large language model. This kind of category descriptions contain the characteristics of the aspect categories, guiding the construction of discriminative category prototypes. Experimental results on two public datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a 3.86% - 4.75% improvement in the Macro-F1 score.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20673v1,2024-07

The task aimed to evaluate the ability of automated systems to resolve word ambiguity and identify locations mentioned in Arabic text. We provided participants with novel datasets, including a sense-annotated corpus for WSD, called SALMA with approximately 34k annotated tokens, and the IDRISI-DA dataset with 3,893 annotations and 763 unique location mentions. These are challenging tasks. Out of the 38 registered teams, only three teams participated in the final evaluation phase, with the highest accuracy being 77.8% for WSD and the highest MRR@1 being 95.0% for LMD. The shared task not only facilitated the evaluation and comparison of different techniques, but also provided valuable insights and resources for the continued advancement of Arabic NLU technologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20663v1,2024-07
Prompt-Driven Contrastive Learning for Transferable Adversarial Attacks,"Hunmin Yang, Jongoh Jeong, Kuk-Jin Yoon","Recent vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated superior capabilities in learning representations that can be transferable across diverse range of downstream tasks and domains. With the emergence of such powerful models, it has become crucial to effectively leverage their capabilities in tackling challenging vision tasks. On the other hand, only a few works have focused on devising adversarial examples that transfer well to both unknown domains and model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer attack method called PDCL-Attack, which leverages the CLIP model to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations generated by a generative model-based attack framework. Specifically, we formulate an effective prompt-driven feature guidance by harnessing the semantic representation power of text, particularly from the ground-truth class labels of input images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce prompt learning to enhance the transferable generative attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across various cross-domain and cross-model settings empirically validate our approach, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20657v1,2024-07
Prompting Encoder Models for Zero-Shot Classification: A Cross-Domain Study in Italian,"Serena Auriemma, Martina Miliani, Mauro Madeddu, Alessandro Bondielli, Lucia Passaro, Alessandro Lenci","Addressing the challenge of limited annotated data in specialized fields and low-resource languages is crucial for the effective use of Language Models (LMs). While most Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on general-purpose English corpora, there is a notable gap in models specifically tailored for Italian, particularly for technical and bureaucratic jargon. This paper explores the feasibility of employing smaller, domain-specific encoder LMs alongside prompting techniques to enhance performance in these specialized contexts. Our study concentrates on the Italian bureaucratic and legal language, experimenting with both general-purpose and further pre-trained encoder-only models. We evaluated the models on downstream tasks such as document classification and entity typing and conducted intrinsic evaluations using Pseudo-Log-Likelihood. The results indicate that while further pre-trained models may show diminished robustness in general knowledge, they exhibit superior adaptability for domain-specific tasks, even in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the application of calibration techniques and in-domain verbalizers significantly enhances the efficacy of encoder models. These domain-specialized models prove to be particularly advantageous in scenarios where in-domain resources or expertise are scarce. In conclusion, our findings offer new insights into the use of Italian models in specialized contexts, which may have a significant impact on both research and industrial applications in the digital transformation era.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20654v1,2024-07
Affective Computing in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey from the NLP Perspective,"Yiqun Zhang, Xiaocui Yang, Xingle Xu, Zeran Gao, Yijie Huang, Shiyi Mu, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang, Kaisong Song, Ge Yu","Affective Computing (AC), integrating computer science, psychology, and cognitive science knowledge, aims to enable machines to recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions.To create more value, AC can be applied to diverse scenarios, including social media, finance, healthcare, education, etc. Affective Computing (AC) includes two mainstream tasks, i.e., Affective Understanding (AU) and Affective Generation (AG). Fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for AU tasks has succeeded considerably. However, these models lack generalization ability, requiring specialized models for specific tasks. Additionally, traditional PLMs face challenges in AG, particularly in generating diverse and emotionally rich responses. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the ChatGPT series and LLaMA models, brings new opportunities and challenges, catalyzing a paradigm shift in AC. LLMs possess capabilities of in-context learning, common sense reasoning, and advanced sequence generation, which present unprecedented opportunities for AU. To provide a comprehensive overview of AC in the LLMs era from an NLP perspective, we summarize the development of LLMs research in this field, aiming to offer new insights. Specifically, we first summarize the traditional tasks related to AC and introduce the preliminary study based on LLMs. Subsequently, we outline the relevant techniques of popular LLMs to improve AC tasks, including Instruction Tuning and Prompt Engineering. For Instruction Tuning, we discuss full parameter fine-tuning and parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA, P-Tuning, and Prompt Tuning. In Prompt Engineering, we examine Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain of Thought (CoT), and Agent-based methods for AU and AG. To clearly understand the performance of LLMs on different Affective Computing tasks, we further summarize the existing benchmarks and evaluation methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04638v1,2024-07
Accelerating Large Language Model Inference with Self-Supervised Early Exits,Florian Valade,"This paper presents a novel technique for accelerating inference in large, pre-trained language models (LLMs) by introducing early exits during inference. The computational demands of these models, used across a wide range of applications, can be substantial. By capitalizing on the inherent variability in token complexity, our approach enables selective acceleration of the inference process. Specifically, we propose the integration of early exit ''heads'' atop existing transformer layers, which facilitate conditional terminations based on a confidence metric. These heads are trained in a self-supervised manner using the model's own predictions as training data, thereby eliminating the need for additional annotated data. The confidence metric, established using a calibration set, ensures a desired level of accuracy while enabling early termination when confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold. Notably, our method preserves the original accuracy and reduces computational time on certain tasks, leveraging the existing knowledge of pre-trained LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. This lightweight, modular modification has the potential to greatly enhance the practical usability of LLMs, particularly in applications like real-time language processing in resource-constrained environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21082v1,2024-07
Decoding Linguistic Representations of Human Brain,"Yu Wang, Heyang Liu, Yuhao Wang, Chuan Xuan, Yixuan Hou, Sheng Feng, Hongcheng Liu, Yusheng Liao, Yanfeng Wang","Language, as an information medium created by advanced organisms, has always been a concern of neuroscience regarding how it is represented in the brain. Decoding linguistic representations in the evoked brain has shown groundbreaking achievements, thanks to the rapid improvement of neuroimaging, medical technology, life sciences and artificial intelligence. In this work, we present a taxonomy of brain-to-language decoding of both textual and speech formats. This work integrates two types of research: neuroscience focusing on language understanding and deep learning-based brain decoding. Generating discernible language information from brain activity could not only help those with limited articulation, especially amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients but also open up a new way for the next generation's brain-computer interface (BCI).

Questionnaires for Everyone: Streamlining Cross-Cultural Questionnaire Adaptation with GPT-Based Translation Quality Evaluation,"Otso Haavisto, Robin Welsch","Adapting questionnaires to new languages is a resource-intensive process often requiring the hiring of multiple independent translators, which limits the ability of researchers to conduct cross-cultural research and effectively creates inequalities in research and society. This work presents a prototype tool that can expedite the questionnaire translation process. The tool incorporates forward-backward translation using DeepL alongside GPT-4-generated translation quality evaluations and improvement suggestions. We conducted two online studies in which participants translated questionnaires from English to either German (Study 1; n=10) or Portuguese (Study 2; n=20) using our prototype. To evaluate the quality of the translations created using the tool, evaluation scores between conventionally translated and tool-supported versions were compared. Our results indicate that integrating LLM-generated translation quality evaluations and suggestions for improvement can help users independently attain results similar to those provided by conventional, non-NLP-supported translation methods. This is the first step towards more equitable questionnaire-based research, powered by AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20608v1,2024-07
Harvesting Textual and Structured Data from the HAL Publication Repository,"Francis Kulumba, Wissam Antoun, Guillaume Vimont, Laurent Romary","HAL (Hyper Articles en Ligne) is the French national publication repository, used by most higher education and research organizations for their open science policy. As a digital library, it is a rich repository of scholarly documents, but its potential for advanced research has been underutilized. We present HALvest, a unique dataset that bridges the gap between citation networks and the full text of papers submitted on HAL. We craft our dataset by filtering HAL for scholarly publications, resulting in approximately 700,000 documents, spanning 34 languages across 13 identified domains, suitable for language model training, and yielding approximately 16.5 billion tokens (with 8 billion in French and 7 billion in English, the most represented languages). We transform the metadata of each paper into a citation network, producing a directed heterogeneous graph. This graph includes uniquely identified authors on HAL, as well as all open submitted papers, and their citations.

Enhancing Agricultural Machinery Management through Advanced LLM Integration,"Emily Johnson, Noah Wilson","The integration of artificial intelligence into agricultural practices, specifically through Consultation on Intelligent Agricultural Machinery Management (CIAMM), has the potential to revolutionize efficiency and sustainability in farming. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, combined with multi-round prompt engineering to enhance decision-making processes in agricultural machinery management. We systematically developed and refined prompts to guide the LLMs in generating precise and contextually relevant outputs. Our approach was evaluated using a manually curated dataset from various online sources, and performance was assessed with accuracy and GPT-4 Scores. Comparative experiments were conducted using LLama-2-70B, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 models, alongside baseline and state-of-the-art methods such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Thought of Thought (ThoT).

Pruning Large Language Models with Semi-Structural Adaptive Sparse Training,"Weiyu Huang, Yuezhou Hu, Guohao Jian, Jun Zhu, Jianfei Chen","The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on their substantial scale, which poses significant challenges during model deployment in terms of latency and memory consumption. Recently, numerous studies have attempted to compress LLMs using one-shot pruning methods. However, these methods often suffer from considerable performance degradation on complex language understanding tasks, raising concerns about the feasibility of pruning in LLMs. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Sparse Trainer (AST), a novel and efficient retraining framework tailored for semi-structured sparse models. AST enables models to learn optimal masks during the weight update process without incurring additional computational overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate that incorporating knowledge distillation significantly improves retraining efficiency and enhances model performance under fixed computational constraints. Additionally, a supplementary set of well-initialized parameters is integrated to further augment the model's efficacy. AST achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal training cost. When applied to the LLaMA2-7B model, AST reduces the perplexity and zero-shot accuracy gap between dense and 2:4 semi-structured sparse models to 0.6 and 1.16%, respectively, utilizing less than 0.4% of the pretraining tokens and GPU hours. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying semi-structured sparse LLMs and offers a promising alternative for achieving highly compressed models when combined with existing quantization techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20584v3,2024-07

Comparison of Large Language Models for Generating Contextually Relevant Questions,"Ivo Lodovico Molina, Valdemar Švábenský, Tsubasa Minematsu, Li Chen, Fumiya Okubo, Atsushi Shimada","This study explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automatic Question Generation in educational settings. Three LLMs are compared in their ability to create questions from university slide text without fine-tuning. Questions were obtained in a two-step pipeline: first, answer phrases were extracted from slides using Llama 2-Chat 13B; then, the three models generated questions for each answer. To analyze whether the questions would be suitable in educational applications for students, a survey was conducted with 46 students who evaluated a total of 246 questions across five metrics: clarity, relevance, difficulty, slide relation, and question-answer alignment. Results indicate that GPT-3.5 and Llama 2-Chat 13B outperform Flan T5 XXL by a small margin, particularly in terms of clarity and question-answer alignment. GPT-3.5 especially excels at tailoring questions to match the input answers.

CLR-Fact: Evaluating the Complex Logical Reasoning Capability of Large Language Models over Factual Knowledge,"Tianshi Zheng, Jiaxin Bai, Yicheng Wang, Tianqing Fang, Yue Guo, Yauwai Yim, Yangqiu Song","While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks by acquiring rich factual knowledge from their broad training data, their ability to synthesize and logically reason with this knowledge in complex ways remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs' complex logical reasoning abilities through a novel benchmark of automatically generated complex reasoning questions over general domain and biomedical knowledge graphs. Our extensive experiments, employing diverse in-context learning techniques, reveal that LLMs excel at reasoning over general world knowledge but face significant challenges with specialized domain-specific knowledge. We find that prompting with explicit Chain-of-Thought demonstrations can substantially improve LLM performance on complex logical reasoning tasks with diverse logical operations. Interestingly, our controlled evaluations uncover an asymmetry where LLMs display proficiency at set union operations, but struggle considerably with set intersections - a key building block of logical reasoning. To foster further work, we will publicly release our evaluation benchmark and code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20564v1,2024-07
Survey of Design Paradigms for Social Robots,"Rita Frieske, Xiaoyu Mo, Yini Fang, Jay Nieles, Bertram E.

This article provides a structured review of social robot design paradigms, categorizing them into cognitive architectures, role design models, linguistic models, communication flow, activity system models, and integrated design models. By breaking down the articles on social robot design and application based on these paradigms, we highlight the strengths and areas for improvement in current approaches.

Contrastive Feedback Mechanism for Simultaneous Speech Translation,"Haotian Tan, Sakriani Sakti","Recent advances in simultaneous speech translation (SST) focus on the decision policies that enable the use of offline-trained ST models for simultaneous inference. These decision policies not only control the quality-latency trade-off in SST but also mitigate the impact of unstable predictions on translation quality by delaying translation for more context or discarding these predictions through stable hypothesis detection. However, these policies often overlook the potential benefits of utilizing unstable predictions. We introduce the contrastive feedback mechanism (CFM) for SST, a novel method that leverages these unstable predictions as feedback to improve translation quality. CFM guides the system to eliminate undesired model behaviors from these predictions through a contrastive objective. The experiments on 3 state-of-the-art decision policies across 8 languages in the MuST-C v1.0 dataset show that CFM effectively improves the performance of SST.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20524v2,2024-07
Machine Unlearning in Generative AI: A Survey,"Zheyuan Liu, Guangyao Dou, Zhaoxuan Tan, Yijun Tian, Meng Jiang","Generative AI technologies have been deployed in many places, such as (multimodal) large language models and vision generative models.

The graph, later, can be connected to trainable neural models according to those specifications. Our proposed pipeline utilizes techniques like dynamic in-context demonstration retrieval, model refinement based on feedback from a symbolic parser, visualization, and user interaction to generate the tasks' structure and formal knowledge representation. This approach empowers domain experts, even those not well-versed in ML/AI, to formally declare their knowledge to be incorporated in customized neural models in the DomiKnowS framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20513v1,2024-07
A2SF: Accumulative Attention Scoring with Forgetting Factor for Token Pruning in Transformer Decoder,"Hyun-rae Jo, Dongkun Shin","Recently, large language models (LLM) based on transformers are facing memory bottleneck issues due to KV cache, especially in long sequence handling. Previous researches proposed KV cache compression techniques that identify insignificant tokens based on Accumulative Attention Scores and removes their items from KV cache, noting that only few tokens play an important role in attention operations. However, we have observed that the existing Accumulative Attention Score is not suitable for the transformer decoder structure. In the decoder model, the number of times the Attention Score accumulates varies depending on the order of token appearance due to the effect of masking, causing an uneven comparison between tokens. To solve this, we propose Accumulative Attention Score with Forgetting Factor (A2SF) technique, which introduces a Forgetting Factor in the Attention Score accumulation process. A2SF applies a penalty to the past Attention Score generated from old tokens by repeatedly multiplying the Forgetting Factor to the Attention Score over time. Therefore, older tokens receive a larger penalty, providing fairness among different ages of tokens. Through the fair comparison among tokens, we can more effectively select important tokens. We have verified the accuracy improvement through A2SF in the OPT and LLaMA models and A2SF improves the accuracy of LLaMA 2 by up to 7.8% and 5.1% on 1-shot and 0-shot.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20485v2,2024-07
CoMMIT: Coordinated Instruction Tuning for Multimodal Large Language Models,"Junda Wu, Xintong Li, Tong Yu, Yu Wang, Xiang Chen, Jiuxiang Gu, Lina Yao, Jingbo Shang, Julian McAuley","Instruction tuning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) aims to smoothly integrate a backbone LLM with a pre-trained feature encoder for downstream tasks. The major challenge is how to efficiently find the synergy through cooperative learning where LLMs adapt their reasoning abilities in downstream tasks while feature encoders adjust their encoding to provide more relevant modal information. In this paper, we analyze the MLLM instruction tuning from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, where we find unbalanced learning between the two components, i.e., the feature encoder and the LLM, can cause diminishing learning gradients that slow the model convergence and often lead to sub-optimal results due to insufficient learning. Inspired by our findings, we propose a measurement to quantitatively evaluate the learning balance, based on which we further design a dynamic learning scheduler that better coordinates the learning. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary loss regularization method to promote updating of the generation distribution of MLLMs considering the learning state of each model component, which potentially prevents each component from gradient diminishing and enables a more accurate estimation of the learning balance coefficient. We conduct experiments with multiple LLM backbones and feature encoders, where our techniques are model-agnostic and can be generically integrated with various MLLM backbones. Experiment results on multiple downstream tasks and modalities in vision and audio, demonstrate the proposed method's better efficiency and effectiveness in MLLM instruction tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20454v1,2024-07

Generating Gender Alternatives in Machine Translation,"Sarthak Garg, Mozhdeh Gheini, Clara Emmanuel, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Qin Gao, Matthias Paulik","Machine translation (MT) systems often translate terms with ambiguous gender (e.g., English term ""the nurse"") into the gendered form that is most prevalent in the systems' training data (e.g., ""enfermera"", the Spanish term for a female nurse). This often reflects and perpetuates harmful stereotypes present in society. With MT user interfaces in mind that allow for resolving gender ambiguity in a frictionless manner, we study the problem of generating all grammatically correct gendered translation alternatives. We open source train and test datasets for five language pairs and establish benchmarks for this task. Our key technical contribution is a novel semi-supervised solution for generating alternatives that integrates seamlessly with standard MT models and maintains high performance without requiring additional components or increasing inference overhead.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20438v1,2024-07
"Through the Looking Glass, and what Horn Clause Programs Found There",Paul Tarau,"Dual Horn clauses mirror key properties of Horn clauses. This paper explores the ``other side of the looking glass'' to reveal some expected and unexpected symmetries and their practical uses.   We revisit Dual Horn clauses as enablers of a form of constructive negation that supports goal-driven forward reasoning and is valid both intuitionistically and classically. In particular, we explore the ability to falsify a counterfactual hypothesis in the context of a background theory expressed as a Dual Horn clause program.   With Dual Horn clause programs, by contrast to negation as failure, the variable bindings in their computed answers provide explanations for the reasons why a statement is successfully falsified. Moreover, in the propositional case, by contrast to negation as failure as implemented with stable models semantics in ASP systems, and similarly to Horn clause programs, Dual Horn clause programs have polynomial complexity.   After specifying their execution model with a metainterpreter, we devise a compilation scheme from Dual Horn clause programs to Horn clause programs, ensuring their execution with no performance penalty and we design the embedded SymLP language to support combined Horn clause and Dual Horn clause programs.   As a (motivating) application, we cast LLM reasoning chains into propositional Horn and Dual Horn clauses that work together to constructively prove and disprove goals and enhance Generative AI with explainability of reasoning chains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20413v1,2024-07

One approach to mitigate these challenges is synthesizing data using another LLM. In this paper, we introduce a scalable method for generating synthetic instructions to enhance the code generation capability of LLMs. The proposed algorithm, Genetic-Instruct, mimics evolutionary processes, utilizing self-instruction to create numerous synthetic samples from a limited number of seeds. Genetic-Instruct is designed for efficient scaling of the generation process.

What if Red Can Talk? Dynamic Dialogue Generation Using Large Language Models,"Navapat Nananukul, Wichayaporn Wongkamjan","Role-playing games (RPGs) provide players with a rich, interactive world to explore. Dialogue serves as the primary means of communication between developers and players, manifesting in various forms such as guides, NPC interactions, and storytelling. While most games rely on written scripts to define the main story and character personalities, player immersion can be significantly enhanced through casual interactions between characters. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a dialogue filler framework that utilizes LLMs enhanced by knowledge graphs to generate dynamic and contextually appropriate character interactions. We test this framework within the environments of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Pokemon, providing qualitative and quantitative evidence that demonstrates GPT-4's capability to act with defined personalities and generate dialogue. However, some flaws remain, such as GPT-4 being overly positive or more subtle personalities, such as maturity, tend to be of lower quality compared to more overt traits like timidity.

"Gender, Race, and Intersectional Bias in Resume Screening via Language Model Retrieval","Kyra Wilson, Aylin Caliskan","Artificial intelligence (AI) hiring tools have revolutionized resume screening, and large language models (LLMs) have the potential to do the same. However, given the biases which are embedded within LLMs, it is unclear whether they can be used in this scenario without disadvantaging groups based on their protected attributes. In this work, we investigate the possibilities of using LLMs in a resume screening setting via a document retrieval framework that simulates job candidate selection. Using that framework, we then perform a resume audit study to determine whether a selection of Massive Text Embedding (MTE) models are biased in resume screening scenarios. We simulate this for nine occupations, using a collection of over 500 publicly available resumes and 500 job descriptions. We find that the MTEs are biased, significantly favoring White-associated names in 85.1\% of cases and female-associated names in only 11.1\% of cases, with a minority of cases showing no statistically significant differences. Further analyses show that Black males are disadvantaged in up to 100\% of cases, replicating real-world patterns of bias in employment settings, and validate three hypotheses of intersectionality. We also find an impact of document length as well as the corpus frequency of names in the selection of resumes. These findings have implications for widely used AI tools that are automating employment, fairness, and tech policy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20371v2,2024-07

BRIDGE: Bridging Gaps in Image Captioning Evaluation with Stronger Visual Cues,"Sara Sarto, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara","Effectively aligning with human judgment when evaluating machine-generated image captions represents a complex yet intriguing challenge. Existing evaluation metrics like CIDEr or CLIP-Score fall short in this regard as they do not take into account the corresponding image or lack the capability of encoding fine-grained details and penalizing hallucinations. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose BRIDGE, a new learnable and reference-free image captioning metric that employs a novel module to map visual features into dense vectors and integrates them into multi-modal pseudo-captions which are built during the evaluation process. This approach results in a multimodal metric that properly incorporates information from the input image without relying on reference captions, bridging the gap between human judgment and machine-generated image captions.

Can Editing LLMs Inject Harm?,"Canyu Chen, Baixiang Huang, Zekun Li, Zhaorun Chen, Shiyang Lai, Xiongxiao Xu, Jia-Chen Gu, Jindong Gu, Huaxiu Yao, Chaowei Xiao, Xifeng Yan, William Yang Wang, Philip Torr, Dawn Song, Kai Shu","Knowledge editing has been increasingly adopted to correct the false or outdated knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs). Meanwhile, one critical but under-explored question is: can knowledge editing be used to inject harm into LLMs? In this paper, we propose to reformulate knowledge editing as a new type of safety threat for LLMs, namely Editing Attack, and conduct a systematic investigation with a newly constructed dataset EditAttack. Specifically, we focus on two typical safety risks of Editing Attack including Misinformation Injection and Bias Injection. For the risk of misinformation injection, we first categorize it into commonsense misinformation injection and long-tail misinformation injection. Then, we find that editing attacks can inject both types of misinformation into LLMs, and the effectiveness is particularly high for commonsense misinformation injection. For the risk of bias injection, we discover that not only can biased sentences be injected into LLMs with high effectiveness, but also one single biased sentence injection can cause a bias increase in general outputs of LLMs, which are even highly irrelevant to the injected sentence, indicating a catastrophic impact on the overall fairness of LLMs. Then, we further illustrate the high stealthiness of editing attacks, measured by their impact on the general knowledge and reasoning capacities of LLMs, and show the hardness of defending editing attacks with empirical evidence. Our discoveries demonstrate the emerging misuse risks of knowledge editing techniques on compromising the safety alignment of LLMs and the feasibility of disseminating misinformation or bias with LLMs as new channels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20224v3,2024-07

(2) What is the model's hidden (mental) reasoning process? (3) Do models solve math questions using skills similar to or different from humans? (4) Do models trained on GSM8K-like datasets develop reasoning skills beyond those necessary for solving GSM8K problems? (5) What mental process causes models to make reasoning mistakes? (6) How large or deep must a model be to effectively solve GSM8K-level math questions?   Our study uncovers many hidden mechanisms by which language models solve mathematical questions, providing insights that extend beyond current understandings of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20311v1,2024-07
QAEA-DR: A Unified Text Augmentation Framework for Dense Retrieval,"Hongming Tan, Shaoxiong Zhan, Hai Lin, Hai-Tao Zheng, Wai Kin, Chan","In dense retrieval, embedding long texts into dense vectors can result in information loss, leading to inaccurate query-text matching. Additionally, low-quality texts with excessive noise or sparse key information are unlikely to align well with relevant queries. Recent studies mainly focus on improving the sentence embedding model or retrieval process. In this work, we introduce a novel text augmentation framework for dense retrieval. This framework transforms raw documents into information-dense text formats, which supplement the original texts to effectively address the aforementioned issues without modifying embedding or retrieval methodologies. Two text representations are generated via large language models (LLMs) zero-shot prompting: question-answer pairs and element-driven events. We term this approach QAEA-DR: unifying question-answer generation and event extraction in a text augmentation framework for dense retrieval. To further enhance the quality of generated texts, a scoring-based evaluation and regeneration mechanism is introduced in LLM prompting. Our QAEA-DR model has a positive impact on dense retrieval, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20207v1,2024-07
Aligning Query Representation with Rewritten Query and Relevance Judgments in Conversational Search,"Fengran Mo, Chen Qu, Kelong Mao, Yihong Wu, Zhan Su, Kaiyu Huang, Jian-Yun Nie","Conversational search supports multi-turn user-system interactions to solve complex information needs. Different from the traditional single-turn ad-hoc search, conversational search encounters a more challenging problem of context-dependent query understanding with the lengthy and long-tail conversational history context. While conversational query rewriting methods leverage explicit rewritten queries to train a rewriting model to transform the context-dependent query into a stand-stone search query, this is usually done without considering the quality of search results. Conversational dense retrieval methods use fine-tuning to improve a pre-trained ad-hoc query encoder, but they are limited by the conversational search data available for training. In this paper, we leverage both rewritten queries and relevance judgments in the conversational search data to train a better query representation model. The key idea is to align the query representation with those of rewritten queries and relevant documents. The proposed model -- Query Representation Alignment Conversational Dense Retriever, QRACDR, is tested on eight datasets, including various settings in conversational search and ad-hoc search. The results demonstrate the strong performance of QRACDR compared with state-of-the-art methods, and confirm the effectiveness of representation alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20189v1,2024-07
MindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits Deep AI Searcher,"Zehui Chen, Kuikun Liu, Qiuchen Wang, Jiangning Liu, Wenwei Zhang, Kai Chen, Feng Zhao","Information seeking and integration is a complex cognitive task that consumes enormous time and effort. Inspired by the remarkable progress of Large Language Models, recent works attempt to solve this task by combining LLMs and search engines. However, these methods still obtain unsatisfying performance due to three challenges: (1) complex requests often cannot be accurately and completely retrieved by the search engine once (2) corresponding information to be integrated is spread over multiple web pages along with massive noise, and (3) a large number of web pages with long contents may quickly exceed the maximum context length of LLMs. Inspired by the cognitive process when humans solve these problems, we introduce MindSearch to mimic the human minds in web information seeking and integration, which can be instantiated by a simple yet effective LLM-based multi-agent framework. The WebPlanner models the human mind of multi-step information seeking as a dynamic graph construction process: it decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher. Tasked with each sub-question, WebSearcher performs hierarchical information retrieval with search engines and collects valuable information for WebPlanner. The multi-agent design of MindSearch enables the whole framework to seek and integrate information parallelly from larger-scale (e.g., more than 300) web pages in 3 minutes, which is worth 3 hours of human effort. MindSearch demonstrates significant improvement in the response quality in terms of depth and breadth, on both close-set and open-set QA problems. Besides, responses from MindSearch based on InternLM2.5-7B are preferable by humans to ChatGPT-Web and Perplexity.ai applications, which implies that MindSearch can already deliver a competitive solution to the proprietary AI search engine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20183v1,2024-07
AutoScale: Automatic Prediction of Compute-optimal Data Composition for Training LLMs,"Feiyang Kang, Yifan Sun, Bingbing Wen, Si Chen, Dawn Song, Rafid Mahmood, Ruoxi Jia","Domain reweighting is an emerging research area aimed at adjusting the relative weights of different data sources to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of language model pre-training. This paper demonstrates that the optimal composition of training data from different domains is scale-dependent, challenging the existing practice of determining optimal mixtures through small-scale experiments and directly applying them at larger scales. We derive an analytical model for the dependence of optimal weights on data scale and introduce *AutoScale*, a novel, practical approach for optimizing data compositions at potentially large training data scales. *AutoScale* first uses a principled optimization framework to find optimal compositions at smaller, feasible scales, then predicts optimal compositions at larger scales using our derived model. Our evaluation on GPT-2 Large and BERT pre-training demonstrates *AutoScale*'s effectiveness in improving training convergence and downstream performance. Particularly, for GPT-2 Large on RedPajama, *AutoScale* decreases validation perplexity 28% faster than baselines, with up to 38% speed-up over unweighted training, achieving the best performance across downstream tasks. This work provides insights into the varying benefits of data sources across training scales for language models, contributing to the burgeoning research on scale-dependent data curation.

An Energy-based Model for Word-level AutoCompletion in Computer-aided Translation,"Cheng Yang, Guoping Huang, Mo Yu, Zhirui Zhang, Siheng Li, Mingming Yang, Shuming Shi, Yujiu Yang, Lemao Liu","Word-level AutoCompletion(WLAC) is a rewarding yet challenging task in Computer-aided Translation. Existing work addresses this task through a classification model based on a neural network that maps the hidden vector of the input context into its corresponding label (i.e., the candidate target word is treated as a label). Since the context hidden vector itself does not take the label into account and it is projected to the label through a linear classifier, the model can not sufficiently leverage valuable information from the source sentence as verified in our experiments, which eventually hinders its overall performance. To alleviate this issue, this work proposes an energy-based model for WLAC, which enables the context hidden vector to capture crucial information from the source sentence. Unfortunately, training and inference suffer from efficiency and effectiveness challenges, thereby we employ three simple yet effective strategies to put our model into practice. Experiments on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that our reranking-based approach achieves substantial improvements (about 6.07%) over the previous state-of-the-art model. Further analyses show that each strategy of our approach contributes to the final performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20083v1,2024-07
Investigating the Impact of Semi-Supervised Methods with Data Augmentation on Offensive Language Detection in Romanian Language,"Elena-Beatrice Nicola, Dumitru-Clementin Cercel, Florin Pop","Offensive language detection is a crucial task in today's digital landscape, where online platforms grapple with maintaining a respectful and inclusive environment. However, building robust offensive language detection models requires large amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Semi-supervised learning offers a feasible solution by utilizing labeled and unlabeled data to create more accurate and robust models. In this paper, we explore a few different semi-supervised methods, as well as data augmentation techniques. Concretely, we implemented eight semi-supervised methods and ran experiments for them using only the available data in the RO-Offense dataset and applying five augmentation techniques before feeding the data to the models. Experimental results demonstrate that some of them benefit more from augmentations than others.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20076v1,2024-07
Exploring Large Language Models to generate Easy to Read content,"Paloma Martínez, Lourdes Moreno, Alberto Ramos","Ensuring text accessibility and understandability are essential goals, particularly for individuals with cognitive impairments and intellectual disabilities, who encounter challenges in accessing information across various mediums such as web pages, newspapers, administrative tasks, or health documents. Initiatives like Easy to Read and Plain Language guidelines aim to simplify complex texts; however, standardizing these guidelines remains challenging and often involves manual processes. This work presents an exploratory investigation into leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to systematically simplify Spanish texts into Easy to Read formats, with a focus on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for simplifying texts, especially in generating Easy to Read content. The study contributes a parallel corpus of Spanish adapted for Easy To Read format, which serves as a valuable resource for training and testing text simplification systems. Additionally, several text simplification experiments using LLMs and the collected corpus are conducted, involving fine-tuning and testing a Llama2 model to generate Easy to Read content. A qualitative evaluation, guided by an expert in text adaptation for Easy to Read content, is carried out to assess the automatically simplified texts. This research contributes to advancing text accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments, highlighting promising strategies for leveraging LLMs while responsibly managing energy usage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20046v1,2024-07
Do LLMs Really Adapt to Domains? An Ontology Learning Perspective,"Huu Tan Mai, Cuong Xuan Chu, Heiko Paulheim","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented prowess across various natural language processing tasks in various application domains. Recent studies show that LLMs can be leveraged to perform lexical semantic tasks, such as Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) or Ontology Learning (OL). However, it has not effectively been verified whether their success is due to their ability to reason over unstructured or semi-structured data, or their effective learning of linguistic patterns and senses alone. This unresolved question is particularly crucial when dealing with domain-specific data, where the lexical senses and their meaning can completely differ from what a LLM has learned during its training stage. This paper investigates the following question: Do LLMs really adapt to domains and remain consistent in the extraction of structured knowledge, or do they only learn lexical senses instead of reasoning? To answer this question and, we devise a controlled experiment setup that uses WordNet to synthesize parallel corpora, with English and gibberish terms. We examine the differences in the outputs of LLMs for each corpus in two OL tasks: relation extraction and taxonomy discovery. Empirical results show that, while adapting to the gibberish corpora, off-the-shelf LLMs do not consistently reason over semantic relationships between concepts, and instead leverage senses and their frame. However, fine-tuning improves the performance of LLMs on lexical semantic tasks even when the domain-specific terms are arbitrary and unseen during pre-training, hinting at the applicability of pre-trained LLMs for OL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19998v1,2024-07
Confidence Estimation for Automatic Detection of Depression and Alzheimer's Disease Based on Clinical Interviews,"Wen Wu, Chao Zhang, Philip C. Woodland",Speech-based automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression has attracted increased attention. Confidence estimation is crucial for a trust-worthy automatic diagnostic system which informs the clinician about the confidence of model predictions and helps reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. This paper investigates confidence estimation for automatic detection of AD and depression based on clinical interviews. A novel Bayesian approach is proposed which uses a dynamic Dirichlet prior distribution to model the second-order probability of the predictive distribution. Experimental results on the publicly available ADReSS and DAIC-WOZ datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a range of baselines for both classification accuracy and confidence estimation.,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19984v1,2024-07
A Temporal Psycholinguistics Approach to Identity Resolution of Social Media Users,Md Touhidul Islam,"In this thesis, we propose an approach to identity resolution across social media platforms using the topics, sentiments, and timings of the posts on the platforms. After collecting the public posts of around 5000 profiles from Disqus and Twitter, we analyze their posts to match their profiles across the two platforms. We pursue both temporal and non-temporal methods in our analysis. While neither approach proves definitively superior, the temporal approach generally performs better. We found that the temporal window size influences results more than the shifting amount. On the other hand, our sentiment analysis shows that the inclusion of sentiment makes little difference, probably due to flawed data extraction methods. We also experimented with a distance-based reward-and-punishment-focused scoring model, which achieved an accuracy of 24.198% and an average rank of 158.217 out of 2525 in our collected corpus. Future work includes refining sentiment analysis by evaluating sentiments per topic, extending temporal analysis with additional phases, and improving the scoring model through weight adjustments and modified rewards.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19967v1,2024-07
"Inference acceleration for large language models using ""stairs"" assisted greedy generation","Domas Grigaliūnas, Mantas Lukoševičius","Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters are known for their impressive predicting capabilities but require lots of resources to run. With their massive rise in popularity, even a small reduction in required resources could have an impact on environment. On the other hand, smaller models require fewer resources but may sacrifice accuracy. In this work, we are proposing an implementation of ``stairs'' assisted greedy generation. It is a modified assisted generation methodology that makes use of a smaller model's fast generation, large model's batch prediction, and ""stairs"" validation in order to achieve a speed up in prediction generation. Results show between 9.58 and 17.24 percent inference time reduction compared to a stand-alone large LLM prediction in a text generation task without a loss in accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19947v1,2024-07
Sentiment Analysis of Lithuanian Online Reviews Using Large Language Models,"Brigita Vileikytė, Mantas Lukoševičius, Lukas Stankevičius","Sentiment analysis is a widely researched area within Natural Language Processing (NLP), attracting significant interest due to the advent of automated solutions. Despite this, the task remains challenging because of the inherent complexity of languages and the subjective nature of sentiments. It is even more challenging for less-studied and less-resourced languages such as Lithuanian. Our review of existing Lithuanian NLP research reveals that traditional machine learning methods and classification algorithms have limited effectiveness for the task. In this work, we address sentiment analysis of Lithuanian five-star-based online reviews from multiple domains that we collect and clean. We apply transformer models to this task for the first time, exploring the capabilities of pre-trained multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically focusing on fine-tuning BERT and T5 models. Given the inherent difficulty of the task, the fine-tuned models perform quite well, especially when the sentiments themselves are less ambiguous: 80.74% and 89.61% testing recognition accuracy of the most popular one- and five-star reviews respectively. They significantly outperform current commercial state-of-the-art general-purpose LLM GPT-4. We openly share our fine-tuned LLMs online.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19914v1,2024-07
BEExAI: Benchmark to Evaluate Explainable AI,"Samuel Sithakoul, Sara Meftah, Clément Feutry","Recent research in explainability has given rise to numerous post-hoc attribution methods aimed at enhancing our comprehension of the outputs of black-box machine learning models. However, evaluating the quality of explanations lacks a cohesive approach and a consensus on the methodology for deriving quantitative metrics that gauge the efficacy of explainability post-hoc attribution methods. Furthermore, with the development of increasingly complex deep learning models for diverse data applications, the need for a reliable way of measuring the quality and correctness of explanations is becoming critical. We address this by proposing BEExAI, a benchmark tool that allows large-scale comparison of different post-hoc XAI methods, employing a set of selected evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19897v1,2024-07

Detecting and Understanding Vulnerabilities in Language Models via Mechanistic Interpretability,"Jorge García-Carrasco, Alejandro Maté, Juan Trujillo","Large Language Models (LLMs), characterized by being trained on broad amounts of data in a self-supervised manner, have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks. Indeed, their generative abilities have aroused interest on the application of LLMs across a wide range of contexts. However, neural networks in general, and LLMs in particular, are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where an imperceptible change to the input can mislead the output of the model. This is a serious concern that impedes the use of LLMs on high-stakes applications, such as healthcare, where a wrong prediction can imply serious consequences. Even though there are many efforts on making LLMs more robust to adversarial attacks, there are almost no works that study \emph{how} and \emph{where} these vulnerabilities that make LLMs prone to adversarial attacks happen. Motivated by these facts, we explore how to localize and understand vulnerabilities, and propose a method, based on Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) techniques, to guide this process. Specifically, this method enables us to detect vulnerabilities related to a concrete task by (i) obtaining the subset of the model that is responsible for that task, (ii) generating adversarial samples for that task, and (iii) using MI techniques together with the previous samples to discover and understand the possible vulnerabilities. We showcase our method on a pretrained GPT-2 Small model carrying out the task of predicting 3-letter acronyms to demonstrate its effectiveness on locating and understanding concrete vulnerabilities of the model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19842v1,2024-07
ATHAR: A High-Quality and Diverse Dataset for Classical Arabic to English Translation,"Mohammed Khalil, Mohammed Sabry","Classical Arabic represents a significant era, encompassing the golden age of Arab culture, philosophy, and scientific literature. With a broad consensus on the importance of translating these literatures to enrich knowledge dissemination across communities, the advent of large language models (LLMs) and translation systems offers promising tools to facilitate this goal. However, we have identified a scarcity of translation datasets in Classical Arabic, which are often limited in scope and topics, hindering the development of high-quality translation systems. In response, we present the ATHAR dataset, comprising 66,000 high-quality Classical Arabic to English translation samples that cover a wide array of subjects including science, culture, and philosophy. Furthermore, we assess the performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs under various settings, concluding that there is a need for such datasets in current systems. Our findings highlight how models can benefit from fine-tuning or incorporating this dataset into their pretraining pipelines.

However, traditional Transformer architectures incur significant overhead due to their secondary computational complexity. To address this issue, we introduce ML-Mamba, a multimodal language model, which utilizes the latest and efficient Mamba-2 model for inference. Mamba-2 is known for its linear scalability and fast processing of long sequences. We replace the Transformer-based backbone with a pre-trained Mamba-2 model and explore methods for integrating 2D visual selective scanning mechanisms into multimodal learning while also trying various visual encoders and Mamba-2 model variants. Our extensive experiments in various multimodal benchmark tests demonstrate the competitive performance of ML-Mamba and highlight the potential of state space models in multimodal tasks. The experimental results show that: (1) we empirically explore how to effectively apply the 2D vision selective scan mechanism for multimodal learning. We propose a novel multimodal connector called the Mamba-2 Scan Connector (MSC), which enhances representational capabilities. (2) ML-Mamba achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as TinyLaVA and MobileVLM v2 through its linear sequential modeling while faster inference speed; (3) Compared to multimodal models utilizing Mamba-1, the Mamba-2-based ML-Mamba exhibits superior inference performance and effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19832v3,2024-07
Concise Thoughts: Impact of Output Length on LLM Reasoning and Cost,"Sania Nayab, Giulio Rossolini, Giorgio Buttazzo, Nicolamaria Manes, Fabrizio Giacomelli","Today's large language models (LLMs) can solve challenging question-answering tasks, and prompt engineering techniques, such as chain-of-thought (CoT), have gained attention for enhancing the explanation and correctness of outputs. Nevertheless, models require significant time to generate answers augmented with lengthy reasoning details. To address this issue, this paper analyzes the impact of output lengths on LLM inference pipelines and proposes novel metrics to evaluate them in terms of \textit{correct conciseness}. It also examines the impact of controlling output length through a refined prompt engineering strategy, Constrained-CoT (CCoT), which encourages the model to limit output length. Experiments on pre-trained LLMs demonstrated the benefit of the proposed metrics and the effectiveness of CCoT across different models. For instance, constraining the reasoning of LLaMA2-70b to 100 words improves the accuracy from 36.01\% (CoT) to 41.07\% (CCoT) on the GSM8K dataset, while reducing the average output length by 28 words.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19825v1,2024-07
Comparative Analysis of Encoder-Based NER and Large Language Models for Skill Extraction from Russian Job Vacancies,"Nikita Matkin, Aleksei Smirnov, Mikhail Usanin, Egor Ivanov, Kirill Sobyanin, Sofiia Paklina, Petr Parshakov","The labor market is undergoing rapid changes, with increasing demands on job seekers and a surge in job openings. Identifying essential skills and competencies from job descriptions is challenging due to varying employer requirements and the omission of key skills. This study addresses these challenges by comparing traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods based on encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) for extracting skills from Russian job vacancies. Using a labeled dataset of 4,000 job vacancies for training and 1,472 for testing, the performance of both approaches is evaluated. Results indicate that traditional NER models, especially DeepPavlov RuBERT NER tuned, outperform LLMs across various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and inference time. The findings suggest that traditional NER models provide more effective and efficient solutions for skill extraction, enhancing job requirement clarity and aiding job seekers in aligning their qualifications with employer expectations.

Enhancing Adversarial Text Attacks on BERT Models with Projected Gradient Descent,"Hetvi Waghela, Jaydip Sen, Sneha Rakshit","Adversarial attacks against deep learning models represent a major threat to the security and reliability of natural language processing (NLP) systems. In this paper, we propose a modification to the BERT-Attack framework, integrating Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to enhance its effectiveness and robustness. The original BERT-Attack, designed for generating adversarial examples against BERT-based models, suffers from limitations such as a fixed perturbation budget and a lack of consideration for semantic similarity. The proposed approach in this work, PGD-BERT-Attack, addresses these limitations by leveraging PGD to iteratively generate adversarial examples while ensuring both imperceptibility and semantic similarity to the original input. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of PGD-BERT-Attack compared to the original BERT-Attack and other baseline methods. The results demonstrate that PGD-BERT-Attack achieves higher success rates in causing misclassification while maintaining low perceptual changes. Furthermore, PGD-BERT-Attack produces adversarial instances that exhibit greater semantic resemblance to the initial input, enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios. Overall, the proposed modification offers a more effective and robust approach to adversarial attacks on BERT-based models, thus contributing to the advancement of defense against attacks on NLP systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21073v1,2024-07
Improving Retrieval Augmented Language Model with Self-Reasoning,"Yuan Xia, Jingbo Zhou, Zhenhui Shi, Jun Chen, Haifeng Huang","The Retrieval-Augmented Language Model (RALM) has shown remarkable performance on knowledge-intensive tasks by incorporating external knowledge during inference, which mitigates the factual hallucinations inherited in large language models (LLMs). Despite these advancements, challenges persist in the implementation of RALMs, particularly concerning their reliability and traceability. To be specific, the irrelevant document retrieval may result in unhelpful response generation or even deteriorate the performance of LLMs, while the lack of proper citations in generated outputs complicates efforts to verify the trustworthiness of the models. To this end, we propose a novel self-reasoning framework aimed at improving the reliability and traceability of RALMs, whose core idea is to leverage reasoning trajectories generated by the LLM itself. The framework involves constructing self-reason trajectories with three processes: a relevance-aware process, an evidence-aware selective process, and a trajectory analysis process. We have evaluated our framework across four public datasets (two short-form QA datasets, one long-form QA dataset, and one fact verification dataset) to demonstrate the superiority of our method, which can outperform existing state-of-the-art models and can achieve comparable performance with GPT-4, while only using 2,000 training samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19813v3,2024-07

Cool-Fusion: Fuse Large Language Models without Training,"Cong Liu, Xiaojun Quan, Yan Pan, Liang Lin, Weigang Wu, Xu Chen","We focus on the problem of fusing two or more heterogeneous large language models (LLMs) to facilitate their complementary strengths. One of the challenges on model fusion is high computational load, i.e. to fine-tune or to align vocabularies via combinatorial optimization. To this end, we propose \emph{Cool-Fusion}, a simple yet effective approach that fuses the knowledge of heterogeneous source LLMs to leverage their complementary strengths. \emph{Cool-Fusion} is the first method that does not require any type of training like the ensemble approaches. But unlike ensemble methods, it is applicable to any set of source LLMs that have different vocabularies. The basic idea is to have each source LLM individually generate tokens until the tokens can be decoded into a text segment that ends at word boundaries common to all source LLMs. Then, the source LLMs jointly rerank the generated text segment and select the best one, which is the fused text generation in one step. Extensive experiments are conducted across a variety of benchmark datasets. On \emph{GSM8K}, \emph{Cool-Fusion} increases accuracy from three strong source LLMs by a significant 8\%-17.8\%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19807v1,2024-07

Introducing a new hyper-parameter for RAG: Context Window Utilization,"Kush Juvekar, Anupam Purwar","This paper introduces a new hyper-parameter for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems called Context Window Utilization. RAG systems enhance generative models by incorporating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge bases, improving the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of generated responses. The size of the text chunks retrieved and processed is a critical factor influencing RAG performance. This study aims to identify the optimal chunk size that maximizes answer generation quality. Through systematic experimentation, we analyze the effects of varying chunk sizes on the efficiency and effectiveness of RAG frameworks. Our findings reveal that an optimal chunk size balances the trade-off between providing sufficient context and minimizing irrelevant information.

Synthesizing Scientific Summaries: An Extractive and Abstractive Approach,"Grishma Sharma, Aditi Paretkar, Deepak Sharma","The availability of a vast array of research papers in any area of study, necessitates the need of automated summarisation systems that can present the key research conducted and their corresponding findings. Scientific paper summarisation is a challenging task for various reasons including token length limits in modern transformer models and corresponding memory and compute requirements for long text. A significant amount of work has been conducted in this area, with approaches that modify the attention mechanisms of existing transformer models and others that utilise discourse information to capture long range dependencies in research papers. In this paper, we propose a hybrid methodology for research paper summarisation which incorporates an extractive and abstractive approach. We use the extractive approach to capture the key findings of research, and pair it with the introduction of the paper which captures the motivation for research. We use two models based on unsupervised learning for the extraction stage and two transformer language models, resulting in four combinations for our hybrid approach. The performances of the models are evaluated on three metrics and we present our findings in this paper. We find that using certain combinations of hyper parameters, it is possible for automated summarisation systems to exceed the abstractiveness of summaries written by humans. Finally, we state our future scope of research in extending this methodology to summarisation of generalised long documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19779v1,2024-07
Model Agnostic Hybrid Sharding For Heterogeneous Distributed Inference,"Claudio Angione, Yue Zhao, Harry Yang, Ahmad Farhan, Fielding Johnston, James Buban, Patrick Colangelo","The rapid growth of large-scale AI models, particularly large language models has brought significant challenges in data privacy, computational resources, and accessibility. Traditional centralized architectures often struggle to meet required data security and scalability needs which hinders the democratization of AI systems. Nesa introduces a model-agnostic sharding framework designed for decentralized AI inference. Our framework uses blockchain-based sequential deep neural network sharding to distribute computational tasks across a diverse network of nodes based on a personalised heuristic and routing mechanism. This enables efficient distributed training and inference for recent large-scale models even on consumer-grade hardware. We use compression techniques like dynamic blockwise quantization and mixed matrix decomposition to reduce data transfer and memory needs. We also integrate robust security measures, including hardware-based trusted execution environments to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Evaluating our system across various natural language processing and vision tasks shows that these compression strategies do not compromise model accuracy. Our results highlight the potential to democratize access to cutting-edge AI technologies by enabling secure and efficient inference on a decentralized network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19775v1,2024-07
"Legal Minds, Algorithmic Decisions: How LLMs Apply Constitutional Principles in Complex Scenarios","Camilla Bignotti, Carolina Camassa","In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis of how large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, interpret constitutional principles in complex decision-making scenarios. We examine rulings from the Italian Constitutional Court on bioethics issues that involve trade-offs between competing values and compare model-generated legal arguments on these issues to those presented by the State, the Court, and the applicants. Our results indicate that GPT-4 consistently aligns more closely with progressive interpretations of the Constitution, often overlooking competing values and mirroring the applicants' views rather than the more conservative perspectives of the State or the Court's moderate positions. Our experiments reveal a distinct tendency of GPT-4 to favor progressive legal interpretations, underscoring the influence of underlying data biases. We thus underscore the importance of testing alignment in real-world scenarios and considering the implications of deploying LLMs in decision-making processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19760v2,2024-07

Do Text-to-Vis Benchmarks Test Real Use of Visualisations?,"Hy Nguyen, Xuefei He, Andrew Reeson, Cecile Paris, Josiah Poon, Jonathan K. Kummerfeld","Large language models are able to generate code for visualisations in response to simple user requests. This is a useful application and an appealing one for NLP research because plots of data provide grounding for language. However, there are relatively few benchmarks, and those that exist may not be representative of what users do in practice. This paper investigates whether benchmarks reflect real-world use through an empirical study comparing benchmark datasets with code from public repositories. Our findings reveal a substantial gap, with evaluations not testing the same distribution of chart types, attributes, and actions as real-world examples. One dataset is representative, but requires extensive modification to become a practical end-to-end benchmark. This shows that new benchmarks are needed to support the development of systems that truly address users' visualisation needs. These observations will guide future data creation, highlighting which features hold genuine significance for users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19726v4,2024-07
CollectiveSFT: Scaling Large Language Models for Chinese Medical Benchmark with Collective Instructions in Healthcare,"Jingwei Zhu, Minghuan Tan, Min Yang, Ruixue Li, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny","The rapid progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted the creation of numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities.This study focuses on the Comprehensive Medical Benchmark in Chinese (CMB), showcasing how dataset diversity and distribution in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may enhance LLM performance.Remarkably, We successfully trained a smaller base model to achieve scores comparable to larger models, indicating that a diverse and well-distributed dataset can optimize performance regardless of model size.This study suggests that even smaller models may reach high performance levels with carefully curated and varied datasets. By integrating a wide range of instructional content, our approach addresses potential issues such as data quality inconsistencies.

Efficiently and Effectively: A Two-stage Approach to Balance Plaintext and Encrypted Text for Traffic Classification,"Wei Peng, Lei Cui, Wei Cai, Zhenquan Ding, Zhiyu Hao, Xiaochun Yun","Encrypted traffic classification is the task of identifying the application or service associated with encrypted network traffic. One effective approach for this task is to use deep learning methods to encode the raw traffic bytes directly and automatically extract features for classification (byte-based models). However, current byte-based models input raw traffic bytes, whether plaintext or encrypted text, for automated feature extraction, neglecting the distinct impacts of plaintext and encrypted text on downstream tasks. Additionally, these models primarily focus on improving classification accuracy, with little emphasis on the efficiency of models. In this paper, for the first time, we analyze the impact of plaintext and encrypted text on the model's effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our observations and findings, we propose a two-phase approach to balance the trade-off between plaintext and encrypted text in traffic classification. Specifically, Stage one is to Determine whether the Plain text is enough to be accurately Classified (DPC) using the proposed DPC Selector. This stage quickly identifies samples that can be classified using plaintext, leveraging explicit byte features in plaintext to enhance model's efficiency. Stage two aims to adaptively make a classification with the result from stage one. This stage incorporates encrypted text information for samples that cannot be classified using plaintext alone, ensuring the model's effectiveness on traffic classification tasks. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results in both effectiveness and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19687v3,2024-07

To address this disparity, we present SeaLLMs 3, the latest iteration of the SeaLLMs model family, tailored for Southeast Asian languages. This region, characterized by its rich linguistic diversity, has lacked adequate language technology support. SeaLLMs 3 aims to bridge this gap by covering a comprehensive range of languages spoken in this region, including English, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai, Tagalog, Malay, Burmese, Khmer, Lao, Tamil, and Javanese.

Overview of PerpectiveArg2024: The First Shared Task on Perspective Argument Retrieval,"Neele Falk, Andreas Waldis, Iryna Gurevych","Argument retrieval is the task of finding relevant arguments for a given query. While existing approaches rely solely on the semantic alignment of queries and arguments, this first shared task on perspective argument retrieval incorporates perspectives during retrieval, accounting for latent influences in argumentation. We present a novel multilingual dataset covering demographic and socio-cultural (socio) variables, such as age, gender, and political attitude, representing minority and majority groups in society. We distinguish between three scenarios to explore how retrieval systems consider explicitly (in both query and corpus) and implicitly (only in query) formulated perspectives. This paper provides an overview of this shared task and summarizes the results of the six submitted systems. We find substantial challenges in incorporating perspectivism, especially when aiming for personalization based solely on the text of arguments without explicitly providing socio profiles. Moreover, retrieval systems tend to be biased towards the majority group but partially mitigate bias for the female gender. While we bootstrap perspective argument retrieval, further research is essential to optimize retrieval systems to facilitate personalization and reduce polarization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19670v1,2024-07

We first introduce a text encoder (base size) enhanced with RoPE and unpadding, pre-trained in a native 8192-token context (longer than 512 of previous multilingual encoders). Then we construct a hybrid TRM and a cross-encoder reranker by contrastive learning. Evaluations show that our text encoder outperforms the same-sized previous state-of-the-art XLM-R. Meanwhile, our TRM and reranker match the performance of large-sized state-of-the-art BGE-M3 models and achieve better results on long-context retrieval benchmarks.

From Pre-training Corpora to Large Language Models: What Factors Influence LLM Performance in Causal Discovery Tasks?,"Tao Feng, Lizhen Qu, Niket Tandon, Zhuang Li, Xiaoxi Kang, Gholamreza Haffari","Recent advances in artificial intelligence have seen Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate notable proficiency in causal discovery tasks. This study explores the factors influencing the performance of LLMs in causal discovery tasks. Utilizing open-source LLMs, we examine how the frequency of causal relations within their pre-training corpora affects their ability to accurately respond to causal discovery queries. Our findings reveal that a higher frequency of causal mentions correlates with better model performance, suggesting that extensive exposure to causal information during training enhances the models' causal discovery capabilities. Additionally, we investigate the impact of context on the validity of causal relations. Our results indicate that LLMs might exhibit divergent predictions for identical causal relations when presented in different contexts. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of how different factors contribute to LLM performance in causal discovery tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19638v1,2024-07
LoginMEA: Local-to-Global Interaction Network for Multi-modal Entity Alignment,"Taoyu Su, Xinghua Zhang, Jiawei Sheng, Zhenyu Zhang, Tingwen Liu","Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities between two multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), whose entities can be associated with relational triples and related images. Most previous studies treat the graph structure as a special modality, and fuse different modality information with separate uni-modal encoders, neglecting valuable relational associations in modalities. Other studies refine each uni-modal information with graph structures, but may introduce unnecessary relations in specific modalities. To this end, we propose a novel local-to-global interaction network for MMEA, termed as LoginMEA. Particularly, we first fuse local multi-modal interactions to generate holistic entity semantics and then refine them with global relational interactions of entity neighbors. In this design, the uni-modal information is fused adaptively, and can be refined with relations accordingly. To enrich local interactions of multi-modal entity information, we device modality weights and low-rank interactive fusion, allowing diverse impacts and element-level interactions among modalities. To capture global interactions of graph structures, we adopt relation reflection graph attention networks, which fully capture relational associations between entities. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior results of our method over 5 cross-KG or bilingual benchmark datasets, indicating the effectiveness of capturing local and global interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19625v1,2024-07
TopicTag: Automatic Annotation of NMF Topic Models Using Chain of Thought and Prompt Tuning with LLMs,"Selma Wanna, Ryan Barron, Nick Solovyev, Maksim E. Eren, Manish Bhattarai, Kim Rasmussen, Boian S. Alexandrov","Topic modeling is a technique for organizing and extracting themes from large collections of unstructured text. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a common unsupervised approach that decomposes a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix to uncover latent topics and segment the dataset accordingly. While useful for highlighting patterns and clustering documents, NMF does not provide explicit topic labels, necessitating subject matter experts (SMEs) to assign labels manually. We present a methodology for automating topic labeling in documents clustered via NMF with automatic model determination (NMFk). By leveraging the output of NMFk and employing prompt engineering, we utilize large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate topic labels.

Chess game notations are also a kind of text, and one can consider the records of moves or positions of pieces as words and statements in a certain language. In this article I show how word embeddings (word2vec) can work on chess game texts instead of natural language texts. I don't see how this representation of chess data can be used productively. It's unlikely that these vector models will help engines or people choose the best move. But in a purely academic sense, it's clear that such methods of information representation capture something important about the very nature of the game, which doesn't necessarily lead to a win.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19600v1,2024-07
Meta-Rewarding Language Models: Self-Improving Alignment with LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge,"Tianhao Wu, Weizhe Yuan, Olga Golovneva, Jing Xu, Yuandong Tian, Jiantao Jiao, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar","Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly surpassing human knowledge in many domains. While improving these models traditionally relies on costly human data, recent self-rewarding mechanisms (Yuan et al., 2024) have shown that LLMs can improve by judging their own responses instead of relying on human labelers. However, existing methods have primarily focused on improving model responses rather than judgment capabilities, resulting in rapid saturation during iterative training. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Meta-Rewarding step to the self-improvement process, where the model judges its own judgements and uses that feedback to refine its judgment skills. Surprisingly, this unsupervised approach improves the model's ability to judge {\em and} follow instructions, as demonstrated by a win rate improvement of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 22.9% to 39.4% on AlpacaEval 2, and 20.6% to 29.1% on Arena-Hard.

SaulLM-54B & SaulLM-141B: Scaling Up Domain Adaptation for the Legal Domain,"Pierre Colombo, Telmo Pires, Malik Boudiaf, Rui Melo, Dominic Culver, Sofia Morgado, Etienne Malaboeuf, Gabriel Hautreux, Johanne Charpentier, Michael Desa","In this paper, we introduce SaulLM-54B and SaulLM-141B, two large language models (LLMs) tailored for the legal sector. These models, which feature architectures of 54 billion and 141 billion parameters, respectively, are based on the Mixtral architecture. The development of SaulLM-54B and SaulLM-141B is guided by large-scale domain adaptation, divided into three strategies: (1) the exploitation of continued pretraining involving a base corpus that includes over 540 billion of legal tokens, (2) the implementation of a specialized legal instruction-following protocol, and (3) the alignment of model outputs with human preferences in legal interpretations. The integration of synthetically generated data in the second and third steps enhances the models' capabilities in interpreting and processing legal texts, effectively reaching state-of-the-art performance and outperforming previous open-source models on LegalBench-Instruct. This work explores the trade-offs involved in domain-specific adaptation at this scale, offering insights that may inform future studies on domain adaptation using strong decoder models. Building upon SaulLM-7B, this study refines the approach to produce an LLM better equipped for legal tasks. We are releasing base, instruct, and aligned versions on top of SaulLM-54B and SaulLM-141B under the MIT License to facilitate reuse and collaborative research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19584v1,2024-07
Mini-batch Coresets for Memory-efficient Training of Large Language Models,"Dang Nguyen, Wenhan Yang, Rathul Anand, Yu Yang, Baharan Mirzasoleiman","Training with larger mini-batches improves the convergence rate and can yield superior performance. However, training with large mini-batches becomes prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the large GPU memory requirement. To address this problem, an effective approach is finding small mini-batch coresets that closely match the gradient of larger mini-batches. However, this approach becomes infeasible and ineffective for LLMs, due to the highly imbalanced nature of the sources in language data, use of the Adam optimizer, and the very large gradient dimensionality of LLMs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing Coresets for Training LLMs (CoLM). First, we show that mini-batch coresets found by gradient matching do not contain representative examples of the small sources w.h.p., and thus including all examples of the small sources in the mini-batch coresets is crucial for optimal performance. Second, we normalize the gradients by their historical exponential to find mini-batch coresets for training with Adam. Finally, we leverage zeroth-order methods to find smooth gradient of the last V -projection matrix and sparsify it to keep the dimensions with the largest normalized gradient magnitude. We apply CoLM to fine-tuning Phi-2, Phi-3, and Zephyr with LoRA on MathInstruct and SuperGLUE benchmark. Remarkably, CoLM reduces the memory requirement of fine-tuning by 2x and even outperforms training with 4x larger mini-batches. Notably, CoLM easily stack with existing memory-efficient training methods, such as LoRA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19580v2,2024-07
Are LLMs Good Annotators for Discourse-level Event Relation Extraction?,"Kangda Wei, Aayush Gautam, Ruihong Huang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in a wide array of natural language processing tasks. However, its effectiveness over discourse-level event relation extraction (ERE) tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of LLMs in addressing discourse-level ERE tasks characterized by lengthy documents and intricate relations encompassing coreference, temporal, causal, and subevent types. Evaluation is conducted using an commercial model, GPT-3.5, and an open-source model, LLaMA-2. Our study reveals a notable underperformance of LLMs compared to the baseline established through supervised learning. Although Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can improve LLMs performance, it does not scale well compared to the smaller supervised baseline model. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that LLMs have several weaknesses when applied for extracting event relations, including a tendency to fabricate event mentions, and failures to capture transitivity rules among relations, detect long distance relations, or comprehend contexts with dense event mentions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19568v2,2024-07

We present new measures of alignment in substance, style, and psychometric orientation, and experiment with two conversation datasets. Our results provide subtle insights: better alignment is attributed to fewer beams in Beam Search and lower values of P in Nucleus Sampling.

Towards a Universal Method for Meaningful Signal Detection,Louis Mahon,"It is known that human speech and certain animal vocalizations can convey meaningful content because we can decipher the content that a given utterance does convey. This paper explores an alternative approach to determining whether a signal is meaningful, one that analyzes only the signal itself and is independent of what the conveyed meaning might be. We devise a method that takes a waveform as input and outputs a score indicating its degree of `meaningfulness`. We cluster contiguous portions of the input to minimize the total description length, and then take the length of the code of the assigned cluster labels as meaningfulness score. We evaluate our method empirically, against several baselines, and show that it is the only one to give a high score to human speech in various languages and with various speakers, a moderate score to animal vocalizations from birds and orcas, and a low score to ambient noise from various sources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00016v3,2024-07

ASI-Seg: Audio-Driven Surgical Instrument Segmentation with Surgeon Intention Understanding,"Zhen Chen, Zongming Zhang, Wenwu Guo, Xingjian Luo, Long Bai, Jinlin Wu, Hongliang Ren, Hongbin Liu","Surgical instrument segmentation is crucial in surgical scene understanding, thereby facilitating surgical safety. Existing algorithms directly detected all instruments of pre-defined categories in the input image, lacking the capability to segment specific instruments according to the surgeon's intention. During different stages of surgery, surgeons exhibit varying preferences and focus toward different surgical instruments. Therefore, an instrument segmentation algorithm that adheres to the surgeon's intention can minimize distractions from irrelevant instruments and assist surgeons to a great extent. The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) reveals the capability to segment objects following prompts, but the manual annotations for prompts are impractical during the surgery. To address these limitations in operating rooms, we propose an audio-driven surgical instrument segmentation framework, named ASI-Seg, to accurately segment the required surgical instruments by parsing the audio commands of surgeons. Specifically, we propose an intention-oriented multimodal fusion to interpret the segmentation intention from audio commands and retrieve relevant instrument details to facilitate segmentation. Moreover, to guide our ASI-Seg segment of the required surgical instruments, we devise a contrastive learning prompt encoder to effectively distinguish the required instruments from the irrelevant ones. Therefore, our ASI-Seg promotes the workflow in the operating rooms, thereby providing targeted support and reducing the cognitive load on surgeons. Extensive experiments are performed to validate the ASI-Seg framework, which reveals remarkable advantages over classical state-of-the-art and medical SAMs in both semantic segmentation and intention-oriented segmentation.

In this work, we do not propose a new efficient model structure or train small-scale MLLMs from scratch. Instead, we focus on what matters for training small-scale MLLMs through knowledge distillation, which is the first step from the multimodal distillation perspective. Our extensive studies involve training strategies, model choices, and distillation algorithms in the knowledge distillation process. These results show that joint alignment for both tokens and logit alignment plays critical roles in teacher-student frameworks. In addition, we draw a series of intriguing observations from this study. By evaluating different benchmarks and proper strategy, even a 2.7B small-scale model can perform on par with larger models with 7B or 13B parameters.

ELP-Adapters: Parameter Efficient Adapter Tuning for Various Speech Processing Tasks,"Nakamasa Inoue, Shinta Otake, Takumi Hirose, Masanari Ohi, Rei Kawakami","Self-supervised learning has emerged as a key approach for learning generic representations from speech data. Despite promising results in downstream tasks such as speech recognition, speaker verification, and emotion recognition, a significant number of parameters is required, which makes fine-tuning for each task memory-inefficient. To address this limitation, we introduce ELP-adapter tuning, a novel method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using three types of adapter, namely encoder adapters (E-adapters), layer adapters (L-adapters), and a prompt adapter (P-adapter). The E-adapters are integrated into transformer-based encoder layers and help to learn fine-grained speech representations that are effective for speech recognition. The L-adapters create paths from each encoder layer to the downstream head and help to extract non-linguistic features from lower encoder layers that are effective for speaker verification and emotion recognition. The P-adapter appends pseudo features to CNN features to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. With these adapters, models can be quickly adapted to various speech processing tasks. Our evaluation across four downstream tasks using five backbone models demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. With the WavLM backbone, its performance was comparable to or better than that of full fine-tuning on all tasks while requiring 90% fewer learnable parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21066v1,2024-07

We propose univariate polynomial regression as a function class that is just rich enough to study prompting and alignment, while allowing us to visualize and understand what is going on clearly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19346v1,2024-07
Inference-Time Selective Debiasing,"Gleb Kuzmin, Neemesh Yadav, Ivan Smirnov, Timothy Baldwin, Artem Shelmanov","We propose selective debiasing -- an inference-time safety mechanism that aims to increase the overall quality of models in terms of prediction performance and fairness in the situation when re-training a model is prohibitive. The method is inspired by selective prediction, where some predictions that are considered low quality are discarded at inference time. In our approach, we identify the potentially biased model predictions and, instead of discarding them, we debias them using LEACE -- a post-processing debiasing method. To select problematic predictions, we propose a bias quantification approach based on KL divergence, which achieves better results than standard UQ methods. Experiments with text classification datasets demonstrate that selective debiasing helps to close the performance gap between post-processing methods and at-training and pre-processing debiasing techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19345v2,2024-07
LawLLM: Law Large Language Model for the US Legal System,"Dong Shu, Haoran Zhao, Xukun Liu, David Demeter, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang","In the rapidly evolving field of legal analytics, finding relevant cases and accurately predicting judicial outcomes are challenging because of the complexity of legal language, which often includes specialized terminology, complex syntax, and historical context. Moreover, the subtle distinctions between similar and precedent cases require a deep understanding of legal knowledge. Researchers often conflate these concepts, making it difficult to develop specialized techniques to effectively address these nuanced tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Law Large Language Model (LawLLM), a multi-task model specifically designed for the US legal domain to address these challenges. LawLLM excels at Similar Case Retrieval (SCR), Precedent Case Recommendation (PCR), and Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP). By clearly distinguishing between precedent and similar cases, we provide essential clarity, guiding future research in developing specialized strategies for these tasks. We propose customized data preprocessing techniques for each task that transform raw legal data into a trainable format. Furthermore, we also use techniques such as in-context learning (ICL) and advanced information retrieval methods in LawLLM. The evaluation results demonstrate that LawLLM consistently outperforms existing baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, offering unparalleled multi-task capabilities and filling critical gaps in the legal domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21065v1,2024-07
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning via Circular Convolution,"Aochuan Chen, Jiashun Cheng, Zijing Liu, Ziqi Gao, Fugee Tsung, Yu Li, Jia Li","Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity for fine-tuning large foundation models, leveraging low-rank matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to represent weight changes (i.e., $\Delta \mathbf{W} = \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A}$). This method reduces trainable parameters and mitigates heavy memory consumption associated with full delta matrices by sequentially multiplying $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ with the activation. Despite its success, the intrinsic low-rank characteristic may limit its performance. Although several variants have been proposed to address this issue, they often overlook the crucial computational and memory efficiency brought by LoRA. In this paper, we propose Circular Convolution Adaptation (C$^3$A), which not only achieves high-rank adaptation with enhanced performance but also excels in both computational power and memory utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C$^3$A consistently outperforms LoRA and its variants across various fine-tuning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19342v2,2024-07
Investigating Critical Period Effects in Language Acquisition through Neural Language Models,"Ionut Constantinescu, Tiago Pimentel, Ryan Cotterell, Alex Warstadt","Humans appear to have a critical period (CP) for language acquisition: Second language (L2) acquisition becomes harder after early childhood, and ceasing exposure to a first language (L1) after this period (but not before) typically does not lead to substantial loss of L1 proficiency. It is unknown whether these CP effects result from innately determined brain maturation or as a stabilization of neural connections naturally induced by experience. In this study, we use language models (LMs) to test the extent to which these phenomena are peculiar to humans, or shared by a broader class of language learners. We vary the age of exposure by training LMs on language pairs in various experimental conditions, and find that LMs, which lack any direct analog to innate maturational stages, do not show CP effects when the age of exposure of L2 is delayed. Our results contradict the claim that CP effects are an inevitable result of statistical learning, and they are consistent with an innate mechanism for CP effects. We show that we can reverse-engineer the CP by introducing a regularizer partway through training to simulate a maturational decrease in plasticity. All in all, our results suggest that L1 learning on its own may not be enough to induce a CP, and additional engineering is necessary to make language models more cognitively plausible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19325v2,2024-07
IBMEA: Exploring Variational Information Bottleneck for Multi-modal Entity Alignment,"Taoyu Su, Jiawei Sheng, Shicheng Wang, Xinghua Zhang, Hongbo Xu, Tingwen Liu","Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities between multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where the entities can be associated with related images. Most existing studies integrate multi-modal information heavily relying on the automatically-learned fusion module, rarely suppressing the redundant information for MMEA explicitly. To this end, we explore variational information bottleneck for multi-modal entity alignment (IBMEA), which emphasizes the alignment-relevant information and suppresses the alignment-irrelevant information in generating entity representations. Specifically, we devise multi-modal variational encoders to generate modal-specific entity representations as probability distributions. Then, we propose four modal-specific information bottleneck regularizers, limiting the misleading clues in refining modal-specific entity representations. Finally, we propose a modal-hybrid information contrastive regularizer to integrate all the refined modal-specific representations, enhancing the entity similarity between MMKGs to achieve MMEA. We conduct extensive experiments on two cross-KG and three bilingual MMEA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and also shows promising and robust performance in low-resource and high-noise data scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19302v1,2024-07
The Impact of LoRA Adapters for LLMs on Clinical NLP Classification Under Data Limitations,"Thanh-Dung Le, Ti Ti Nguyen, Vu Nguyen Ha","Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) poses significant challenges due to the domain gap and limited data availability. This study investigates the effectiveness of various adapter techniques, equivalent to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for fine-tuning LLMs in a resource-constrained hospital environment. We experimented with four structures-Adapter, Lightweight, TinyAttention, and Gated Residual Network (GRN)-as final layers for clinical notes classification. We fine-tuned biomedical pre-trained models, including CamemBERT-bio, AliBERT, and DrBERT, alongside two Transformer-based models. Our extensive experimental results indicate that i) employing adapter structures does not yield significant improvements in fine-tuning biomedical pre-trained LLMs, and ii) simpler Transformer-based models, trained from scratch, perform better under resource constraints. Among the adapter structures, GRN demonstrated superior performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and an F1 score of 0.88. Moreover, the total training time for LLMs exceeded 1000 hours, compared to under 6 hours for simpler transformer-based models, highlighting that LLMs are more suitable for environments with extensive computational resources and larger datasets. Consequently, this study demonstrates that simpler Transformer-based models can be effectively trained from scratch, providing a viable solution for clinical NLP tasks in low-resource environments with limited data availability. By identifying the GRN as the most effective adapter structure, we offer a practical approach to enhance clinical note classification without requiring extensive computational resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19299v1,2024-07
"Understanding Memorisation in LLMs: Dynamics, Influencing Factors, and Implications","Till Speicher, Mohammad Aflah Khan, Qinyuan Wu, Vedant Nanda, Soumi Das, Bishwamittra Ghosh, Krishna P. Gummadi, Evimaria Terzi","Understanding whether and to what extent large language models (LLMs) have memorised training data has important implications for the reliability of their output and the privacy of their training data. In order to cleanly measure and disentangle memorisation from other phenomena (e.g. in-context learning), we create an experimental framework that is based on repeatedly exposing LLMs to random strings. Our framework allows us to better understand the dynamics, i.e., the behaviour of the model, when repeatedly exposing it to random strings. Using our framework, we make several striking observations: (a) we find consistent phases of the dynamics across families of models (Pythia, Phi and Llama2), (b) we identify factors that make some strings easier to memorise than others, and (c) we identify the role of local prefixes and global context in memorisation. We also show that sequential exposition to different random strings has a significant effect on memorisation. Our results, often surprising, have significant downstream implications in the study and usage of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19262v1,2024-07
Stochastic Parrots or ICU Experts? Large Language Models in Critical Care Medicine: A Scoping Review,"Tongyue Shi, Jun Ma, Zihan Yu, Haowei Xu, Minqi Xiong, Meirong Xiao, Yilin Li, Huiying Zhao, Guilan Kong","With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation, attracting amounts of research interest in applying LLMs to health and medicine. Critical care medicine (CCM) provides diagnosis and treatment for critically ill patients who often require intensive monitoring and interventions in intensive care units (ICUs). Can LLMs be applied to CCM? Are LLMs just like stochastic parrots or ICU experts in assisting clinical decision-making? This scoping review aims to provide a panoramic portrait of the application of LLMs in CCM. Literature in seven databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, were searched from January 1, 2019, to June 10, 2024. Peer-reviewed journal and conference articles that discussed the application of LLMs in critical care settings were included. From an initial 619 articles, 24 were selected for final review. This review grouped applications of LLMs in CCM into three categories: clinical decision support, medical documentation and reporting, and medical education and doctor-patient communication. LLMs have advantages in handling unstructured data and do not require manual feature engineering. Meanwhile, applying LLMs to CCM faces challenges, including hallucinations, poor interpretability, bias and alignment challenges, and privacy and ethics issues. Future research should enhance model reliability and interpretability, integrate up-to-date medical knowledge, and strengthen privacy and ethical guidelines. As LLMs evolve, they could become key tools in CCM to help improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare delivery. This study is the first review of LLMs in CCM, aiding researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to understand the current status and future potentials of LLMs in CCM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19256v1,2024-07
On Behalf of the Stakeholders: Trends in NLP Model Interpretability in the Era of LLMs,"Nitay Calderon, Roi Reichart","Recent advancements in NLP systems, particularly with the introduction of LLMs, have led to widespread adoption of these systems by a broad spectrum of users across various domains, impacting decision-making, the job market, society, and scientific research. This surge in usage has led to an explosion in NLP model interpretability and analysis research, accompanied by numerous technical surveys. Yet, these surveys often overlook the needs and perspectives of explanation stakeholders. In this paper, we address three fundamental questions: Why do we need interpretability, what are we interpreting, and how? By exploring these questions, we examine existing interpretability paradigms, their properties, and their relevance to different stakeholders. We further explore the practical implications of these paradigms by analyzing trends from the past decade across multiple research fields. To this end, we retrieved thousands of papers and employed an LLM to characterize them. Our analysis reveals significant disparities between NLP developers and non-developer users, as well as between research fields, underscoring the diverse needs of stakeholders. For example, explanations of internal model components are rarely used outside the NLP field. We hope this paper informs the future design, development, and application of methods that align with the objectives and requirements of various stakeholders.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19200v1,2024-07
Towards the Dynamics of a DNN Learning Symbolic Interactions,"Qihan Ren, Junpeng Zhang, Yang Xu, Yue Xin, Dongrui Liu, Quanshi Zhang","This study proves the two-phase dynamics of a deep neural network (DNN) learning interactions. Despite the long disappointing view of the faithfulness of post-hoc explanation of a DNN, a series of theorems have been proven in recent years to show that for a given input sample, a small set of interactions between input variables can be considered as primitive inference patterns that faithfully represent a DNN's detailed inference logic on that sample. Particularly, Zhang et al. have observed that various DNNs all learn interactions of different complexities in two distinct phases, and this two-phase dynamics well explains how a DNN changes from under-fitting to over-fitting. Therefore, in this study, we mathematically prove the two-phase dynamics of interactions, providing a theoretical mechanism for how the generalization power of a DNN changes during the training process. Experiments show that our theory well predicts the real dynamics of interactions on different DNNs trained for various tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19198v2,2024-07
Why Misinformation is Created? Detecting them by Integrating Intent Features,"Bing Wang, Ximing Li, Changchun Li, Bo Fu, Songwen Pei, Shengsheng Wang","Various social media platforms, e.g., Twitter and Reddit, allow people to disseminate a plethora of information more efficiently and conveniently. However, they are inevitably full of misinformation, causing damage to diverse aspects of our daily lives. To reduce the negative impact, timely identification of misinformation, namely Misinformation Detection (MD), has become an active research topic receiving widespread attention. As a complex phenomenon, the veracity of an article is influenced by various aspects. In this paper, we are inspired by the opposition of intents between misinformation and real information. Accordingly, we propose to reason the intent of articles and form the corresponding intent features to promote the veracity discrimination of article features. To achieve this, we build a hierarchy of a set of intents for both misinformation and real information by referring to the existing psychological theories, and we apply it to reason the intent of articles by progressively generating binary answers with an encoder-decoder structure. We form the corresponding intent features and integrate it with the token features to achieve more discriminative article features for MD. Upon these ideas, we suggest a novel MD method, namely Detecting Misinformation by Integrating Intent featuRes (DM-INTER). To evaluate the performance of DM-INTER, we conduct extensive experiments on benchmark MD datasets. The experimental results validate that DM-INTER can outperform the existing baseline MD methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19196v1,2024-07
Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in Multimodal Misinformation Detection,"Bing Wang, Shengsheng Wang, Changchun Li, Renchu Guan, Ximing Li","Nowadays, misinformation is widely spreading over various social media platforms and causes extremely negative impacts on society. To combat this issue, automatically identifying misinformation, especially those containing multimodal content, has attracted growing attention from the academic and industrial communities, and induced an active research topic named Multimodal Misinformation Detection (MMD). Typically, existing MMD methods capture the semantic correlation and inconsistency between multiple modalities, but neglect some potential clues in multimodal content. Recent studies suggest that manipulated traces of the images in articles are non-trivial clues for detecting misinformation. Meanwhile, we find that the underlying intentions behind the manipulation, e.g., harmful and harmless, also matter in MMD. Accordingly, in this work, we propose to detect misinformation by learning manipulation features that indicate whether the image has been manipulated, as well as intention features regarding the harmful and harmless intentions of the manipulation. Unfortunately, the manipulation and intention labels that make these features discriminative are unknown. To overcome the problem, we propose two weakly supervised signals as alternatives by introducing additional datasets on image manipulation detection and formulating two classification tasks as positive and unlabeled learning problems. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel MMD method, namely Harmfully Manipulated Images Matter in MMD (HAMI-M3D). Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets can demonstrate that HAMI-M3D can consistently improve the performance of any MMD baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19192v1,2024-07

Employing a novel typology for ethical reasoning and an interrogation approach, we curated comprehensive questions and utilized prompt engineering strategies to probe LLMs' value alignment. Our evaluation criteria quantified deviations from local values, ensuring a rigorous assessment process. Comparative analysis of three commercial LLMs by USA vendors revealed significant insights into their effectiveness and limitations, demonstrating the critical importance of value alignment.

This study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to empower students by discerning between bullying and joking in school peer interactions. We employed ChatGPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 Opus, evaluating their effectiveness through human review. Our results revealed that not all LLMs were suitable for an agentic approach, with ChatGPT-4 showing the most promise. We observed variations in LLM outputs, possibly influenced by political overcorrectness, context window limitations, and pre-existing bias in their training data. ChatGPT-4 excelled in context-specific accuracy after implementing the agentic approach, highlighting its potential to provide continuous, real-time support to vulnerable students. This study underlines the significant social impact of using agentic AI in educational settings, offering a new avenue for reducing the negative consequences of bullying and enhancing student well-being.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01459v1,2024-07
FarSSiBERT: A Novel Transformer-based Model for Semantic Similarity Measurement of Persian Social Networks Informal Texts,"Seyed Mojtaba Sadjadi, Zeinab Rajabi, Leila Rabiei, Mohammad-Shahram Moin","One fundamental task for NLP is to determine the similarity between two texts and evaluate the extent of their likeness. The previous methods for the Persian language have low accuracy and are unable to comprehend the structure and meaning of texts effectively. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on formal texts, but in real-world applications of text processing, there is a need for robust methods that can handle colloquial texts. This requires algorithms that consider the structure and significance of words based on context, rather than just the frequency of words. The lack of a proper dataset for this task in the Persian language makes it important to develop such algorithms and construct a dataset for Persian text. This paper introduces a new transformer-based model to measure semantic similarity between Persian informal short texts from social networks. In addition, a Persian dataset named FarSSiM has been constructed for this purpose, using real data from social networks and manually annotated and verified by a linguistic expert team. The proposed model involves training a large language model using the BERT architecture from scratch. This model, called FarSSiBERT, is pre-trained on approximately 104 million Persian informal short texts from social networks, making it one of a kind in the Persian language. Moreover, a novel specialized informal language tokenizer is provided that not only performs tokenization on formal texts well but also accurately identifies tokens that other Persian tokenizers are unable to recognize. It has been demonstrated that our proposed model outperforms ParsBERT, laBSE, and multilingual BERT in the Pearson and Spearman's coefficient criteria. Additionally, the pre-trained large language model has great potential for use in other NLP tasks on colloquial text and as a tokenizer for less-known informal words.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19173v1,2024-07
Addressing Topic Leakage in Cross-Topic Evaluation for Authorship Verification,"Jitkapat Sawatphol, Can Udomcharoenchaikit, Sarana Nutanong","Authorship verification (AV) aims to identify whether a pair of texts has the same author. We address the challenge of evaluating AV models' robustness against topic shifts. The conventional evaluation assumes minimal topic overlap between training and test data. However, we argue that there can still be topic leakage in test data, causing misleading model performance and unstable rankings. To address this, we propose an evaluation method called Heterogeneity-Informed Topic Sampling (HITS), which creates a smaller dataset with a heterogeneously distributed topic set. Our experimental results demonstrate that HITS-sampled datasets yield a more stable ranking of models across random seeds and evaluation splits. Our contributions include: 1. An analysis of causes and effects of topic leakage. 2. A demonstration of the HITS in reducing the effects of topic leakage, and 3. The Robust Authorship Verification bENchmark (RAVEN) that allows topic shortcut test to uncover AV models' reliance on topic-specific features.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19164v1,2024-07

Our approach involves iterative inclusion of LLM generated molecules with high predicted performance, along with experimental data.

OfficeBench: Benchmarking Language Agents across Multiple Applications for Office Automation,"Zilong Wang, Yuedong Cui, Li Zhong, Zimin Zhang, Da Yin, Bill Yuchen Lin, Jingbo Shang","Office automation significantly enhances human productivity by automatically finishing routine tasks in the workflow. Beyond the basic information extraction studied in much of the prior document AI literature, the office automation research should be extended to more realistic office tasks which require to integrate various information sources in the office system and produce outputs through a series of decision-making processes. We introduce OfficeBench, one of the first office automation benchmarks for evaluating current LLM agents' capability to address office tasks in realistic office workflows. OfficeBench requires LLM agents to perform feasible long-horizon planning, proficiently switch between applications in a timely manner, and accurately ground their actions within a large combined action space, based on the contextual demands of the workflow. Applying our customized evaluation methods on each task, we find that GPT-4 Omni achieves the highest pass rate of 47.00%, demonstrating a decent performance in handling office tasks. However, this is still far below the human performance and accuracy standards required by real-world office workflows. We further observe that most issues are related to operation redundancy and hallucinations, as well as limitations in switching between multiple applications, which may provide valuable insights for developing effective agent frameworks for office automation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19056v1,2024-07

Our approach can be applied to enhance video understanding, auto-labeling, and captioning. To evaluate caption quality, we introduce CapScore, an LLM-based metric to assess the similarity and quality of generated captions compared to the ground truth captions. We further build four human-annotated datasets in three domains: autonomous driving, general scenes, and robotics, to facilitate comprehensive comparisons. We show that Wolf achieves superior captioning performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches from the research community (VILA1.5, CogAgent) and commercial solutions (Gemini-Pro-1.5, GPT-4V).

AppWorld: A Controllable World of Apps and People for Benchmarking Interactive Coding Agents,"Harsh Trivedi, Tushar Khot, Mareike Hartmann, Ruskin Manku, Vinty Dong, Edward Li, Shashank Gupta, Ashish Sabharwal, Niranjan Balasubramanian","Autonomous agents that address day-to-day digital tasks (e.g., ordering groceries for a household), must not only operate multiple apps (e.g., notes, messaging, shopping app) via APIs, but also generate rich code with complex control flow in an iterative manner based on their interaction with the environment. However, existing benchmarks for tool use are inadequate, as they only cover tasks that require a simple sequence of API calls.   To remedy this gap, we built $\textbf{AppWorld Engine}$, a high-quality execution environment (60K lines of code) of 9 day-to-day apps operable via 457 APIs and populated with realistic digital activities simulating the lives of ~100 fictitious users. We then created $\textbf{AppWorld Benchmark}$ (40K lines of code), a suite of 750 natural, diverse, and challenging autonomous agent tasks requiring rich and interactive code generation. It supports robust programmatic evaluation with state-based unit tests, allowing for different ways of completing a task while also checking for unexpected changes, i.e., collateral damage. The state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4o, solves only ~49% of our 'normal' tasks and ~30% of 'challenge' tasks, while other models solve at least 16% fewer.

Embedding And Clustering Your Data Can Improve Contrastive Pretraining,Luke Merrick,"Recent studies of large-scale contrastive pretraining in the text embedding domain show that using single-source minibatches, rather than mixed-source minibatches, can substantially improve overall model accuracy. In this work, we explore extending training data stratification beyond source granularity by leveraging a pretrained text embedding model and the classic k-means clustering algorithm to further split training data apart by the semantic clusters within each source. Experimentally, we observe a notable increase in NDCG@10 when pretraining a BERT-based text embedding model on query-passage pairs from the MSMARCO passage retrieval dataset. Additionally, we conceptually connect our clustering approach to both the Topic Aware Sampling (TAS) aspect of the TAS-B methodology and the nearest-neighbor-based hard-negative mining aspect of the ANCE methodology and discuss how this unified view motivates future lines of research on the organization of contrastive pretraining data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18887v1,2024-07
Granularity is crucial when applying differential privacy to text: An investigation for neural machine translation,"Doan Nam Long Vu, Timour Igamberdiev, Ivan Habernal","Applying differential privacy (DP) by means of the DP-SGD algorithm to protect individual data points during training is becoming increasingly popular in NLP. However, the choice of granularity at which DP is applied is often neglected. For example, neural machine translation (NMT) typically operates on the sentence-level granularity. From the perspective of DP, this setup assumes that each sentence belongs to a single person and any two sentences in the training dataset are independent. This assumption is however violated in many real-world NMT datasets, e.g., those including dialogues. For proper application of DP we thus must shift from sentences to entire documents. In this paper, we investigate NMT at both the sentence and document levels, analyzing the privacy/utility trade-off for both scenarios, and evaluating the risks of not using the appropriate privacy granularity in terms of leaking personally identifiable information (PII). Our findings indicate that the document-level NMT system is more resistant to membership inference attacks, emphasizing the significance of using the appropriate granularity when working with DP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18789v2,2024-07
The power of Prompts: Evaluating and Mitigating Gender Bias in MT with LLMs,"Aleix Sant, Carlos Escolano, Audrey Mash, Francesca De Luca Fornaciari, Maite Melero","This paper studies gender bias in machine translation through the lens of Large Language Models (LLMs). Four widely-used test sets are employed to benchmark various base LLMs, comparing their translation quality and gender bias against state-of-the-art Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for English to Catalan (En $\rightarrow$ Ca) and English to Spanish (En $\rightarrow$ Es) translation directions. Our findings reveal pervasive gender bias across all models, with base LLMs exhibiting a higher degree of bias compared to NMT models. To combat this bias, we explore prompting engineering techniques applied to an instruction-tuned LLM. We identify a prompt structure that significantly reduces gender bias by up to 12% on the WinoMT evaluation dataset compared to more straightforward prompts. These results significantly reduce the gender bias accuracy gap between LLMs and traditional NMT systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18786v1,2024-07
Knowledge Graph Structure as Prompt: Improving Small Language Models Capabilities for Knowledge-based Causal Discovery,"Yuni Susanti, Michael Färber","Causal discovery aims to estimate causal structures among variables based on observational data. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a fresh perspective to tackle the causal discovery problem by reasoning on the metadata associated with variables rather than their actual data values, an approach referred to as knowledge-based causal discovery. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of Small Language Models (SLMs, defined as LLMs with fewer than 1 billion parameters) with prompt-based learning for knowledge-based causal discovery. Specifically, we present KG Structure as Prompt, a novel approach for integrating structural information from a knowledge graph, such as common neighbor nodes and metapaths, into prompt-based learning to enhance the capabilities of SLMs. Experimental results on three types of biomedical and open-domain datasets under few-shot settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing most baselines and even conventional fine-tuning approaches trained on full datasets. Our findings further highlight the strong capabilities of SLMs: in combination with knowledge graphs and prompt-based learning, SLMs demonstrate the potential to surpass LLMs with larger number of parameters. Our code and datasets are available on GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18752v3,2024-07

To make the CPT approach more traceable, this paper presents a technical report for continually pre-training Llama-3 (8B), which significantly enhances the Chinese language ability and scientific reasoning ability of the backbone model. To enhance the new abilities while retaining the original abilities, we design specific data mixture and curriculum strategies by utilizing existing datasets and synthesizing high-quality datasets. Specifically, we synthesize multidisciplinary scientific question and answer (QA) pairs based on related web pages, and subsequently incorporate these synthetic data to improve the scientific reasoning ability of Llama-3. We refer to the model after CPT as Llama-3-SynE (Synthetic data Enhanced Llama-3). We also present the tuning experiments with a relatively small model -- TinyLlama, and employ the derived findings to train the backbone model. Extensive experiments on a number of evaluation benchmarks show that our approach can largely improve the performance of the backbone models, including both the general abilities (+8.81 on C-Eval and +6.31 on CMMLU) and the scientific reasoning abilities (+12.00 on MATH and +4.13 on SciEval), without hurting the original capacities.

Towards Generalized Offensive Language Identification,"Alphaeus Dmonte, Tejas Arya, Tharindu Ranasinghe, Marcos Zampieri","The prevalence of offensive content on the internet, encompassing hate speech and cyberbullying, is a pervasive issue worldwide. Consequently, it has garnered significant attention from the machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) communities. As a result, numerous systems have been developed to automatically identify potentially harmful content and mitigate its impact. These systems can follow two approaches; (1) Use publicly available models and application endpoints, including prompting large language models (LLMs) (2) Annotate datasets and train ML models on them. However, both approaches lack an understanding of how generalizable they are. Furthermore, the applicability of these systems is often questioned in off-domain and practical environments. This paper empirically evaluates the generalizability of offensive language detection models and datasets across a novel generalized benchmark. We answer three research questions on generalizability. Our findings will be useful in creating robust real-world offensive language detection systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18738v1,2024-07

ChatSchema: A pipeline of extracting structured information with Large Multimodal Models based on schema,"Fei Wang, Yuewen Zheng, Qin Li, Jingyi Wu, Pengfei Li, Luxia Zhang","Objective: This study introduces ChatSchema, an effective method for extracting and structuring information from unstructured data in medical paper reports using a combination of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) based on the schema. By integrating predefined schema, we intend to enable LMMs to directly extract and standardize information according to the schema specifications, facilitating further data entry. Method: Our approach involves a two-stage process, including classification and extraction for categorizing report scenarios and structuring information. We established and annotated a dataset to verify the effectiveness of ChatSchema, and evaluated key extraction using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics. Based on key extraction, we further assessed value extraction. We conducted ablation studies on two LMMs to illustrate the improvement of structured information extraction with different input modals and methods. Result: We analyzed 100 medical reports from Peking University First Hospital and established a ground truth dataset with 2,945 key-value pairs. We evaluated ChatSchema using GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro and found a higher overall performance of GPT-4o. The results are as follows: For the result of key extraction, key-precision was 98.6%, key-recall was 98.5%, key-F1-score was 98.6%. For the result of value extraction based on correct key extraction, the overall accuracy was 97.2%, precision was 95.8%, recall was 95.8%, and F1-score was 95.8%. An ablation study demonstrated that ChatSchema achieved significantly higher overall accuracy and overall F1-score of key-value extraction, compared to the Baseline, with increases of 26.9% overall accuracy and 27.4% overall F1-score, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18716v1,2024-07
Cluster-norm for Unsupervised Probing of Knowledge,"Walter Laurito, Sharan Maiya, Grégoire Dhimoïla, Owen, Yeung, Kaarel Hänni","The deployment of language models brings challenges in generating reliable information, especially when these models are fine-tuned using human preferences. To extract encoded knowledge without (potentially) biased human labels, unsupervised probing techniques like Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) have been developed (Burns et al., 2022). However, salient but unrelated features in a given dataset can mislead these probes (Farquhar et al., 2023). Addressing this, we propose a cluster normalization method to minimize the impact of such features by clustering and normalizing activations of contrast pairs before applying unsupervised probing techniques. While this approach does not address the issue of differentiating between knowledge in general and simulated knowledge - a major issue in the literature of latent knowledge elicitation (Christiano et al., 2021) - it significantly improves the ability of unsupervised probes to identify the intended knowledge amidst distractions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18712v2,2024-07
Adaptive Contrastive Search: Uncertainty-Guided Decoding for Open-Ended Text Generation,"Esteban Garces Arias, Julian Rodemann, Meimingwei Li, Christian Heumann, Matthias Aßenmacher","Decoding from the output distributions of large language models to produce high-quality text is a complex challenge in language modeling. Various approaches, such as beam search, sampling with temperature, $k-$sampling, nucleus $p-$sampling, typical decoding, contrastive decoding, and contrastive search, have been proposed to address this problem, aiming to improve coherence, diversity, as well as resemblance to human-generated text. In this study, we introduce adaptive contrastive search, a novel decoding strategy extending contrastive search by incorporating an adaptive degeneration penalty, guided by the estimated uncertainty of the model at each generation step. This strategy is designed to enhance both the creativity and diversity of the language modeling process while at the same time producing coherent and high-quality generated text output. Our findings indicate performance enhancement in both aspects, across different model architectures and datasets, underscoring the effectiveness of our method in text generation tasks.

Improving noisy student training for low-resource languages in End-to-End ASR using CycleGAN and inter-domain losses,"Chia-Yu Li, Ngoc Thang Vu","Training a semi-supervised end-to-end speech recognition system using noisy student training has significantly improved performance. However, this approach requires a substantial amount of paired speech-text and unlabeled speech, which is costly for low-resource languages. Therefore, this paper considers a more extreme case of semi-supervised end-to-end automatic speech recognition where there are limited paired speech-text, unlabeled speech (less than five hours), and abundant external text. Firstly, we observe improved performance by training the model using our previous work on semi-supervised learning ""CycleGAN and inter-domain losses"" solely with external text. Secondly, we enhance ""CycleGAN and inter-domain losses"" by incorporating automatic hyperparameter tuning, calling it ""enhanced CycleGAN inter-domain losses."" Thirdly, we integrate it into the noisy student training approach pipeline for low-resource scenarios. Our experimental results, conducted on six non-English languages from Voxforge and Common Voice, show a 20% word error rate reduction compared to the baseline teacher model and a 10% word error rate reduction compared to the baseline best student model, highlighting the significant improvements achieved through our proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21061v1,2024-07
Every Part Matters: Integrity Verification of Scientific Figures Based on Multimodal Large Language Models,"Xiang Shi, Jiawei Liu, Yinpeng Liu, Qikai Cheng, Wei Lu","This paper tackles a key issue in the interpretation of scientific figures: the fine-grained alignment of text and figures. It advances beyond prior research that primarily dealt with straightforward, data-driven visualizations such as bar and pie charts and only offered a basic understanding of diagrams through captioning and classification. We introduce a novel task, Figure Integrity Verification, designed to evaluate the precision of technologies in aligning textual knowledge with visual elements in scientific figures. To support this, we develop a semi-automated method for constructing a large-scale dataset, Figure-seg, specifically designed for this task. Additionally, we propose an innovative framework, Every Part Matters (EPM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to not only incrementally improve the alignment and verification of text-figure integrity but also enhance integrity through analogical reasoning. Our comprehensive experiments show that these innovations substantially improve upon existing methods, allowing for more precise and thorough analysis of complex scientific figures. This progress not only enhances our understanding of multimodal technologies but also stimulates further research and practical applications across fields requiring the accurate interpretation of complex visual data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18626v1,2024-07

Using Large Language Models for the Interpretation of Building Regulations,"Stefan Fuchs, Michael Witbrock, Johannes Dimyadi, Robert Amor","Compliance checking is an essential part of a construction project. The recent rapid uptake of building information models (BIM) in the construction industry has created more opportunities for automated compliance checking (ACC). BIM enables sharing of digital building design data that can be used for compliance checking with legal requirements, which are conventionally conveyed in natural language and not intended for machine processing. Creating a computable representation of legal requirements suitable for ACC is complex, costly, and time-consuming. Large language models (LLMs) such as the generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, powering OpenAI's ChatGPT, can generate logically coherent text and source code responding to user prompts. This capability could be used to automate the conversion of building regulations into a semantic and computable representation. This paper evaluates the performance of LLMs in translating building regulations into LegalRuleML in a few-shot learning setup. By providing GPT-3.5 with only a few example translations, it can learn the basic structure of the format. Using a system prompt, we further specify the LegalRuleML representation and explore the existence of expert domain knowledge in the model. Such domain knowledge might be ingrained in GPT-3.5 through the broad pre-training but needs to be brought forth by careful contextualisation. Finally, we investigate whether strategies such as chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency could apply to this use case. As LLMs become more sophisticated, the increased common sense, logical coherence, and means to domain adaptation can significantly support ACC, leading to more efficient and effective checking processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21060v1,2024-07
Dynamic Language Group-Based MoE: Enhancing Code-Switching Speech Recognition with Hierarchical Routing,"Hukai Huang, Shenghui Lu, Yahui Shan, He Qu, Fengrun Zhang, Wenhao Guan, Qingyang Hong, Lin Li","The Mixture of Experts (MoE) model is a promising approach for handling code-switching speech recognition (CS-ASR) tasks. However, the existing CS-ASR work on MoE has yet to leverage the advantages of MoE's parameter scaling ability fully. This work proposes DLG-MoE, a Dynamic Language Group-based MoE, which can effectively handle the CS-ASR task and leverage the advantages of parameter scaling. DLG-MoE operates based on a hierarchical routing mechanism. First, the language router explicitly models the language attribute and dispatches the representations to the corresponding language expert groups. Subsequently, the unsupervised router within each language group implicitly models attributes beyond language and coordinates expert routing and collaboration. DLG-MoE outperforms the existing MoE methods on CS-ASR tasks while demonstrating great flexibility. It supports different top-$k$ inference and streaming capabilities and can also prune the model parameters flexibly to obtain a monolingual sub-model. The code has been released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18581v4,2024-07
Learning Robust Named Entity Recognizers From Noisy Data With Retrieval Augmentation,"Chaoyi Ai, Yong Jiang, Shen Huang, Pengjun Xie, Kewei Tu","Named entity recognition (NER) models often struggle with noisy inputs, such as those with spelling mistakes or errors generated by Optical Character Recognition processes, and learning a robust NER model is challenging. Existing robust NER models utilize both noisy text and its corresponding gold text for training, which is infeasible in many real-world applications in which gold text is not available. In this paper, we consider a more realistic setting in which only noisy text and its NER labels are available. We propose to retrieve relevant text of the noisy text from a knowledge corpus and use it to enhance the representation of the original noisy input. We design three retrieval methods: sparse retrieval based on lexicon similarity, dense retrieval based on semantic similarity, and self-retrieval based on task-specific text. After retrieving relevant text, we concatenate the retrieved text with the original noisy text and encode them with a transformer network, utilizing self-attention to enhance the contextual token representations of the noisy text using the retrieved text. We further employ a multi-view training framework that improves robust NER without retrieving text during inference. Experiments show that our retrieval-augmented model achieves significant improvements in various noisy NER settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18562v1,2024-07
Multimodal Emotion Recognition using Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention,"Joe Dhanith P R, Shravan Venkatraman, Modigari Narendra, Vigya Sharma, Santhosh Malarvannan, Amir H. Gandomi","Understanding emotions is a fundamental aspect of human communication. Integrating audio and video signals offers a more comprehensive understanding of emotional states compared to traditional methods that rely on a single data source, such as speech or facial expressions. Despite its potential, multimodal emotion recognition faces significant challenges, particularly in synchronization, feature extraction, and fusion of diverse data sources. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel transformer-based model named Audio-Video Transformer Fusion with Cross Attention (AVT-CA). The AVT-CA model employs a transformer fusion approach to effectively capture and synchronize interlinked features from both audio and video inputs, thereby resolving synchronization problems. Additionally, the Cross Attention mechanism within AVT-CA selectively extracts and emphasizes critical features while discarding irrelevant ones from both modalities, addressing feature extraction and fusion challenges. Extensive experimental analysis conducted on the CMU-MOSEI, RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed model. The results underscore the importance of AVT-CA in developing precise and reliable multimodal emotion recognition systems for practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18552v2,2024-07
A Universal Prompting Strategy for Extracting Process Model Information from Natural Language Text using Large Language Models,"Julian Neuberger, Lars Ackermann, Han van der Aa, Stefan Jablonski","Over the past decade, extensive research efforts have been dedicated to the extraction of information from textual process descriptions. Despite the remarkable progress witnessed in natural language processing (NLP), information extraction within the Business Process Management domain remains predominantly reliant on rule-based systems and machine learning methodologies. Data scarcity has so far prevented the successful application of deep learning techniques. However, the rapid progress in generative large language models (LLMs) makes it possible to solve many NLP tasks with very high quality without the need for extensive data. Therefore, we systematically investigate the potential of LLMs for extracting information from textual process descriptions, targeting the detection of process elements such as activities and actors, and relations between them. Using a heuristic algorithm, we demonstrate the suitability of the extracted information for process model generation. Based on a novel prompting strategy, we show that LLMs are able to outperform state-of-the-art machine learning approaches with absolute performance improvements of up to 8\% $F_1$ score across three different datasets. We evaluate our prompting strategy on eight different LLMs, showing it is universally applicable, while also analyzing the impact of certain prompt parts on extraction quality. The number of example texts, the specificity of definitions, and the rigour of format instructions are identified as key for improving the accuracy of extracted information. Our code, prompts, and data are publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18540v1,2024-07
Towards a Multidimensional Evaluation Framework for Empathetic Conversational Systems,"Aravind Sesagiri Raamkumar, Siyuan Brandon Loh","Empathetic Conversational Systems (ECS) are built to respond empathetically to the user's emotions and sentiments, regardless of the application domain. Current ECS studies evaluation approaches are restricted to offline evaluation experiments primarily for gold standard comparison & benchmarking, and user evaluation studies for collecting human ratings on specific constructs. These methods are inadequate in measuring the actual quality of empathy in conversations. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional empathy evaluation framework with three new methods for measuring empathy at (i) structural level using three empathy-related dimensions, (ii) behavioral level using empathy behavioral types, and (iii) overall level using an empathy lexicon, thereby fortifying the evaluation process. Experiments were conducted with the state-of-the-art ECS models and large language models (LLMs) to show the framework's usefulness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18538v1,2024-07
Is larger always better? Evaluating and prompting large language models for non-generative medical tasks,"Yinghao Zhu, Junyi Gao, Zixiang Wang, Weibin Liao, Xiaochen Zheng, Lifang Liang, Yasha Wang, Chengwei Pan, Ewen M. Harrison, Liantao Ma","The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine is growing, but their ability to handle both structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data and unstructured clinical notes is not well-studied. This study benchmarks various models, including GPT-based LLMs, BERT-based models, and traditional clinical predictive models, for non-generative medical tasks utilizing renowned datasets. We assessed 14 language models (9 GPT-based and 5 BERT-based) and 7 traditional predictive models using the MIMIC dataset (ICU patient records) and the TJH dataset (early COVID-19 EHR data), focusing on tasks such as mortality and readmission prediction, disease hierarchy reconstruction, and biomedical sentence matching, comparing both zero-shot and finetuned performance. Results indicated that LLMs exhibited robust zero-shot predictive capabilities on structured EHR data when using well-designed prompting strategies, frequently surpassing traditional models. However, for unstructured medical texts, LLMs did not outperform finetuned BERT models, which excelled in both supervised and unsupervised tasks. Consequently, while LLMs are effective for zero-shot learning on structured data, finetuned BERT models are more suitable for unstructured texts, underscoring the importance of selecting models based on specific task requirements and data characteristics to optimize the application of NLP technology in healthcare.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18525v1,2024-07
The formation of perceptual space in early phonetic acquisition: a cross-linguistic modeling approach,"Frank Lihui Tan, Youngah Do","This study investigates how learners organize perceptual space in early phonetic acquisition by advancing previous studies in two key aspects. Firstly, it examines the shape of the learned hidden representation as well as its ability to categorize phonetic categories. Secondly, it explores the impact of training models on context-free acoustic information, without involving contextual cues, on phonetic acquisition, closely mimicking the early language learning stage. Using a cross-linguistic modeling approach, autoencoder models are trained on English and Mandarin and evaluated in both native and non-native conditions, following experimental conditions used in infant language perception studies. The results demonstrate that unsupervised bottom-up training on context-free acoustic information leads to comparable learned representations of perceptual space between native and non-native conditions for both English and Mandarin, resembling the early stage of universal listening in infants. These findings provide insights into the organization of perceptual space during early phonetic acquisition and contribute to our understanding of the formation and representation of phonetic categories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18501v1,2024-07
A Reliable Common-Sense Reasoning Socialbot Built Using LLMs and Goal-Directed ASP,"Yankai Zeng, Abhiramon Rajashekharan, Kinjal Basu, Huaduo Wang, Joaquín Arias, Gopal Gupta","The development of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, has enabled the construction of several socialbots, like ChatGPT, that are receiving a lot of attention for their ability to simulate a human conversation. However, the conversation is not guided by a goal and is hard to control. In addition, because LLMs rely more on pattern recognition than deductive reasoning, they can give confusing answers and have difficulty integrating multiple topics into a cohesive response. These limitations often lead the LLM to deviate from the main topic to keep the conversation interesting. We propose AutoCompanion, a socialbot that uses an LLM model to translate natural language into predicates (and vice versa) and employs commonsense reasoning based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) to hold a social conversation with a human. In particular, we rely on s(CASP), a goal-directed implementation of ASP as the backend. This paper presents the framework design and how an LLM is used to parse user messages and generate a response from the s(CASP) engine output. To validate our proposal, we describe (real) conversations in which the chatbot's goal is to keep the user entertained by talking about movies and books, and s(CASP) ensures (i) correctness of answers, (ii) coherence (and precision) during the conversation, which it dynamically regulates to achieve its specific purpose, and (iii) no deviation from the main topic.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18498v1,2024-07

For the first stage of this project we implemented a Feed-Forward Neural Network using sentence-level embeddings as features. We experimented with four different embedding models for generating the inputs to the neural network. The subsequent stage builds upon the previous work and we have implemented three types of revisions. The first revision focuses on the enhancements to the model architecture and the training approach. The second revision focuses on handling class imbalance using stratified data sampling. The third revision focuses on leveraging lexical resources, where we apply four different resources to enrich the features associated with the dataset. During the final stage of this project, we have created the final end-to-end system for the primary task using an ensemble of models to revise primary task performance. Additionally, as part of the final stage, these approaches have been adapted to the WASSA 2023 Shared Task on Empathy Emotion and Personality Detection in Interactions, in which the empathic concern, emotion polarity, and emotion intensity in dyadic text conversations are predicted.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18496v1,2024-07
Modular RAG: Transforming RAG Systems into LEGO-like Reconfigurable Frameworks,"Yunfan Gao, Yun Xiong, Meng Wang, Haofen Wang","Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has markedly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. The increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG, leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems. However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm, with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of ""retrieve-then-generate"". In this context, this paper examines the limitations of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG technologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21059v1,2024-07
A Role-specific Guided Large Language Model for Ophthalmic Consultation Based on Stylistic Differentiation,"Laiyi Fu, Binbin Fan, Hongkai Du, Yanxiang Feng, Chunhua Li, Huping Song","Ophthalmology consultations are crucial for diagnosing, treating, and preventing eye diseases. However, the growing demand for consultations exceeds the availability of ophthalmologists. By leveraging large pre-trained language models, we can design effective dialogues for specific scenarios, aiding in consultations. Traditional fine-tuning strategies for question-answering tasks are impractical due to increasing model size and often ignoring patient-doctor role function during consultations. In this paper, we propose EyeDoctor, an ophthalmic medical questioning large language model that enhances accuracy through doctor-patient role perception guided and an augmented knowledge base with external disease information. Experimental results show EyeDoctor achieves higher question-answering precision in ophthalmology consultations. Notably, EyeDoctor demonstrated a 7.25% improvement in Rouge-1 scores and a 10.16% improvement in F1 scores on multi-round datasets compared to second best model ChatGPT, highlighting the importance of doctor-patient role differentiation and dynamic knowledge base expansion for intelligent medical consultations.

Multi-turn Response Selection with Commonsense-enhanced Language Models,"Yuandong Wang, Xuhui Ren, Tong Chen, Yuxiao Dong, Nguyen Quoc Viet Hung, Jie Tang","As a branch of advanced artificial intelligence, dialogue systems are prospering. Multi-turn response selection is a general research problem in dialogue systems. With the assistance of background information and pre-trained language models, the performance of state-of-the-art methods on this problem gains impressive improvement. However, existing studies neglect the importance of external commonsense knowledge. Hence, we design a Siamese network where a pre-trained Language model merges with a Graph neural network (SinLG). SinLG takes advantage of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to catch the word correlations in the context and response candidates and utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to reason helpful common sense from an external knowledge graph. The GNN aims to assist the PLM in fine-tuning, and arousing its related memories to attain better performance. Specifically, we first extract related concepts as nodes from an external knowledge graph to construct a subgraph with the context response pair as a super node for each sample. Next, we learn two representations for the context response pair via both the PLM and GNN. A similarity loss between the two representations is utilized to transfer the commonsense knowledge from the GNN to the PLM. Then only the PLM is used to infer online so that efficiency can be guaranteed. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two variants of the PERSONA-CHAT dataset, which proves that our solution can not only improve the performance of the PLM but also achieve an efficient inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18479v1,2024-07
Constructing the CORD-19 Vaccine Dataset,"Manisha Singh, Divy Sharma, Alonso Ma, Bridget Tyree, Margaret Mitchell","We introduce new dataset 'CORD-19-Vaccination' to cater to scientists specifically looking into COVID-19 vaccine-related research. This dataset is extracted from CORD-19 dataset [Wang et al., 2020] and augmented with new columns for language detail, author demography, keywords, and topic per paper. Facebook's fastText model is used to identify languages [Joulin et al., 2016]. To establish author demography (author affiliation, lab/institution location, and lab/institution country columns) we processed the JSON file for each paper and then further enhanced using Google's search API to determine country values. 'Yake' was used to extract keywords from the title, abstract, and body of each paper and the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) algorithm was used to add topic information [Campos et al., 2020, 2018a,b]. To evaluate the dataset, we demonstrate a question-answering task like the one used in the CORD-19 Kaggle challenge [Goldbloom et al., 2022]. For further evaluation, sequential sentence classification was performed on each paper's abstract using the model from Dernoncourt et al. [2016]. We partially hand annotated the training dataset and used a pre-trained BERT-PubMed layer. 'CORD- 19-Vaccination' contains 30k research papers and can be immensely valuable for NLP research such as text mining, information extraction, and question answering, specific to the domain of COVID-19 vaccine research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18471v1,2024-07
Enhancing Dysarthric Speech Recognition for Unseen Speakers via Prototype-Based Adaptation,"Shiyao Wang, Shiwan Zhao, Jiaming Zhou, Aobo Kong, Yong Qin","Dysarthric speech recognition (DSR) presents a formidable challenge due to inherent inter-speaker variability, leading to severe performance degradation when applying DSR models to new dysarthric speakers. Traditional speaker adaptation methodologies typically involve fine-tuning models for each speaker, but this strategy is cost-prohibitive and inconvenient for disabled users, requiring substantial data collection. To address this issue, we introduce a prototype-based approach that markedly improves DSR performance for unseen dysarthric speakers without additional fine-tuning. Our method employs a feature extractor trained with HuBERT to produce per-word prototypes that encapsulate the characteristics of previously unseen speakers. These prototypes serve as the basis for classification. Additionally, we incorporate supervised contrastive learning to refine feature extraction. By enhancing representation quality, we further improve DSR performance, enabling effective personalized DSR.

Fairness Definitions in Language Models Explained,"Thang Viet Doan, Zhibo Chu, Zichong Wang, Wenbin Zhang","Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite these advancements, LMs can inherit and amplify societal biases related to sensitive attributes such as gender and race, limiting their adoption in real-world applications. Therefore, fairness has been extensively explored in LMs, leading to the proposal of various fairness notions. However, the lack of clear agreement on which fairness definition to apply in specific contexts (\textit{e.g.,} medium-sized LMs versus large-sized LMs) and the complexity of understanding the distinctions between these definitions can create confusion and impede further progress. To this end, this paper proposes a systematic survey that clarifies the definitions of fairness as they apply to LMs. Specifically, we begin with a brief introduction to LMs and fairness in LMs, followed by a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of existing fairness notions in LMs and the introduction of a novel taxonomy that categorizes these concepts based on their foundational principles and operational distinctions. We further illustrate each definition through experiments, showcasing their practical implications and outcomes. Finally, we discuss current research challenges and open questions, aiming to foster innovative ideas and advance the field. The implementation and additional resources are publicly available at https://github.com/LavinWong/Fairness-in-Large-Language-Models/tree/main/definitions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18454v1,2024-07
Guidance-Based Prompt Data Augmentation in Specialized Domains for Named Entity Recognition,"Hyeonseok Kang, Hyein Seo, Jeesu Jung, Sangkeun Jung, Du-Seong Chang, Riwoo Chung","While the abundance of rich and vast datasets across numerous fields has facilitated the advancement of natural language processing, sectors in need of specialized data types continue to struggle with the challenge of finding quality data. Our study introduces a novel guidance data augmentation technique utilizing abstracted context and sentence structures to produce varied sentences while maintaining context-entity relationships, addressing data scarcity challenges. By fostering a closer relationship between context, sentence structure, and role of entities, our method enhances data augmentation's effectiveness. Consequently, by showcasing diversification in both entity-related vocabulary and overall sentence structure, and simultaneously improving the training performance of named entity recognition task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18442v1,2024-07
"Understanding the Interplay of Scale, Data, and Bias in Language Models: A Case Study with BERT","Muhammad Ali, Swetasudha Panda, Qinlan Shen, Michael Wick, Ari Kobren","In the current landscape of language model research, larger models, larger datasets and more compute seems to be the only way to advance towards intelligence. While there have been extensive studies of scaling laws and models' scaling behaviors, the effect of scale on a model's social biases and stereotyping tendencies has received less attention. In this study, we explore the influence of model scale and pre-training data on its learnt social biases. We focus on BERT -- an extremely popular language model -- and investigate biases as they show up during language modeling (upstream), as well as during classification applications after fine-tuning (downstream). Our experiments on four architecture sizes of BERT demonstrate that pre-training data substantially influences how upstream biases evolve with model scale. With increasing scale, models pre-trained on large internet scrapes like Common Crawl exhibit higher toxicity, whereas models pre-trained on moderated data sources like Wikipedia show greater gender stereotypes. However, downstream biases generally decrease with increasing model scale, irrespective of the pre-training data. Our results highlight the qualitative role of pre-training data in the biased behavior of language models, an often overlooked aspect in the study of scale. Through a detailed case study of BERT, we shed light on the complex interplay of data and model scale, and investigate how it translates to concrete biases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21058v1,2024-07
Self-Directed Synthetic Dialogues and Revisions Technical Report,"Nathan Lambert, Hailey Schoelkopf, Aaron Gokaslan, Luca Soldaini, Valentina Pyatkin, Louis Castricato","Synthetic data has become an important tool in the fine-tuning of language models to follow instructions and solve complex problems. Nevertheless, the majority of open data to date is often lacking multi-turn data and collected on closed models, limiting progress on advancing open fine-tuning methods. We introduce Self Directed Synthetic Dialogues (SDSD), an experimental dataset consisting of guided conversations of language models talking to themselves. The dataset consists of multi-turn conversations generated with DBRX, Llama 2 70B, and Mistral Large, all instructed to follow a conversation plan generated prior to the conversation. We also explore including principles from Constitutional AI and other related works to create synthetic preference data via revisions to the final conversation turn. We hope this work encourages further exploration in multi-turn data and the use of open models for expanding the impact of synthetic data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18421v1,2024-07
Know Your Limits: A Survey of Abstention in Large Language Models,"Bingbing Wen, Jihan Yao, Shangbin Feng, Chenjun Xu, Yulia Tsvetkov, Bill Howe, Lucy Lu Wang","Abstention, the refusal of large language models (LLMs) to provide an answer, is increasingly recognized for its potential to mitigate hallucinations and enhance safety in LLM systems. In this survey, we introduce a framework to examine abstention from three perspectives: the query, the model, and human values. We organize the literature on abstention methods, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics using this framework, and discuss merits and limitations of prior work. We further identify and motivate areas for future work, centered around whether abstention can be achieved as a meta-capability that transcends specific tasks or domains, while still providing opportunities to optimize abstention abilities based on context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18418v2,2024-07
PersonaGym: Evaluating Persona Agents and LLMs,"Vinay Samuel, Henry Peng Zou, Yue Zhou, Shreyas Chaudhari, Ashwin Kalyan, Tanmay Rajpurohit, Ameet Deshpande, Karthik Narasimhan, Vishvak Murahari","Persona agents, which are LLM agents that act according to an assigned persona, have demonstrated impressive contextual response capabilities across various applications. These persona agents offer significant enhancements across diverse sectors, such as education, healthcare, and entertainment, where model developers can align agent responses to different user requirements thereby broadening the scope of agent applications. However, evaluating persona agent performance is incredibly challenging due to the complexity of assessing persona adherence in free-form interactions across various environments that are relevant to each persona agent. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for assessing persona agents, and PersonaScore, the first automated human-aligned metric grounded in decision theory for comprehensive large-scale evaluation of persona agents. Our evaluation of 6 open and closed-source LLMs, using a benchmark encompassing 200 personas and 10,000 questions, reveals significant opportunities for advancement in persona agent capabilities across state-of-the-art models. For example, Claude 3.5 Sonnet only has a 2.97% relative improvement in PersonaScore than GPT 3.5 despite being a much more advanced model. Importantly, we find that increased model size and complexity do not necessarily imply enhanced persona agent capabilities thereby highlighting the pressing need for algorithmic and architectural invention towards faithful and performant persona agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18416v3,2024-07
Exploring Bengali Religious Dialect Biases in Large Language Models with Evaluation Perspectives,"Azmine Toushik Wasi, Raima Islam, Mst Rafia Islam, Taki Hasan Rafi, Dong-Kyu Chae","While Large Language Models (LLM) have created a massive technological impact in the past decade, allowing for human-enabled applications, they can produce output that contains stereotypes and biases, especially when using low-resource languages. This can be of great ethical concern when dealing with sensitive topics such as religion. As a means toward making LLMS more fair, we explore bias from a religious perspective in Bengali, focusing specifically on two main religious dialects: Hindu and Muslim-majority dialects. Here, we perform different experiments and audit showing the comparative analysis of different sentences using three commonly used LLMs: ChatGPT, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot, pertaining to the Hindu and Muslim dialects of specific words and showcasing which ones catch the social biases and which do not. Furthermore, we analyze our findings and relate them to potential reasons and evaluation perspectives, considering their global impact with over 300 million speakers worldwide. With this work, we hope to establish the rigor for creating more fairness in LLMs, as these are widely used as creative writing agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18376v1,2024-07
Trust or Escalate: LLM Judges with Provable Guarantees for Human Agreement,"Jaehun Jung, Faeze Brahman, Yejin Choi","We present a principled approach to provide LLM-based evaluation with a rigorous guarantee of human agreement. We first propose that a reliable evaluation method should not uncritically rely on model preferences for pairwise evaluation, but rather assess the confidence of judge models and selectively decide when to trust its judgement. We then show that under this selective evaluation framework, human agreement can be provably guaranteed -- such that the model evaluation aligns with that of humans to a user-specified agreement level. As part of our framework, we also introduce Simulated Annotators, a novel confidence estimation method that significantly improves judge calibration and thus enables high coverage of evaluated instances. Finally, we propose Cascaded Selective Evaluation, where we use cheaper models as initial judges and escalate to stronger models only when necessary -- again, while still providing a provable guarantee of human agreement. Experimental results show that Cascaded Selective Evaluation guarantees strong alignment with humans, far beyond what LLM judges could achieve without selective evaluation. For example, on a subset of Chatbot Arena where GPT-4 almost never achieves 80% human agreement, our method, even while employing substantially cost-effective models such as Mistral-7B, guarantees over 80% human agreement with almost 80% test coverage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18370v1,2024-07
Robust Claim Verification Through Fact Detection,"Nazanin Jafari, James Allan","Claim verification can be a challenging task. In this paper, we present a method to enhance the robustness and reasoning capabilities of automated claim verification through the extraction of short facts from evidence. Our novel approach, FactDetect, leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate concise factual statements from evidence and label these facts based on their semantic relevance to the claim and evidence. The generated facts are then combined with the claim and evidence. To train a lightweight supervised model, we incorporate a fact-detection task into the claim verification process as a multitasking approach to improve both performance and explainability. We also show that augmenting FactDetect in the claim verification prompt enhances performance in zero-shot claim verification using LLMs. Our method demonstrates competitive results in the supervised claim verification model by 15% on the F1 score when evaluated for challenging scientific claim verification datasets. We also demonstrate that FactDetect can be augmented with claim and evidence for zero-shot prompting (AugFactDetect) in LLMs for verdict prediction. We show that AugFactDetect outperforms the baseline with statistical significance on three challenging scientific claim verification datasets with an average of 17.3% performance gain compared to the best performing baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18367v1,2024-07
Self-Training with Direct Preference Optimization Improves Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,"Tianduo Wang, Shichen Li, Wei Lu","Effective training of language models (LMs) for mathematical reasoning tasks demands high-quality supervised fine-tuning data. Besides obtaining annotations from human experts, a common alternative is sampling from larger and more powerful LMs. However, this knowledge distillation approach can be costly and unstable, particularly when relying on closed-source, proprietary LMs like GPT-4, whose behaviors are often unpredictable. In this work, we demonstrate that the reasoning abilities of small-scale LMs can be enhanced through self-training, a process where models learn from their own outputs. We also show that the conventional self-training can be further augmented by a preference learning algorithm called Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). By integrating DPO into self-training, we leverage preference data to guide LMs towards more accurate and diverse chain-of-thought reasoning. We evaluate our method across various mathematical reasoning tasks using different base models. Our experiments show that this approach not only improves LMs' reasoning performance but also offers a more cost-effective and scalable solution compared to relying on large proprietary LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18248v1,2024-07
LoRA-Pro: Are Low-Rank Adapters Properly Optimized?,"Zhengbo Wang, Jian Liang, Ran He, Zilei Wang, Tieniu Tan","Low-rank adaptation, also known as LoRA, has emerged as a prominent method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models. Despite its computational efficiency, LoRA still yields inferior performance compared to full fine-tuning. In this paper, we first uncover a fundamental connection between the optimization processes of LoRA and full fine-tuning: using LoRA for optimization is mathematically equivalent to full fine-tuning using a low-rank gradient for parameter updates. And this low-rank gradient can be expressed in terms of the gradients of the two low-rank matrices in LoRA. Leveraging this insight, we introduce LoRA-Pro, a method that enhances LoRA's performance by strategically adjusting the gradients of these low-rank matrices. This adjustment allows the low-rank gradient to more accurately approximate the full fine-tuning gradient, thereby narrowing the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the optimal solutions for adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices, applying them during fine-tuning in LoRA-Pro. We conduct extensive experiments across natural language understanding, dialogue generation, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and image classification tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-Pro substantially improves LoRA's performance, effectively narrowing the gap with full fine-tuning.

Recursive Introspection: Teaching Language Model Agents How to Self-Improve,"Yuxiao Qu, Tianjun Zhang, Naman Garg, Aviral Kumar","A central piece in enabling intelligent agentic behavior in foundation models is to make them capable of introspecting upon their behavior, reasoning, and correcting their mistakes as more computation or interaction is available. Even the strongest proprietary large language models (LLMs) do not quite exhibit the ability of continually improving their responses sequentially, even in scenarios where they are explicitly told that they are making a mistake. In this paper, we develop RISE: Recursive IntroSpEction, an approach for fine-tuning LLMs to introduce this capability, despite prior work hypothesizing that this capability may not be possible to attain. Our approach prescribes an iterative fine-tuning procedure, which attempts to teach the model how to alter its response after having executed previously unsuccessful attempts to solve a hard test-time problem, with optionally additional environment feedback. RISE poses fine-tuning for a single-turn prompt as solving a multi-turn Markov decision process (MDP), where the initial state is the prompt. Inspired by principles in online imitation learning and reinforcement learning, we propose strategies for multi-turn data collection and training so as to imbue an LLM with the capability to recursively detect and correct its previous mistakes in subsequent iterations. Our experiments show that RISE enables Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral models to improve themselves with more turns on math reasoning tasks, outperforming several single-turn strategies given an equal amount of inference-time computation. We also find that RISE scales well, often attaining larger benefits with more capable models. Our analysis shows that RISE makes meaningful improvements to responses to arrive at the correct solution for challenging prompts, without disrupting one-turn abilities as a result of expressing more complex distributions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18219v2,2024-07
Effects of Scale on Language Model Robustness,"Nikolaus Howe, Ian McKenzie, Oskar Hollinsworth, Michał Zajac, Tom Tseng, Aaron Tucker, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Adam Gleave","Language models exhibit scaling laws, whereby increasing model and dataset size yields predictable decreases in negative log likelihood, unlocking a dazzling array of capabilities. This phenomenon spurs many companies to train ever larger models in pursuit of ever improved performance. Yet, these models are vulnerable to adversarial inputs such as ``jailbreaks'' and prompt injections that induce models to perform undesired behaviors, posing a growing risk as models become more capable. Prior work indicates that computer vision models become more robust with model and data scaling, raising the question: does language model robustness also improve with scale?   We study this question empirically in the classification setting, finding that without explicit defense training, larger models tend to be modestly more robust on most tasks, though the effect is not reliable. Even with the advantage conferred by scale, undefended models remain easy to attack in absolute terms, and we thus turn our attention to explicitly training models for adversarial robustness, which we show to be a much more compute-efficient defense than scaling model size alone. In this setting, we also observe that adversarially trained larger models generalize faster and better to modified attacks not seen during training when compared with smaller models. Finally, we analyze the offense/defense balance of increasing compute, finding parity in some settings and an advantage for offense in others, suggesting that adversarial training alone is not sufficient to solve robustness, even at greater model scales.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18213v3,2024-07

El-Beltagy, Muhammed AbuOdeh","We present an overview of the FIGNEWS shared task, organized as part of the ArabicNLP 2024 conference co-located with ACL 2024. The shared task addresses bias and propaganda annotation in multilingual news posts. We focus on the early days of the Israel War on Gaza as a case study. The task aims to foster collaboration in developing annotation guidelines for subjective tasks by creating frameworks for analyzing diverse narratives highlighting potential bias and propaganda. In a spirit of fostering and encouraging diversity, we address the problem from a multilingual perspective, namely within five languages: English, French, Arabic, Hebrew, and Hindi. A total of 17 teams participated in two annotation subtasks: bias (16 teams) and propaganda (6 teams). The teams competed in four evaluation tracks: guidelines development, annotation quality, annotation quantity, and consistency. Collectively, the teams produced 129,800 data points.

Dallah: A Dialect-Aware Multimodal Large Language Model for Arabic,"Fakhraddin Alwajih, Gagan Bhatia, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed","Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in generating and understanding image-to-text content. Despite these successes, progress is predominantly limited to English due to the scarcity of high quality multimodal resources in other languages. This limitation impedes the development of competitive models in languages such as Arabic. To alleviate this situation, we introduce an efficient Arabic multimodal assistant, dubbed Dallah, that utilizes an advanced language model based on LLaMA-2 to facilitate multimodal interactions. Dallah demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Arabic MLLMs. Through fine-tuning six Arabic dialects, Dallah showcases its capability to handle complex dialectal interactions incorporating both textual and visual elements. The model excels in two benchmark tests: one evaluating its performance on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and another specifically designed to assess dialectal responses. Beyond its robust performance in multimodal interaction tasks, Dallah has the potential to pave the way for further development of dialect-aware Arabic MLLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18129v2,2024-07
Tracking linguistic information in transformer-based sentence embeddings through targeted sparsification,"Vivi Nastase, Paola Merlo","Analyses of transformer-based models have shown that they encode a variety of linguistic information from their textual input. While these analyses have shed a light on the relation between linguistic information on one side, and internal architecture and parameters on the other, a question remains unanswered: how is this linguistic information reflected in sentence embeddings? Using datasets consisting of sentences with known structure, we test to what degree information about chunks (in particular noun, verb or prepositional phrases), such as grammatical number, or semantic role, can be localized in sentence embeddings. Our results show that such information is not distributed over the entire sentence embedding, but rather it is encoded in specific regions. Understanding how the information from an input text is compressed into sentence embeddings helps understand current transformer models and help build future explainable neural models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18119v1,2024-07
PEFT-U: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for User Personalization,"Christopher Clarke, Yuzhao Heng, Lingjia Tang, Jason Mars","The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heralded a new era of human-AI interaction. These sophisticated models, exemplified by Chat-GPT and its successors, have exhibited remarkable capabilities in language understanding. However, as these LLMs have undergone exponential growth, a crucial dimension that remains understudied is the personalization of these models. Large foundation models such as GPT-3 etc. focus on creating a universal model that serves a broad range of tasks and users. This approach emphasizes the model's generalization capabilities, treating users as a collective rather than as distinct individuals. While practical for many common applications, this one-size-fits-all approach often fails to address the rich tapestry of human diversity and individual needs. To explore this issue we introduce the PEFT-U Benchmark: a new dataset for building and evaluating NLP models for user personalization. \datasetname{} consists of a series of user-centered tasks containing diverse and individualized expressions where the preferences of users can potentially differ for the same input. Using PEFT-U, we explore the challenge of efficiently personalizing LLMs to accommodate user-specific preferences in the context of diverse user-centered tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18078v1,2024-07
Difficulty Estimation and Simplification of French Text Using LLMs,"Henri Jamet, Yash Raj Shrestha, Michalis Vlachos","We leverage generative large language models for language learning applications, focusing on estimating the difficulty of foreign language texts and simplifying them to lower difficulty levels. We frame both tasks as prediction problems and develop a difficulty classification model using labeled examples, transfer learning, and large language models, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to previous approaches. For simplification, we evaluate the trade-off between simplification quality and meaning preservation, comparing zero-shot and fine-tuned performances of large language models. We show that meaningful text simplifications can be obtained with limited fine-tuning. Our experiments are conducted on French texts, but our methods are language-agnostic and directly applicable to other foreign languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18061v1,2024-07
I can listen but cannot read: An evaluation of two-tower multimodal systems for instrument recognition,"Yannis Vasilakis, Rachel Bittner, Johan Pauwels","Music two-tower multimodal systems integrate audio and text modalities into a joint audio-text space, enabling direct comparison between songs and their corresponding labels. These systems enable new approaches for classification and retrieval, leveraging both modalities. Despite the promising results they have shown for zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, closer inspection of the embeddings is needed. This paper evaluates the inherent zero-shot properties of joint audio-text spaces for the case-study of instrument recognition. We present an evaluation and analysis of two-tower systems for zero-shot instrument recognition and a detailed analysis of the properties of the pre-joint and joint embeddings spaces. Our findings suggest that audio encoders alone demonstrate good quality, while challenges remain within the text encoder or joint space projection. Specifically, two-tower systems exhibit sensitivity towards specific words, favoring generic prompts over musically informed ones. Despite the large size of textual encoders, they do not yet leverage additional textual context or infer instruments accurately from their descriptions. Lastly, a novel approach for quantifying the semantic meaningfulness of the textual space leveraging an instrument ontology is proposed. This method reveals deficiencies in the systems' understanding of instruments and provides evidence of the need for fine-tuning text encoders on musical data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18058v1,2024-07
RestoreAgent: Autonomous Image Restoration Agent via Multimodal Large Language Models,"Haoyu Chen, Wenbo Li, Jinjin Gu, Jingjing Ren, Sixiang Chen, Tian Ye, Renjing Pei, Kaiwen Zhou, Fenglong Song, Lei Zhu","Natural images captured by mobile devices often suffer from multiple types of degradation, such as noise, blur, and low light. Traditional image restoration methods require manual selection of specific tasks, algorithms, and execution sequences, which is time-consuming and may yield suboptimal results. All-in-one models, though capable of handling multiple tasks, typically support only a limited range and often produce overly smooth, low-fidelity outcomes due to their broad data distribution fitting. To address these challenges, we first define a new pipeline for restoring images with multiple degradations, and then introduce RestoreAgent, an intelligent image restoration system leveraging multimodal large language models. RestoreAgent autonomously assesses the type and extent of degradation in input images and performs restoration through (1) determining the appropriate restoration tasks, (2) optimizing the task sequence, (3) selecting the most suitable models, and (4) executing the restoration. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of RestoreAgent in handling complex degradation, surpassing human experts. Furthermore, the system modular design facilitates the fast integration of new tasks and models, enhancing its flexibility and scalability for various applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18035v1,2024-07
GermanPartiesQA: Benchmarking Commercial Large Language Models for Political Bias and Sycophancy,"Jan Batzner, Volker Stocker, Stefan Schmid, Gjergji Kasneci","LLMs are changing the way humans create and interact with content, potentially affecting citizens' political opinions and voting decisions. As LLMs increasingly shape our digital information ecosystems, auditing to evaluate biases, sycophancy, or steerability has emerged as an active field of research. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the alignment of six LLMs by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere with German party positions and evaluate sycophancy based on a prompt experiment. We contribute to evaluating political bias and sycophancy in multi-party systems across major commercial LLMs. First, we develop the benchmark dataset GermanPartiesQA based on the Voting Advice Application Wahl-o-Mat covering 10 state and 1 national elections between 2021 and 2023. In our study, we find a left-green tendency across all examined LLMs. We then conduct our prompt experiment for which we use the benchmark and sociodemographic data of leading German parliamentarians to evaluate changes in LLMs responses. To differentiate between sycophancy and steerabilty, we use 'I am [politician X], ...' and 'You are [politician X], ...' prompts. Against our expectations, we do not observe notable differences between prompting 'I am' and 'You are'. While our findings underscore that LLM responses can be ideologically steered with political personas, they suggest that observed changes in LLM outputs could be better described as personalization to the given context rather than sycophancy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18008v1,2024-07
Keep the Cost Down: A Review on Methods to Optimize LLM' s KV-Cache Consumption,"Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao","Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT's release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture's struggle with handling long texts. KV Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives.

On the Effect of Purely Synthetic Training Data for Different Automatic Speech Recognition Architectures,"Benedikt Hilmes, Nick Rossenbach, and Ralf Schlüter","In this work we evaluate the utility of synthetic data for training automatic speech recognition (ASR). We use the ASR training data to train a text-to-speech (TTS) system similar to FastSpeech-2. With this TTS we reproduce the original training data, training ASR systems solely on synthetic data. For ASR, we use three different architectures, attention-based encoder-decoder, hybrid deep neural network hidden Markov model and a Gaussian mixture hidden Markov model, showing the different sensitivity of the models to synthetic data generation. In order to extend previous work, we present a number of ablation studies on the effectiveness of synthetic vs. real training data for ASR. In particular we focus on how the gap between training on synthetic and real data changes by varying the speaker embedding or by scaling the model size. For the latter we show that the TTS models generalize well, even when training scores indicate overfitting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17997v2,2024-07
What does Kiki look like? Cross-modal associations between speech sounds and visual shapes in vision-and-language models,"Tessa Verhoef, Kiana Shahrasbi, Tom Kouwenhoven","Humans have clear cross-modal preferences when matching certain novel words to visual shapes. Evidence suggests that these preferences play a prominent role in our linguistic processing, language learning, and the origins of signal-meaning mappings. With the rise of multimodal models in AI, such as vision- and-language (VLM) models, it becomes increasingly important to uncover the kinds of visio-linguistic associations these models encode and whether they align with human representations. Informed by experiments with humans, we probe and compare four VLMs for a well-known human cross-modal preference, the bouba-kiki effect. We do not find conclusive evidence for this effect but suggest that results may depend on features of the models, such as architecture design, model size, and training details. Our findings inform discussions on the origins of the bouba-kiki effect in human cognition and future developments of VLMs that align well with human cross-modal associations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17974v1,2024-07

However, choosing the appropriate setting of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) is a labor-intensive and computationally expensive process. Here, we provide recommended HP configurations for practical use-cases that represent a better starting point for practitioners, when considering two SOTA LLMs and two commonly used tuning methods. We describe Coverage-based Search (CBS), a process for ranking HP configurations based on an offline extensive grid search, such that the top ranked configurations collectively provide a practical robust recommendation for a wide range of datasets and domains. We focus our experiments on Llama-3-8B and Mistral-7B, as well as full fine-tuning and LoRa, conducting a total of > 10,000 tuning experiments. Our results suggest that, in general, Llama-3-8B and LoRA should be preferred, when possible. Moreover, we show that for both models and tuning methods, exploring only a few HP configurations, as recommended by our analysis, can provide excellent results in practice, making this work a valuable resource for practitioners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18990v2,2024-07
The Curious Case of Representational Alignment: Unravelling Visio-Linguistic Tasks in Emergent Communication,"Tom Kouwenhoven, Max Peeperkorn, Bram van Dijk, Tessa Verhoef","Natural language has the universal properties of being compositional and grounded in reality. The emergence of linguistic properties is often investigated through simulations of emergent communication in referential games. However, these experiments have yielded mixed results compared to similar experiments addressing linguistic properties of human language. Here we address representational alignment as a potential contributing factor to these results. Specifically, we assess the representational alignment between agent image representations and between agent representations and input images. Doing so, we confirm that the emergent language does not appear to encode human-like conceptual visual features, since agent image representations drift away from inputs whilst inter-agent alignment increases. We moreover identify a strong relationship between inter-agent alignment and topographic similarity, a common metric for compositionality, and address its consequences. To address these issues, we introduce an alignment penalty that prevents representational drift but interestingly does not improve performance on a compositional discrimination task. Together, our findings emphasise the key role representational alignment plays in simulations of language emergence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17960v1,2024-07
Positive Text Reframing under Multi-strategy Optimization,"Shutong Jia, Biwei Cao, Qingqing Gao, Jiuxin Cao, Bo Liu","Differing from sentiment transfer, positive reframing seeks to substitute negative perspectives with positive expressions while preserving the original meaning. With the emergence of pre-trained language models (PLMs), it is possible to achieve acceptable results by fine-tuning PLMs. Nevertheless, generating fluent, diverse and task-constrained reframing text remains a significant challenge. To tackle this issue, a \textbf{m}ulti-\textbf{s}trategy \textbf{o}ptimization \textbf{f}ramework (MSOF) is proposed in this paper. Starting from the objective of positive reframing, we first design positive sentiment reward and content preservation reward to encourage the model to transform the negative expressions of the original text while ensuring the integrity and consistency of the semantics. Then, different decoding optimization approaches are introduced to improve the quality of text generation. Finally, based on the modeling formula of positive reframing, we propose a multi-dimensional re-ranking method that further selects candidate sentences from three dimensions: strategy consistency, text similarity and fluency.

We compare representatives of four different explainability approaches, i.e., gradient-based, perturbation-based, attention-based, and prototype-based approaches, and analyze them quantitatively with an ablation study and qualitatively in a user study. Results show that perturbation-based explainability performs best, followed by gradient-based and attention-based explainability. Prototypebased experiments did not yield useful results. Overall, we observe that explainability strongly supports the users in better understanding the model predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20274v1,2024-07
Modelling Multimodal Integration in Human Concept Processing with Vision-and-Language Models,"Anna Bavaresco, Marianne de Heer Kloots, Sandro Pezzelle, Raquel Fernández","Representations from deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven remarkably predictive of neural activity involved in both visual and linguistic processing. Despite these successes, most studies to date concern unimodal DNNs, encoding either visual or textual input but not both. Yet, there is growing evidence that human meaning representations integrate linguistic and sensory-motor information. Here we investigate whether the integration of multimodal information operated by current vision-and-language DNN models (VLMs) leads to representations that are more aligned with human brain activity than those obtained by language-only and vision-only DNNs. We focus on fMRI responses recorded while participants read concept words in the context of either a full sentence or an accompanying picture. Our results reveal that VLM representations correlate more strongly than language- and vision-only DNNs with activations in brain areas functionally related to language processing. A comparison between different types of visuo-linguistic architectures shows that recent generative VLMs tend to be less brain-aligned than previous architectures with lower performance on downstream applications. Moreover, through an additional analysis comparing brain vs. behavioural alignment across multiple VLMs, we show that -- with one remarkable exception -- representations that strongly align with behavioural judgments do not correlate highly with brain responses. This indicates that brain similarity does not go hand in hand with behavioural similarity, and vice versa.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17914v1,2024-07
The Power of Combining Data and Knowledge: GPT-4o is an Effective Interpreter of Machine Learning Models in Predicting Lymph Node Metastasis of Lung Cancer,"Danqing Hu, Bing Liu, Xiaofeng Zhu, Nan Wu","Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a crucial factor in determining the initial treatment for patients with lung cancer, yet accurate preoperative diagnosis of LNM remains challenging. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their remarkable text generation capabilities. Leveraging the extensive medical knowledge learned from vast corpora, LLMs can estimate probabilities for clinical problems, though their performance has historically been inferior to data-driven machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble method that combines the medical knowledge acquired by LLMs with the latent patterns identified by machine learning models to enhance LNM prediction performance. Initially, we developed machine learning models using patient data. We then designed a prompt template to integrate the patient data with the predicted probability from the machine learning model. Subsequently, we instructed GPT-4o, the most advanced LLM developed by OpenAI, to estimate the likelihood of LNM based on patient data and then adjust the estimate using the machine learning output. Finally, we collected three outputs from the GPT-4o using the same prompt and ensembled these results as the final prediction. Using the proposed method, our models achieved an AUC value of 0.778 and an AP value of 0.426 for LNM prediction, significantly improving predictive performance compared to baseline machine learning models. The experimental results indicate that GPT-4o can effectively leverage its medical knowledge and the probabilities predicted by machine learning models to achieve more accurate LNM predictions. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can perform well in clinical risk prediction tasks, offering a new paradigm for integrating medical knowledge and patient data in clinical predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17900v5,2024-07
A Large-Scale Sensitivity Analysis on Latent Embeddings and Dimensionality Reductions for Text Spatializations,"Daniel Atzberger, Tim Cech, Willy Scheibel, Jürgen Döllner, Michael Behrisch, Tobias Schreck","The semantic similarity between documents of a text corpus can be visualized using map-like metaphors based on two-dimensional scatterplot layouts. These layouts result from a dimensionality reduction on the document-term matrix or a representation within a latent embedding, including topic models. Thereby, the resulting layout depends on the input data and hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction and is therefore affected by changes in them. Furthermore, the resulting layout is affected by changes in the input data and hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction. However, such changes to the layout require additional cognitive efforts from the user. In this work, we present a sensitivity study that analyzes the stability of these layouts concerning (1) changes in the text corpora, (2) changes in the hyperparameter, and (3) randomness in the initialization. Our approach has two stages: data measurement and data analysis. First, we derived layouts for the combination of three text corpora and six text embeddings and a grid-search-inspired hyperparameter selection of the dimensionality reductions. Afterward, we quantified the similarity of the layouts through ten metrics, concerning local and global structures and class separation. Second, we analyzed the resulting 42817 tabular data points in a descriptive statistical analysis. From this, we derived guidelines for informed decisions on the layout algorithm and highlight specific hyperparameter settings. We provide our implementation as a Git repository at https://github.com/hpicgs/Topic-Models-and-Dimensionality-Reduction-Sensitivity-Study and results as Zenodo archive at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12772898.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17876v1,2024-07
Improving Domain-Specific ASR with LLM-Generated Contextual Descriptions,"Jiwon Suh, Injae Na, Woohwan Jung","End-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E ASR) systems have significantly improved speech recognition through training on extensive datasets. Despite these advancements, they still struggle to accurately recognize domain specific words, such as proper nouns and technical terminologies. To address this problem, we propose a method to utilize the state-of-the-art Whisper without modifying its architecture, preserving its generalization performance while enabling it to leverage descriptions effectively. Moreover, we propose two additional training techniques to improve the domain specific ASR: decoder fine-tuning, and context perturbation. We also propose a method to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate descriptions with simple metadata, when descriptions are unavailable. Our experiments demonstrate that proposed methods notably enhance domain-specific ASR accuracy on real-life datasets, with LLM-generated descriptions outperforming human-crafted ones in effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17874v1,2024-07
Is the Digital Forensics and Incident Response Pipeline Ready for Text-Based Threats in LLM Era?,"Avanti Bhandarkar, Ronald Wilson, Anushka Swarup, Mengdi Zhu, Damon Woodard","In the era of generative AI, the widespread adoption of Neural Text Generators (NTGs) presents new cybersecurity challenges, particularly within the realms of Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). These challenges primarily involve the detection and attribution of sources behind advanced attacks like spearphishing and disinformation campaigns. As NTGs evolve, the task of distinguishing between human and NTG-authored texts becomes critically complex. This paper rigorously evaluates the DFIR pipeline tailored for text-based security systems, specifically focusing on the challenges of detecting and attributing authorship of NTG-authored texts. By introducing a novel human-NTG co-authorship text attack, termed CS-ACT, our study uncovers significant vulnerabilities in traditional DFIR methodologies, highlighting discrepancies between ideal scenarios and real-world conditions. Utilizing 14 diverse datasets and 43 unique NTGs, up to the latest GPT-4, our research identifies substantial vulnerabilities in the forensic profiling phase, particularly in attributing authorship to NTGs. Our comprehensive evaluation points to factors such as model sophistication and the lack of distinctive style within NTGs as significant contributors for these vulnerabilities. Our findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated and adaptable strategies, such as incorporating adversarial learning, stylizing NTGs, and implementing hierarchical attribution through the mapping of NTG lineages to enhance source attribution. This sets the stage for future research and the development of more resilient text-based security systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17870v1,2024-07
Financial Statement Analysis with Large Language Models,"Alex Kim, Maximilian Muhn, Valeri Nikolaev","We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can successfully perform financial statement analysis in a way similar to a professional human analyst. We provide standardized and anonymous financial statements to GPT4 and instruct the model to analyze them to determine the direction of firms' future earnings. Even without narrative or industry-specific information, the LLM outperforms financial analysts in its ability to predict earnings changes directionally. The LLM exhibits a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle. Furthermore, we find that the prediction accuracy of the LLM is on par with a narrowly trained state-of-the-art ML model. LLM prediction does not stem from its training memory. Instead, we find that the LLM generates useful narrative insights about a company's future performance. Lastly, our trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield a higher Sharpe ratio and alphas than strategies based on other models. Our results suggest that LLMs may take a central role in analysis and decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17866v2,2024-07

We report results of our methods on four commonly used intent classification datasets and compare against previous works of a similar nature. Our work shows promising results for dataless classification scaling to a large number of unseen intents. We show competitive results and significant improvements (+6.12\% Avg.) over strong zero-shot baselines, all without training on labelled or task-specific data. Furthermore, we provide qualitative error analysis of the shortfalls of this methodology to help guide future research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17862v1,2024-07
Shapley Value-based Contrastive Alignment for Multimodal Information Extraction,"Wen Luo, Yu Xia, Shen Tianshu, Sujian Li","The rise of social media and the exponential growth of multimodal communication necessitates advanced techniques for Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE). However, existing methodologies primarily rely on direct Image-Text interactions, a paradigm that often faces significant challenges due to semantic and modality gaps between images and text. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm of Image-Context-Text interaction, where large multimodal models (LMMs) are utilized to generate descriptive textual context to bridge these gaps. In line with this paradigm, we propose a novel Shapley Value-based Contrastive Alignment (Shap-CA) method, which aligns both context-text and context-image pairs. Shap-CA initially applies the Shapley value concept from cooperative game theory to assess the individual contribution of each element in the set of contexts, texts and images towards total semantic and modality overlaps. Following this quantitative evaluation, a contrastive learning strategy is employed to enhance the interactive contribution within context-text/image pairs, while minimizing the influence across these pairs. Furthermore, we design an adaptive fusion module for selective cross-modal fusion. Extensive experiments across four MIE datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17854v1,2024-07
Scaling A Simple Approach to Zero-Shot Speech Recognition,"Jinming Zhao, Vineel Pratap, Michael Auli","Despite rapid progress in increasing the language coverage of automatic speech recognition, the field is still far from covering all languages with a known writing script. Recent work showed promising results with a zero-shot approach requiring only a small amount of text data, however, accuracy heavily depends on the quality of the used phonemizer which is often weak for unseen languages. In this paper, we present MMS Zero-shot a conceptually simpler approach based on romanization and an acoustic model trained on data in 1,078 different languages or three orders of magnitude more than prior art. MMS Zero-shot reduces the average character error rate by a relative 46% over 100 unseen languages compared to the best previous work. Moreover, the error rate of our approach is only 2.5x higher compared to in-domain supervised baselines, while our approach uses no labeled data for the evaluation languages at all.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17852v1,2024-07
Innovative Speech-Based Deep Learning Approaches for Parkinson's Disease Classification: A Systematic Review,"Lisanne van Gelderen, Cristian Tejedor-García","Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, frequently presents with early-stage speech impairments. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning (DL), have significantly enhanced PD diagnosis through the analysis of speech data. Nevertheless, the progress of research is restricted by the limited availability of publicly accessible speech-based PD datasets, primarily due to privacy concerns. The goal of this systematic review is to explore the current landscape of speech-based DL approaches for PD classification, based on 33 scientific works published between January 2020 and March 2024. We discuss their available resources, capabilities, and potential limitations, and issues related to bias, explainability, and privacy. Furthermore, this review provides an overview of publicly accessible speech-based datasets and open-source material for PD. The DL approaches identified are categorized into end-to-end (E2E) learning, transfer learning (TL), and deep acoustic feature extraction (DAFE). Among E2E approaches, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are prevalent, though Transformers are increasingly popular. E2E approaches face challenges such as limited data and computational resources, especially with Transformers. TL addresses these issues by providing more robust PD diagnosis and better generalizability across languages. DAFE aims to improve the explainability and interpretability of results by examining the specific effects of deep features on both other DL approaches and more traditional machine learning (ML) methods. However, it often underperforms compared to E2E and TL approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17844v4,2024-07
An Efficient Inference Framework for Early-exit Large Language Models,"Ruijie Miao, Yihan Yan, Xinshuo Yao, Tong Yang","Building efficient inference framework has gained increasing interests for research community. Early-exit models, a variant of LLMs, improves the inference efficiency of LLMs by skipping rest layers and directly generate output tokens when they are confident enough. However, there is no work of LLM inference framework that takes early-exit models into consideration. This is non-trivial as prior art on LLM inference cannot be directly applied to early-exit models. In this work, we solves two key challenges in building efficient inference framework for early-exit models: (1) batch inference at iteration-level granularity; and (2) KV cache management. For the former, we propose to process the batch until all sequences surpass the early-exit confidence threshold. For the latter, we propose to fill the KV cache of rest layers before the iteration terminates. Our evaluation shows that, compared with the original vLLM operating at full layers, our solution achieves up to 1.25x speed up.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20272v1,2024-07
Unified Lexical Representation for Interpretable Visual-Language Alignment,"Yifan Li, Yikai Wang, Yanwei Fu, Dongyu Ru, Zheng Zhang, Tong He","Visual-Language Alignment (VLA) has gained a lot of attention since CLIP's groundbreaking work. Although CLIP performs well, the typical direct latent feature alignment lacks clarity in its representation and similarity scores. On the other hand, lexical representation, a vector whose element represents the similarity between the sample and a word from the vocabulary, is a natural sparse representation and interpretable, providing exact matches for individual words. However, lexical representations are difficult to learn due to no ground-truth supervision and false-discovery issues, and thus requires complex design to train effectively. In this paper, we introduce LexVLA, a more interpretable VLA framework by learning a unified lexical representation for both modalities without complex design. We use DINOv2 as our visual model for its local-inclined features and Llama 2, a generative language model, to leverage its in-context lexical prediction ability. To avoid the false discovery, we propose an overuse penalty to refrain the lexical representation from falsely frequently activating meaningless words. We demonstrate that these two pre-trained uni-modal models can be well-aligned by fine-tuning on the modest multi-modal dataset and avoid intricate training configurations. On cross-modal retrieval benchmarks, LexVLA, trained on the CC-12M multi-modal dataset, outperforms baselines fine-tuned on larger datasets (e.g., YFCC15M) and those trained from scratch on even bigger datasets (e.g., 1.1B data, including CC-12M). We conduct extensive experiments to analyze LexVLA. Codes are available at https://github.com/Clementine24/LexVLA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17827v2,2024-07
Demystifying Verbatim Memorization in Large Language Models,"Jing Huang, Diyi Yang, Christopher Potts","Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently memorize long sequences verbatim, often with serious legal and privacy implications. Much prior work has studied such verbatim memorization using observational data. To complement such work, we develop a framework to study verbatim memorization in a controlled setting by continuing pre-training from Pythia checkpoints with injected sequences. We find that (1) non-trivial amounts of repetition are necessary for verbatim memorization to happen; (2) later (and presumably better) checkpoints are more likely to verbatim memorize sequences, even for out-of-distribution sequences; (3) the generation of memorized sequences is triggered by distributed model states that encode high-level features and makes important use of general language modeling capabilities. Guided by these insights, we develop stress tests to evaluate unlearning methods and find they often fail to remove the verbatim memorized information, while also degrading the LM. Overall, these findings challenge the hypothesis that verbatim memorization stems from specific model weights or mechanisms. Rather, verbatim memorization is intertwined with the LM's general capabilities and thus will be very difficult to isolate and suppress without degrading model quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17817v1,2024-07
Learn while Unlearn: An Iterative Unlearning Framework for Generative Language Models,"Haoyu Tang, Ye Liu, Xukai Liu, Kai Zhang, Yanghai Zhang, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen","Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have led to the development of sophisticated models trained on extensive datasets, yet raising concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based unlearning techniques. Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods require access to the original training data, which is often inaccessible. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bear the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to remove specific knowledge through an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically assess the unlearning extent on specific data pieces and make iterative update. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20271v2,2024-07
Closing the gap between open-source and commercial large language models for medical evidence summarization,"Gongbo Zhang, Qiao Jin, Yiliang Zhou, Song Wang, Betina R. Idnay, Yiming Luo, Elizabeth Park, Jordan G. Nestor, Matthew E. Spotnitz, Ali Soroush, Thomas Campion, Zhiyong Lu, Chunhua Weng, Yifan Peng","Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise in summarizing medical evidence. Most recent studies focus on the application of proprietary LLMs. Using proprietary LLMs introduces multiple risk factors, including a lack of transparency and vendor dependency. While open-source LLMs allow better transparency and customization, their performance falls short compared to proprietary ones. In this study, we investigated to what extent fine-tuning open-source LLMs can further improve their performance in summarizing medical evidence. Utilizing a benchmark dataset, MedReview, consisting of 8,161 pairs of systematic reviews and summaries, we fine-tuned three broadly-used, open-sourced LLMs, namely PRIMERA, LongT5, and Llama-2. Overall, the fine-tuned LLMs obtained an increase of 9.89 in ROUGE-L (95% confidence interval: 8.94-10.81), 13.21 in METEOR score (95% confidence interval: 12.05-14.37), and 15.82 in CHRF score (95% confidence interval: 13.89-16.44). The performance of fine-tuned LongT5 is close to GPT-3.5 with zero-shot settings. Furthermore, smaller fine-tuned models sometimes even demonstrated superior performance compared to larger zero-shot models. The above trends of improvement were also manifested in both human and GPT4-simulated evaluations. Our results can be applied to guide model selection for tasks demanding particular domain knowledge, such as medical evidence summarization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00588v1,2024-07
KiVA: Kid-inspired Visual Analogies for Testing Large Multimodal Models,"Eunice Yiu, Maan Qraitem, Charlie Wong, Anisa Noor Majhi, Yutong Bai, Shiry Ginosar, Alison Gopnik, Kate Saenko","This paper investigates visual analogical reasoning in large multimodal models (LMMs) compared to human adults and children. A ""visual analogy"" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 1,400 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children and adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while models like GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the ""what"" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the ""how"" and extrapolating this rule to new objects. In contrast, children and adults exhibit much stronger analogical reasoning at all three stages. Additionally, the strongest tested model, GPT-4V, performs better in tasks involving simple visual attributes like color and size, correlating with quicker human adult response times. Conversely, more complex tasks such as number, rotation, and reflection, which necessitate extensive cognitive processing and understanding of the 3D physical world, present more significant challenges. Altogether, these findings highlight the limitations of training models on data that primarily consists of 2D images and text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17773v1,2024-07

Banyan: Improved Representation Learning with Explicit Structure,"Mattia Opper, N. Siddharth","We present Banyan, an improved model to learn semantic representations by inducing explicit structure over data. In contrast to prior approaches using structure spanning single sentences, Banyan learns by resolving multiple constituent structures into a shared one explicitly incorporating global context. Combined with an improved message-passing scheme inspired by Griffin, Banyan learns significantly better representations, avoids spurious false negatives with contrastive learning, and drastically improves memory efficiency in such explicit-structured models. Using the Self-StrAE framework, we show that Banyan (a) outperforms baselines using sentential structure across various settings (b) matches or outperforms unstructured baselines like GloVe (+augmentations) and a RoBERTa medium (+simcse) pre-trained on 100M tokens, despite having just a handful of (non-embedding) parameters, and (c) also learns effective representations across several low resource (Asian and African) languages as measured on SemRel tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17771v1,2024-07

BotEval balances flexibility for customization and user-friendliness by providing templates for common use cases that span various degrees of complexity and built-in compatibility with popular crowdsourcing platforms.

Beyond Entity Alignment: Towards Complete Knowledge Graph Alignment via Entity-Relation Synergy,"Xiaohan Fang, Chaozhuo Li, Yi Zhao, Qian Zang, Litian Zhang, Jiquan Peng, Xi Zhang, Jibing Gong","Knowledge Graph Alignment (KGA) aims to integrate knowledge from multiple sources to address the limitations of individual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in terms of coverage and depth. However, current KGA models fall short in achieving a ``complete'' knowledge graph alignment. Existing models primarily emphasize the linkage of cross-graph entities but overlook aligning relations across KGs, thereby providing only a partial solution to KGA. The semantic correlations embedded in relations are largely overlooked, potentially restricting a comprehensive understanding of cross-KG signals. In this paper, we propose to conceptualize relation alignment as an independent task and conduct KGA by decomposing it into two distinct but highly correlated sub-tasks: entity alignment and relation alignment. To capture the mutually reinforcing correlations between these objectives, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization-based model, EREM, which iteratively optimizes both sub-tasks. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that EREM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both entity alignment and relation alignment tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17745v1,2024-07
Cost-effective Instruction Learning for Pathology Vision and Language Analysis,"Kaitao Chen, Mianxin Liu, Fang Yan, Lei Ma, Xiaoming Shi, Lilong Wang, Xiaosong Wang, Lifeng Zhu, Zhe Wang, Mu Zhou, Shaoting Zhang","The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17734v1,2024-07
Are Large Language Models Possible to Conduct Cognitive Behavioral Therapy?,"Hao Shen, Zihan Li, Minqiang Yang, Minghui Ni, Yongfeng Tao, Zhengyang Yu, Weihao Zheng, Chen Xu, Bin Hu","In contemporary society, the issue of psychological health has become increasingly prominent, characterized by the diversification, complexity, and universality of mental disorders. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), currently the most influential and clinically effective psychological treatment method with no side effects, has limited coverage and poor quality in most countries. In recent years, researches on the recognition and intervention of emotional disorders using large language models (LLMs) have been validated, providing new possibilities for psychological assistance therapy. However, are LLMs truly possible to conduct cognitive behavioral therapy? Many concerns have been raised by mental health experts regarding the use of LLMs for therapy. Seeking to answer this question, we collected real CBT corpus from online video websites, designed and conducted a targeted automatic evaluation framework involving the evaluation of emotion tendency of generated text, structured dialogue pattern and proactive inquiry ability. For emotion tendency, we calculate the emotion tendency score of the CBT dialogue text generated by each model. For structured dialogue pattern, we use a diverse range of automatic evaluation metrics to compare speaking style, the ability to maintain consistency of topic and the use of technology in CBT between different models . As for inquiring to guide the patient, we utilize PQA (Proactive Questioning Ability) metric. We also evaluated the CBT ability of the LLM after integrating a CBT knowledge base to explore the help of introducing additional knowledge to enhance the model's CBT counseling ability. Four LLM variants with excellent performance on natural language processing are evaluated, and the experimental result shows the great potential of LLMs in psychological counseling realm, especially after combining with other technological means.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17730v1,2024-07
Multi-group Uncertainty Quantification for Long-form Text Generation,"Terrance Liu, Zhiwei Steven Wu","While large language models are rapidly moving towards consumer-facing applications, they are often still prone to factual errors and hallucinations. In order to reduce the potential harms that may come from these errors, it is important for users to know to what extent they can trust an LLM when it makes a factual claim. To this end, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification of factual correctness in long-form natural language generation. Given some output from a large language model, we study both uncertainty at the level of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and uncertainty across the entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Moreover, we invoke multicalibration and multivalid conformal prediction to ensure that such uncertainty guarantees are valid both marginally and across distinct groups of prompts. Using the task of biography generation, we demonstrate empirically that having access to and making use of additional group attributes for each prompt improves both overall and group-wise performance. As the problems of calibration, conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively explored previously in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these empirical results to form a benchmark for this setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21057v1,2024-07
Describe Where You Are: Improving Noise-Robustness for Speech Emotion Recognition with Text Description of the Environment,"Seong-Gyun Leem, Daniel Fulford, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, David Gard, Carlos Busso","Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often struggle in real-world environments, where ambient noise severely degrades their performance. This paper explores a novel approach that exploits prior knowledge of testing environments to maximize SER performance under noisy conditions. To address this task, we propose a text-guided, environment-aware training where an SER model is trained with contaminated speech samples and their paired noise description. We use a pre-trained text encoder to extract the text-based environment embedding and then fuse it to a transformer-based SER model during training and inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through our experiment with the MSP-Podcast corpus and real-world additive noise samples collected from the Freesound repository. Our experiment indicates that the text-based environment descriptions processed by a large language model (LLM) produce representations that improve the noise-robustness of the SER system. In addition, our proposed approach with an LLM yields better performance than our environment-agnostic baselines, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. When testing at -5dB SNR level, our proposed method shows better performance than our best baseline model by 31.8 % (arousal), 23.5% (dominance), and 9.5% (valence).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17716v1,2024-07
Enhancing Agent Learning through World Dynamics Modeling,"Zhiyuan Sun, Haochen Shi, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Glen Berseth, Xingdi Yuan, Bang Liu","Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to tasks in language understanding and interactive decision-making, with their impressive performance largely attributed to the extensive domain knowledge embedded within them. However, the depth and breadth of this knowledge can vary across domains. Many existing approaches assume that LLMs possess a comprehensive understanding of their environment, often overlooking potential gaps in their grasp of actual world dynamics. To address this, we introduce Discover, Verify, and Evolve (DiVE), a framework that discovers world dynamics from a small number of demonstrations, verifies the accuracy of these dynamics, and evolves new, advanced dynamics tailored to the current situation. Through extensive evaluations, we assess the impact of each component on performance and compare the dynamics generated by DiVE to human-annotated dynamics. Our results show that LLMs guided by DiVE make more informed decisions, achieving rewards comparable to human players in the Crafter environment and surpassing methods that require prior task-specific training in the MiniHack environment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17695v2,2024-07
Examining the Influence of Political Bias on Large Language Model Performance in Stance Classification,"Lynnette Hui Xian Ng, Iain Cruickshank, Roy Ka-Wei Lee","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in executing tasks based on natural language queries. However, these models, trained on curated datasets, inherently embody biases ranging from racial to national and gender biases. It remains uncertain whether these biases impact the performance of LLMs for certain tasks. In this study, we investigate the political biases of LLMs within the stance classification task, specifically examining whether these models exhibit a tendency to more accurately classify politically-charged stances. Utilizing three datasets, seven LLMs, and four distinct prompting schemes, we analyze the performance of LLMs on politically oriented statements and targets. Our findings reveal a statistically significant difference in the performance of LLMs across various politically oriented stance classification tasks. Furthermore, we observe that this difference primarily manifests at the dataset level, with models and prompting schemes showing statistically similar performances across different stance classification datasets. Lastly, we observe that when there is greater ambiguity in the target the statement is directed towards, LLMs have poorer stance classification accuracy.

Transformers on Markov Data: Constant Depth Suffices,"Nived Rajaraman, Marco Bondaschi, Kannan Ramchandran, Michael Gastpar, Ashok Vardhan Makkuva","Attention-based transformers have been remarkably successful at modeling generative processes across various domains and modalities. In this paper, we study the behavior of transformers on data drawn from \kth Markov processes, where the conditional distribution of the next symbol in a sequence depends on the previous $k$ symbols observed. We observe a surprising phenomenon empirically which contradicts previous findings: when trained for sufficiently long, a transformer with a fixed depth and $1$ head per layer is able to achieve low test loss on sequences drawn from \kth Markov sources, even as $k$ grows. Furthermore, this low test loss is achieved by the transformer's ability to represent and learn the in-context conditional empirical distribution. On the theoretical side, our main result is that a transformer with a single head and three layers can represent the in-context conditional empirical distribution for \kth Markov sources, concurring with our empirical observations. Along the way, we prove that \textit{attention-only} transformers with $O(\log_2(k))$ layers can represent the in-context conditional empirical distribution by composing induction heads to track the previous $k$ symbols in the sequence. These results provide more insight into our current understanding of the mechanisms by which transformers learn to capture context, by understanding their behavior on Markov sources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17686v1,2024-07
S2-Attention: Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads,"Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Suyu Ge, Liliang Ren, Barun Patra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Hao Peng, Xia Song","Sparse attention, which selectively attends to a subset of tokens in the context was supposed to be efficient. However, its theoretical reduction in FLOPs has rarely translated into wall-clock speed-up over its dense attention counterparts due to the lack of hardware-aware optimizations like FlashAttention. Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether sparse attention can maintain the model's quality at a scale of today's large language models (LLMs) and how. This paper presents Sparsely-Sharded(S2) Attention, a Triton library that provides kernel optimization for sparse attention customizable at both per-head and per-context-range levels. S2-Attention enables the exploration of novel and high-performance sparse attention techniques, which we demonstrate through extensive ablations across a wide range of sparse attention designs at various model scales. From these insights, we present several basic guidelines to design sparse attention that can achieve not only practical efficiency improvements, but also strong downstream performance. To achieve high parallelization and optimized memory IO, sparse attention should shard the context heterogeneously across attention heads, where each head attends to a different subset of tokens while collectively covering the full context. Meanwhile, we find hybrid architectures combining sparse and dense attention particularly beneficial in practice. S2-Attention achieves wall-clock speedup of 8.79X, 15.87X, 25.3X compared to the strong FlashAttention-2 baseline with strong downstream performance on-par with full attention and perfect retrieval performance at a 128k context length. At inference, for 7B models, our model, with the help of our S2-Attention kernel, achieves 4.5x speed-up compared to dense counterparts. S2-Attention is released with easy-to-customize APIs for direct usage in Megatron and vLLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17678v5,2024-07
Time Matters: Examine Temporal Effects on Biomedical Language Models,"Weisi Liu, Zhe He, Xiaolei Huang","Time roots in applying language models for biomedical applications: models are trained on historical data and will be deployed for new or future data, which may vary from training data. While increasing biomedical tasks have employed state-of-the-art language models, there are very few studies have examined temporal effects on biomedical models when data usually shifts across development and deployment. This study fills the gap by statistically probing relations between language model performance and data shifts across three biomedical tasks. We deploy diverse metrics to evaluate model performance, distance methods to measure data drifts, and statistical methods to quantify temporal effects on biomedical language models. Our study shows that time matters for deploying biomedical language models, while the degree of performance degradation varies by biomedical tasks and statistical quantification approaches. We believe this study can establish a solid benchmark to evaluate and assess temporal effects on deploying biomedical language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17638v2,2024-07
"IgnitionInnovators at ""Discharge Me!"": Chain-of-Thought Instruction Finetuning Large Language Models for Discharge Summaries","An Quang Tang, Xiuzhen Zhang, Minh Ngoc Dinh","This paper presents our proposed approach to the Discharge Me! shared task, collocated with the 23th Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP).

By streamlining the recent instruction-finetuning process on LLMs, we explore several prompting strategies for optimally adapting LLMs to specific generation task of DSD. Experimental results show that providing a clear output structure, complimented by a set of comprehensive Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) questions, effectively improves the model's reasoning capability, and thereby, enhancing the structural correctness and faithfulness of clinical information in the generated text.

Forecasting Credit Ratings: A Case Study where Traditional Methods Outperform Generative LLMs,"Felix Drinkall, Janet B. Pierrehumbert, Stefan Zohren","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to perform well for many downstream tasks. Transfer learning can enable LLMs to acquire skills that were not targeted during pre-training. In financial contexts, LLMs can sometimes beat well-established benchmarks. This paper investigates how well LLMs perform in the task of forecasting corporate credit ratings. We show that while LLMs are very good at encoding textual information, traditional methods are still very competitive when it comes to encoding numeric and multimodal data. For our task, current LLMs perform worse than a more traditional XGBoost architecture that combines fundamental and macroeconomic data with high-density text-based embedding features.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17624v2,2024-07
Coupling Speech Encoders with Downstream Text Models,"Ciprian Chelba, Johan Schalkwyk","We present a modular approach to building cascade speech translation (AST) models that guarantees that the resulting model performs no worse than the 1-best cascade baseline while preserving state-of-the-art speech recognition (ASR) and text translation (MT) performance for a given task. Our novel contribution is the use of an ``exporter'' layer that is trained under L2-loss to ensure a strong match between ASR embeddings and the MT token embeddings for the 1-best sequence. The ``exporter'' output embeddings are fed directly to the MT model in lieu of 1-best token embeddings, thus guaranteeing that the resulting model performs no worse than the 1-best cascade baseline, while allowing back-propagation gradient to flow from the MT model into the ASR components. The matched-embeddings cascade architecture provide a significant improvement over its 1-best counterpart in scenarios where incremental training of the MT model is not an option and yet we seek to improve quality by leveraging (speech, transcription, translated transcription) data provided with the AST task. The gain disappears when the MT model is incrementally trained on the parallel text data available with the AST task. The approach holds promise for other scenarios that seek to couple ASR encoders and immutable text models, such at large language models (LLM).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17605v1,2024-07
I Could've Asked That: Reformulating Unanswerable Questions,"Wenting Zhao, Ge Gao, Claire Cardie, Alexander M. Rush","When seeking information from unfamiliar documents, users frequently pose questions that cannot be answered by the documents. While existing large language models (LLMs) identify these unanswerable questions, they do not assist users in reformulating their questions, thereby reducing their overall utility. We curate CouldAsk, an evaluation benchmark composed of existing and new datasets for document-grounded question answering, specifically designed to study reformulating unanswerable questions. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs on CouldAsk. The results demonstrate the limited capabilities of these models in reformulating questions. Specifically, GPT-4 and Llama2-7B successfully reformulate questions only 26% and 12% of the time, respectively. Error analysis shows that 62% of the unsuccessful reformulations stem from the models merely rephrasing the questions or even generating identical questions.

To bridge this gap, we introduce WildHallucinations, a benchmark that evaluates factuality. It does so by prompting LLMs to generate information about entities mined from user-chatbot conversations in the wild. These generations are then automatically fact-checked against a systematically curated knowledge source collected from web search. Notably, half of these real-world entities do not have associated Wikipedia pages. We evaluate 118,785 generations from 15 LLMs on 7,919 entities. We find that LLMs consistently hallucinate more on entities without Wikipedia pages and exhibit varying hallucination rates across different domains. Finally, given the same base models, adding a retrieval component only slightly reduces hallucinations but does not eliminate hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17468v1,2024-07
CMR Scaling Law: Predicting Critical Mixture Ratios for Continual Pre-training of Language Models,"Jiawei Gu, Zacc Yang, Chuanghao Ding, Rui Zhao, Fei Tan","Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in diverse tasks but often underperform in specialized fields due to limited domain-specific or proprietary corpus. Continual pre-training (CPT) enhances LLM capabilities by imbuing new domain-specific or proprietary knowledge while replaying general corpus to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The data mixture ratio of general corpus and domain-specific corpus, however, has been chosen heuristically, leading to sub-optimal training efficiency in practice. In this context, we attempt to re-visit the scaling behavior of LLMs under the hood of CPT, and discover a power-law relationship between loss, mixture ratio, and training tokens scale. We formalize the trade-off between general and domain-specific capabilities, leading to a well-defined Critical Mixture Ratio (CMR) of general and domain data. By striking the balance, CMR maintains the model's general ability and achieves the desired domain transfer, ensuring the highest utilization of available resources. Considering the balance between efficiency and effectiveness, CMR can be regarded as the optimal mixture ratio. Through extensive experiments, we ascertain the predictability of CMR, propose CMR scaling law and have substantiated its generalization. These findings offer practical guidelines for optimizing LLM training in specialized domains, ensuring both general and domain-specific performance while efficiently managing training resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17467v2,2024-07
Exploring Domain Robust Lightweight Reward Models based on Router Mechanism,"Hyuk Namgoong, Jeesu Jung, Sangkeun Jung, Yoonhyung Roh","Recent advancements in large language models have heavily relied on the large reward model from reinforcement learning from human feedback for fine-tuning. However, the use of a single reward model across various domains may not always be optimal, often requiring retraining from scratch when new domain data is introduced. To address these challenges, we explore the utilization of small language models operating in a domain-specific manner based on router mechanisms. Our three approaches are: 1) utilize mixture of experts to form a single reward model by modularizing an internal router and experts, 2) employing external router to select the appropriate reward model from multiple domain-specific models, and 3) the framework reduces parameter size by loading reward models and router adapters onto a single small language model using adapters. Experimental validation underscores the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating performance comparable to baseline methods while also reducing the total parameter size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17546v1,2024-07
FLRT: Fluent Student-Teacher Redteaming,"T. Ben Thompson, Michael Sklar","Many publicly available language models have been safety tuned to reduce the likelihood of toxic or liability-inducing text. To redteam or jailbreak these models for compliance with toxic requests, users and security analysts have developed adversarial prompting techniques. One attack method is to apply discrete optimization techniques to the prompt. However, the resulting attack strings are often gibberish text, easily filtered by defenders due to high measured perplexity, and may fail for unseen tasks and/or well-tuned models. In this work, we improve existing algorithms (primarily GCG and BEAST) to develop powerful and fluent attacks on safety-tuned models like Llama-2 and Phi-3. Our technique centers around a new distillation-based approach that encourages the victim model to emulate a toxified finetune, either in terms of output probabilities or internal activations. To encourage human-fluent attacks, we add a multi-model perplexity penalty and a repetition penalty to the objective. We also enhance optimizer strength by allowing token insertions, token swaps, and token deletions and by using longer attack sequences. The resulting process is able to reliably jailbreak the most difficult target models with prompts that appear similar to human-written prompts. On Advbench we achieve attack success rates $>93$% for Llama-2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Vicuna-7B, while maintaining model-measured perplexity $<33$; we achieve $95$% attack success for Phi-3, though with higher perplexity. We also find a universally-optimized single fluent prompt that induces $>88$% compliance on previously unseen tasks across Llama-2-7B, Phi-3-mini and Vicuna-7B and transfers to other black-box models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17447v2,2024-07

While prior work has been focusing on adding constituency-based structures to Transformers, we introduce Dependency Transformer Grammars (DTGs), a new class of Transformer language model with explicit dependency-based inductive bias. DTGs simulate dependency transition systems with constrained attention patterns by modifying attention masks, incorporate the stack information through relative positional encoding, and augment dependency arc representation with a combination of token embeddings and operation embeddings. When trained on a dataset of sentences annotated with dependency trees, DTGs achieve better generalization while maintaining comparable perplexity with Transformer language model baselines. DTGs also outperform recent constituency-based models, showing that dependency can better guide Transformer language models.

However, traditional rule-based methods struggle to detect novel anomalies. This paper leverages large language models (LLMs) for workflow anomaly detection by exploiting their ability to learn complex data patterns. Two approaches are investigated: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on labeled data for sentence classification to identify anomalies, and 2) in-context learning (ICL) where prompts containing task descriptions and examples guide LLMs in few-shot anomaly detection without fine-tuning.

Reporting and Analysing the Environmental Impact of Language Models on the Example of Commonsense Question Answering with External Knowledge,"Aida Usmanova, Junbo Huang, Debayan Banerjee, Ricardo Usbeck","Human-produced emissions are growing at an alarming rate, causing already observable changes in the climate and environment in general. Each year global carbon dioxide emissions hit a new record, and it is reported that 0.5% of total US greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to data centres as of 2021. The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked social interest in Large Language Models (LLMs), the new generation of Language Models with a large number of parameters and trained on massive amounts of data. Currently, numerous companies are releasing products featuring various LLMs, with many more models in development and awaiting release. Deep Learning research is a competitive field, with only models that reach top performance attracting attention and being utilized. Hence, achieving better accuracy and results is often the first priority, while the model's efficiency and the environmental impact of the study are neglected. However, LLMs demand substantial computational resources and are very costly to train, both financially and environmentally. It becomes essential to raise awareness and promote conscious decisions about algorithmic and hardware choices. Providing information on training time, the approximate carbon dioxide emissions and power consumption would assist future studies in making necessary adjustments and determining the compatibility of available computational resources with model requirements. In this study, we infused T5 LLM with external knowledge and fine-tuned the model for Question-Answering task. Furthermore, we calculated and reported the approximate environmental impact for both steps. The findings demonstrate that the smaller models may not always be sustainable options, and increased training does not always imply better performance.

This framing simplifies and expedites the manual evaluation process and enables automatic and independent LLM-based evaluation. As a test case, we apply our approach to a corpus of Holocaust survivor testimonies, motivated both by its relevance to title set extraction and by the moral significance of this pursuit. We validate the methodology by experimenting with naturalistic and synthetic title set generation systems and compare their performance with the methodology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17390v1,2024-07

MMRA: A Benchmark for Evaluating Multi-Granularity and Multi-Image Relational Association Capabilities in Large Visual Language Models,"Siwei Wu, Kang Zhu, Yu Bai, Yiming Liang, Yizhi Li, Haoning Wu, J. H. Liu, Ruibo Liu, Xingwei Qu, Xuxin Cheng, Ge Zhang, Wenhao Huang, Chenghua Lin","Given the remarkable success that large visual language models (LVLMs) have achieved in image perception tasks, the endeavor to make LVLMs perceive the world like humans is drawing increasing attention. Current multi-modal benchmarks primarily focus on facts or specific topic-related knowledge contained within individual images. However, they often overlook the associative relations between multiple images, which require the identification and analysis of similarities among entities or content present in different images. Therefore, we propose the multi-image relation association task and a meticulously curated Multi-granularity Multi-image Relational Association (MMRA) benchmark, comprising 1,024 samples. In order to systematically and comprehensively evaluate current LVLMs, we establish an associational relation system among images that contain 11 subtasks (e.g, UsageSimilarity, SubEvent) at two granularity levels (i.e., image and entity) according to the relations in ConceptNet. Our experiments reveal that on the MMRA benchmark, current multi-image LVLMs exhibit distinct advantages and disadvantages across various subtasks. Notably, fine-grained, entity-level multi-image perception tasks pose a greater challenge for LVLMs compared to image-level tasks. Moreover, LVLMs perform poorly on spatial-related tasks, indicating that LVLMs still have limited spatial awareness. Additionally, our findings indicate that while LVLMs demonstrate a strong capability to perceive image details, enhancing their ability to associate information across multiple images hinges on improving the reasoning capabilities of their language model component. Moreover, we explored the ability of LVLMs to perceive image sequences within the context of our multi-image association task. Our experiments show that the majority of current LVLMs do not adequately model image sequences during the pre-training process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17379v2,2024-07

Label Alignment and Reassignment with Generalist Large Language Model for Enhanced Cross-Domain Named Entity Recognition,"Ke Bao, Chonghuan Yang","Named entity recognition on the in-domain supervised and few-shot settings have been extensively discussed in the NLP community and made significant progress. However, cross-domain NER, a more common task in practical scenarios, still poses a challenge for most NER methods. Previous research efforts in that area primarily focus on knowledge transfer such as correlate label information from source to target domains but few works pay attention to the problem of label conflict. In this study, we introduce a label alignment and reassignment approach, namely LAR, to address this issue for enhanced cross-domain named entity recognition, which includes two core procedures: label alignment between source and target domains and label reassignment for type inference. The process of label reassignment can significantly be enhanced by integrating with an advanced large-scale language model such as ChatGPT. We conduct an extensive range of experiments on NER datasets involving both supervised and zero-shot scenarios. Empirical experimental results demonstrate the validation of our method with remarkable performance under the supervised and zero-shot out-of-domain settings compared to SOTA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17344v1,2024-07
How Good (Or Bad) Are LLMs at Detecting Misleading Visualizations?,"Leo Yu-Ho Lo, Huamin Qu","In this study, we address the growing issue of misleading charts, a prevalent problem that undermines the integrity of information dissemination. Misleading charts can distort the viewer's perception of data, leading to misinterpretations and decisions based on false information. The development of effective automatic detection methods for misleading charts is an urgent field of research. The recent advancement of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a promising direction for addressing this challenge. We explored the capabilities of these models in analyzing complex charts and assessing the impact of different prompting strategies on the models' analyses. We utilized a dataset of misleading charts collected from the internet by prior research and crafted nine distinct prompts, ranging from simple to complex, to test the ability of four different multimodal LLMs in detecting over 21 different chart issues. Through three experiments--from initial exploration to detailed analysis--we progressively gained insights into how to effectively prompt LLMs to identify misleading charts and developed strategies to address the scalability challenges encountered as we expanded our detection range from the initial five issues to 21 issues in the final experiment. Our findings reveal that multimodal LLMs possess a strong capability for chart comprehension and critical thinking in data interpretation. There is significant potential in employing multimodal LLMs to counter misleading information by supporting critical thinking and enhancing visualization literacy.

What Matters in Explanations: Towards Explainable Fake Review Detection Focusing on Transformers,"Md Shajalal, Md Atabuzzaman, Alexander Boden, Gunnar Stevens, Delong Du","Customers' reviews and feedback play crucial role on electronic commerce~(E-commerce) platforms like Amazon, Zalando, and eBay in influencing other customers' purchasing decisions. However, there is a prevailing concern that sellers often post fake or spam reviews to deceive potential customers and manipulate their opinions about a product. Over the past decade, there has been considerable interest in using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to identify such fraudulent reviews. Unfortunately, the decisions made by complex ML and DL models - which often function as \emph{black-boxes} - can be surprising and difficult for general users to comprehend. In this paper, we propose an explainable framework for detecting fake reviews with high precision in identifying fraudulent content with explanations and investigate what information matters most for explaining particular decisions by conducting empirical user evaluation. Initially, we develop fake review detection models using DL and transformer models including XLNet and DistilBERT. We then introduce layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique for generating explanations that can map the contributions of words toward the predicted class. The experimental results on two benchmark fake review detection datasets demonstrate that our predictive models achieve state-of-the-art performance and outperform several existing methods. Furthermore, the empirical user evaluation of the generated explanations concludes which important information needs to be considered in generating explanations in the context of fake review identification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21056v1,2024-07
Improving ICD coding using Chapter based Named Entities and Attentional Models,"Abhijith R. Beeravolu, Mirjam Jonkman, Sami Azam, Friso De Boer","Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have led to automation in various domains. However, clinical NLP often relies on benchmark datasets that may not reflect real-world scenarios accurately. Automatic ICD coding, a vital NLP task, typically uses outdated and imbalanced datasets like MIMIC-III, with existing methods yielding micro-averaged F1 scores between 0.4 and 0.7 due to many false positives. Our research introduces an enhanced approach to ICD coding that improves F1 scores by using chapter-based named entities and attentional models. This method categorizes discharge summaries into ICD-9 Chapters and develops attentional models with chapter-specific data, eliminating the need to consider external data for code identification. For categorization, we use Chapter-IV to de-bias and influence key entities and weights without neural networks, creating accurate thresholds and providing interpretability for human validation. Post-validation, we develop attentional models for three frequent and three non-frequent codes from Chapter-IV using Bidirectional-Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) with Attention and Transformer with Multi-head Attention architectures.

However, their performance is restricted due to the scarcity of formal theorem-proving data, which requires additional effort to be extracted from raw formal language corpora. Meanwhile, a significant amount of human-written formal language corpora remains underutilized. To address this issue, we propose LEAN-GitHub, a dataset consisting of large-scale formal data extracted from almost all Lean 4 repositories on GitHub. After fine-tuning InternLM-math-plus on this dataset, our model achieved accuracies of 48.8% with a single pass and 54.5% with 64 passes on the Lean 4 miniF2F test, surpassing state-of-the-art method at 52%. And it also achieves state-of-the-art on two other Lean 4 benchmarks (ProofNet and Putnam) targeting different fields/levels of math. These results demonstrate that our proposed dataset is beneficial for formal reasoning on a wide range of math topics. We open-source our model at https://GitHub. com/InternLM/InternLM-Math and our data at https://huggingface.co/ datasets/InternLM/Lean-GitHub",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17227v1,2024-07
Bailicai: A Domain-Optimized Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Medical Applications,"Cui Long, Yongbin Liu, Chunping Ouyang, Ying Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in natural language understanding, prompting extensive exploration of their potential applications across diverse domains. In the medical domain, open-source LLMs have demonstrated moderate efficacy following domain-specific fine-tuning; however, they remain substantially inferior to proprietary models such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. These open-source models encounter limitations in the comprehensiveness of domain-specific knowledge and exhibit a propensity for 'hallucinations' during text generation. To mitigate these issues, researchers have implemented the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which augments LLMs with background information from external knowledge bases while preserving the model's internal parameters. However, document noise can adversely affect performance, and the application of RAG in the medical field remains in its nascent stages. This study presents the Bailicai framework: a novel integration of retrieval-augmented generation with large language models optimized for the medical domain. The Bailicai framework augments the performance of LLMs in medicine through the implementation of four sub-modules. Experimental results demonstrate that the Bailicai approach surpasses existing medical domain LLMs across multiple medical benchmarks and exceeds the performance of GPT-3.5. Furthermore, the Bailicai method effectively attenuates the prevalent issue of hallucinations in medical applications of LLMs and ameliorates the noise-related challenges associated with traditional RAG techniques when processing irrelevant or pseudo-relevant documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21055v1,2024-07
Sentiment Reasoning for Healthcare,"Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Khai Le-Duc, Bach Phan Tat, Duy Le, Long Vo-Dang, Truong-Son Hy","Transparency in AI healthcare decision-making is crucial for building trust among AI and users. Incorporating reasoning capabilities enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand emotions in context, handle nuanced language, and infer unstated sentiments. In this work, we introduce a new task -- Sentiment Reasoning -- for both speech and text modalities, along with our proposed multimodal multitask framework and dataset. Sentiment Reasoning is an auxiliary task in sentiment analysis where the model predicts both the sentiment label and generates the rationale behind it based on the input transcript. Our study conducted on both human transcripts and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts shows that Sentiment Reasoning helps improve model transparency by providing rationale for model prediction with quality semantically comparable to humans while also improving model performance (1% increase in both accuracy and macro-F1) via rationale-augmented fine-tuning. Also, no significant difference in the semantic quality of generated rationales between human and ASR transcripts.

NarrationDep: Narratives on Social Media For Automatic Depression Detection,"Hamad Zogan, Imran Razzak, Shoaib Jameel, Guandong Xu","Social media posts provide valuable insight into the narrative of users and their intentions, including providing an opportunity to automatically model whether a social media user is depressed or not. The challenge lies in faithfully modelling user narratives from their online social media posts, which could potentially be useful in several different applications. We have developed a novel and effective model called \texttt{NarrationDep}, which focuses on detecting narratives associated with depression. By analyzing a user's tweets, \texttt{NarrationDep} accurately identifies crucial narratives. \texttt{NarrationDep} is a deep learning framework that jointly models individual user tweet representations and clusters of users' tweets. As a result, \texttt{NarrationDep} is characterized by a novel two-layer deep learning model: the first layer models using social media text posts, and the second layer learns semantic representations of tweets associated with a cluster. To faithfully model these cluster representations, the second layer incorporates a novel component that hierarchically learns from users' posts. The results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other comparative models including recently developed models on a variety of datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17174v1,2024-07

Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Multi-Speaker TTS Using Pre-trained Czech SpeechT5 Model,"Jan Lehečka, Zdeněk Hanzlíček, Jindřich Matoušek, Daniel Tihelka","In this paper, we experimented with the SpeechT5 model pre-trained on large-scale datasets. We pre-trained the foundation model from scratch and fine-tuned it on a large-scale robust multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) task. We tested the model capabilities in a zero- and few-shot scenario. Based on two listening tests, we evaluated the synthetic audio quality and the similarity of how synthetic voices resemble real voices. Our results showed that the SpeechT5 model can generate a synthetic voice for any speaker using only one minute of the target speaker's data. We successfully demonstrated the high quality and similarity of our synthetic voices on publicly known Czech politicians and celebrities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17167v1,2024-07

Our main goal is to push forward research on this unique dataset, which is an extremely valuable part of our cultural heritage. Our results suggest that monolingual speech recognition models are, in most cases, superior to multilingual models, even when processing the oral history archive full of mixed-language sentences from non-native speakers. We also performed the same experiments on the public CommonVoice dataset to verify our results.

SimCT: A Simple Consistency Test Protocol in LLMs Development Lifecycle,"Fufangchen Zhao, Guoqiang Jin, Rui Zhao, Jiangheng Huang, Fei Tan","In this work, we report our efforts to advance the standard operation procedure of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) or LLMs-based systems or services in industry. We introduce the concept of Large Language Model Development Lifecycle (LDLC) and then highlight the importance of consistency test in ensuring the delivery quality. The principled solution of consistency test, however, is usually overlooked by industrial practitioners and not urgent in academia, and current practical solutions are insufficiently rigours and labor-intensive. We thus propose a simple yet effective consistency test protocol, named SimCT. SimCT is mainly to proactively check the consistency across different development stages of ""bare metal"" LLMs or associated services without accessing the model artifacts, in an attempt to expedite the delivery by reducing the back-and-forth alignment communications among multiple teams involved in different development stages.   Specifically, SimCT encompasses response-wise and model-wise tests. We implement the protocol with LightGBM and Student's t-test for two components respectively, and perform extensive experiments to substantiate the effectiveness of SimCT and the involved components.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17150v2,2024-07
SDoH-GPT: Using Large Language Models to Extract Social Determinants of Health (SDoH),"Bernardo Consoli, Xizhi Wu, Song Wang, Xinyu Zhao, Yanshan Wang, Justin Rousseau, Tom Hartvigsen, Li Shen, Huanmei Wu, Yifan Peng, Qi Long, Tianlong Chen, Ying Ding","Extracting social determinants of health (SDoH) from unstructured medical notes depends heavily on labor-intensive annotations, which are typically task-specific, hampering reusability and limiting sharing. In this study we introduced SDoH-GPT, a simple and effective few-shot Large Language Model (LLM) method leveraging contrastive examples and concise instructions to extract SDoH without relying on extensive medical annotations or costly human intervention. It achieved tenfold and twentyfold reductions in time and cost respectively, and superior consistency with human annotators measured by Cohen's kappa of up to 0.92. The innovative combination of SDoH-GPT and XGBoost leverages the strengths of both, ensuring high accuracy and computational efficiency while consistently maintaining 0.90+ AUROC scores. Testing across three distinct datasets has confirmed its robustness and accuracy. This study highlights the potential of leveraging LLMs to revolutionize medical note classification, demonstrating their capability to achieve highly accurate classifications with significantly reduced time and cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17126v1,2024-07
To Know or Not To Know? Analyzing Self-Consistency of Large Language Models under Ambiguity,"Anastasiia Sedova, Robert Litschko, Diego Frassinelli, Benjamin Roth, Barbara Plank","One of the major aspects contributing to the striking performance of large language models (LLMs) is the vast amount of factual knowledge accumulated during pre-training. Yet, many LLMs suffer from self-inconsistency, which raises doubts about their trustworthiness and reliability. This paper focuses on entity type ambiguity, analyzing the proficiency and consistency of state-of-the-art LLMs in applying factual knowledge when prompted with ambiguous entities. To do so, we propose an evaluation protocol that disentangles knowing from applying knowledge, and test state-of-the-art LLMs on 49 ambiguous entities. Our experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with choosing the correct entity reading, achieving an average accuracy of only 85%, and as low as 75% with underspecified prompts. The results also reveal systematic discrepancies in LLM behavior, showing that while the models may possess knowledge, they struggle to apply it consistently, exhibit biases toward preferred readings, and display self-inconsistencies. This highlights the need to address entity ambiguity in the future for more trustworthy LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17125v3,2024-07

SAFETY-J: Evaluating Safety with Critique,"Yixiu Liu, Yuxiang Zheng, Shijie Xia, Jiajun Li, Yi Tu, Chaoling Song, Pengfei Liu","The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in content generation raises significant safety concerns, particularly regarding the transparency and interpretability of content evaluations. Current methods, primarily focused on binary safety classifications, lack mechanisms for detailed critique, limiting their utility for model improvement and user trust. To address these limitations, we introduce SAFETY-J, a bilingual generative safety evaluator for English and Chinese with critique-based judgment. SAFETY-J utilizes a robust training dataset that includes diverse dialogues and augmented query-response pairs to assess safety across various scenarios comprehensively. We establish an automated meta-evaluation benchmark that objectively assesses the quality of critiques with minimal human intervention, facilitating scalable and continuous improvement. Additionally, SAFETY-J employs an iterative preference learning technique to dynamically refine safety assessments based on meta-evaluations and critiques. Our evaluations demonstrate that SAFETY-J provides more nuanced and accurate safety evaluations, thereby enhancing both critique quality and predictive reliability in complex content scenarios. To facilitate further research and application, we open-source SAFETY-J's training protocols, datasets, and code at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/Safety-J.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17075v3,2024-07
High Efficiency Image Compression for Large Visual-Language Models,"Binzhe Li, Shurun Wang, Shiqi Wang, Yan Ye","In recent years, large visual language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance and promising generalization capability in multi-modal tasks, thus replacing humans as receivers of visual information in various application scenarios. In this paper, we pioneer to propose a variable bitrate image compression framework consisting of a pre-editing module and an end-to-end codec to achieve promising rate-accuracy performance for different LVLMs. In particular, instead of optimizing an adaptive pre-editing network towards a particular task or several representative tasks, we propose a new optimization strategy tailored for LVLMs, which is designed based on the representation and discrimination capability with token-level distortion and rank. The pre-editing module and the variable bitrate end-to-end image codec are jointly trained by the losses based on semantic tokens of the large model, which introduce enhanced generalization capability for various data and tasks. {Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework could efficiently achieve much better rate-accuracy performance compared to the state-of-the-art coding standard, Versatile Video Coding.} Meanwhile, experiments with multi-modal tasks have revealed the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17060v1,2024-07
DYNAMICQA: Tracing Internal Knowledge Conflicts in Language Models,"Sara Vera Marjanović, Haeun Yu, Pepa Atanasova, Maria Maistro, Christina Lioma, Isabelle Augenstein","Knowledge-intensive language understanding tasks require Language Models (LMs) to integrate relevant context, mitigating their inherent weaknesses, such as incomplete or outdated knowledge. However, conflicting knowledge can be present in the LM's parameters, termed intra-memory conflict, which can affect a model's propensity to accept contextual knowledge. To study the effect of intra-memory conflict on an LM's ability to accept relevant context, we utilize two knowledge conflict measures and a novel dataset containing inherently conflicting data, DynamicQA. This dataset includes facts with a temporal dynamic nature where facts can change over time and disputable dynamic facts, which can change depending on the viewpoint. DynamicQA is the first to include real-world knowledge conflicts and provide context to study the link between the different types of knowledge conflicts. We also evaluate several measures on their ability to reflect the presence of intra-memory conflict: semantic entropy and a novel coherent persuasion score. With our extensive experiments, we verify that LMs exhibit a greater degree of intra-memory conflict with dynamic facts compared to facts that have a single truth value. Furthermore, we reveal that facts with intra-memory conflict are harder to update with context, suggesting that retrieval-augmented generation will struggle with the most commonly adapted facts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17023v2,2024-07
Can Language Models Evaluate Human Written Text? Case Study on Korean Student Writing for Education,"Seungyoon Kim, Seungone Kim","Large language model (LLM)-based evaluation pipelines have demonstrated their capability to robustly evaluate machine-generated text. Extending this methodology to assess human-written text could significantly benefit educational settings by providing direct feedback to enhance writing skills, although this application is not straightforward. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively assess human-written text for educational purposes. We collected 100 texts from 32 Korean students across 15 types of writing and employed GPT-4-Turbo to evaluate them using grammaticality, fluency, coherence, consistency, and relevance as criteria. Our analyses indicate that LLM evaluators can reliably assess grammaticality and fluency, as well as more objective types of writing, though they struggle with other criteria and types of writing. We publicly release our dataset and feedback.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17022v1,2024-07
Unveiling In-Context Learning: A Coordinate System to Understand Its Working Mechanism,"Anhao Zhao, Fanghua Ye, Jinlan Fu, Xiaoyu Shen","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. However, the underlying working mechanism of ICL remains poorly understood. Recent research presents two conflicting views on ICL: One emphasizes the impact of similar examples in the demonstrations, stressing the need for label correctness and more shots. The other attributes it to LLMs' inherent ability of task recognition, deeming label correctness and shot numbers of demonstrations as not crucial. In this work, we provide a Two-Dimensional Coordinate System that unifies both views into a systematic framework. The framework explains the behavior of ICL through two orthogonal variables: whether similar examples are presented in the demonstrations (perception) and whether LLMs can recognize the task (cognition). We propose the peak inverse rank metric to detect the task recognition ability of LLMs and study LLMs' reactions to different definitions of similarity. Based on these, we conduct extensive experiments to elucidate how ICL functions across each quadrant on multiple representative classification tasks. Finally, we extend our analyses to generation tasks, showing that our coordinate system can also be used to interpret ICL for generation tasks effectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17011v2,2024-07
Revisiting Who's Harry Potter: Towards Targeted Unlearning from a Causal Intervention Perspective,"Yujian Liu, Yang Zhang, Tommi Jaakkola, Shiyu Chang","This paper investigates Who's Harry Potter (WHP), a pioneering yet insufficiently understood method for LLM unlearning. We explore it in two steps. First, we introduce a new task of LLM targeted unlearning, where given an unlearning target (e.g., a person) and some unlearning documents, we aim to unlearn only the information about the target, rather than everything in the unlearning documents. We further argue that a successful unlearning should satisfy criteria such as not outputting gibberish, not fabricating facts about the unlearning target, and not releasing factual information under jailbreak attacks. Second, we construct a causal intervention framework for targeted unlearning, where the knowledge of the unlearning target is modeled as a confounder between LLM input and output, and the unlearning process as a deconfounding process. This framework justifies and extends WHP, deriving a simple unlearning algorithm that includes WHP as a special case. Experiments on existing and new datasets show that our approach, without explicitly optimizing for the aforementioned criteria, achieves competitive performance in all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/causal_unlearn.git.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16997v2,2024-07
A Voter-Based Stochastic Rejection-Method Framework for Asymptotically Safe Language Model Outputs,"Jake R. Watts, Joel Sokol","This paper proposes a new method for preventing unsafe or otherwise low quality large language model (LLM) outputs, by leveraging the stochasticity of LLMs. We propose a system whereby LLM checkers vote on the acceptability of a generated output, regenerating it if a threshold of disapproval is reached, until sufficient checkers approve. We further propose estimators for cost and failure rate, and based on those estimators and experimental data tailored to the application, we propose an algorithm that achieves a desired failure rate at the least possible cost. We demonstrate that, under these models, failure rate decreases exponentially as a function of cost when voter count and threshold are chosen according to the algorithm, and that the models reasonably estimate the actual performance of such a system in action, even with limited data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16994v2,2024-07
Generative artificial intelligence in dentistry: Current approaches and future challenges,"Fabián Villena, Claudia Véliz, Rosario García-Huidobro, Sebastián Aguayo","Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a commodity for people because of the advent of generative AI (GenAI) models that bridge the usability gap of AI by providing a natural language interface to interact with complex models. These GenAI models range from text generation - such as two-way chat systems - to the generation of image or video from textual descriptions input by a user. These advancements in AI have impacted Dentistry in multiple aspects. In dental education, the student now has the opportunity to solve a plethora of questions by only prompting a GenAI model and have the answer in a matter of seconds. GenAI models can help us deliver better patient healthcare by helping practitioners gather knowledge quickly and efficiently. Finally, GenAI can also be used in dental research, where the applications range from new drug discovery to assistance in academic writing.

Towards Aligning Language Models with Textual Feedback,"Saüc Abadal Lloret, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Keerthiram Murugesan, Mrinmaya Sachan","We present ALT (ALignment with Textual feedback), an approach that aligns language models with user preferences expressed in text. We argue that text offers greater expressiveness, enabling users to provide richer feedback than simple comparative preferences and this richer feedback can lead to more efficient and effective alignment. ALT aligns the model by conditioning its generation on the textual feedback. Our method relies solely on language modeling techniques and requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning, though it still presents the main benefits of RL-based alignment algorithms and can effectively learn from textual feedback. We explore the efficacy and efficiency of textual feedback across different tasks such as toxicity reduction, summarization, and dialog response generation. We find that ALT outperforms PPO for the task of toxicity reduction while being able to match its performance on summarization with only 20% of the samples. We also explore how ALT can be used with feedback provided by an existing LLM where we explore an LLM providing constrained and unconstrained textual feedback. We also outline future directions to align models with natural language feedback.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16970v2,2024-07
Towards Transfer Unlearning: Empirical Evidence of Cross-Domain Bias Mitigation,"Huimin Lu, Masaru Isonuma, Junichiro Mori, Ichiro Sakata","Large language models (LLMs) often inherit biases from vast amounts of training corpora. Traditional debiasing methods, while effective to some extent, do not completely eliminate memorized biases and toxicity in LLMs. In this paper, we study an unlearning-based approach to debiasing in LLMs by performing gradient ascent on hate speech against minority groups, i.e., minimizing the likelihood of biased or toxic content. Specifically, we propose a mask language modeling unlearning technique, which unlearns the harmful part of the text. This method enables LLMs to selectively forget and disassociate from biased and harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diminishing bias while maintaining the language modeling abilities. Surprisingly, the results also unveil an unexpected potential for cross-domain transfer unlearning: debiasing in one bias form (e.g. gender) may contribute to mitigating others (e.g. race and religion).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16951v1,2024-07
Early screening of potential breakthrough technologies with enhanced interpretability: A patent-specific hierarchical attention network model,"Jaewoong Choi, Janghyeok Yoon, Changyong Lee","Despite the usefulness of machine learning approaches for the early screening of potential breakthrough technologies, their practicality is often hindered by opaque models. To address this, we propose an interpretable machine learning approach to predicting future citation counts from patent texts using a patent-specific hierarchical attention network (PatentHAN) model. Central to this approach are (1) a patent-specific pre-trained language model, capturing the meanings of technical words in patent claims, (2) a hierarchical network structure, enabling detailed analysis at the claim level, and (3) a claim-wise self-attention mechanism, revealing pivotal claims during the screening process. A case study of 35,376 pharmaceutical patents demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in early screening of potential breakthrough technologies while ensuring interpretability. Furthermore, we conduct additional analyses using different language models and claim types to examine the robustness of the approach. It is expected that the proposed approach will enhance expert-machine collaboration in identifying breakthrough technologies, providing new insight derived from text mining into technological value.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16939v1,2024-07
ScholarChemQA: Unveiling the Power of Language Models in Chemical Research Question Answering,"Xiuying Chen, Tairan Wang, Taicheng Guo, Kehan Guo, Juexiao Zhou, Haoyang Li, Mingchen Zhuge, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Xin Gao, Xiangliang Zhang","Question Answering (QA) effectively evaluates language models' reasoning and knowledge depth. While QA datasets are plentiful in areas like general domain and biomedicine, academic chemistry is less explored. Chemical QA plays a crucial role in both education and research by effectively translating complex chemical information into readily understandable format. Addressing this gap, we introduce ScholarChemQA, a large-scale QA dataset constructed from chemical papers. This dataset reflects typical real-world challenges, including an imbalanced data distribution and a substantial amount of unlabeled data that can be potentially useful. Correspondingly, we introduce a QAMatch model, specifically designed to effectively answer chemical questions by fully leveraging our collected data. We first address the issue of imbalanced label distribution by re-weighting the instance-wise loss based on the inverse frequency of each class, ensuring minority classes are not dominated by majority ones during optimization. Next, we utilize the unlabeled data to enrich the learning process, generating a variety of augmentations based on a SoftMix operation and ensuring their predictions align with the same target, i.e., pseudo-labels. To ensure the quality of the pseudo-labels, we propose a calibration procedure aimed at closely aligning the pseudo-label estimates of individual samples with a desired ground truth distribution. Experiments show that our QAMatch significantly outperforms the recent similar-scale baselines and Large Language Models (LLMs) not only on our ScholarChemQA dataset but also on four benchmark datasets. We hope our benchmark and model can facilitate and promote more research on chemical QA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16931v1,2024-07
Train-Attention: Meta-Learning Where to Focus in Continual Knowledge Learning,"Yeongbin Seo, Dongha Lee, Jinyoung Yeo","Previous studies on continual knowledge learning (CKL) in large language models (LLMs) have predominantly focused on approaches such as regularization, architectural modifications, and rehearsal techniques to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these methods naively inherit the inefficiencies of standard training procedures, indiscriminately applying uniform weight across all tokens, which can lead to unnecessary parameter updates and increased forgetting. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel CKL approach termed Train-Attention-Augmented Language Model (TAALM), which enhances learning efficiency by dynamically predicting and applying weights to tokens based on their usefulness. This method employs a meta-learning framework that optimizes token importance predictions, facilitating targeted knowledge updates and minimizing forgetting. Also, we observe that existing benchmarks do not clearly exhibit the trade-off between learning and retaining, therefore we propose a new benchmark, \textsc{LAMA-ckl}, to address this issue. Through experiments conducted on both newly introduced and established CKL benchmarks, TAALM proves the state-of-the-art performance upon the baselines, and also shows synergistic compatibility when integrated with previous CKL approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16920v1,2024-07

As the cognitive mechanisms of hallucination have been related to memory, here we explore hallucination for LLM that is enabled with explicit memory mechanisms. We empirically demonstrate that by simply scaling the readout vector that constrains generation in a memory-augmented LLM decoder, hallucination mitigation can be achieved in a training-free manner. Our method is geometry-inspired and outperforms a state-of-the-art LLM editing method on the task of generation of Wikipedia-like biography entries both in terms of generation quality and runtime complexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16908v1,2024-07

Despite being very well thought out, we noticed a number of issues we believe are limiting. Therefore, we propose $\textit{BenchIE}^{FL}$, a new OIE benchmark which fully enforces the principles of BenchIE while containing fewer errors, omissions and shortcomings when candidate facts are matched towards reference ones. $\textit{BenchIE}^{FL}$ allows insightful conclusions to be drawn on the actual performance of OIE extractors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16860v1,2024-07
CompBench: A Comparative Reasoning Benchmark for Multimodal LLMs,"Jihyung Kil, Zheda Mai, Justin Lee, Zihe Wang, Kerrie Cheng, Lemeng Wang, Ye Liu, Arpita Chowdhury, Wei-Lun Chao","The ability to compare objects, scenes, or situations is crucial for effective decision-making and problem-solving in everyday life. For instance, comparing the freshness of apples enables better choices during grocery shopping, while comparing sofa designs helps optimize the aesthetics of our living space. Despite its significance, the comparative capability is largely unexplored in artificial general intelligence (AGI). In this paper, we introduce CompBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the comparative reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). CompBench mines and pairs images through visually oriented questions covering eight dimensions of relative comparison: visual attribute, existence, state, emotion, temporality, spatiality, quantity, and quality. We curate a collection of around 40K image pairs using metadata from diverse vision datasets and CLIP similarity scores. These image pairs span a broad array of visual domains, including animals, fashion, sports, and both outdoor and indoor scenes. The questions are carefully crafted to discern relative characteristics between two images and are labeled by human annotators for accuracy and relevance. We use CompBench to evaluate recent MLLMs, including GPT-4V(ision), Gemini-Pro, and LLaVA-1.6. Our results reveal notable shortcomings in their comparative abilities. We believe CompBench not only sheds light on these limitations but also establishes a solid foundation for future enhancements in the comparative capability of MLLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16837v1,2024-07
Retrieval Augmented Generation or Long-Context LLMs? A Comprehensive Study and Hybrid Approach,"Zhuowan Li, Cheng Li, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Michael Bendersky","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been a powerful tool for Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently process overly lengthy contexts. However, recent LLMs like Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4 show exceptional capabilities to understand long contexts directly. We conduct a comprehensive comparison between RAG and long-context (LC) LLMs, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. We benchmark RAG and LC across various public datasets using three latest LLMs. Results reveal that when resourced sufficiently, LC consistently outperforms RAG in terms of average performance. However, RAG's significantly lower cost remains a distinct advantage. Based on this observation, we propose Self-Route, a simple yet effective method that routes queries to RAG or LC based on model self-reflection. Self-Route significantly reduces the computation cost while maintaining a comparable performance to LC. Our findings provide a guideline for long-context applications of LLMs using RAG and LC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16833v2,2024-07
VisMin: Visual Minimal-Change Understanding,"Rabiul Awal, Saba Ahmadi, Le Zhang, Aishwarya Agrawal","Fine-grained understanding of objects, attributes, and relationships between objects is crucial for visual-language models (VLMs). Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar \textit{captions} given an image. In this paper, we introduce a new, challenging benchmark termed \textbf{Vis}ual \textbf{Min}imal-Change Understanding (VisMin), which requires models to predict the correct image-caption match given two images and two captions. The image pair and caption pair contain minimal changes, i.e., only one aspect changes at a time from among the following: \textit{object}, \textit{attribute}, \textit{count}, and \textit{spatial relation}. These changes test the models' understanding of objects, attributes (such as color, material, shape), counts, and spatial relationships between objects. We built an automatic framework using large language models and diffusion models, followed by a rigorous 4-step verification process by human annotators. Empirical experiments reveal that current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships and counting abilities. We also generate a large-scale training dataset to finetune CLIP and Idefics2, showing significant improvements in fine-grained understanding across benchmarks and in CLIP's general image-text alignment. We release all resources, including the benchmark, training data, and finetuned model checkpoints, at \url{https://vismin.net/}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16772v1,2024-07
Stress-Testing Long-Context Language Models with Lifelong ICL and Task Haystack,"Xiaoyue Xu, Qinyuan Ye, Xiang Ren","We introduce Lifelong ICL, a problem setting that challenges long-context language models (LMs) to learn a sequence of language tasks through in-context learning (ICL). We further introduce Task Haystack, an evaluation suite dedicated to assessing and diagnosing how long-context LMs utilizes contexts in Lifelong ICL. When given a task instruction and test inputs, long-context LMs are expected to leverage the relevant demonstrations in the Lifelong ICL prompt, avoid distraction and interference from other tasks, and achieve test accuracies that are not significantly worse than those of the Single-task ICL baseline.   Task Haystack draws inspiration from the widely-adopted ""needle-in-a-haystack"" (NIAH) evaluation, but presents distinct new challenges. It requires models (1) to utilize the contexts at a deeper level, rather than resorting to simple copying and pasting; (2) to navigate through long streams of evolving topics and tasks, proxying the complexities and dynamism of contexts in real-world scenarios. Additionally, Task Haystack inherits the controllability of NIAH, providing model developers with tools and visualizations to identify model vulnerabilities effectively.   We benchmark 14 long-context LMs using Task Haystack, finding that frontier models like GPT-4o still struggle with the setting, failing on 15% of cases on average. Most open-weight models further lack behind by a large margin, with failure rates reaching up to 61%. In our controlled analysis, we identify factors such as distraction and recency bias as contributors to these failure cases. Further, performance declines when task instructions are paraphrased at test time or when ICL demonstrations are repeated excessively, raising concerns about the robustness, instruction understanding, and true context utilization of long-context LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16695v2,2024-07
Explanation Regularisation through the Lens of Attributions,"Pedro Ferreira, Ivan Titov, Wilker Aziz","Explanation regularisation (ER) has been introduced as a way to guide text classifiers to form their predictions relying on input tokens that humans consider plausible. This is achieved by introducing an auxiliary explanation loss that measures how well the output of an input attribution technique for the model agrees with human-annotated rationales. The guidance appears to benefit performance in out-of-domain (OOD) settings, presumably due to an increased reliance on ""plausible"" tokens. However, previous work has under-explored the impact of guidance on that reliance, particularly when reliance is measured using attribution techniques different from those used to guide the model. In this work, we seek to close this gap, and also explore the relationship between reliance on plausible features and OOD performance. We find that the connection between ER and the ability of a classifier to rely on plausible features has been overstated and that a stronger reliance on plausible tokens does not seem to be the cause for OOD improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16693v2,2024-07
Can Large Language Models Automatically Jailbreak GPT-4V?,"Yuanwei Wu, Yue Huang, Yixin Liu, Xiang Li, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun","GPT-4V has attracted considerable attention due to its extraordinary capacity for integrating and processing multimodal information. At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16686v2,2024-07

In this paper, we introduce OpenHands (f.k.a.

RedAgent: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Context-aware Autonomous Language Agent,"Huiyu Xu, Wenhui Zhang, Zhibo Wang, Feng Xiao, Rui Zheng, Yunhe Feng, Zhongjie Ba, Kui Ren","Recently, advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have been integrated into many real-world applications like Code Copilot. These applications have significantly expanded the attack surface of LLMs, exposing them to a variety of threats. Among them, jailbreak attacks that induce toxic responses through jailbreak prompts have raised critical safety concerns. To identify these threats, a growing number of red teaming approaches simulate potential adversarial scenarios by crafting jailbreak prompts to test the target LLM. However, existing red teaming methods do not consider the unique vulnerabilities of LLM in different scenarios, making it difficult to adjust the jailbreak prompts to find context-specific vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, these methods are limited to refining jailbreak templates using a few mutation operations, lacking the automation and scalability to adapt to different scenarios. To enable context-aware and efficient red teaming, we abstract and model existing attacks into a coherent concept called ""jailbreak strategy"" and propose a multi-agent LLM system named RedAgent that leverages these strategies to generate context-aware jailbreak prompts. By self-reflecting on contextual feedback in an additional memory buffer, RedAgent continuously learns how to leverage these strategies to achieve effective jailbreaks in specific contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can jailbreak most black-box LLMs in just five queries, improving the efficiency of existing red teaming methods by two times. Additionally, RedAgent can jailbreak customized LLM applications more efficiently. By generating context-aware jailbreak prompts towards applications on GPTs, we discover 60 severe vulnerabilities of these real-world applications with only two queries per vulnerability. We have reported all found issues and communicated with OpenAI and Meta for bug fixes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16667v1,2024-07
Towards scalable efficient on-device ASR with transfer learning,"Laxmi Pandey, Ke Li, Jinxi Guo, Debjyoti Paul, Arthur Guo, Jay Mahadeokar, Xuedong Zhang","Multilingual pretraining for transfer learning significantly boosts the robustness of low-resource monolingual ASR models. This study systematically investigates three main aspects: (a) the impact of transfer learning on model performance during initial training or fine-tuning, (b) the influence of transfer learning across dataset domains and languages, and (c) the effect on rare-word recognition compared to non-rare words. Our finding suggests that RNNT-loss pretraining, followed by monolingual fine-tuning with Minimum Word Error Rate (MinWER) loss, consistently reduces Word Error Rates (WER) across languages like Italian and French. WER Reductions (WERR) reach 36.2% and 42.8% compared to monolingual baselines for MLS and in-house datasets. Out-of-domain pretraining leads to 28% higher WERR than in-domain pretraining. Both rare and non-rare words benefit, with rare words showing greater improvements with out-of-domain pretraining, and non-rare words with in-domain pretraining.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16664v1,2024-07
A Survey of Text Style Transfer: Applications and Ethical Implications,"Sourabrata Mukherjee, Mateusz Lango, Zdenek Kasner, Ondrej Dušek","Text style transfer (TST) is an important task in controllable text generation, which aims to control selected attributes of language use, such as politeness, formality, or sentiment, without altering the style-independent content of the text. The field has received considerable research attention in recent years and has already been covered in several reviews, but the focus has mostly been on the development of new algorithms and learning from different types of data (supervised, unsupervised, out-of-domain, etc.) and not so much on the application side. However, TST-related technologies are gradually reaching a production- and deployment-ready level, and therefore, the inclusion of the application perspective in TST research becomes crucial. Similarly, the often overlooked ethical considerations of TST technology have become a pressing issue. This paper presents a comprehensive review of TST applications that have been researched over the years, using both traditional linguistic approaches and more recent deep learning methods. We discuss current challenges, future research directions, and ethical implications of TST applications in text generation. By providing a holistic overview of the landscape of TST applications, we hope to stimulate further research and contribute to a better understanding of the potential as well as ethical considerations associated with TST.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16737v1,2024-07
Course-Correction: Safety Alignment Using Synthetic Preferences,"Rongwu Xu, Yishuo Cai, Zhenhong Zhou, Renjie Gu, Haiqin Weng, Yan Liu, Tianwei Zhang, Wei Xu, Han Qiu","The risk of harmful content generated by large language models (LLMs) becomes a critical concern. This paper presents a systematic study on assessing and improving LLMs' capability to perform the task of \textbf{course-correction}, \ie, the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously. To start with, we introduce the \textsc{C$^2$-Eval} benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction. To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, we create \textsc{C$^2$-Syn}, a synthetic dataset with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven preference learning. Experiments on 2 LLMs, \textsc{Llama2-Chat 7B} and \textsc{Qwen2 7B}, show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance. Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16637v2,2024-07
Semantic Change Characterization with LLMs using Rhetorics,"Jader Martins Camboim de Sá, Marcos Da Silveira, Cédric Pruski","Languages continually evolve in response to societal events, resulting in new terms and shifts in meanings. These changes have significant implications for computer applications, including automatic translation and chatbots, making it essential to characterize them accurately. The recent development of LLMs has notably advanced natural language understanding, particularly in sense inference and reasoning. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs in characterizing three types of semantic change: dimension, relation, and orientation. We achieve this by combining LLMs' Chain-of-Thought with rhetorical devices and conducting an experimental assessment of our approach using newly created datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of LLMs in capturing and analyzing semantic changes, providing valuable insights to improve computational linguistic applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16624v1,2024-07
Lawma: The Power of Specialization for Legal Tasks,"Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo, Vedant Nanda, Rediet Abebe, Stefan Bechtold, Christoph Engel, Jens Frankenreiter, Krishna Gummadi, Moritz Hardt, Michael Livermore","Annotation and classification of legal text are central components of empirical legal research. Traditionally, these tasks are often delegated to trained research assistants. Motivated by the advances in language modeling, empirical legal scholars are increasingly turning to prompting commercial models, hoping that it will alleviate the significant cost of human annotation. Despite growing use, our understanding of how to best utilize large language models for legal tasks remains limited. We conduct a comprehensive study of 260 legal text classification tasks, nearly all new to the machine learning community. Starting from GPT-4 as a baseline, we show that it has non-trivial but highly varied zero-shot accuracy, often exhibiting performance that may be insufficient for legal work. We then demonstrate that a lightly fine-tuned Llama 3 model vastly outperforms GPT-4 on almost all tasks, typically by double-digit percentage points. We find that larger models respond better to fine-tuning than smaller models. A few tens to hundreds of examples suffice to achieve high classification accuracy. Notably, we can fine-tune a single model on all 260 tasks simultaneously at a small loss in accuracy relative to having a separate model for each task. Our work points to a viable alternative to the predominant practice of prompting commercial models. For concrete legal tasks with some available labeled data, researchers are better off using a fine-tuned open-source model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16615v1,2024-07
Data Mixture Inference: What do BPE Tokenizers Reveal about their Training Data?,"Jonathan Hayase, Alisa Liu, Yejin Choi, Sewoong Oh, Noah A. Smith","The pretraining data of today's strongest language models is opaque; in particular, little is known about the proportions of various domains or languages represented. In this work, we tackle a task which we call data mixture inference, which aims to uncover the distributional make-up of training data. We introduce a novel attack based on a previously overlooked source of information: byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, used by the vast majority of modern language models. Our key insight is that the ordered list of merge rules learned by a BPE tokenizer naturally reveals information about the token frequencies in its training data. Given a tokenizer's merge list along with example data for each category of interest, we formulate a linear program that solves for the proportion of each category in the tokenizer's training set. In controlled experiments, we show that our attack recovers mixture ratios with high precision for tokenizers trained on known mixtures of natural languages, programming languages, and data sources. We then apply our approach to off-the-shelf tokenizers released with recent LMs. We confirm much publicly disclosed information about these models, and also make several new inferences: GPT-4o and Mistral NeMo's tokenizers are much more multilingual than their predecessors, training on 39% and 47% non-English language data, respectively; Llama 3 extends GPT-3.5's tokenizer primarily for multilingual (48%) use; GPT-3.5's and Claude's tokenizers are trained on predominantly code (~60%). We hope our work sheds light on current design practices for pretraining data, and inspires continued research into data mixture inference for LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16607v4,2024-07
Shared Imagination: LLMs Hallucinate Alike,"Yilun Zhou, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese, Chien-Sheng Wu","Despite the recent proliferation of large language models (LLMs), their training recipes -- model architecture, pre-training data and optimization algorithm -- are often very similar. This naturally raises the question of the similarity among the resulting models. In this paper, we propose a novel setting, imaginary question answering (IQA), to better understand model similarity. In IQA, we ask one model to generate purely imaginary questions (e.g., on completely made-up concepts in physics) and prompt another model to answer. Surprisingly, despite the total fictionality of these questions, all models can answer each other's questions with remarkable success, suggesting a ""shared imagination space"" in which these models operate during such hallucinations. We conduct a series of investigations into this phenomenon and discuss implications on model homogeneity, hallucination, and computational creativity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16604v1,2024-07
A Comparative Study on Patient Language across Therapeutic Domains for Effective Patient Voice Classification in Online Health Discussions,"Giorgos Lysandrou, Roma English Owen, Vanja Popovic, Grant Le Brun, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Beatrice Alex, Elizabeth A. L. Fairley","There exists an invisible barrier between healthcare professionals' perception of a patient's clinical experience and the reality. This barrier may be induced by the environment that hinders patients from sharing their experiences openly with healthcare professionals. As patients are observed to discuss and exchange knowledge more candidly on social media, valuable insights can be leveraged from these platforms. However, the abundance of non-patient posts on social media necessitates filtering out such irrelevant content to distinguish the genuine voices of patients, a task we refer to as patient voice classification. In this study, we analyse the importance of linguistic characteristics in accurately classifying patient voices. Our findings underscore the essential role of linguistic and statistical text similarity analysis in identifying common patterns among patient groups. These results allude to even starker differences in the way patients express themselves at a disease level and across various therapeutic domains. Additionally, we fine-tuned a pre-trained Language Model on the combined datasets with similar linguistic patterns, resulting in a highly accurate automatic patient voice classification. Being the pioneering study on the topic, our focus on extracting authentic patient experiences from social media stands as a crucial step towards advancing healthcare standards and fostering a patient-centric approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16593v1,2024-07
TLCR: Token-Level Continuous Reward for Fine-grained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback,"Eunseop Yoon, Hee Suk Yoon, SooHwan Eom, Gunsoo Han, Daniel Wontae Nam, Daejin Jo, Kyoung-Woon On, Mark A. Hasegawa-Johnson, Sungwoong Kim, Chang D. Yoo","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages human preference data to train language models to align more closely with human essence. These human preference data, however, are labeled at the sequence level, creating a mismatch between sequence-level preference labels and tokens, which are autoregressively generated from the language model. Although several recent approaches have tried to provide token-level (i.e., dense) rewards for each individual token, these typically rely on predefined discrete reward values (e.g., positive: +1, negative: -1, neutral: 0), failing to account for varying degrees of preference inherent to each token. To address this limitation, we introduce TLCR (Token-Level Continuous Reward) for RLHF, which incorporates a discriminator trained to distinguish positive and negative tokens, and the confidence of the discriminator is used to assign continuous rewards to each token considering the context. Extensive experiments show that our proposed TLCR leads to consistent performance improvements over previous sequence-level or token-level discrete rewards on open-ended generation benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16574v2,2024-07

Language generation via LLMs models has two key problems: firstly, they are prone to hallucination and therefore, for any medical purpose they require scientific and factual grounding; secondly, LLMs pose tremendous challenge to computational resources due to their gigantic model size. In this work, we introduce pRAGe, a pipeline for Retrieval Augmented Generation and evaluation of medical paraphrases generation using Small Language Models (SLM).

Quantifying the Role of Textual Predictability in Automatic Speech Recognition,"Sean Robertson, Gerald Penn, Ewan Dunbar","A long-standing question in automatic speech recognition research is how to attribute errors to the ability of a model to model the acoustics, versus its ability to leverage higher-order context (lexicon, morphology, syntax, semantics). We validate a novel approach which models error rates as a function of relative textual predictability, and yields a single number, $k$, which measures the effect of textual predictability on the recognizer. We use this method to demonstrate that a Wav2Vec 2.0-based model makes greater stronger use of textual context than a hybrid ASR model, in spite of not using an explicit language model, and also use it to shed light on recent results demonstrating poor performance of standard ASR systems on African-American English. We demonstrate that these mostly represent failures of acoustic--phonetic modelling. We show how this approach can be used straightforwardly in diagnosing and improving ASR.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16537v2,2024-07
Imperfect Vision Encoders: Efficient and Robust Tuning for Vision-Language Models,"Aristeidis Panos, Rahaf Aljundi, Daniel Olmeda Reino, Richard E Turner","Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in visual question answering and image captioning, acting as a crucial link between visual and language models. However, existing open-source VLMs heavily rely on pretrained and frozen vision encoders (such as CLIP). Despite CLIP's robustness across diverse domains, it still exhibits non-negligible image understanding errors. These errors propagate to the VLM responses, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In our work, we propose an efficient and robust method for updating vision encoders within VLMs. Our approach selectively and locally updates encoders, leading to substantial performance improvements on data where previous mistakes occurred, while maintaining overall robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method during continual few-shot updates.

Players act as crew members aboard a spaceship, tasked with identifying impostors who are sabotaging the ship and eliminating the crew. Within this environment, the behavior of simulated language agents is analyzed. The experiments involve diverse game sequences featuring different configurations of Crewmates and Impostor personality archetypes. Our work demonstrates that state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) can effectively grasp the game rules and make decisions based on the current context.

Assessing In-context Learning and Fine-tuning for Topic Classification of German Web Data,"Julian Schelb, Roberto Ulloa, Andreas Spitz","Researchers in the political and social sciences often rely on classification models to analyze trends in information consumption by examining browsing histories of millions of webpages. Automated scalable methods are necessary due to the impracticality of manual labeling. In this paper, we model the detection of topic-related content as a binary classification task and compare the accuracy of fine-tuned pre-trained encoder models against in-context learning strategies. Using only a few hundred annotated data points per topic, we detect content related to three German policies in a database of scraped webpages. We compare multilingual and monolingual models, as well as zero and few-shot approaches, and investigate the impact of negative sampling strategies and the combination of URL & content-based features. Our results show that a small sample of annotated data is sufficient to train an effective classifier. Fine-tuning encoder-based models yields better results than in-context learning.

Machine Translation Hallucination Detection for Low and High Resource Languages using Large Language Models,"Kenza Benkirane, Laura Gongas, Shahar Pelles, Naomi Fuchs, Joshua Darmon, Pontus Stenetorp, David Ifeoluwa Adelani, Eduardo Sánchez","Recent advancements in massively multilingual machine translation systems have significantly enhanced translation accuracy; however, even the best performing systems still generate hallucinations, severely impacting user trust. Detecting hallucinations in Machine Translation (MT) remains a critical challenge, particularly since existing methods excel with High-Resource Languages (HRLs) but exhibit substantial limitations when applied to Low-Resource Languages (LRLs). This paper evaluates sentence-level hallucination detection approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic similarity within massively multilingual embeddings. Our study spans 16 language directions, covering HRLs, LRLs, with diverse scripts. We find that the choice of model is essential for performance. On average, for HRLs, Llama3-70B outperforms the previous state of the art by as much as 0.16 MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient). However, for LRLs we observe that Claude Sonnet outperforms other LLMs on average by 0.03 MCC. The key takeaway from our study is that LLMs can achieve performance comparable or even better than previously proposed models, despite not being explicitly trained for any machine translation task. However, their advantage is less significant for LRLs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16470v3,2024-07
Psychomatics -- A Multidisciplinary Framework for Understanding Artificial Minds,"Giuseppe Riva, Fabrizia Mantovani, Brenda K. Wiederhold, Antonella Marchetti, Andrea Gaggioli","Although LLMs and other artificial intelligence systems demonstrate cognitive skills similar to humans, like concept learning and language acquisition, the way they process information fundamentally differs from biological cognition. To better understand these differences this paper introduces Psychomatics, a multidisciplinary framework bridging cognitive science, linguistics, and computer science. It aims to better understand the high-level functioning of LLMs, focusing specifically on how LLMs acquire, learn, remember, and use information to produce their outputs. To achieve this goal, Psychomatics will rely on a comparative methodology, starting from a theory-driven research question - is the process of language development and use different in humans and LLMs? - drawing parallels between LLMs and biological systems. Our analysis shows how LLMs can map and manipulate complex linguistic patterns in their training data. Moreover, LLMs can follow Grice's Cooperative Principle to provide relevant and informative responses. However, human cognition draws from multiple sources of meaning, including experiential, emotional, and imaginative facets, which transcend mere language processing and are rooted in our social and developmental trajectories. Moreover, current LLMs lack physical embodiment, reducing their ability to make sense of the intricate interplay between perception, action, and cognition that shapes human understanding and expression. Ultimately, Psychomatics holds the potential to yield transformative insights into the nature of language, cognition, and intelligence, both artificial and biological. Moreover, by drawing parallels between LLMs and human cognitive processes, Psychomatics can inform the development of more robust and human-like AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16444v1,2024-07
Structure-aware Domain Knowledge Injection for Large Language Models,"Kai Liu, Ze Chen, Zhihang Fu, Rongxin Jiang, Fan Zhou, Yaowu Chen, Yue Wu, Jieping Ye","This paper introduces a pioneering methodology, termed StructTuning, to efficiently transform foundation Large Language Models (LLMs) into domain specialists. It significantly reduces the training corpus requirement to a mere 0.3%, while achieving an impressive 50% of traditional knowledge injection performance. Our method is inspired by the educational processes of human students, particularly how structured domain knowledge from textbooks is assimilated and subsequently applied to tackle real-world challenges through specific exercises. Based on this, we propose a novel two-stage strategy for knowledge injection and alignment: Structure-aware Continual Pre-Training (SCPT) and Structure-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT). In the SCPT phase, we automatically extract the domain knowledge taxonomy and reorganize the training corpora, enabling LLMs to effectively link textual segments to targeted knowledge points within the taxonomy. In the SSFT phase, we explicitly prompt models to elucidate the underlying knowledge structure in their outputs, leveraging the structured domain insight to address practical problems. Our ultimate method has undergone extensive evaluations across model architectures and scales, using closed-book question-answering tasks on LongBench and MMedBench datasets. Remarkably, our method demonstrates the potential of comparable improvement against the state-of-the-art MMedLM2 on MMedBench, while significantly reducing the training costs to 5%. This breakthrough paves the way for scaling up our StructTuning for stronger domain-specific LLMs with comprehensive data utilization.

Enhancing LLM's Cognition via Structurization,"Kai Liu, Zhihang Fu, Chao Chen, Wei Zhang, Rongxin Jiang, Fan Zhou, Yaowu Chen, Yue Wu, Jieping Ye","When reading long-form text, human cognition is complex and structurized. While large language models (LLMs) process input contexts through a causal and sequential perspective, this approach can potentially limit their ability to handle intricate and complex inputs effectively. To enhance LLM's cognition capability, this paper presents a novel concept of context structurization. Specifically, we transform the plain, unordered contextual sentences into well-ordered and hierarchically structurized elements. By doing so, LLMs can better grasp intricate and extended contexts through precise attention and information-seeking along the organized structures. Extensive evaluations are conducted across various model architectures and sizes (including a series of auto-regressive LLMs as well as BERT-like masking models) on a diverse set of NLP tasks (e.g., context-based question-answering, exhaustive hallucination evaluation, and passage-level dense retrieval). Empirical results show consistent and significant performance gains afforded by a single-round structurization. In particular, we boost the open-sourced LLaMA2-70B model to achieve comparable performance against GPT-3.5-Turbo as the hallucination evaluator. Besides, we show the feasibility of distilling advanced LLMs' language processing abilities to a smaller yet effective StruXGPT-7B to execute structurization, addressing the practicality of our approach.

FairFlow: An Automated Approach to Model-based Counterfactual Data Augmentation For NLP,"Ewoenam Kwaku Tokpo, Toon Calders","Despite the evolution of language models, they continue to portray harmful societal biases and stereotypes inadvertently learned from training data. These inherent biases often result in detrimental effects in various applications. Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA), which seeks to balance demographic attributes in training data, has been a widely adopted approach to mitigate bias in natural language processing. However, many existing CDA approaches rely on word substitution techniques using manually compiled word-pair dictionaries. These techniques often lead to out-of-context substitutions, resulting in potential quality issues. The advancement of model-based techniques, on the other hand, has been challenged by the need for parallel training data. Works in this area resort to manually generated parallel data that are expensive to collect and are consequently limited in scale. This paper proposes FairFlow, an automated approach to generating parallel data for training counterfactual text generator models that limits the need for human intervention. Furthermore, we show that FairFlow significantly overcomes the limitations of dictionary-based word-substitution approaches whilst maintaining good performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16431v1,2024-07

We also proposed an algorithm to compare the knowledge models for different versions of a guideline to discover the specific changes introduced in the treatment protocol of a new version. We created a question-answering (Q&A) framework with the guideline knowledge models as the augmented knowledge base to study our ability to query the knowledge models. We compiled a set of 32 question-answer pairs derived from two reliable data sources for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to evaluate the Q&A framework. The framework was evaluated against the question-answer pairs from one data source, and it can generate the answers with 54.5% accuracy from the treatment algorithm and 81.8% accuracy from the discussion part of the NCCN NSCLC guideline knowledge model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21053v1,2024-07

Evolutionary Prompt Design for LLM-Based Post-ASR Error Correction,"Rithik Sachdev, Zhong-Qiu Wang, Chao-Han Huck Yang","Building upon the strength of modern large language models (LLMs), generative error correction (GEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm that can elevate the performance of modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. One representative approach is to leverage in-context learning to prompt LLMs so that a better hypothesis can be generated by the LLMs based on a carefully-designed prompt and an $N$-best list of hypotheses produced by ASR systems. However, it is yet unknown whether the existing prompts are the most effective ones for the task of post-ASR error correction. In this context, this paper first explores alternative prompts to identify an initial set of effective prompts, and then proposes to employ an evolutionary prompt optimization algorithm to refine the initial prompts. Evaluations results on the CHiME-4 subset of the Task $1$ of the SLT $2024$ GenSEC challenge show the effectiveness and potential of the proposed algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16370v1,2024-07
FACTTRACK: Time-Aware World State Tracking in Story Outlines,"Zhiheng Lyu, Kevin Yang, Lingpeng Kong, Daniel Klein","While accurately detecting and correcting factual contradictions in language model outputs has become increasingly important as their capabilities improve, doing so is highly challenging. We propose a novel method, FACTTRACK, for tracking atomic facts and addressing factual contradictions. Crucially, FACTTRACK also maintains time-aware validity intervals for each fact, allowing for change over time. At a high level, FACTTRACK consists of a four-step pipeline to update a world state data structure for each new event: (1) decompose the event into directional atomic facts; (2) determine the validity interval of each atomic fact using the world state; (3) detect contradictions with existing facts in the world state; and finally (4) add new facts to the world state and update existing atomic facts. When we apply FACTTRACK to contradiction detection on structured story outlines, we find that FACTTRACK using LLaMA2-7B-Chat substantially outperforms a fair baseline using LLaMA2-7B-Chat, and achieves performance comparable to a GPT4 baseline. Moreover, when using GPT4, FACTTRACK significantly outperforms the GPT4 baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16347v1,2024-07
PrimeGuard: Safe and Helpful LLMs through Tuning-Free Routing,"Blazej Manczak, Eliott Zemour, Eric Lin, Vaikkunth Mugunthan","Deploying language models (LMs) necessitates outputs to be both high-quality and compliant with safety guidelines. Although Inference-Time Guardrails (ITG) offer solutions that shift model output distributions towards compliance, we find that current methods struggle in balancing safety with helpfulness. ITG Methods that safely address non-compliant queries exhibit lower helpfulness while those that prioritize helpfulness compromise on safety. We refer to this trade-off as the guardrail tax, analogous to the alignment tax. To address this, we propose PrimeGuard, a novel ITG method that utilizes structured control flow.   PrimeGuard routes requests to different self-instantiations of the LM with varying instructions, leveraging its inherent instruction-following capabilities and in-context learning. Our tuning-free approach dynamically compiles system-designer guidelines for each query. We construct and release safe-eval, a diverse red-team safety benchmark. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PrimeGuard, without fine-tuning, overcomes the guardrail tax by (1) significantly increasing resistance to iterative jailbreak attacks and (2) achieving state-of-the-art results in safety guardrailing while (3) matching helpfulness scores of alignment-tuned models. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PrimeGuard, without fine-tuning, outperforms all competing baselines and overcomes the guardrail tax by improving the fraction of safe responses from 61% to 97% and increasing average helpfulness scores from 4.17 to 4.29 on the largest models, while reducing attack success rate from 100% to 8%.   PrimeGuard implementation is available at https://github.com/dynamofl/PrimeGuard and safe-eval dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/dynamoai/safe_eval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16318v1,2024-07
Table-Filling via Mean Teacher for Cross-domain Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction,"Kun Peng, Lei Jiang, Qian Li, Haoran Li, Xiaoyan Yu, Li Sun, Shuo Sun, Yanxian Bi, Hao Peng","Cross-domain Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) aims to extract fine-grained sentiment elements from target domain sentences by leveraging the knowledge acquired from the source domain. Due to the absence of labeled data in the target domain, recent studies tend to rely on pre-trained language models to generate large amounts of synthetic data for training purposes. However, these approaches entail additional computational costs associated with the generation process. Different from them, we discover a striking resemblance between table-filling methods in ASTE and two-stage Object Detection (OD) in computer vision, which inspires us to revisit the cross-domain ASTE task and approach it from an OD standpoint. This allows the model to benefit from the OD extraction paradigm and region-level alignment. Building upon this premise, we propose a novel method named \textbf{T}able-\textbf{F}illing via \textbf{M}ean \textbf{T}eacher (TFMT). Specifically, the table-filling methods encode the sentence into a 2D table to detect word relations, while TFMT treats the table as a feature map and utilizes a region consistency to enhance the quality of those generated pseudo labels. Additionally, considering the existence of the domain gap, a cross-domain consistency based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy is designed to alleviate domain shift problems. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameters and computational costs, making it a strong baseline for cross-domain ASTE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21052v1,2024-07

Beyond Binary Gender: Evaluating Gender-Inclusive Machine Translation with Ambiguous Attitude Words,"Yijie Chen, Yijin Liu, Fandong Meng, Jinan Xu, Yufeng Chen, Jie Zhou","Gender bias has been a focal point in the study of bias in machine translation and language models. Existing machine translation gender bias evaluations are primarily focused on male and female genders, limiting the scope of the evaluation. To assess gender bias accurately, these studies often rely on calculating the accuracy of gender pronouns or the masculine and feminine attributes of grammatical gender via the stereotypes triggered by occupations or sentiment words ({\em i.e.}, clear positive or negative attitude), which cannot extend to non-binary groups. This study presents a benchmark AmbGIMT (Gender-Inclusive Machine Translation with Ambiguous attitude words), which assesses gender bias beyond binary gender. Meanwhile, we propose a novel process to evaluate gender bias based on the Emotional Attitude Score (EAS), which is used to quantify ambiguous attitude words. In evaluating three recent and effective open-source LLMs and one powerful multilingual translation-specific model, our main observations are: (1) The translation performance within non-binary gender contexts is markedly inferior in terms of translation quality and exhibits more negative attitudes than binary-gender contexts. (2) The analysis experiments indicate that incorporating constraint context in prompts for gender identity terms can substantially reduce translation bias, while the bias remains evident despite the presence of the constraints.

LawLuo: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework for Multi-Round Chinese Legal Consultation,"Jingyun Sun, Chengxiao Dai, Zhongze Luo, Yangbo Chang, Yang Li","Legal Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in providing legal consultations to non-experts. However, most existing Chinese legal consultation models are based on single-agent systems, which differ from real-world legal consultations, where multiple professionals collaborate to offer more tailored responses. To better simulate real consultations, we propose LawLuo, a multi-agent framework for multi-turn Chinese legal consultations. LawLuo includes four agents: the receptionist agent, which assesses user intent and selects a lawyer agent; the lawyer agent, which interacts with the user; the secretary agent, which organizes conversation records and generates consultation reports; and the boss agent, which evaluates the performance of the lawyer and secretary agents to ensure optimal results. These agents' interactions mimic the operations of real law firms. To train them to follow different legal instructions, we developed distinct fine-tuning datasets. We also introduce a case graph-based RAG to help the lawyer agent address vague user inputs. Experimental results show that LawLuo outperforms baselines in generating more personalized and professional responses, handling ambiguous queries, and following legal instructions in multi-turn conversations. Our full code and constructed datasets will be open-sourced upon paper acceptance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16252v3,2024-07
Exploring the Effectiveness and Consistency of Task Selection in Intermediate-Task Transfer Learning,"Pin-Jie Lin, Miaoran Zhang, Marius Mosbach, Dietrich Klakow","Identifying beneficial tasks to transfer from is a critical step toward successful intermediate-task transfer learning. In this work, we experiment with 130 source-target task combinations and demonstrate that the transfer performance exhibits severe variance across different source tasks and training seeds, highlighting the crucial role of intermediate-task selection in a broader context. We compare four representative task selection methods in a unified setup, focusing on their effectiveness and consistency. Compared to embedding-free methods and text embeddings, task embeddings constructed from fine-tuned weights can better estimate task transferability by improving task prediction scores from 2.59% to 3.96%. Despite their strong performance, we observe that the task embeddings do not consistently demonstrate superiority for tasks requiring reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method that measures pairwise token similarity using maximum inner product search, leading to the highest performance in task prediction. Our findings suggest that token-wise similarity is better predictive for predicting transferability compared to averaging weights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16245v1,2024-07
A Multi-view Mask Contrastive Learning Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Age Estimation,"Yiping Zhang, Yuntao Shou, Tao Meng, Wei Ai, Keqin Li","The age estimation task aims to use facial features to predict the age of people and is widely used in public security, marketing, identification, and other fields. However, the features are mainly concentrated in facial keypoints, and existing CNN and Transformer-based methods have inflexibility and redundancy for modeling complex irregular structures. Therefore, this paper proposes a Multi-view Mask Contrastive Learning Graph Convolutional Neural Network (MMCL-GCN) for age estimation. Specifically, the overall structure of the MMCL-GCN network contains a feature extraction stage and an age estimation stage. In the feature extraction stage, we introduce a graph structure to construct face images as input and then design a Multi-view Mask Contrastive Learning (MMCL) mechanism to learn complex structural and semantic information about face images. The learning mechanism employs an asymmetric siamese network architecture, which utilizes an online encoder-decoder structure to reconstruct the missing information from the original graph and utilizes the target encoder to learn latent representations for contrastive learning. Furthermore, to promote the two learning mechanisms better compatible and complementary, we adopt two augmentation strategies and optimize the joint losses. In the age estimation stage, we design a Multi-layer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-IELM) with identity mapping to fully use the features extracted by the online encoder. Then, a classifier and a regressor were constructed based on ML-IELM, which were used to identify the age grouping interval and accurately estimate the final age. Extensive experiments show that MMCL-GCN can effectively reduce the error of age estimation on benchmark datasets such as Adience, MORPH-II, and LAP-2016.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16234v1,2024-07
PreAlign: Boosting Cross-Lingual Transfer by Early Establishment of Multilingual Alignment,"Jiahuan Li, Shujian Huang, Aarron Ching, Xinyu Dai, Jiajun Chen","Large language models demonstrate reasonable multilingual abilities, despite predominantly English-centric pretraining. However, the spontaneous multilingual alignment in these models is shown to be weak, leading to unsatisfactory cross-lingual transfer and knowledge sharing. Previous works attempt to address this issue by explicitly injecting multilingual alignment information during or after pretraining. Thus for the early stage in pretraining, the alignment is weak for sharing information or knowledge across languages. In this paper, we propose PreAlign, a framework that establishes multilingual alignment prior to language model pretraining. PreAlign injects multilingual alignment by initializing the model to generate similar representations of aligned words and preserves this alignment using a code-switching strategy during pretraining. Extensive experiments in a synthetic English to English-Clone setting demonstrate that PreAlign significantly outperforms standard multilingual joint training in language modeling, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, and cross-lingual knowledge application. Further experiments in real-world scenarios further validate PreAlign's effectiveness across various model sizes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16222v3,2024-07
Do LLMs Know When to NOT Answer? Investigating Abstention Abilities of Large Language Models,"Nishanth Madhusudhan, Sathwik Tejaswi Madhusudhan, Vikas Yadav, Masoud Hashemi","Abstention Ability (AA) is a critical aspect of Large Language Model (LLM) reliability, referring to an LLM's capability to withhold responses when uncertain or lacking a definitive answer, without compromising performance. Although previous studies have attempted to improve AA, they lack a standardised evaluation method and remain unsuitable for black-box models where token prediction probabilities are inaccessible. This makes comparative analysis challenging, especially for state-of-the-art closed-source commercial LLMs. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a black-box evaluation approach and a new dataset, Abstain-QA, crafted to rigorously assess AA across varied question types (answerable and unanswerable), domains (well-represented and under-represented), and task types (fact centric and reasoning). We also propose a new confusion matrix, the ''Answerable-Unanswerable Confusion Matrix'' (AUCM) which serves as the basis for evaluating AA, by offering a structured and precise approach for assessment. Finally, we explore the impact of three prompting strategies-Strict Prompting, Verbal Confidence Thresholding, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-on improving AA. Our results indicate that even powerful models like GPT-4, Mixtral 8x22b encounter difficulties with abstention; however, strategic approaches such as Strict prompting and CoT can enhance this capability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16221v2,2024-07

However, the mixed quality of training data can lead to the generation of undesired responses, presenting a significant challenge. Over the past two years, various methods have been proposed from different perspectives to enhance LLMs, particularly in aligning them with human expectation. Despite these efforts, there has not been a comprehensive survey paper that categorizes and details these approaches. In this work, we aim to address this gap by categorizing these papers into distinct topics and providing detailed explanations of each alignment method, thereby helping readers gain a thorough understanding of the current state of the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16216v1,2024-07
Graph-Structured Speculative Decoding,"Zhuocheng Gong, Jiahao Liu, Ziyue Wang, Pengfei Wu, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Dongyan Zhao, Rui Yan","Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) by employing a small language model to draft a hypothesis sequence, which is then validated by the LLM. The effectiveness of this approach heavily relies on the balance between performance and efficiency of the draft model. In our research, we focus on enhancing the proportion of draft tokens that are accepted to the final output by generating multiple hypotheses instead of just one. This allows the LLM more options to choose from and select the longest sequence that meets its standards. Our analysis reveals that hypotheses produced by the draft model share many common token sequences, suggesting a potential for optimizing computation. Leveraging this observation, we introduce an innovative approach utilizing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to manage the drafted hypotheses. This structure enables us to efficiently predict and merge recurring token sequences, vastly reducing the computational demands of the draft model. We term this approach Graph-structured Speculative Decoding (GSD). We apply GSD across a range of LLMs, including a 70-billion parameter LLaMA-2 model, and observe a remarkable speedup of 1.73$\times$ to 1.96$\times$, significantly surpassing standard speculative decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16207v1,2024-07
Figure it Out: Analyzing-based Jailbreak Attack on Large Language Models,"Shi Lin, Rongchang Li, Xun Wang, Changting Lin, Wenpeng Xing, Meng Han","The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought remarkable generative capabilities across diverse tasks. However, despite the impressive achievements, these LLMs still have numerous inherent vulnerabilities, particularly when faced with jailbreak attacks. By investigating jailbreak attacks, we can uncover hidden weaknesses in LLMs and inform the development of more robust defense mechanisms to fortify their security. In this paper, we further explore the boundary of jailbreak attacks on LLMs and propose Analyzing-based Jailbreak (ABJ). This effective jailbreak attack method takes advantage of LLMs' growing analyzing and reasoning capability and reveals their underlying vulnerabilities when facing analyzing-based tasks. We conduct a detailed evaluation of ABJ across various open-source and closed-source LLMs, which achieves 94.8% attack success rate (ASR) and 1.06 attack efficiency (AE) on GPT-4-turbo-0409, demonstrating state-of-the-art attack effectiveness and efficiency. Our research highlights the importance of prioritizing and enhancing the safety of LLMs to mitigate the risks of misuse. The code is publicly available at hhttps://github.com/theshi-1128/ABJ-Attack.

How to Leverage Personal Textual Knowledge for Personalized Conversational Information Retrieval,"Fengran Mo, Longxiang Zhao, Kaiyu Huang, Yue Dong, Degen Huang, Jian-Yun Nie","Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) combines conversational and personalizable elements to satisfy various users' complex information needs through multi-turn interaction based on their backgrounds. The key promise is that the personal textual knowledge base (PTKB) can improve the CIR effectiveness because the retrieval results can be more related to the user's background. However, PTKB is noisy: not every piece of knowledge in PTKB is relevant to the specific query at hand. In this paper, we explore and test several ways to select knowledge from PTKB and use it for query reformulation by using a large language model (LLM). The experimental results show the PTKB might not always improve the search results when used alone, but LLM can help generate a more appropriate personalized query when high-quality guidance is provided.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16192v1,2024-07
Artificial Agency and Large Language Models,"Maud van Lier, Gorka Muñoz-Gil","The arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stirred up philosophical debates about the possibility of realizing agency in an artificial manner. In this work we contribute to the debate by presenting a theoretical model that can be used as a threshold conception for artificial agents. The model defines agents as systems whose actions and goals are always influenced by a dynamic framework of factors that consists of the agent's accessible history, its adaptive repertoire and its external environment. This framework, in turn, is influenced by the actions that the agent takes and the goals that it forms. We show with the help of the model that state-of-the-art LLMs are not agents yet, but that there are elements to them that suggest a way forward. The paper argues that a combination of the agent architecture presented in Park et al. (2023) together with the use of modules like the Coscientist in Boiko et al. (2023) could potentially be a way to realize agency in an artificial manner. We end the paper by reflecting on the obstacles one might face in building such an artificial agent and by presenting possible directions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16190v2,2024-07
An Active Inference Strategy for Prompting Reliable Responses from Large Language Models in Medical Practice,"Roma Shusterman, Allison C. Waters, Shannon O`Neill, Phan Luu, Don M. Tucker","Continuing advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) in artificial intelligence offer important capacities in intuitively accessing and using medical knowledge in many contexts, including education and training as well as assessment and treatment. Most of the initial literature on LLMs in medicine has emphasized that LLMs are unsuitable for medical use because they are non-deterministic, may provide incorrect or harmful responses, and cannot be regulated to assure quality control. If these issues could be corrected, optimizing LLM technology could benefit patients and physicians by providing affordable, point-of-care medical knowledge. Our proposed framework refines LLM responses by restricting their primary knowledge base to domain-specific datasets containing validated medical information. Additionally, we introduce an actor-critic LLM prompting protocol based on active inference principles of human cognition, where a Therapist agent initially responds to patient queries, and a Supervisor agent evaluates and adjusts responses to ensure accuracy and reliability. We conducted a validation study where expert cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) therapists evaluated responses from the LLM in a blind format. Experienced human CBT-I therapists assessed responses to 100 patient queries, comparing LLM-generated responses with appropriate and inappropriate responses crafted by experienced CBT-I therapists. Results showed that LLM responses received high ratings from the CBT-I therapists, often exceeding those of therapist-generated appropriate responses. This structured approach aims to integrate advanced LLM technology into medical applications, meeting regulatory requirements for establishing the safe and effective use of special purpose validated LLMs in medicine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21051v1,2024-07
Structural Optimization Ambiguity and Simplicity Bias in Unsupervised Neural Grammar Induction,"Jinwook Park, Kangil Kim","Neural parameterization has significantly advanced unsupervised grammar induction. However, training these models with a traditional likelihood loss for all possible parses exacerbates two issues: 1) $\textit{structural optimization ambiguity}$ that arbitrarily selects one among structurally ambiguous optimal grammars despite the specific preference of gold parses, and 2) $\textit{structural simplicity bias}$ that leads a model to underutilize rules to compose parse trees. These challenges subject unsupervised neural grammar induction (UNGI) to inevitable prediction errors, high variance, and the necessity for extensive grammars to achieve accurate predictions. This paper tackles these issues, offering a comprehensive analysis of their origins. As a solution, we introduce $\textit{sentence-wise parse-focusing}$ to reduce the parse pool per sentence for loss evaluation, using the structural bias from pre-trained parsers on the same dataset. In unsupervised parsing benchmark tests, our method significantly improves performance while effectively reducing variance and bias toward overly simplistic parses.

Robust Privacy Amidst Innovation with Large Language Models Through a Critical Assessment of the Risks,"Yao-Shun Chuang, Atiquer Rahman Sarkar, Yu-Chun Hsu, Noman Mohammed, Xiaoqian Jiang","This study examines integrating EHRs and NLP with large language models (LLMs) to improve healthcare data management and patient care. It focuses on using advanced models to create secure, HIPAA-compliant synthetic patient notes for biomedical research. The study used de-identified and re-identified MIMIC III datasets with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Mistral 7B to generate synthetic notes. Text generation employed templates and keyword extraction for contextually relevant notes, with one-shot generation for comparison. Privacy assessment checked PHI occurrence, while text utility was tested using an ICD-9 coding task. Text quality was evaluated with ROUGE and cosine similarity metrics to measure semantic similarity with source notes. Analysis of PHI occurrence and text utility via the ICD-9 coding task showed that the keyword-based method had low risk and good performance. One-shot generation showed the highest PHI exposure and PHI co-occurrence, especially in geographic location and date categories. The Normalized One-shot method achieved the highest classification accuracy. Privacy analysis revealed a critical balance between data utility and privacy protection, influencing future data use and sharing. Re-identified data consistently outperformed de-identified data. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of keyword-based methods in generating privacy-protecting synthetic clinical notes that retain data usability, potentially transforming clinical data-sharing practices. The superior performance of re-identified over de-identified data suggests a shift towards methods that enhance utility and privacy by using dummy PHIs to perplex privacy attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16166v2,2024-07

Walji","This research addresses the issue of missing structured data in dental records by extracting diagnostic information from unstructured text. The updated periodontology classification system's complexity has increased incomplete or missing structured diagnoses. To tackle this, we use advanced AI and NLP methods, leveraging GPT-4 to generate synthetic notes for fine-tuning a RoBERTa model. This significantly enhances the model's ability to understand medical and dental language. We evaluated the model using 120 randomly selected clinical notes from two datasets, demonstrating its improved diagnostic extraction accuracy. The results showed high accuracy in diagnosing periodontal status, stage, and grade, with Site 1 scoring 0.99 and Site 2 scoring 0.98. In the subtype category, Site 2 achieved perfect scores, outperforming Site 1. This method enhances extraction accuracy and broadens its use across dental contexts. The study underscores AI and NLP's transformative impact on healthcare delivery and management. Integrating AI and NLP technologies enhances documentation and simplifies administrative tasks by precisely extracting complex clinical information. This approach effectively addresses challenges in dental diagnostics. Using synthetic training data from LLMs optimizes the training process, improving accuracy and efficiency in identifying periodontal diagnoses from clinical notes.

UniMEL: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Entity Linking with Large Language Models,"Liu Qi, He Yongyi, Lian Defu, Zheng Zhi, Xu Tong, Liu Che, Chen Enhong","Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) is a crucial task that aims at linking ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to the referent entities in a multimodal knowledge base, such as Wikipedia. Existing methods focus heavily on using complex mechanisms and extensive model tuning methods to model the multimodal interaction on specific datasets. However, these methods overcomplicate the MEL task and overlook the visual semantic information, which makes them costly and hard to scale. Moreover, these methods can not solve the issues like textual ambiguity, redundancy, and noisy images, which severely degrade their performance. Fortunately, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust capabilities in text understanding and reasoning, particularly Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that can process multimodal inputs, provides new insights into addressing this challenge. However, how to design a universally applicable LLMs-based MEL approach remains a pressing challenge. To this end, we propose UniMEL, a unified framework which establishes a new paradigm to process multimodal entity linking tasks using LLMs. In this framework, we employ LLMs to augment the representation of mentions and entities individually by integrating textual and visual information and refining textual information. Subsequently, we employ the embedding-based method for retrieving and re-ranking candidate entities. Then, with only ~0.26% of the model parameters fine-tuned, LLMs can make the final selection from the candidate entities. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solution achieves state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies verify the effectiveness of all modules.

DDK: Distilling Domain Knowledge for Efficient Large Language Models,"Jiaheng Liu, Chenchen Zhang, Jinyang Guo, Yuanxing Zhang, Haoran Que, Ken Deng, Zhiqi Bai, Jie Liu, Ge Zhang, Jiakai Wang, Yanan Wu, Congnan Liu, Wenbo Su, Jiamang Wang, Lin Qu, Bo Zheng","Despite the advanced intelligence abilities of large language models (LLMs) in various applications, they still face significant computational and storage demands. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective strategy to improve the performance of a smaller LLM (i.e., the student model) by transferring knowledge from a high-performing LLM (i.e., the teacher model). Prevailing techniques in LLM distillation typically use a black-box model API to generate high-quality pretrained and aligned datasets, or utilize white-box distillation by altering the loss function to better transfer knowledge from the teacher LLM. However, these methods ignore the knowledge differences between the student and teacher LLMs across domains. This results in excessive focus on domains with minimal performance gaps and insufficient attention to domains with large gaps, reducing overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM distillation framework called DDK, which dynamically adjusts the composition of the distillation dataset in a smooth manner according to the domain performance differences between the teacher and student models, making the distillation process more stable and effective. Extensive evaluations show that DDK significantly improves the performance of student models, outperforming both continuously pretrained baselines and existing knowledge distillation methods by a large margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16154v1,2024-07
CHIME: LLM-Assisted Hierarchical Organization of Scientific Studies for Literature Review Support,"Chao-Chun Hsu, Erin Bransom, Jenna Sparks, Bailey Kuehl, Chenhao Tan, David Wadden, Lucy Lu Wang, Aakanksha Naik","Literature review requires researchers to synthesize a large amount of information and is increasingly challenging as the scientific literature expands. In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs for producing hierarchical organizations of scientific studies to assist researchers with literature review. We define hierarchical organizations as tree structures where nodes refer to topical categories and every node is linked to the studies assigned to that category. Our naive LLM-based pipeline for hierarchy generation from a set of studies produces promising yet imperfect hierarchies, motivating us to collect CHIME, an expert-curated dataset for this task focused on biomedicine. Given the challenging and time-consuming nature of building hierarchies from scratch, we use a human-in-the-loop process in which experts correct errors (both links between categories and study assignment) in LLM-generated hierarchies. CHIME contains 2,174 LLM-generated hierarchies covering 472 topics, and expert-corrected hierarchies for a subset of 100 topics. Expert corrections allow us to quantify LLM performance, and we find that while they are quite good at generating and organizing categories, their assignment of studies to categories could be improved. We attempt to train a corrector model with human feedback which improves study assignment by 12.6 F1 points. We release our dataset and models to encourage research on developing better assistive tools for literature review.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16148v1,2024-07
Evaluating Long Range Dependency Handling in Code Generation Models using Multi-Step Key Retrieval,"Yannick Assogba, Donghao Ren","As language models support larger and larger context sizes, evaluating their ability to make effective use of that context becomes increasingly important. We analyze the ability of several code generation models to handle long range dependencies using a suite of multi-step key retrieval tasks in context windows up to 8k tokens in length. The tasks progressively increase in difficulty and allow more nuanced evaluation of model capabilities than tests like the popular needle-in-the-haystack test. We find that performance degrades significantly (up to 2x) when a function references another function that is defined later in the prompt. We also observe that models that use sliding window attention mechanisms have difficulty handling references further than the size of a single window. We perform simple prompt modifications using call graph information to improve multi-step retrieval performance up to 3x. Our analysis highlights different facets of long-context performance and is suggestive of prompt construction strategies for code completion tools",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21049v1,2024-07
Finetuning Generative Large Language Models with Discrimination Instructions for Knowledge Graph Completion,"Yang Liu, Xiaobin Tian, Zequn Sun, Wei Hu","Traditional knowledge graph (KG) completion models learn embeddings to predict missing facts. Recent works attempt to complete KGs in a text-generation manner with large language models (LLMs). However, they need to ground the output of LLMs to KG entities, which inevitably brings errors. In this paper, we present a finetuning framework, DIFT, aiming to unleash the KG completion ability of LLMs and avoid grounding errors. Given an incomplete fact, DIFT employs a lightweight model to obtain candidate entities and finetunes an LLM with discrimination instructions to select the correct one from the given candidates. To improve performance while reducing instruction data, DIFT uses a truncated sampling method to select useful facts for finetuning and injects KG embeddings into the LLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16127v1,2024-07
APTNESS: Incorporating Appraisal Theory and Emotion Support Strategies for Empathetic Response Generation,"Yuxuan Hu, Minghuan Tan, Chenwei Zhang, Zixuan Li, Xiaodan Liang, Min Yang, Chengming Li, Xiping Hu","Empathetic response generation is designed to comprehend the emotions of others and select the most appropriate strategies to assist them in resolving emotional challenges. Empathy can be categorized into cognitive empathy and affective empathy. The former pertains to the ability to understand and discern the emotional issues and situations of others, while the latter involves the capacity to provide comfort. To enhance one's empathetic abilities, it is essential to develop both these aspects. Therefore, we develop an innovative framework that combines retrieval augmentation and emotional support strategy integration. Our framework starts with the introduction of a comprehensive emotional palette for empathy. We then apply appraisal theory to decompose this palette and create a database of empathetic responses. This database serves as an external resource and enhances the LLM's empathy by integrating semantic retrieval mechanisms. Moreover, our framework places a strong emphasis on the proper articulation of response strategies. By incorporating emotional support strategies, we aim to enrich the model's capabilities in both cognitive and affective empathy, leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive empathetic response. Finally, we extract datasets ED and ET from the empathetic dialogue dataset \textsc{EmpatheticDialogues} and ExTES based on dialogue length. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can enhance the empathy ability of LLMs from both cognitive and affective empathy perspectives. Our code is released at https://github.com/CAS-SIAT-XinHai/APTNESS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21048v1,2024-07
Analyzing Polysemy Evolution Using Semantic Cells,"Yukio Ohsawa, Dingming Xue, Kaira Sekiguchi","The senses of words evolve. The sense of the same word may change from today to tomorrow, and multiple senses of the same word may be the result of the evolution of each other, that is, they may be parents and children. If we view Juba as an evolving ecosystem, the paradigm of learning the correct answer, which does not move with the sense of a word, is no longer valid. This paper is a case study that shows that word polysemy is an evolutionary consequence of the modification of Semantic Cells, which has al-ready been presented by the author, by introducing a small amount of diversity in its initial state as an example of analyzing the current set of short sentences. In particular, the analysis of a sentence sequence of 1000 sentences in some order for each of the four senses of the word Spring, collected using Chat GPT, shows that the word acquires the most polysemy monotonically in the analysis when the senses are arranged in the order in which they have evolved. In other words, we present a method for analyzing the dynamism of a word's acquiring polysemy with evolution and, at the same time, a methodology for viewing polysemy from an evolutionary framework rather than a learning-based one.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16110v3,2024-07

Rossi, Franck Dernoncourt","Question-answering for domain-specific applications has recently attracted much interest due to the latest advancements in large language models (LLMs). However, accurately assessing the performance of these applications remains a challenge, mainly due to the lack of suitable benchmarks that effectively simulate real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce two product question-answering (QA) datasets focused on Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop products to help evaluate the performance of existing models on domain-specific product QA tasks. Additionally, we propose a novel knowledge-driven RAG-QA framework to enhance the performance of the models in the product QA task. Our experiments demonstrated that inducing domain knowledge through query reformulation allowed for increased retrieval and generative performance when compared to standard RAG-QA methods. This improvement, however, is slight, and thus illustrates the challenge posed by the datasets introduced.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16073v1,2024-07
Leveraging Large Language Models to Geolocate Linguistic Variations in Social Media Posts,"Davide Savarro, Davide Zago, Stefano Zoia","Geolocalization of social media content is the task of determining the geographical location of a user based on textual data, that may show linguistic variations and informal language. In this project, we address the GeoLingIt challenge of geolocalizing tweets written in Italian by leveraging large language models (LLMs). GeoLingIt requires the prediction of both the region and the precise coordinates of the tweet. Our approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs to simultaneously predict these geolocalization aspects. By integrating innovative methodologies, we enhance the models' ability to understand the nuances of Italian social media text to improve the state-of-the-art in this domain. This work is conducted as part of the Large Language Models course at the Bertinoro International Spring School 2024.

Leveraging LLM Reasoning Enhances Personalized Recommender Systems,"Alicia Y. Tsai, Adam Kraft, Long Jin, Chenwei Cai, Anahita Hosseini, Taibai Xu, Zemin Zhang, Lichan Hong, Ed H. Chi, Xinyang Yi","Recent advancements have showcased the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in executing reasoning tasks, particularly facilitated by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. While tasks like arithmetic reasoning involve clear, definitive answers and logical chains of thought, the application of LLM reasoning in recommendation systems (RecSys) presents a distinct challenge. RecSys tasks revolve around subjectivity and personalized preferences, an under-explored domain in utilizing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our study explores several aspects to better understand reasoning for RecSys and demonstrate how task quality improves by utilizing LLM reasoning in both zero-shot and finetuning settings. Additionally, we propose RecSAVER (Recommender Systems Automatic Verification and Evaluation of Reasoning) to automatically assess the quality of LLM reasoning responses without the requirement of curated gold references or human raters. We show that our framework aligns with real human judgment on the coherence and faithfulness of reasoning responses. Overall, our work shows that incorporating reasoning into RecSys can improve personalized tasks, paving the way for further advancements in recommender system methodologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00802v1,2024-07
Enhancing Temporal Understanding in LLMs for Semi-structured Tables,"Irwin Deng, Kushagra Dixit, Vivek Gupta, Dan Roth","Temporal reasoning over tabular data presents substantial challenges for large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent research. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of temporal datasets to pinpoint the specific limitations of LLMs. Our investigation leads to enhancements in TempTabQA, a dataset specifically designed for tabular temporal question answering. We provide critical insights for improving LLM performance in temporal reasoning tasks with tabular data. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach, C.L.E.A.R to strengthen LLM capabilities in this domain. Our findings demonstrate that our method significantly improves evidence-based reasoning across various models. Additionally, our experimental results reveal that indirect supervision with auxiliary data substantially boosts model performance in these tasks.

Boosting Reward Model with Preference-Conditional Multi-Aspect Synthetic Data Generation,"Jiaming Shen, Ran Xu, Yennie Jun, Zhen Qin, Tianqi Liu, Carl Yang, Yi Liang, Simon Baumgartner, Michael Bendersky","Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. They are trained using preference datasets where each example consists of one input prompt, two responses, and a preference label. As curating a high-quality human labeled preference dataset is both time-consuming and expensive, people often rely on existing powerful LLMs for preference label generation. This can potentially introduce noise and impede RM training. In this work, we present RMBoost, a novel synthetic preference data generation paradigm to boost reward model quality. Unlike traditional methods, which generate two responses before obtaining the preference label, RMBoost first generates one response and selects a preference label, followed by generating the second more (or less) preferred response conditioned on the pre-selected preference label and the first response. This approach offers two main advantages. First, RMBoost reduces labeling noise since preference pairs are constructed intentionally. Second, RMBoost facilitates the creation of more diverse responses by incorporating various quality aspects (e.g., helpfulness, relevance, completeness) into the prompts. We conduct extensive experiments across three diverse datasets and demonstrate that RMBoost outperforms other synthetic preference data generation techniques and significantly boosts the performance of four distinct reward models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16008v1,2024-07
SocialQuotes: Learning Contextual Roles of Social Media Quotes on the Web,"John Palowitch, Hamidreza Alvari, Mehran Kazemi, Tanvir Amin, Filip Radlinski","Web authors frequently embed social media to support and enrich their content, creating the potential to derive web-based, cross-platform social media representations that can enable more effective social media retrieval systems and richer scientific analyses. As step toward such capabilities, we introduce a novel language modeling framework that enables automatic annotation of roles that social media entities play in their embedded web context. Using related communication theory, we liken social media embeddings to quotes, formalize the page context as structured natural language signals, and identify a taxonomy of roles for quotes within the page context. We release SocialQuotes, a new data set built from the Common Crawl of over 32 million social quotes, 8.3k of them with crowdsourced quote annotations. Using SocialQuotes and the accompanying annotations, we provide a role classification case study, showing reasonable performance with modern-day LLMs, and exposing explainable aspects of our framework via page content ablations. We also classify a large batch of un-annotated quotes, revealing interesting cross-domain, cross-platform role distributions on the web.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16007v1,2024-07
Multimodal Input Aids a Bayesian Model of Phonetic Learning,"Sophia Zhi, Roger P. Levy, Stephan C. Meylan","One of the many tasks facing the typically-developing child language learner is learning to discriminate between the distinctive sounds that make up words in their native language. Here we investigate whether multimodal information--specifically adult speech coupled with video frames of speakers' faces--benefits a computational model of phonetic learning. We introduce a method for creating high-quality synthetic videos of speakers' faces for an existing audio corpus. Our learning model, when both trained and tested on audiovisual inputs, achieves up to a 8.1% relative improvement on a phoneme discrimination battery compared to a model trained and tested on audio-only input. It also outperforms the audio model by up to 3.9% when both are tested on audio-only data, suggesting that visual information facilitates the acquisition of acoustic distinctions. Visual information is especially beneficial in noisy audio environments, where an audiovisual model closes 67% of the loss in discrimination performance of the audio model in noise relative to a non-noisy environment. These results demonstrate that visual information benefits an ideal learner and illustrate some of the ways that children might be able to leverage visual cues when learning to discriminate speech sounds.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15992v1,2024-07
Multilingual Fine-Grained News Headline Hallucination Detection,"Jiaming Shen, Tianqi Liu, Jialu Liu, Zhen Qin, Jay Pavagadhi, Simon Baumgartner, Michael Bendersky","The popularity of automated news headline generation has surged with advancements in pre-trained language models. However, these models often suffer from the ``hallucination'' problem, where the generated headline is not fully supported by its source article. Efforts to address this issue have predominantly focused on English, using over-simplistic classification schemes that overlook nuanced hallucination types. In this study, we introduce the first multilingual, fine-grained news headline hallucination detection dataset that contains over 11 thousand pairs in 5 languages, each annotated with detailed hallucination types by experts. We conduct extensive experiments on this dataset under two settings. First, we implement several supervised fine-tuning approaches as preparatory solutions and demonstrate this dataset's challenges and utilities. Second, we test various large language models' in-context learning abilities and propose two novel techniques, language-dependent demonstration selection and coarse-to-fine prompting, to boost the few-shot hallucination detection performance in terms of the example-F1 metric. We release this dataset to foster further research in multilingual, fine-grained headline hallucination detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15975v1,2024-07
Promises and Pitfalls of Generative Masked Language Modeling: Theoretical Framework and Practical Guidelines,"Yuchen Li, Alexandre Kirchmeyer, Aashay Mehta, Yilong Qin, Boris Dadachev, Kishore Papineni, Sanjiv Kumar, Andrej Risteski","Autoregressive language models are the currently dominant paradigm for text generation, but they have some fundamental limitations that cannot be remedied by scale-for example inherently sequential and unidirectional generation. While alternate classes of models have been explored, we have limited mathematical understanding of their fundamental power and limitations. In this paper we focus on Generative Masked Language Models (GMLMs), a non-autoregressive paradigm in which we train a model to fit conditional probabilities of the data distribution via masking, which are subsequently used as inputs to a Markov Chain to draw samples from the model, These models empirically strike a promising speed-quality trade-off as each step can be typically parallelized by decoding the entire sequence in parallel. We develop a mathematical framework for analyzing and improving such models which sheds light on questions of sample complexity and inference speed and quality. Empirically, we adapt the T5 model for iteratively-refined parallel decoding, achieving 2-3x speedup in machine translation with minimal sacrifice in quality compared with autoregressive models. We run careful ablation experiments to give recommendations on key design choices, and make fine-grained observations on the common error modes in connection with our theory. Our mathematical analyses and empirical observations characterize both potentials and limitations of this approach, and can be applied to future works on improving understanding and performance of GMLMs. Our codes are released at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/padir",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21046v1,2024-07
Benchmarks as Microscopes: A Call for Model Metrology,"Michael Saxon, Ari Holtzman, Peter West, William Yang Wang, Naomi Saphra","Modern language models (LMs) pose a new challenge in capability assessment. Static benchmarks inevitably saturate without providing confidence in the deployment tolerances of LM-based systems, but developers nonetheless claim that their models have generalized traits such as reasoning or open-domain language understanding based on these flawed metrics. The science and practice of LMs requires a new approach to benchmarking which measures specific capabilities with dynamic assessments. To be confident in our metrics, we need a new discipline of model metrology -- one which focuses on how to generate benchmarks that predict performance under deployment. Motivated by our evaluation criteria, we outline how building a community of model metrology practitioners -- one focused on building tools and studying how to measure system capabilities -- is the best way to meet these needs to and add clarity to the AI discussion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16711v2,2024-07
dMel: Speech Tokenization made Simple,"He Bai, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Ruixiang Zhang, Zijin Gu, Zakaria Aldeneh, Navdeep Jaitly","Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing by leveraging self-supervised pretraining on vast textual data. Inspired by this success, researchers have investigated complicated speech tokenization methods to discretize continuous speech signals so that language modeling techniques can be applied to speech data. However, existing approaches either model semantic (content) tokens, potentially losing acoustic information, or model acoustic tokens, risking the loss of semantic (content) information. Having multiple token types also complicates the architecture and requires additional pretraining. Here we show that discretizing mel-filterbank channels into discrete intensity bins produces a simple representation (dMel), that performs better than other existing speech tokenization methods. Using an LM-style transformer architecture for speech-text modeling, we comprehensively evaluate different speech tokenization methods on speech recognition (ASR) and speech synthesis (TTS). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of dMel in achieving high performance on both tasks within a unified framework, paving the way for efficient and effective joint modeling of speech and text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15835v2,2024-07
J-CHAT: Japanese Large-scale Spoken Dialogue Corpus for Spoken Dialogue Language Modeling,"Wataru Nakata, Kentaro Seki, Hitomi Yanaka, Yuki Saito, Shinnosuke Takamichi, Hiroshi Saruwatari","Spoken dialogue plays a crucial role in human-AI interactions, necessitating dialogue-oriented spoken language models (SLMs). To develop versatile SLMs, large-scale and diverse speech datasets are essential. Additionally, to ensure hiqh-quality speech generation, the data must be spontaneous like in-wild data and must be acoustically clean with noise removed. Despite the critical need, no open-source corpus meeting all these criteria has been available. This study addresses this gap by constructing and releasing a large-scale spoken dialogue corpus, named Japanese Corpus for Human-AI Talks (J-CHAT), which is publicly accessible. Furthermore, this paper presents a language-independent method for corpus construction and describes experiments on dialogue generation using SLMs trained on J-CHAT. Experimental results indicate that the collected data from multiple domains by our method improve the naturalness and meaningfulness of dialogue generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15828v1,2024-07
Perceptions of Linguistic Uncertainty by Language Models and Humans,"Catarina G Belem, Markelle Kelly, Mark Steyvers, Sameer Singh, Padhraic Smyth","_Uncertainty expressions_ such as ""probably"" or ""highly unlikely"" are pervasive in human language. While prior work has established that there is population-level agreement in terms of how humans quantitatively interpret these expressions, there has been little inquiry into the abilities of language models in the same context. In this paper, we investigate how language models map linguistic expressions of uncertainty to numerical responses. Our approach assesses whether language models can employ theory of mind in this setting: understanding the uncertainty of another agent about a particular statement, independently of the model's own certainty about that statement. We find that 7 out of 10 models are able to map uncertainty expressions to probabilistic responses in a human-like manner. However, we observe systematically different behavior depending on whether a statement is actually true or false. This sensitivity indicates that language models are substantially more susceptible to bias based on their prior knowledge (as compared to humans). These findings raise important questions and have broad implications for human-AI and AI-AI communication.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15814v2,2024-07

In this paper, we present FSboard, an American Sign Language fingerspelling dataset situated in a mobile text entry use case, collected from 147 paid and consenting Deaf signers using Pixel 4A selfie cameras in a variety of environments. Fingerspelling recognition is an incomplete solution that is only one small part of sign language translation, but it could provide some immediate benefit to Deaf/Hard of Hearing signers as more broadly capable technology develops. At >3 million characters in length and >250 hours in duration, FSboard is the largest fingerspelling recognition dataset to date by a factor of >10x. As a simple baseline, we finetune 30 Hz MediaPipe Holistic landmark inputs into ByT5-Small and achieve 11.1% Character Error Rate (CER) on a test set with unique phrases and signers.

Extracting Structured Insights from Financial News: An Augmented LLM Driven Approach,"Rian Dolphin, Joe Dursun, Jonathan Chow, Jarrett Blankenship, Katie Adams, Quinton Pike","Financial news plays a crucial role in decision-making processes across the financial sector, yet the efficient processing of this information into a structured format remains challenging. This paper presents a novel approach to financial news processing that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome limitations that previously prevented the extraction of structured data from unstructured financial news. We introduce a system that extracts relevant company tickers from raw news article content, performs sentiment analysis at the company level, and generates summaries, all without relying on pre-structured data feeds. Our methodology combines the generative capabilities of LLMs, and recent prompting techniques, with a robust validation framework that uses a tailored string similarity approach. Evaluation on a dataset of 5530 financial news articles demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, with 90% of articles not missing any tickers compared with current data providers, and 22% of articles having additional relevant tickers. In addition to this paper, the methodology has been implemented at scale with the resulting processed data made available through a live API endpoint, which is updated in real-time with the latest news. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first data provider to offer granular, per-company sentiment analysis from news articles, enhancing the depth of information available to market participants. We also release the evaluation dataset of 5530 processed articles as a static file, which we hope will facilitate further research leveraging financial news.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15788v1,2024-07

A key challenge is to develop steerable language models that trade-off multiple (conflicting) objectives in a flexible and efficient manner. This paper presents Conditional Language Policy (CLP), a general framework for finetuning language models on multiple objectives. Building on techniques from multi-task training and parameter-efficient finetuning, CLP learn steerable models that effectively trade-off conflicting objectives at inference time. Notably, this does not require training or maintaining multiple models to achieve different trade-offs between the objectives. Through extensive experiments and ablations on two summarization datasets, we show that CLP learns steerable language models that outperform and Pareto-dominate the existing approaches for multi-objective finetuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15762v2,2024-07
LongVideoBench: A Benchmark for Long-context Interleaved Video-Language Understanding,"Haoning Wu, Dongxu Li, Bei Chen, Junnan Li","Large multimodal models (LMMs) are processing increasingly longer and richer inputs. Albeit the progress, few public benchmark is available to measure such development. To mitigate this gap, we introduce LongVideoBench, a question-answering benchmark that features video-language interleaved inputs up to an hour long. Our benchmark includes 3,763 varying-length web-collected videos with their subtitles across diverse themes, designed to comprehensively evaluate LMMs on long-term multimodal understanding. To achieve this, we interpret the primary challenge as to accurately retrieve and reason over detailed multimodal information from long inputs. As such, we formulate a novel video question-answering task termed referring reasoning. Specifically, as part of the question, it contains a referring query that references related video contexts, called referred context. The model is then required to reason over relevant video details from the referred context. Following the paradigm of referring reasoning, we curate 6,678 human-annotated multiple-choice questions in 17 fine-grained categories, establishing one of the most comprehensive benchmarks for long-form video understanding. Evaluations suggest that the LongVideoBench presents significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4-Turbo), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. In addition, our results indicate that model performance on the benchmark improves only when they are capable of processing more frames, positioning LongVideoBench as a valuable benchmark for evaluating future-generation long-context LMMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15754v1,2024-07
OMoS-QA: A Dataset for Cross-Lingual Extractive Question Answering in a German Migration Context,"Steffen Kleinle, Jakob Prange, Annemarie Friedrich","When immigrating to a new country, it is easy to feel overwhelmed by the need to obtain information on financial support, housing, schooling, language courses, and other issues. If relocation is rushed or even forced, the necessity for high-quality answers to such questions is all the more urgent. Official immigration counselors are usually overbooked, and online systems could guide newcomers to the requested information or a suitable counseling service.   To this end, we present OMoS-QA, a dataset of German and English questions paired with relevant trustworthy documents and manually annotated answers, specifically tailored to this scenario. Questions are automatically generated with an open-source large language model (LLM) and answer sentences are selected by crowd workers with high agreement. With our data, we conduct a comparison of 5 pretrained LLMs on the task of extractive question answering (QA) in German and English. Across all models and both languages, we find high precision and low-to-mid recall in selecting answer sentences, which is a favorable trade-off to avoid misleading users. This performance even holds up when the question language does not match the document language. When it comes to identifying unanswerable questions given a context, there are larger differences between the two languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15736v1,2024-07
DStruct2Design: Data and Benchmarks for Data Structure Driven Generative Floor Plan Design,"Zhi Hao Luo, Luis Lara, Ge Ya Luo, Florian Golemo, Christopher Beckham, Christopher Pal","Text conditioned generative models for images have yielded impressive results. Text conditioned floorplan generation as a special type of raster image generation task also received particular attention. However there are many use cases in floorpla generation where numerical properties of the generated result are more important than the aesthetics. For instance, one might want to specify sizes for certain rooms in a floorplan and compare the generated floorplan with given specifications Current approaches, datasets and commonly used evaluations do not support these kinds of constraints. As such, an attractive strategy is to generate an intermediate data structure that contains numerical properties of a floorplan which can be used to generate the final floorplan image. To explore this setting we (1) construct a new dataset for this data-structure to data-structure formulation of floorplan generation using two popular image based floorplan datasets RPLAN and ProcTHOR-10k, and provide the tools to convert further procedurally generated ProcTHOR floorplan data into our format. (2) We explore the task of floorplan generation given a partial or complete set of constraints and we design a series of metrics and benchmarks to enable evaluating how well samples generated from models respect the constraints. (3) We create multiple baselines by finetuning a large language model (LLM), Llama3, and demonstrate the feasibility of using floorplan data structure conditioned LLMs for the problem of floorplan generation respecting numerical constraints. We hope that our new datasets and benchmarks will encourage further research on different ways to improve the performance of LLMs and other generative modelling techniques for generating designs where quantitative constraints are only partially specified, but must be respected.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15723v1,2024-07
Do Large Language Models Have Compositional Ability? An Investigation into Limitations and Scalability,"Zhuoyan Xu, Zhenmei Shi, Yingyu Liang","Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many AI problems and exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Compositional ability, solving unseen complex tasks that combine two or more simple tasks, is an essential reasoning ability for Artificial General Intelligence. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach composite tasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase, remains an open and largely underexplored question. In this study, we delve into the ICL capabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks as in-context examples. We develop a test suite of composite tasks including linguistic and logical challenges and perform empirical studies across different LLM families. We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1) For simpler composite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to different input segments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, while scaling up the model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex composite tasks involving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represents one task, models typically underperform, and scaling up generally provides no improvements. We offer theoretical analysis in a simplified setting, explaining that models exhibit compositional capability when the task handles different input parts separately. We believe our work sheds new light on the capabilities of LLMs in solving composite tasks regarding the nature of the tasks and model scale.

AssistantBench: Can Web Agents Solve Realistic and Time-Consuming Tasks?,"Ori Yoran, Samuel Joseph Amouyal, Chaitanya Malaviya, Ben Bogin, Ofir Press, Jonathan Berant","Language agents, built on top of language models (LMs), are systems that can interact with complex environments, such as the open web. In this work, we examine whether such agents can perform realistic and time-consuming tasks on the web, e.g., monitoring real-estate markets or locating relevant nearby businesses. We introduce AssistantBench, a challenging new benchmark consisting of 214 realistic tasks that can be automatically evaluated, covering different scenarios and domains. We find that AssistantBench exposes the limitations of current systems, including language models and retrieval-augmented language models, as no model reaches an accuracy of more than 26 points. While closed-book LMs perform well in terms of accuracy, they exhibit low precision and tend to hallucinate facts. State-of-the-art web agents reach a score of near zero. Additionally, we introduce SeePlanAct (SPA), a new web agent that significantly outperforms previous agents, and an ensemble of SPA and closed-book models reaches the best overall performance. Moreover, we analyze failures of current systems and highlight that open web navigation remains a major challenge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15711v2,2024-07

Counter Turing Test ($CT^2$): Investigating AI-Generated Text Detection for Hindi -- Ranking LLMs based on Hindi AI Detectability Index ($ADI_{hi}$),"Ishan Kavathekar, Anku Rani, Ashmit Chamoli, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Amit Sheth, Amitava Das","The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and awareness around multilingual LLMs have raised concerns regarding the potential risks and repercussions linked to the misapplication of AI-generated text, necessitating increased vigilance. While these models are primarily trained for English, their extensive training on vast datasets covering almost the entire web, equips them with capabilities to perform well in numerous other languages. AI-Generated Text Detection (AGTD) has emerged as a topic that has already received immediate attention in research, with some initial methods having been proposed, soon followed by the emergence of techniques to bypass detection. In this paper, we report our investigation on AGTD for an indic language Hindi. Our major contributions are in four folds: i) examined 26 LLMs to evaluate their proficiency in generating Hindi text, ii) introducing the AI-generated news article in Hindi ($AG_{hi}$) dataset, iii) evaluated the effectiveness of five recently proposed AGTD techniques: ConDA, J-Guard, RADAR, RAIDAR and Intrinsic Dimension Estimation for detecting AI-generated Hindi text, iv) proposed Hindi AI Detectability Index ($ADI_{hi}$) which shows a spectrum to understand the evolving landscape of eloquence of AI-generated text in Hindi.

Psychometric Alignment: Capturing Human Knowledge Distributions via Language Models,"Joy He-Yueya, Wanjing Anya Ma, Kanishk Gandhi, Benjamin W. Domingue, Emma Brunskill, Noah D. Goodman","Language models (LMs) are increasingly used to simulate human-like responses in scenarios where accurately mimicking a population's behavior can guide decision-making, such as in developing educational materials and designing public policies. The objective of these simulations is for LMs to capture the variations in human responses, rather than merely providing the expected correct answers. Prior work has shown that LMs often generate unrealistically accurate responses, but there are no established metrics to quantify how closely the knowledge distribution of LMs aligns with that of humans. To address this, we introduce ""psychometric alignment,"" a metric that measures the extent to which LMs reflect human knowledge distribution. Assessing this alignment involves collecting responses from both LMs and humans to the same set of test items and using Item Response Theory to analyze the differences in item functioning between the groups. We demonstrate that our metric can capture important variations in populations that traditional metrics, like differences in accuracy, fail to capture. We apply this metric to assess existing LMs for their alignment with human knowledge distributions across three real-world domains. We find significant misalignment between LMs and human populations, though using persona-based prompts can improve alignment. Interestingly, smaller LMs tend to achieve greater psychometric alignment than larger LMs. Further, training LMs on human response data from the target distribution enhances their psychometric alignment on unseen test items, but the effectiveness of such training varies across domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15645v1,2024-07
RadioRAG: Factual large language models for enhanced diagnostics in radiology using online retrieval augmented generation,"Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh, Mahshad Lotfinia, Keno Bressem, Robert Siepmann, Lisa Adams, Dyke Ferber, Christiane Kuhl, Jakob Nikolas Kather, Sven Nebelung, Daniel Truhn","Large language models (LLMs) often generate outdated or inaccurate information based on static training datasets. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG), an end-to-end framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80 questions from the RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional expert-curated questions with reference standard answers, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were prompted with and without RadioRAG in a zero-shot inference scenario RadioRAG retrieved context-specific information from www.radiopaedia.org in real-time. Accuracy was investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using bootstrapping. The results were further compared with human performance. RadioRAG improved diagnostic accuracy across most LLMs, with relative accuracy increases ranging up to 54% for different LLMs. It matched or exceeded non-RAG models and the human radiologist in question answering across radiologic subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, the degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement, highlighting variability in RadioRAG's effectiveness. LLMs benefit when provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data. For radiology, RadioRAG establishes a robust framework that substantially improves diagnostic accuracy and factuality in radiological question answering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15621v2,2024-07
Can GPT-4 learn to analyse moves in research article abstracts?,"Danni Yu, Marina Bondi, Ken Hyland","One of the most powerful and enduring ideas in written discourse analysis is that genres can be described in terms of the moves which structure a writer's purpose. Considerable research has sought to identify these distinct communicative acts, but analyses have been beset by problems of subjectivity, reliability and the time-consuming need for multiple coders to confirm analyses. In this paper we employ the affordances of GPT-4 to automate the annotation process by using natural language prompts. Focusing on abstracts from articles in four applied linguistics journals, we devise prompts which enable the model to identify moves effectively. The annotated outputs of these prompts were evaluated by two assessors with a third addressing disagreements. The results show that an 8-shot prompt was more effective than one using two, confirming that the inclusion of examples illustrating areas of variability can enhance GPT-4's ability to recognize multiple moves in a single sentence and reduce bias related to textual position. We suggest that GPT-4 offers considerable potential in automating this annotation process, when human actors with domain specific linguistic expertise inform the prompting process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15612v3,2024-07
StylusAI: Stylistic Adaptation for Robust German Handwritten Text Generation,"Nauman Riaz, Saifullah Saifullah, Stefan Agne, Andreas Dengel, Sheraz Ahmed","In this study, we introduce StylusAI, a novel architecture leveraging diffusion models in the domain of handwriting style generation. StylusAI is specifically designed to adapt and integrate the stylistic nuances of one language's handwriting into another, particularly focusing on blending English handwriting styles into the context of the German writing system. This approach enables the generation of German text in English handwriting styles and German handwriting styles into English, enriching machine-generated handwriting diversity while ensuring that the generated text remains legible across both languages. To support the development and evaluation of StylusAI, we present the \lq{Deutscher Handschriften-Datensatz}\rq~(DHSD), a comprehensive dataset encompassing 37 distinct handwriting styles within the German language. This dataset provides a fundamental resource for training and benchmarking in the realm of handwritten text generation. Our results demonstrate that StylusAI not only introduces a new method for style adaptation in handwritten text generation but also surpasses existing models in generating handwriting samples that improve both text quality and stylistic fidelity, evidenced by its performance on the IAM database and our newly proposed DHSD. Thus, StylusAI represents a significant advancement in the field of handwriting style generation, offering promising avenues for future research and applications in cross-linguistic style adaptation for languages with similar scripts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15608v1,2024-07
Unlocking the Potential: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Water Engineering and Research,"Boyan Xu, Liang Wen, Zihao Li, Yuxing Yang, Guanlan Wu, Xiongpeng Tang, Yu Li, Zihao Wu, Qingxian Su, Xueqing Shi, Yue Yang, Rui Tong, How Yong Ng","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential applications across various fields. This paper embarked on a pivotal inquiry: Can existing LLMs effectively serve as ""water expert models"" for water engineering and research tasks? This study was the first to evaluate LLMs' contributions across various water engineering and research tasks by establishing a domain-specific benchmark suite, namely, WaterER. Herein, we prepared 983 tasks related to water engineering and research, categorized into ""wastewater treatment"", ""environmental restoration"", ""drinking water treatment and distribution"", ""sanitation"", ""anaerobic digestion"" and ""contaminants assessment"". We evaluated the performance of seven LLMs (i.e., GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini, GLM-4, ERNIE, QWEN and Llama3) on these tasks. We highlighted the strengths of GPT-4 in handling diverse and complex tasks of water engineering and water research, the specialized capabilities of Gemini in academic contexts, Llama3's strongest capacity to answer Chinese water engineering questions and the competitive performance of Chinese-oriented models like GLM-4, ERNIE and QWEN in some water engineering tasks. More specifically, current LLMs excelled particularly in generating precise research gaps for papers on ""contaminants and related water quality monitoring and assessment"". Additionally, they were more adept at creating appropriate titles for research papers on ""treatment processes for wastewaters"", ""environmental restoration"", and ""drinking water treatment"". Overall, this study pioneered evaluating LLMs in water engineering and research by introducing the WaterER benchmark to assess the trustworthiness of their predictions. This standardized evaluation framework would also drive future advancements in LLM technology by using targeting datasets, propelling these models towards becoming true ""water expert"".",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21045v1,2024-07
Unsupervised Robust Cross-Lingual Entity Alignment via Neighbor Triple Matching with Entity and Relation Texts,"Soojin Yoon, Sungho Ko, Tongyoung Kim, SeongKu Kang, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee","Cross-lingual entity alignment (EA) enables the integration of multiple knowledge graphs (KGs) across different languages, providing users with seamless access to diverse and comprehensive knowledge. Existing methods, mostly supervised, face challenges in obtaining labeled entity pairs. To address this, recent studies have shifted towards self-supervised and unsupervised frameworks. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches have limitations: (1) Relation passing: mainly focusing on the entity while neglecting the semantic information of relations, (2) Isomorphic assumption: assuming isomorphism between source and target graphs, which leads to noise and reduced alignment accuracy, and (3) Noise vulnerability: susceptible to noise in the textual features, especially when encountering inconsistent translations or Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems. In this paper, we propose ERAlign, an unsupervised and robust cross-lingual EA pipeline that jointly performs Entity-level and Relation-level Alignment by neighbor triple matching strategy using semantic textual features of relations and entities. Its refinement step iteratively enhances results by fusing entity-level and relation-level alignments based on neighbor triple matching. The additional verification step examines the entities' neighbor triples as the linearized text. This Align-then-Verify pipeline rigorously assesses alignment results, achieving near-perfect alignment even in the presence of noisy textual features of entities. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the robustness and general applicability of ERAlign improved the accuracy and effectiveness of EA tasks, contributing significantly to knowledge-oriented applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15588v4,2024-07
An Empirical Study of Retrieval Augmented Generation with Chain-of-Thought,"Yuetong Zhao, Hongyu Cao, Xianyu Zhao, Zhijian Ou","Since the launch of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, generative dialogue models represented by ChatGPT have quickly become essential tools in daily life. As user expectations increase, enhancing the capability of generative dialogue models to solve complex problems has become a focal point of current research. This paper delves into the effectiveness of the RAFT (Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning) method in improving the performance of Generative dialogue models. RAFT combines chain-of-thought with model supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which significantly enhanced the model's information extraction and logical reasoning abilities. We evaluated the RAFT method across multiple datasets and analysed its performance in various reasoning tasks, including long-form QA and short-form QA tasks, tasks in both Chinese and English, and supportive and comparison reasoning tasks. Notably, it addresses the gaps in previous research regarding long-form QA tasks and Chinese datasets. Moreover, we also evaluate the benefit of the chain-of-thought (CoT) in the RAFT method. This work offers valuable insights for studies focused on enhancing the performance of generative dialogue models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15569v2,2024-07
SETTP: Style Extraction and Tunable Inference via Dual-level Transferable Prompt Learning,"Chunzhen Jin, Yongfeng Huang, Yaqi Wang, Peng Cao, Osmar Zaiane","Text style transfer, an important research direction in natural language processing, aims to adapt the text to various preferences but often faces challenges with limited resources. In this work, we introduce a novel method termed Style Extraction and Tunable Inference via Dual-level Transferable Prompt Learning (SETTP) for effective style transfer in low-resource scenarios. First, SETTP learns source style-level prompts containing fundamental style characteristics from high-resource style transfer. During training, the source style-level prompts are transferred through an attention module to derive a target style-level prompt for beneficial knowledge provision in low-resource style transfer. Additionally, we propose instance-level prompts obtained by clustering the target resources based on the semantic content to reduce semantic bias. We also propose an automated evaluation approach of style similarity based on alignment with human evaluations using ChatGPT-4. Our experiments across three resourceful styles show that SETTP requires only 1/20th of the data volume to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. In tasks involving scarce data like writing style and role style, SETTP outperforms previous methods by 16.24\%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15556v1,2024-07
Latent Adversarial Training Improves Robustness to Persistent Harmful Behaviors in LLMs,"Abhay Sheshadri, Aidan Ewart, Phillip Guo, Aengus Lynch, Cindy Wu, Vivek Hebbar, Henry Sleight, Asa Cooper Stickland, Ethan Perez, Dylan Hadfield-Menell, Stephen Casper","Large language models (LLMs) can often be made to behave in undesirable ways that they are explicitly fine-tuned not to. For example, the LLM red-teaming literature has produced a wide variety of 'jailbreaking' techniques to elicit harmful text from models that were fine-tuned to be harmless. Recent work on red-teaming, model editing, and interpretability suggests that this challenge stems from how (adversarial) fine-tuning largely serves to suppress rather than remove undesirable capabilities from LLMs. Prior work has introduced latent adversarial training (LAT) as a way to improve robustness to broad classes of failures. These prior works have considered untargeted latent space attacks where the adversary perturbs latent activations to maximize loss on examples of desirable behavior. Untargeted LAT can provide a generic type of robustness but does not leverage information about specific failure modes. Here, we experiment with targeted LAT where the adversary seeks to minimize loss on a specific competing task. We find that it can augment a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods. First, we use targeted LAT to improve robustness to jailbreaks, outperforming a strong R2D2 baseline with orders of magnitude less compute. Second, we use it to more effectively remove backdoors with no knowledge of the trigger. Finally, we use it to more effectively unlearn knowledge for specific undesirable tasks in a way that is also more robust to re-learning. Overall, our results suggest that targeted LAT can be an effective tool for defending against harmful behaviors from LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15549v2,2024-07
Attention Is All You Need But You Don't Need All Of It For Inference of Large Language Models,"Georgy Tyukin, Gbetondji J-S Dovonon, Jean Kaddour, Pasquale Minervini","The inference demand for LLMs has skyrocketed in recent months, and serving models with low latencies remains challenging due to the quadratic input length complexity of the attention layers. In this work, we investigate the effect of dropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of Llama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally decreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire layers. For example, removing 33\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model results in a 1.8\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We also observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances for more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15516v1,2024-07
Compensate Quantization Errors+: Quantized Models Are Inquisitive Learners,"Yifei Gao, Jie Ou, Lei Wang, Fanhua Shang, Jaji Wu, Jun Cheng","Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase remarkable performance and robust deductive capabilities, yet their expansive size complicates deployment and raises environmental concerns due to substantial resource consumption. The recent development of a quantization technique known as Learnable Singular-value Increment (LSI) has addressed some of these quantization challenges. Leveraging insights from LSI and our extensive research, we have developed innovative methods that enhance the performance of quantized LLMs, particularly in low-bit settings. Our methods consistently deliver state-of-the-art results across various quantization scenarios and offer deep theoretical insights into the quantization process, elucidating the potential of quantized models for widespread application.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15508v2,2024-07
Fundamental Limits of Prompt Compression: A Rate-Distortion Framework for Black-Box Language Models,"Alliot Nagle, Adway Girish, Marco Bondaschi, Michael Gastpar, Ashok Vardhan Makkuva, Hyeji Kim","We formalize the problem of prompt compression for large language models (LLMs) and present a framework to unify token-level prompt compression methods which create hard prompts for black-box models. We derive the distortion-rate function for this setup as a linear program, and provide an efficient algorithm to compute this fundamental limit via the dual of the linear program. Using the distortion-rate function as the baseline, we study the performance of existing compression schemes on a synthetic dataset consisting of prompts generated from a Markov chain, natural language queries, and their respective answers. Our empirical analysis demonstrates the criticality of query-aware prompt compression, where the compressor has knowledge of the downstream task/query for the black-box LLM. We show that there is a large gap between the performance of current prompt compression methods and the optimal strategy, and propose Adaptive QuerySelect, a query-aware, variable-rate adaptation of a prior work to close the gap. We extend our experiments to a small natural language dataset to further confirm our findings on our synthetic dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15504v2,2024-07
Refining Corpora from a Model Calibration Perspective for Chinese Spelling Correction,"Dingyao Yu, Yang An, Wei Ye, Xiongfeng Xiao, Shaoguang Mao, Tao Ge, Shikun Zhang","Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) commonly lacks large-scale high-quality corpora, due to the labor-intensive labeling of spelling errors in real-life human writing or typing scenarios. Two data augmentation methods are widely adopted: (1) \textit{Random Replacement} with the guidance of confusion sets and (2) \textit{OCR/ASR-based Generation} that simulates character misusing. However, both methods inevitably introduce noisy data (e.g., false spelling errors), potentially leading to over-correction. By carefully analyzing the two types of corpora, we find that though the latter achieves more robust generalization performance, the former yields better-calibrated CSC models. We then provide a theoretical analysis of this empirical observation, based on which a corpus refining strategy is proposed. Specifically, OCR/ASR-based data samples are fed into a well-calibrated CSC model trained on random replacement-based corpora and then filtered based on prediction confidence. By learning a simple BERT-based model on the refined OCR/ASR-based corpus, we set up impressive state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used benchmarks, while significantly alleviating over-correction (e.g., lowering false positive predictions).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15498v1,2024-07
A Comparison of Language Modeling and Translation as Multilingual Pretraining Objectives,"Zihao Li, Shaoxiong Ji, Timothee Mickus, Vincent Segonne, Jörg Tiedemann","Pretrained language models (PLMs) display impressive performances and have captured the attention of the NLP community. Establishing best practices in pretraining has, therefore, become a major focus of NLP research, especially since insights gained from monolingual English models may not necessarily apply to more complex multilingual models. One significant caveat of the current state of the art is that different works are rarely comparable: they often discuss different parameter counts, training data, and evaluation methodology.   This paper proposes a comparison of multilingual pretraining objectives in a controlled methodological environment. We ensure that training data and model architectures are comparable, and discuss the downstream performances across 6 languages that we observe in probing and fine-tuning scenarios. We make two key observations: (1) the architecture dictates which pretraining objective is optimal; (2) multilingual translation is a very effective pretraining objective under the right conditions.

Text-to-Battery Recipe: A language modeling-based protocol for automatic battery recipe extraction and retrieval,"Daeun Lee, Jaewoong Choi, Hiroshi Mizuseki, Byungju Lee","Recent studies have increasingly applied natural language processing (NLP) to automatically extract experimental research data from the extensive battery materials literature. Despite the complex process involved in battery manufacturing -- from material synthesis to cell assembly -- there has been no comprehensive study systematically organizing this information. In response, we propose a language modeling-based protocol, Text-to-Battery Recipe (T2BR), for the automatic extraction of end-to-end battery recipes, validated using a case study on batteries containing LiFePO4 cathode material. We report machine learning-based paper filtering models, screening 2,174 relevant papers from the keyword-based search results, and unsupervised topic models to identify 2,876 paragraphs related to cathode synthesis and 2,958 paragraphs related to cell assembly. Then, focusing on the two topics, two deep learning-based named entity recognition models are developed to extract a total of 30 entities -- including precursors, active materials, and synthesis methods -- achieving F1 scores of 88.18% and 94.61%. The accurate extraction of entities enables the systematic generation of 165 end-toend recipes of LiFePO4 batteries. Our protocol and results offer valuable insights into specific trends, such as associations between precursor materials and synthesis methods, or combinations between different precursor materials. We anticipate that our findings will serve as a foundational knowledge base for facilitating battery-recipe information retrieval. The proposed protocol will significantly accelerate the review of battery material literature and catalyze innovations in battery design and development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15459v1,2024-07

Empirical Capacity Model for Self-Attention Neural Networks,"Aki Härmä, Marcin Pietrasik, Anna Wilbik","Large pretrained self-attention neural networks, or transformers, have been very successful in various tasks recently. The performance of a model on a given task depends on its ability to memorize and generalize the training data. Large transformer models, which may have billions of parameters, in theory have a huge capacity to memorize content. However, the current algorithms for the optimization fall short of the theoretical capacity, and the capacity is also highly dependent on the content. In this paper, we focus on the memory capacity of these models obtained using common training algorithms and synthetic training data. Based on the results, we derive an empirical capacity model (ECM) for a generic transformer. The ECM can be used to design task-specific transformer models with an optimal number of parameters in cases where the target memorization capability of the task can be defined.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15425v2,2024-07

Impacts of Anthropomorphizing Large Language Models in Learning Environments,"Kristina Schaaff, Marc-André Heidelmann","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in learning environments to support teaching-be it as learning companions or as tutors. With our contribution, we aim to discuss the implications of the anthropomorphization of LLMs in learning environments on educational theory to build a foundation for more effective learning outcomes and understand their emotional impact on learners. According to the media equation, people tend to respond to media in the same way as they would respond to another person. A study conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology showed that chatbots can be successfully implemented in learning environments. In this study, learners in selected online courses were unable to distinguish the chatbot from a ""real"" teacher. As LLM-based chatbots such as OpenAI's GPT series are increasingly used in educational tools, it is important to understand how the attribution processes to LLM-based chatbots in terms of anthropomorphization affect learners' emotions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03945v1,2024-07

While developers have integrated multiple safety mechanisms to mitigate their misuse, a risk remains, particularly when models encounter adversarial inputs. This study unveils an attack mechanism that capitalizes on human conversation strategies to extract harmful information from LLMs. We delineate three pivotal strategies: (i) decomposing malicious questions into seemingly innocent sub-questions; (ii) rewriting overtly malicious questions into more covert, benign-sounding ones; (iii) enhancing the harmfulness of responses by prompting models for illustrative examples. Unlike conventional methods that target explicit malicious responses, our approach delves deeper into the nature of the information provided in responses. Through our experiments conducted on GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Llama2, our method has demonstrated a marked efficacy compared to conventional attack methods.

The Development of a Comprehensive Spanish Dictionary for Phonetic and Lexical Tagging in Socio-phonetic Research (ESPADA),Simon Gonzalez,"Pronunciation dictionaries are an important component in the process of speech forced alignment. The accuracy of these dictionaries has a strong effect on the aligned speech data since they help the mapping between orthographic transcriptions and acoustic signals. In this paper, I present the creation of a comprehensive pronunciation dictionary in Spanish (ESPADA) that can be used in most of the dialect variants of Spanish data. Current dictionaries focus on specific regional variants, but with the flexible nature of our tool, it can be readily applied to capture the most common phonetic differences across major dialectal variants. We propose improvements to current pronunciation dictionaries as well as mapping other relevant annotations such as morphological and lexical information. In terms of size, it is currently the most complete dictionary with more than 628,000 entries, representing words from 16 countries. All entries come with their corresponding pronunciations, morphological and lexical tagging, and other relevant information for phonetic analysis: stress patterns, phonotactics, IPA transcriptions, and more. This aims to equip socio-phonetic researchers with a complete open-source tool that enhances dialectal research within socio-phonetic frameworks in the Spanish language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15375v1,2024-07

This has been the product of a wide interest in the use and study of conlangs for artistic purposes. However, one important question is what it is happening with conlang in the academic world. This paper aims to have an overall understanding of the literature on conlang research. With this we aim to give a realistic picture of the field in present days. We have implemented a computational linguistic approach, combining bibliometrics and network analysis to examine all publications available in the Scopus database. Analysing over 2300 academic publications since 1927 until 2022, we have found that Esperanto is by far the most documented conlang. Three main authors have contributed to this: Garv\'ia R., Fiedler S., and Blanke D. The 1970s and 1980s have been the decades where the foundations of current research have been built. In terms of methodologies, language learning and experimental linguistics are the ones contributing to most to the preferred approaches of study in the field. We present the results and discuss our limitations and future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15370v1,2024-07
Walking in Others' Shoes: How Perspective-Taking Guides Large Language Models in Reducing Toxicity and Bias,"Rongwu Xu, Zi'an Zhou, Tianwei Zhang, Zehan Qi, Su Yao, Ke Xu, Wei Xu, Han Qiu","The common toxicity and societal bias in contents generated by large language models (LLMs) necessitate strategies to reduce harm. Present solutions often demand white-box access to the model or substantial training, which is impractical for cutting-edge commercial LLMs. Moreover, prevailing prompting methods depend on external tool feedback and fail to simultaneously lessen toxicity and bias. Motivated by social psychology principles, we propose a novel strategy named \textbf{perspective-taking prompting (\textsc{PeT})} that inspires LLMs to integrate diverse human perspectives and self-regulate their responses. This self-correction mechanism can significantly diminish toxicity (up to $89\%$) and bias (up to $73\%$) in LLMs' responses. Rigorous evaluations and ablation studies are conducted on two commercial LLMs (ChatGPT and GLM) and three open-source LLMs, revealing \textsc{PeT}'s superiority in producing less harmful responses, outperforming five strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15366v1,2024-07
Dissecting Multiplication in Transformers: Insights into LLMs,"Luyu Qiu, Jianing Li, Chi Su, Chen Jason Zhang, Lei Chen","Transformer-based large language models have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, they often struggle with seemingly easy tasks like arithmetic despite their vast capabilities. This stark disparity raise human's concerns about their safe and ethical use, hinder their widespread adoption.In this paper, we focus on a typical arithmetic task, integer multiplication, to explore and explain the imperfection of transformers in this domain. We provide comprehensive analysis of a vanilla transformer trained to perform n-digit integer multiplication. Our observations indicate that the model decomposes multiplication task into multiple parallel subtasks, sequentially optimizing each subtask for each digit to complete the final multiplication. Based on observation and analysis, we infer the reasons of transformers deficiencies in multiplication tasks lies in their difficulty in calculating successive carryovers and caching intermediate results, and confirmed this inference through experiments. Guided by these findings, we propose improvements to enhance transformers performance on multiplication tasks. These enhancements are validated through rigorous testing and mathematical modeling, not only enhance transformer's interpretability, but also improve its performance, e.g., we achieve over 99.9% accuracy on 5-digit integer multiplication with a tiny transformer, outperform LLMs GPT-4. Our method contributes to the broader fields of model understanding and interpretability, paving the way for analyzing more complex tasks and Transformer models. This work underscores the importance of explainable AI, helping to build trust in large language models and promoting their adoption in critical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15360v1,2024-07
CP-Prompt: Composition-Based Cross-modal Prompting for Domain-Incremental Continual Learning,"Yu Feng, Zhen Tian, Yifan Zhu, Zongfu Han, Haoran Luo, Guangwei Zhang, Meina Song","The key challenge of cross-modal domain-incremental learning (DIL) is to enable the learning model to continuously learn from novel data with different feature distributions under the same task without forgetting old ones. However, existing top-performing methods still cause high forgetting rates, by lacking intra-domain knowledge extraction and inter-domain common prompting strategy. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework, CP-Prompt, by training limited parameters to instruct a pre-trained model to learn new domains and avoid forgetting existing feature distributions. CP-Prompt captures intra-domain knowledge by compositionally inserting personalized prompts on multi-head self-attention layers and then learns the inter-domain knowledge with a common prompting strategy. CP-Prompt shows superiority compared with state-of-the-art baselines among three widely evaluated DIL tasks.

This paper presents a hybrid solution for generating discharge summary sections as part of our participation in the ""Discharge Me!"" Challenge at the BioNLP 2024 Shared Task. We developed a two-stage generation method using both extractive and abstractive techniques, in which we first apply name entity recognition (NER) to extract key clinical concepts, which are then used as input for a prompt-tuning-based GatorTronGPT model to generate coherent text for two important sections including ""Brief Hospital Course"" and ""Discharge Instructions"".

Customized Retrieval Augmented Generation and Benchmarking for EDA Tool Documentation QA,"Yuan Pu, Zhuolun He, Tairu Qiu, Haoyuan Wu, Bei Yu","Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models by sourcing factual information from external databases, which is extensively employed in document-grounded question-answering (QA) tasks. Off-the-shelf RAG flows are well pretrained on general-purpose documents, yet they encounter significant challenges when being applied to knowledge-intensive vertical domains, such as electronic design automation (EDA). This paper addresses such issue by proposing a customized RAG framework along with three domain-specific techniques for EDA tool documentation QA, including a contrastive learning scheme for text embedding model fine-tuning, a reranker distilled from proprietary LLM, and a generative LLM fine-tuned with high-quality domain corpus. Furthermore, we have developed and released a documentation QA evaluation benchmark, ORD-QA, for OpenROAD, an advanced RTL-to-GDSII design platform. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RAG flow and techniques have achieved superior performance on ORD-QA as well as on a commercial tool, compared with state-of-the-arts.

MAVEN-Fact: A Large-scale Event Factuality Detection Dataset,"Chunyang Li, Hao Peng, Xiaozhi Wang, Yunjia Qi, Lei Hou, Bin Xu, Juanzi Li","Event Factuality Detection (EFD) task determines the factuality of textual events, i.e., classifying whether an event is a fact, possibility, or impossibility, which is essential for faithfully understanding and utilizing event knowledge. However, due to the lack of high-quality large-scale data, event factuality detection is under-explored in event understanding research, which limits the development of EFD community. To address these issues and provide faithful event understanding, we introduce MAVEN-Fact, a large-scale and high-quality EFD dataset based on the MAVEN dataset. MAVEN-Fact includes factuality annotations of 112,276 events, making it the largest EFD dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAVEN-Fact is challenging for both conventional fine-tuned models and large language models (LLMs). Thanks to the comprehensive annotations of event arguments and relations in MAVEN, MAVEN-Fact also supports some further analyses and we find that adopting event arguments and relations helps in event factuality detection for fine-tuned models but does not benefit LLMs. Furthermore, we preliminarily study an application case of event factuality detection and find it helps in mitigating event-related hallucination in LLMs. Our dataset and codes can be obtained from \url{https://github.com/lcy2723/MAVEN-FACT}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15352v1,2024-07
LLMExplainer: Large Language Model based Bayesian Inference for Graph Explanation Generation,"Jiaxing Zhang, Jiayi Liu, Dongsheng Luo, Jennifer Neville, Hua Wei","Recent studies seek to provide Graph Neural Network (GNN) interpretability via multiple unsupervised learning models. Due to the scarcity of datasets, current methods easily suffer from learning bias. To solve this problem, we embed a Large Language Model (LLM) as knowledge into the GNN explanation network to avoid the learning bias problem. We inject LLM as a Bayesian Inference (BI) module to mitigate learning bias. The efficacy of the BI module has been proven both theoretically and experimentally. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The innovation of our work lies in two parts: 1. We provide a novel view of the possibility of an LLM functioning as a Bayesian inference to improve the performance of existing algorithms; 2. We are the first to discuss the learning bias issues in the GNN explanation problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15351v2,2024-07
Knowledge Acquisition Disentanglement for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering with Large Language Models,"Wenbin An, Feng Tian, Jiahao Nie, Wenkai Shi, Haonan Lin, Yan Chen, QianYing Wang, Yaqiang Wu, Guang Dai, Ping Chen","Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires both image and world knowledge to answer questions. Current methods first retrieve knowledge from the image and external knowledge base with the original complex question, then generate answers with Large Language Models (LLMs). However, since the original question contains complex elements that require knowledge from different sources, acquiring different kinds of knowledge in a coupled manner may confuse models and hinder them from retrieving precise knowledge. Furthermore, the ``forward-only'' answering process fails to explicitly capture the knowledge needs of LLMs, which can further hurt answering quality. To cope with the above limitations, we propose DKA: Disentangled Knowledge Acquisition from LLM feedback, a training-free framework that disentangles knowledge acquisition to avoid confusion and uses LLM's feedback to specify the required knowledge. Specifically, DKA requires LLMs to specify what knowledge they need to answer the question and decompose the original complex question into two simple sub-questions: Image-based sub-question and Knowledge-based sub-question. Then we use the two sub-questions to retrieve knowledge from the image and knowledge base, respectively. In this way, two knowledge acquisition models can focus on the content that corresponds to them and avoid disturbance of irrelevant elements in the original complex question, which can help to provide more precise knowledge and better align the knowledge needs of LLMs to yield correct answers. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that DKA significantly outperforms SOTA models. To facilitate future research, our data and code are available at \url{https://github.com/Lackel/DKA}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15346v1,2024-07
Improving Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding with Multi-Prompt,"David Heineman, Yao Dou, Wei Xu","While instruction fine-tuned LLMs are effective text generators, sensitivity to prompt construction makes performance unstable and sub-optimal in practice. Relying on a single ""best"" prompt cannot capture all differing approaches to a generation problem. Using this observation, we propose multi-prompt decoding, where many candidate generations are decoded from a prompt bank at inference-time. To ensemble candidates, we use Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, which selects a final output using a trained value metric. We show multi-prompt improves MBR across a comprehensive set of conditional generation tasks, and show this is a result of estimating a more diverse and higher quality candidate space than that of a single prompt. Further experiments confirm multi-prompt improves generation across tasks, models and metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15343v2,2024-07

In this study, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine In-context Learning(CFICL) method based on the Baichuan2-7B model for the DimABSA task in the SIGHAN 2024 workshop. Our method improves prediction accuracy through a two-stage optimization process. In the first stage, we use fixed in-context examples and prompt templates to enhance the model's sentiment recognition capability and provide initial predictions for the test data. In the second stage, we encode the Opinion field using BERT and select the most similar training data as new in-context examples based on similarity. These examples include the Opinion field and its scores, as well as related opinion words and their average scores. By filtering for sentiment polarity, we ensure that the examples are consistent with the test data. Our method significantly improves prediction accuracy and consistency by effectively utilizing training data and optimizing in-context examples, as validated by experimental results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15341v1,2024-07

RazorAttention: Efficient KV Cache Compression Through Retrieval Heads,"Hanlin Tang, Yang Lin, Jing Lin, Qingsen Han, Shikuan Hong, Yiwu Yao, Gongyi Wang","The memory and computational demands of Key-Value (KV) cache present significant challenges for deploying long-context language models. Previous approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by selectively dropping tokens, which irreversibly erases critical information that might be needed for future queries. In this paper, we propose a novel compression technique for KV cache that preserves all token information. Our investigation reveals that: i) Most attention heads primarily focus on the local context; ii) Only a few heads, denoted as retrieval heads, can essentially pay attention to all input tokens. These key observations motivate us to use separate caching strategy for attention heads. Therefore, we propose RazorAttention, a training-free KV cache compression algorithm, which maintains a full cache for these crucial retrieval heads and discards the remote tokens in non-retrieval heads. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mechanism involving a ""compensation token"" to further recover the information in the dropped tokens. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that RazorAttention achieves a reduction in KV cache size by over 70% without noticeable impacts on performance. Additionally, RazorAttention is compatible with FlashAttention, rendering it an efficient and plug-and-play solution that enhances LLM inference efficiency without overhead or retraining of the original model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15891v1,2024-07
Weak-to-Strong Compositional Learning from Generative Models for Language-based Object Detection,"Kwanyong Park, Kuniaki Saito, Donghyun Kim","Vision-language (VL) models often exhibit a limited understanding of complex expressions of visual objects (e.g., attributes, shapes, and their relations), given complex and diverse language queries. Traditional approaches attempt to improve VL models using hard negative synthetic text, but their effectiveness is limited. In this paper, we harness the exceptional compositional understanding capabilities of generative foundational models. We introduce a novel method for structured synthetic data generation aimed at enhancing the compositional understanding of VL models in language-based object detection. Our framework generates densely paired positive and negative triplets (image, text descriptions, and bounding boxes) in both image and text domains. By leveraging these synthetic triplets, we transform 'weaker' VL models into 'stronger' models in terms of compositional understanding, a process we call ""Weak-to-Strong Compositional Learning"" (WSCL). To achieve this, we propose a new compositional contrastive learning formulation that discovers semantics and structures in complex descriptions from synthetic triplets. As a result, VL models trained with our synthetic data generation exhibit a significant performance boost in the Omnilabel benchmark by up to +5AP and the D3 benchmark by +6.9AP upon existing baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15296v1,2024-07
Intrinsic Self-correction for Enhanced Morality: An Analysis of Internal Mechanisms and the Superficial Hypothesis,"Guangliang Liu, Haitao Mao, Jiliang Tang, Kristen Marie Johnson","Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of producing content that perpetuates stereotypes, discrimination, and toxicity. The recently proposed moral self-correction is a computationally efficient method for reducing harmful content in the responses of LLMs. However, the process of how injecting self-correction instructions can modify the behavior of LLMs remains under-explored. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of moral self-correction by answering three research questions: (1) In what scenarios does moral self-correction work? (2) What are the internal mechanisms of LLMs, e.g., hidden states, that are influenced by moral self-correction instructions? (3) Is intrinsic moral self-correction actually superficial in terms of reduced immorality in hidden states?   We argue that self-correction can help LLMs find a shortcut to more morally correct output, rather than truly reducing the immorality stored in hidden states. Through empirical investigation with tasks of language generation and multi-choice question answering, we conclude:(i) LLMs exhibit good performance across both tasks, and self-correction instructions are particularly beneficial when the correct answer is already top-ranked; (ii) The morality levels in intermediate hidden states are strong indicators as to whether one instruction would be more effective than another; (iii) Based on our analysis of intermediate hidden states and task case studies of self-correction behaviors, we are first to propose the hypothesis that intrinsic moral self-correction is in fact superficial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15286v3,2024-07
SynCPKL: Harnessing LLMs to Generate Synthetic Data for Commonsense Persona Knowledge Linking,Kuan-Yen Lin,"Understanding rich dialogues often requires NLP systems to access relevant commonsense persona knowledge, but retrieving this knowledge is challenging due to complex contexts and the implicit nature of commonsense.

Fact-Aware Multimodal Retrieval Augmentation for Accurate Medical Radiology Report Generation,"Liwen Sun, James Zhao, Megan Han, Chenyan Xiong","Multimodal foundation models hold significant potential for automating radiology report generation, thereby assisting clinicians in diagnosing cardiac diseases. However, generated reports often suffer from serious factual inaccuracy. In this paper, we introduce a fact-aware multimodal retrieval-augmented pipeline in generating accurate radiology reports (FactMM-RAG). We first leverage RadGraph to mine factual report pairs, then integrate factual knowledge to train a universal multimodal retriever. Given a radiology image, our retriever can identify high-quality reference reports to augment multimodal foundation models, thus enhancing the factual completeness and correctness of report generation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our multimodal retriever outperforms state-of-the-art retrievers on both language generation and radiology-specific metrics, up to 6.5% and 2% score in F1CheXbert and F1RadGraph. Further analysis indicates that employing our factually-informed training strategy imposes an effective supervision signal, without relying on explicit diagnostic label guidance, and successfully propagates fact-aware capabilities from the multimodal retriever to the multimodal foundation model in radiology report generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15268v1,2024-07
They Look Like Each Other: Case-based Reasoning for Explainable Depression Detection on Twitter using Large Language Models,"Mohammad Saeid Mahdavinejad, Peyman Adibi, Amirhassan Monadjemi, Pascal Hitzler","Depression is a common mental health issue that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Despite the promise of social media data for depression detection, the opacity of employed deep learning models hinders interpretability and raises bias concerns. We address this challenge by introducing ProtoDep, a novel, explainable framework for Twitter-based depression detection. ProtoDep leverages prototype learning and the generative power of Large Language Models to provide transparent explanations at three levels: (i) symptom-level explanations for each tweet and user, (ii) case-based explanations comparing the user to similar individuals, and (iii) transparent decision-making through classification weights. Evaluated on five benchmark datasets, ProtoDep achieves near state-of-the-art performance while learning meaningful prototypes. This multi-faceted approach offers significant potential to enhance the reliability and transparency of depression detection on social media, ultimately aiding mental health professionals in delivering more informed care.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21041v1,2024-07

"Two eyes, Two views, and finally, One summary! Towards Multi-modal Multi-tasking Knowledge-Infused Medical Dialogue Summarization","Anisha Saha, Abhisek Tiwari, Sai Ruthvik, Sriparna Saha","We often summarize a multi-party conversation in two stages: chunking with homogeneous units and summarizing the chunks. Thus, we hypothesize that there exists a correlation between homogeneous speaker chunking and overall summarization tasks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of a multi-faceted approach that simultaneously produces summaries of medical concerns, doctor impressions, and an overall view. We introduce a multi-modal, multi-tasking, knowledge-infused medical dialogue summary generation (MMK-Summation) model, which is incorporated with adapter-based fine-tuning through a gated mechanism for multi-modal information integration. The model, MMK-Summation, takes dialogues as input, extracts pertinent external knowledge based on the context, integrates the knowledge and visual cues from the dialogues into the textual content, and ultimately generates concise summaries encompassing medical concerns, doctor impressions, and a comprehensive overview.

TAGCOS: Task-agnostic Gradient Clustered Coreset Selection for Instruction Tuning Data,"Jipeng Zhang, Yaxuan Qin, Renjie Pi, Weizhong Zhang, Rui Pan, Tong Zhang","Instruction tuning has achieved unprecedented success in NLP, turning large language models into versatile chatbots. However, the increasing variety and volume of instruction datasets demand significant computational resources. To address this, it is essential to extract a small and highly informative subset (i.e., Coreset) that achieves comparable performance to the full dataset. Achieving this goal poses non-trivial challenges: 1) data selection requires accurate data representations that reflect the training samples' quality, 2) considering the diverse nature of instruction datasets, and 3) ensuring the efficiency of the coreset selection algorithm for large models. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Agnostic Gradient Clustered COreset Selection (TAGCOS). Specifically, we leverage sample gradients as the data representations, perform clustering to group similar data, and apply an efficient greedy algorithm for coreset selection. Experimental results show that our algorithm, selecting only 5% of the data, surpasses other unsupervised methods and achieves performance close to that of the full dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15235v1,2024-07
The Hitchhiker's Guide to Human Alignment with *PO,"Kian Ahrabian, Xihui Lin, Barun Patra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Alon Benhaim, Jay Pujara, Xia Song","With the growing utilization of large language models (LLMs) across domains, alignment towards human preferences has become one of the most critical aspects of training models. At the forefront of state-of-the-art human alignment methods are preference optimization methods (*PO). However, prior research has often concentrated on identifying the best-performing method, typically involving a grid search over hyperparameters, which can be impractical for general practitioners. In this paper, we aim to identify the algorithm that, while being performant, is simultaneously more robust to varying hyperparameters, thereby increasing the likelihood of achieving better results. We focus on a realistic out-of-distribution (OOD) scenario that mirrors real-world applications of human alignment, offering practical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. Furthermore, to better understand the shortcomings of generations from the different methods, we analyze the model generations through the lens of KL divergence of the SFT model and the response length statistics. Our analysis reveals that the widely adopted DPO method consistently produces lengthy responses of inferior quality that are very close to the SFT responses. Motivated by these findings, we propose an embarrassingly simple extension to the DPO algorithm, LN-DPO, resulting in more concise responses without sacrificing quality compared to the policy obtained by vanilla DPO.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15229v1,2024-07
A Community-Centric Perspective for Characterizing and Detecting Anti-Asian Violence-Provoking Speech,"Gaurav Verma, Rynaa Grover, Jiawei Zhou, Binny Mathew, Jordan Kraemer, Munmun De Choudhury, Srijan Kumar","Violence-provoking speech -- speech that implicitly or explicitly promotes violence against the members of the targeted community, contributed to a massive surge in anti-Asian crimes during the pandemic. While previous works have characterized and built tools for detecting other forms of harmful speech, like fear speech and hate speech, our work takes a community-centric approach to studying anti-Asian violence-provoking speech. Using data from ~420k Twitter posts spanning a 3-year duration (January 1, 2020 to February 1, 2023), we develop a codebook to characterize anti-Asian violence-provoking speech and collect a community-crowdsourced dataset to facilitate its large-scale detection using state-of-the-art classifiers. We contrast the capabilities of natural language processing classifiers, ranging from BERT-based to LLM-based classifiers, in detecting violence-provoking speech with their capabilities to detect anti-Asian hateful speech. In contrast to prior work that has demonstrated the effectiveness of such classifiers in detecting hateful speech ($F_1 = 0.89$), our work shows that accurate and reliable detection of violence-provoking speech is a challenging task ($F_1 = 0.69$). We discuss the implications of our findings, particularly the need for proactive interventions to support Asian communities during public health crises.

Failures to Find Transferable Image Jailbreaks Between Vision-Language Models,"Rylan Schaeffer, Dan Valentine, Luke Bailey, James Chua, Cristóbal Eyzaguirre, Zane Durante, Joe Benton, Brando Miranda, Henry Sleight, John Hughes, Rajashree Agrawal, Mrinank Sharma, Scott Emmons, Sanmi Koyejo, Ethan Perez","The integration of new modalities into frontier AI systems offers exciting capabilities, but also increases the possibility such systems can be adversarially manipulated in undesirable ways. In this work, we focus on a popular class of vision-language models (VLMs) that generate text outputs conditioned on visual and textual inputs. We conducted a large-scale empirical study to assess the transferability of gradient-based universal image ``jailbreaks"" using a diverse set of over 40 open-parameter VLMs, including 18 new VLMs that we publicly release. Overall, we find that transferable gradient-based image jailbreaks are extremely difficult to obtain. When an image jailbreak is optimized against a single VLM or against an ensemble of VLMs, the jailbreak successfully jailbreaks the attacked VLM(s), but exhibits little-to-no transfer to any other VLMs; transfer is not affected by whether the attacked and target VLMs possess matching vision backbones or language models, whether the language model underwent instruction-following and/or safety-alignment training, or many other factors. Only two settings display partially successful transfer: between identically-pretrained and identically-initialized VLMs with slightly different VLM training data, and between different training checkpoints of a single VLM. Leveraging these results, we then demonstrate that transfer can be significantly improved against a specific target VLM by attacking larger ensembles of ``highly-similar"" VLMs. These results stand in stark contrast to existing evidence of universal and transferable text jailbreaks against language models and transferable adversarial attacks against image classifiers, suggesting that VLMs may be more robust to gradient-based transfer attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15211v2,2024-07

Decoding Multilingual Moral Preferences: Unveiling LLM's Biases Through the Moral Machine Experiment,"Karina Vida, Fabian Damken, Anne Lauscher","Large language models (LLMs) increasingly find their way into the most diverse areas of our everyday lives. They indirectly influence people's decisions or opinions through their daily use. Therefore, understanding how and which moral judgements these LLMs make is crucial. However, morality is not universal and depends on the cultural background. This raises the question of whether these cultural preferences are also reflected in LLMs when prompted in different languages or whether moral decision-making is consistent across different languages. So far, most research has focused on investigating the inherent values of LLMs in English. While a few works conduct multilingual analyses of moral bias in LLMs in a multilingual setting, these analyses do not go beyond atomic actions. To the best of our knowledge, a multilingual analysis of moral bias in dilemmas has not yet been conducted.   To address this, our paper builds on the moral machine experiment (MME) to investigate the moral preferences of five LLMs, Falcon, Gemini, Llama, GPT, and MPT, in a multilingual setting and compares them with the preferences collected from humans belonging to different cultures. To accomplish this, we generate 6500 scenarios of the MME and prompt the models in ten languages on which action to take. Our analysis reveals that all LLMs inhibit different moral biases to some degree and that they not only differ from the human preferences but also across multiple languages within the models themselves. Moreover, we find that almost all models, particularly Llama 3, divert greatly from human values and, for instance, prefer saving fewer people over saving more.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15184v1,2024-07
ReAttention: Training-Free Infinite Context with Finite Attention Scope,"Xiaoran Liu, Ruixiao Li, Qipeng Guo, Zhigeng Liu, Yuerong Song, Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Linlin Li, Qun Liu, Xipeng Qiu","The long-context capability of the Large Language Models (LLM) has made significant breakthroughs, but the maximum supported context length remains a critical bottleneck limiting their practical applications. The constraint of context length in LLMs arises from the self-attention mechanism, which cannot effectively and efficiently capture the semantic relationships within infinitely long contexts via the limited pre-trained positional information and attention scope. In this work, we propose \textbf{ReAttention}, a training-free approach enabling LLM based on the self-attention mechanism to support an infinite context with a finite attention scope under sufficient memory resources. ReAttention performs the position-agnostic top-$k$ attention before the ordinary position-aware self-attention, freeing LLMs from the length extrapolation issue. We validate the performance of ReAttention on the LongBench, L-Eval, and InfiniteBench and demonstrate that it is on par with traditional methods. Furthermore, we also apply ReAttention on mainstream LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B and Mistral-v0.3-7B, enabling them to support context lengths of at least 1M and even expanding the context length of LLaMA3.2-3B-chat by 128$\times$ to 4M without any further training in Needle-In-A-Haystack tests. We also improve the efficiency of ReAttention with Triton and achieve an efficient extrapolation without additional overhead.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15176v2,2024-07
When Can Transformers Count to n?,"Gilad Yehudai, Haim Kaplan, Asma Ghandeharioun, Mor Geva, Amir Globerson","Large language models based on the transformer architectures can solve highly complex tasks. But are there simple tasks that such models cannot solve? Here we focus on very simple counting tasks, that involve counting how many times a token in the vocabulary have appeared in a string. We show that if the dimension of the transformer state is linear in the context length, this task can be solved. However, the solution we propose does not scale beyond this limit, and we provide theoretical arguments for why it is likely impossible for a size limited transformer to implement this task. Our empirical results demonstrate the same phase-transition in performance, as anticipated by the theoretical argument. Our results demonstrate the importance of understanding how transformers can solve simple tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15160v2,2024-07
Fine-grained Gender Control in Machine Translation with Large Language Models,"Minwoo Lee, Hyukhun Koh, Minsung Kim, Kyomin Jung","In machine translation, the problem of ambiguously gendered input has been pointed out, where the gender of an entity is not available in the source sentence. To address this ambiguity issue, the task of controlled translation that takes the gender of the ambiguous entity as additional input have been proposed. However, most existing works have only considered a simplified setup of one target gender for input. In this paper, we tackle controlled translation in a more realistic setting of inputs with multiple entities and propose Gender-of-Entity (GoE) prompting method for LLMs. Our proposed method instructs the model with fine-grained entity-level gender information to translate with correct gender inflections. By utilizing four evaluation benchmarks, we investigate the controlled translation capability of LLMs in multiple dimensions and find that LLMs reach state-of-the-art performance in controlled translation. Furthermore, we discover an emergence of gender interference phenomenon when controlling the gender of multiple entities. Finally, we address the limitations of existing gender accuracy evaluation metrics and propose leveraging LLMs as an evaluator for gender inflection in machine translation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15154v1,2024-07
A multi-level multi-label text classification dataset of 19th century Ottoman and Russian literary and critical texts,"Gokcen Gokceoglu, Devrim Cavusoglu, Emre Akbas, Özen Nergis Dolcerocca","This paper introduces a multi-level, multi-label text classification dataset comprising over 3000 documents. The dataset features literary and critical texts from 19th-century Ottoman Turkish and Russian. It is the first study to apply large language models (LLMs) to this dataset, sourced from prominent literary periodicals of the era. The texts have been meticulously organized and labeled. This was done according to a taxonomic framework that takes into account both their structural and semantic attributes. Articles are categorized and tagged with bibliometric metadata by human experts. We present baseline classification results using a classical bag-of-words (BoW) naive Bayes model and three modern LLMs: multilingual BERT, Falcon, and Llama-v2. We found that in certain cases, Bag of Words (BoW) outperforms Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing the need for additional research, especially in low-resource language settings. This dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for researchers in natural language processing and machine learning, especially for historical and low-resource languages. The dataset is publicly available^1.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15136v1,2024-07
DOPRA: Decoding Over-accumulation Penalization and Re-allocation in Specific Weighting Layer,"Jinfeng Wei, Xiaofeng Zhang","In this work, we introduce DOPRA, a novel approach designed to mitigate hallucinations in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike existing solutions that typically involve costly supplementary training data or the integration of external knowledge sources, DOPRA innovatively addresses hallucinations by decoding specific weighted layer penalties and redistribution, offering an economical and effective solution without additional resources. DOPRA is grounded in unique insights into the intrinsic mechanisms controlling hallucinations within MLLMs, especially the models' tendency to over-rely on a subset of summary tokens in the self-attention matrix, neglecting critical image-related information. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in certain strata. To counteract this over-reliance, DOPRA employs a strategy of weighted overlay penalties and redistribution in specific layers, such as the 12th layer, during the decoding process. Furthermore, DOPRA includes a retrospective allocation process that re-examines the sequence of generated tokens, allowing the algorithm to reallocate token selection to better align with the actual image content, thereby reducing the incidence of hallucinatory descriptions in auto-generated captions. Overall, DOPRA represents a significant step forward in improving the output quality of MLLMs by systematically reducing hallucinations through targeted adjustments during the decoding process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15130v2,2024-07

This study introduces SageCopilot, an advanced, industry-grade system system that automates the data science pipeline by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), Autonomous Agents (AutoAgents), and Language User Interfaces (LUIs). Specifically, SageCopilot incorporates a two-phase design: an online component refining users' inputs into executable scripts through In-Context Learning (ICL) and running the scripts for results reporting & visualization, and an offline preparing demonstrations requested by ICL in the online phase. A list of trending strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and prompt-tuning have been used to augment SageCopilot for enhanced performance.

Multi-Agent Causal Discovery Using Large Language Models,"Hao Duong Le, Xin Xia, Zhang Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in causal discovery tasks by utilizing their vast expert knowledge from extensive text corpora. However, the multi-agent capabilities of LLMs in causal discovery remain underexplored. This paper introduces a general framework to investigate this potential. The first is the Meta Agents Model, which relies exclusively on reasoning and discussions among LLM agents to conduct causal discovery. The second is the Coding Agents Model, which leverages the agents' ability to plan, write, and execute code, utilizing advanced statistical libraries for causal discovery. The third is the Hybrid Model, which integrates both the Meta Agents Model and CodingAgents Model approaches, combining the statistical analysis and reasoning skills of multiple agents. Our proposed framework shows promising results by effectively utilizing LLMs expert knowledge, reasoning capabilities, multi-agent cooperation, and statistical causal methods. By exploring the multi-agent potential of LLMs, we aim to establish a foundation for further research in utilizing LLMs multi-agent for solving causal-related problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15073v2,2024-07
Relational Database Augmented Large Language Model,"Zongyue Qin, Chen Luo, Zhengyang Wang, Haoming Jiang, Yizhou Sun","Large language models (LLMs) excel in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, since LLMs can only incorporate new knowledge through training or supervised fine-tuning processes, they are unsuitable for applications that demand precise, up-to-date, and private information not available in the training corpora. This precise, up-to-date, and private information is typically stored in relational databases. Thus, a promising solution is to augment LLMs with the inclusion of relational databases as external memory. This can ensure the timeliness, correctness, and consistency of data, and assist LLMs in performing complex arithmetic operations beyond their inherent capabilities. However, bridging the gap between LLMs and relational databases is challenging. It requires the awareness of databases and data values stored in databases to select correct databases and issue correct SQL queries. Besides, it is necessary for the external memory to be independent of the LLM to meet the needs of real-world applications. We introduce a novel LLM-agnostic memory architecture comprising a database selection memory, a data value memory, and relational databases. And we design an elegant pipeline to retrieve information from it. Besides, we carefully design the prompts to instruct the LLM to maximize the framework's potential. To evaluate our method, we compose a new dataset with various types of questions. Experimental results show that our framework enables LLMs to effectively answer database-related questions, which is beyond their direct ability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15071v1,2024-07
Training Zero-Shot Generalizable End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialog System Without Turn-level Dialog Annotations,"Adib Mosharrof, A. B. Siddique","Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems enable users to achieve their goals through natural language interactions. Traditionally, these systems have relied on turn-level manually annotated metadata, such as dialogue states and policy annotations, which are expensive, time-consuming, and often inconsistent or error-prone. This dependence limits the potential to leverage vast amounts of readily available conversational data for training TOD systems. Additionally, a critical challenge in TOD system design is determining when and how to access and integrate information from external sources. Current approaches typically expect this information to be provided alongside the dialogue context, rather than learning to identify and retrieve it autonomously. While pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have been used to develop TOD systems, their potential to train such systems without laborious annotations remains largely unexplored. This work employs multi-task instruction fine-tuning to create more efficient and scalable TOD systems that can effectively leverage natural language conversational data without manual annotations, while autonomously managing external information retrieval. Our extensive experimental evaluations, using three diverse TOD datasets and three LLMs of varying sizes, demonstrate that our approach can generalize to new, unseen domains. Notably, our approach outperforms both state-of-the-art models trained on annotated data and billion-scale parameter off-the-shelf ChatGPT models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15055v2,2024-07
End-to-End Video Question Answering with Frame Scoring Mechanisms and Adaptive Sampling,"Jianxin Liang, Xiaojun Meng, Yueqian Wang, Chang Liu, Qun Liu, Dongyan Zhao","Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has emerged as a challenging frontier in the field of multimedia processing, requiring intricate interactions between visual and textual modalities. Simply uniformly sampling frames or indiscriminately aggregating frame-level visual features often falls short in capturing the nuanced and relevant contexts of videos to well perform VideoQA. To mitigate these issues, we propose VidF4, a novel VideoQA framework equipped with tailored frame selection strategy for effective and efficient VideoQA. We propose three frame-scoring mechanisms that consider both question relevance and inter-frame similarity to evaluate the importance of each frame for a given question on the video. Furthermore, we design a differentiable adaptive frame sampling mechanism to facilitate end-to-end training for the frame selector and answer generator. The experimental results across three widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing VideoQA methods, establishing a new SOTA across NExT-QA (+0.3%), STAR (+0.9%), and TVQA (+1.0%). Furthermore, through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we validate the effectiveness of each design choice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15047v2,2024-07
Audio-visual training for improved grounding in video-text LLMs,"Shivprasad Sagare, Hemachandran S, Kinshuk Sarabhai, Prashant Ullegaddi, Rajeshkumar SA","Recent advances in multimodal LLMs, have led to several video-text models being proposed for critical video-related tasks. However, most of the previous works support visual input only, essentially muting the audio signal in the video. Few models that support both audio and visual input, are not explicitly trained on audio data. Hence, the effect of audio towards video understanding is largely unexplored. To this end, we propose a model architecture that handles audio-visual inputs explicitly. We train our model with both audio and visual data from a video instruction-tuning dataset. Comparison with vision-only baselines, and other audio-visual models showcase that training on audio data indeed leads to improved grounding of responses. For better evaluation of audio-visual models, we also release a human-annotated benchmark dataset, with audio-aware question-answer pairs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15046v1,2024-07
Enhancing Incremental Summarization with Structured Representations,"EunJeong Hwang, Yichao Zhou, James Bradley Wendt, Beliz Gunel, Nguyen Vo, Jing Xie, Sandeep Tata","Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with processing extensive input contexts, which can lead to redundant, inaccurate, or incoherent summaries. Recent methods have used unstructured memory to incrementally process these contexts, but they still suffer from information overload due to the volume of unstructured data handled. In our study, we introduce structured knowledge representations ($GU_{json}$), which significantly improve summarization performance by 40% and 14% across two public datasets. Most notably, we propose the Chain-of-Key strategy ($CoK_{json}$) that dynamically updates or augments these representations with new information, rather than recreating the structured memory for each new source. This method further enhances performance by 7% and 4% on the datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15021v1,2024-07
"Answer, Assemble, Ace: Understanding How Transformers Answer Multiple Choice Questions","Sarah Wiegreffe, Oyvind Tafjord, Yonatan Belinkov, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Ashish Sabharwal","Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is a key competence of performant transformer language models that is tested by mainstream benchmarks. However, recent evidence shows that models can have quite a range of performance, particularly when the task format is diversified slightly (such as by shuffling answer choice order). In this work we ask: how do successful models perform formatted MCQA? We employ vocabulary projection and activation patching methods to localize key hidden states that encode relevant information for predicting the correct answer. We find that prediction of a specific answer symbol is causally attributed to a single middle layer, and specifically its multi-head self-attention mechanism. We show that subsequent layers increase the probability of the predicted answer symbol in vocabulary space, and that this probability increase is associated with a sparse set of attention heads with unique roles. We additionally uncover differences in how different models adjust to alternative symbols. Finally, we demonstrate that a synthetic task can disentangle sources of model error to pinpoint when a model has learned formatted MCQA, and show that an inability to separate answer symbol tokens in vocabulary space is a property of models unable to perform formatted MCQA tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15018v1,2024-07

Generalization v.s. Memorization: Tracing Language Models' Capabilities Back to Pretraining Data,"Xinyi Wang, Antonis Antoniades, Yanai Elazar, Alfonso Amayuelas, Alon Albalak, Kexun Zhang, William Yang Wang","The impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks or predominantly rely on memorizing vast amounts of pretraining data. To explore this issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional memorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output probabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture task-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language model, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related $n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using the Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks: machine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding, and math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with the strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while model performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual question answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine translation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more novel outputs. This study demonstrates that memorization plays a larger role in simpler, knowledge-intensive tasks, while generalization is the key for harder, reasoning-based tasks, providing a scalable method for analyzing large pretraining corpora in greater depth. We also show the practical implications of our analysis through a novel prompt optimization algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14985v4,2024-07
Sim-CLIP: Unsupervised Siamese Adversarial Fine-Tuning for Robust and Semantically-Rich Vision-Language Models,"Md Zarif Hossain, Ahmed Imteaj","Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant strides in recent times specially in multimodal tasks, yet they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks on their vision components. To address this, we propose Sim-CLIP, an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning method that enhances the robustness of the widely-used CLIP vision encoder against such attacks while maintaining semantic richness and specificity. By employing a Siamese architecture with cosine similarity loss, Sim-CLIP learns semantically meaningful and attack-resilient visual representations without requiring large batch sizes or momentum encoders. Our results demonstrate that VLMs enhanced with Sim-CLIP's fine-tuned CLIP encoder exhibit significantly enhanced robustness against adversarial attacks, while preserving semantic meaning of the perturbed images. Notably, Sim-CLIP does not require additional training or fine-tuning of the VLM itself; replacing the original vision encoder with our fine-tuned Sim-CLIP suffices to provide robustness. This work underscores the significance of reinforcing foundational models like CLIP to safeguard the reliability of downstream VLM applications, paving the way for more secure and effective multimodal systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14971v2,2024-07

The uncertainty arising from the volatility and unpredictability of technology (such as AI) and its potential consequences is widely discussed on social media. This study uses BERTopic modelling along with sentiment and emotion analysis on 1.5 million tweets from 2021 to 2023 to identify anticipated tech-driven futures and capture the emotions communicated by 400 key opinion leaders (KOLs). Findings indicate positive sentiment significantly outweighs negative, with a prevailing dominance of positive anticipatory emotions. Specifically, the 'Hope' score is approximately 10.33\% higher than the median 'Anxiety' score. KOLs emphasize 'Optimism' and benefits over 'Pessimism' and challenges.

Conversational Rubert for Detecting Competitive Interruptions in ASR-Transcribed Dialogues,"Dmitrii Galimzianov, Viacheslav Vyshegorodtsev","Interruption in a dialogue occurs when the listener begins their speech before the current speaker finishes speaking. Interruptions can be broadly divided into two groups: cooperative (when the listener wants to support the speaker), and competitive (when the listener tries to take control of the conversation against the speaker's will). A system that automatically classifies interruptions can be used in call centers, specifically in the tasks of customer satisfaction monitoring and agent monitoring. In this study, we developed a text-based interruption classification model by preparing an in-house dataset consisting of ASR-transcribed customer support telephone dialogues in Russian. We fine-tuned Conversational RuBERT on our dataset and optimized hyperparameters, and the model performed well. With further improvements, the proposed model can be applied to automatic monitoring systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14940v1,2024-07

To our knowledge, we conduct the first, large-scale, longitudinal audit of the consent protocols for the web domains underlying AI training corpora. Our audit of 14,000 web domains provides an expansive view of crawlable web data and how codified data use preferences are changing over time. We observe a proliferation of AI-specific clauses to limit use, acute differences in restrictions on AI developers, as well as general inconsistencies between websites' expressed intentions in their Terms of Service and their robots.txt. We diagnose these as symptoms of ineffective web protocols, not designed to cope with the widespread re-purposing of the internet for AI. Our longitudinal analyses show that in a single year (2023-2024) there has been a rapid crescendo of data restrictions from web sources, rendering ~5%+ of all tokens in C4, or 28%+ of the most actively maintained, critical sources in C4, fully restricted from use. For Terms of Service crawling restrictions, a full 45% of C4 is now restricted. If respected or enforced, these restrictions are rapidly biasing the diversity, freshness, and scaling laws for general-purpose AI systems.

Improving Context-Aware Preference Modeling for Language Models,"Silviu Pitis, Ziang Xiao, Nicolas Le Roux, Alessandro Sordoni","While finetuning language models from pairwise preferences has proven remarkably effective, the underspecified nature of natural language presents critical challenges. Direct preference feedback is uninterpretable, difficult to provide where multidimensional criteria may apply, and often inconsistent, either because it is based on incomplete instructions or provided by diverse principals. To address these challenges, we consider the two-step preference modeling procedure that first resolves the under-specification by selecting a context, and then evaluates preference with respect to the chosen context. We decompose reward modeling error according to these two steps, which suggests that supervising context in addition to context-specific preference may be a viable approach to aligning models with diverse human preferences. For this to work, the ability of models to evaluate context-specific preference is critical. To this end, we contribute context-conditioned preference datasets and accompanying experiments that investigate the ability of language models to evaluate context-specific preference. We use our datasets to (1) show that existing preference models benefit from, but fail to fully consider, added context, (2) finetune a context-aware reward model with context-specific performance exceeding that of GPT-4 and Llama 3 70B on tested datasets, and (3) investigate the value of context-aware preference modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14916v2,2024-07

Mapping Patient Trajectories: Understanding and Visualizing Sepsis Prognostic Pathways from Patients Clinical Narratives,"Sudeshna Jana, Tirthankar Dasgupta, Lipika Dey","In recent years, healthcare professionals are increasingly emphasizing on personalized and evidence-based patient care through the exploration of prognostic pathways. To study this, structured clinical variables from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many researchers. Presently, Natural Language Processing models have received great attention in clinical research which expanded the possibilities of using clinical narratives. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing sepsis prognostic pathways derived from clinical notes, focusing on diverse patient subgroups identified by exploring comorbidities associated with sepsis and generating explanations of these subgroups using SHAP. The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement.

Modular Sentence Encoders: Separating Language Specialization from Cross-Lingual Alignment,"Yongxin Huang, Kexin Wang, Goran Glavaš, Iryna Gurevych","Multilingual sentence encoders are commonly obtained by training multilingual language models to map sentences from different languages into a shared semantic space. As such, they are subject to curse of multilinguality, a loss of monolingual representational accuracy due to parameter sharing. Another limitation of multilingual sentence encoders is the trade-off between monolingual and cross-lingual performance. Training for cross-lingual alignment of sentence embeddings distorts the optimal monolingual structure of semantic spaces of individual languages, harming the utility of sentence embeddings in monolingual tasks. In this work, we address both issues by modular training of sentence encoders, i.e., by separating monolingual specialization from cross-lingual alignment. We first efficiently train language-specific sentence encoders to avoid negative interference between languages (i.e., the curse). We then align all non-English monolingual encoders to the English encoder by training a cross-lingual alignment adapter on top of each, preventing interference with monolingual specialization from the first step. In both steps, we resort to contrastive learning on machine-translated paraphrase data.

In order to extend this capability to a multi-modal setting (i.e. speech and language), this paper introduces the Seal model, an abbreviation for speech language model. It incorporates a novel alignment method, in which Kullback-Leibler divergence loss is performed to train a projector that bridges a frozen speech encoder with a frozen language model decoder. The resulting Seal model exhibits robust performance as a few-shot learner on two speech understanding tasks. Additionally, consistency experiments are conducted to validate its robustness on different pre-trained language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14875v1,2024-07
Understanding the Relationship between Prompts and Response Uncertainty in Large Language Models,"Ze Yu Zhang, Arun Verma, Finale Doshi-Velez, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in decision-making, but their reliability, especially in critical tasks like healthcare, is not well-established. Therefore, understanding how LLMs reason and make decisions is crucial for their safe deployment. This paper investigates how the uncertainty of responses generated by LLMs relates to the information provided in the input prompt. Leveraging the insight that LLMs learn to infer latent concepts during pretraining, we propose a prompt-response concept model that explains how LLMs generate responses and helps understand the relationship between prompts and response uncertainty. We show that the uncertainty decreases as the prompt's informativeness increases, similar to epistemic uncertainty. Our detailed experimental results on real datasets validate our proposed model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14845v2,2024-07

Automatic Real-word Error Correction in Persian Text,"Seyed Mohammad Sadegh Dashti, Amid Khatibi Bardsiri, Mehdi Jafari Shahbazzadeh","Automatic spelling correction stands as a pivotal challenge within the ambit of natural language processing (NLP), demanding nuanced solutions. Traditional spelling correction techniques are typically only capable of detecting and correcting non-word errors, such as typos and misspellings. However, context-sensitive errors, also known as real-word errors, are more challenging to detect because they are valid words that are used incorrectly in a given context. The Persian language, characterized by its rich morphology and complex syntax, presents formidable challenges to automatic spelling correction systems. Furthermore, the limited availability of Persian language resources makes it difficult to train effective spelling correction models. This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach for precise and efficient real-word error correction in Persian text. Our methodology adopts a structured, multi-tiered approach, employing semantic analysis, feature selection, and advanced classifiers to enhance error detection and correction efficacy. The innovative architecture discovers and stores semantic similarities between words and phrases in Persian text. The classifiers accurately identify real-word errors, while the semantic ranking algorithm determines the most probable corrections for real-word errors, taking into account specific spelling correction and context properties such as context, semantic similarity, and edit-distance measures. Evaluations have demonstrated that our proposed method surpasses previous Persian real-word error correction models. Our method achieves an impressive F-measure of 96.6% in the detection phase and an accuracy of 99.1% in the correction phase. These results clearly indicate that our approach is a highly promising solution for automatic real-word error correction in Persian text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14795v1,2024-07
Step-by-Step Reasoning to Solve Grid Puzzles: Where do LLMs Falter?,"Nemika Tyagi, Mihir Parmar, Mohith Kulkarni, Aswin RRV, Nisarg Patel, Mutsumi Nakamura, Arindam Mitra, Chitta Baral","Solving grid puzzles involves a significant amount of logical reasoning. Hence, it is a good domain to evaluate the reasoning capability of a model which can then guide us to improve the reasoning ability of models. However, most existing works evaluate only the final predicted answer of a puzzle, without delving into an in-depth analysis of the LLMs' reasoning chains (such as where they falter) or providing any finer metrics to evaluate them. Since LLMs may rely on simple heuristics or artifacts to predict the final answer, it is crucial to evaluate the generated reasoning chain beyond overall correctness measures, for accurately evaluating the reasoning abilities of LLMs. To this end, we first develop GridPuzzle, an evaluation dataset comprising 274 grid-based puzzles with different complexities. Second, we propose a new error taxonomy derived from manual analysis of reasoning chains from LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini, Mistral, and Llama-2. Then, we develop an LLM-based framework for large-scale subjective evaluation (i.e., identifying errors) and an objective metric, PuzzleEval, to evaluate the correctness of reasoning chains. Evaluating reasoning chains from LLMs leads to several interesting findings. We further show that existing prompting methods used for enhancing models' reasoning abilities do not improve performance on GridPuzzle. This highlights the importance of understanding fine-grained errors and presents a challenge for future research to enhance LLMs' puzzle-solving abilities by developing methods that address these errors. Data and source code are available at https://github.com/Mihir3009/GridPuzzle.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14790v2,2024-07
PERCORE: A Deep Learning-Based Framework for Persian Spelling Correction with Phonetic Analysis,"Seyed Mohammad Sadegh Dashti, Amid Khatibi Bardsiri, Mehdi Jafari Shahbazzadeh","This research introduces a state-of-the-art Persian spelling correction system that seamlessly integrates deep learning techniques with phonetic analysis, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of natural language processing (NLP) for Persian. Utilizing a fine-tuned language representation model, our methodology effectively combines deep contextual analysis with phonetic insights, adeptly correcting both non-word and real-word spelling errors. This strategy proves particularly effective in tackling the unique complexities of Persian spelling, including its elaborate morphology and the challenge of homophony. A thorough evaluation on a wide-ranging dataset confirms our system's superior performance compared to existing methods, with impressive F1-Scores of 0.890 for detecting real-word errors and 0.905 for correcting them. Additionally, the system demonstrates a strong capability in non-word error correction, achieving an F1-Score of 0.891. These results illustrate the significant benefits of incorporating phonetic insights into deep learning models for spelling correction.

On the Design and Analysis of LLM-Based Algorithms,"Yanxi Chen, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding, Jingren Zhou","We initiate a formal investigation into the design and analysis of LLM-based algorithms, i.e. algorithms that contain one or multiple calls of large language models (LLMs) as sub-routines and critically rely on the capabilities of LLMs. While LLM-based algorithms, ranging from basic LLM calls with prompt engineering to complicated LLM-powered agent systems and compound AI systems, have achieved remarkable empirical success, the design and optimization of them have mostly relied on heuristics and trial-and-errors, which is largely due to a lack of formal and analytical study for these algorithms. To fill this gap, we start by identifying the computational-graph representation of LLM-based algorithms, the design principle of task decomposition, and some key abstractions, which then facilitate our formal analysis for the accuracy and efficiency of LLM-based algorithms, despite the black-box nature of LLMs. Through extensive analytical and empirical investigation in a series of case studies, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide range of scenarios and diverse patterns of LLM-based algorithms, such as parallel, hierarchical and recursive task decomposition. Our proposed framework holds promise for advancing LLM-based algorithms, by revealing the reasons behind curious empirical phenomena, guiding the choices of hyperparameters, predicting the empirical performance of algorithms, and inspiring new algorithm design. To promote further study of LLM-based algorithms, we release our source code at https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope/tree/main/examples/paper_llm_based_algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14788v2,2024-07

Golden-Retriever: High-Fidelity Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation for Industrial Knowledge Base,"Zhiyu An, Xianzhong Ding, Yen-Chun Fu, Cheng-Chung Chu, Yan Li, Wan Du","This paper introduces Golden-Retriever, designed to efficiently navigate vast industrial knowledge bases, overcoming challenges in traditional LLM fine-tuning and RAG frameworks with domain-specific jargon and context interpretation. Golden-Retriever incorporates a reflection-based question augmentation step before document retrieval, which involves identifying jargon, clarifying its meaning based on context, and augmenting the question accordingly. Specifically, our method extracts and lists all jargon and abbreviations in the input question, determines the context against a pre-defined list, and queries a jargon dictionary for extended definitions and descriptions. This comprehensive augmentation ensures the RAG framework retrieves the most relevant documents by providing clear context and resolving ambiguities, significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Evaluations using three open-source LLMs on a domain-specific question-answer dataset demonstrate Golden-Retriever's superior performance, providing a robust solution for efficiently integrating and querying industrial knowledge bases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00798v1,2024-07
Hard Prompts Made Interpretable: Sparse Entropy Regularization for Prompt Tuning with RL,"Yunseon Choi, Sangmin Bae, Seonghyun Ban, Minchan Jeong, Chuheng Zhang, Lei Song, Li Zhao, Jiang Bian, Kee-Eung Kim","With the advent of foundation models, prompt tuning has positioned itself as an important technique for directing model behaviors and eliciting desired responses. Prompt tuning regards selecting appropriate keywords included into the input, thereby adapting to the downstream task without adjusting or fine-tuning the model parameters. There is a wide range of work in prompt tuning, from approaches that directly harness the backpropagated gradient signals from the model, to those employing black-box optimization such as reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Our primary focus is on RLPrompt, which aims to find optimal prompt tokens leveraging soft Q-learning. While the results show promise, we have observed that the prompts frequently appear unnatural, which impedes their interpretability. We address this limitation by using sparse Tsallis entropy regularization, a principled approach to filtering out unlikely tokens from consideration. We extensively evaluate our approach across various tasks, including few-shot text classification, unsupervised text style transfer, and textual inversion from images. The results indicate a notable improvement over baselines, highlighting the efficacy of our approach in addressing the challenges of prompt tuning. Moreover, we show that the prompts discovered using our method are more natural and interpretable compared to those from other baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14733v1,2024-07

Contextual modulation of language comprehension in a dynamic neural model of lexical meaning,"Michael C. Stern, Maria M. Piñango","We propose and computationally implement a dynamic neural model of lexical meaning, and experimentally test its behavioral predictions. We demonstrate the architecture and behavior of the model using as a test case the English lexical item 'have', focusing on its polysemous use. In the model, 'have' maps to a semantic space defined by two continuous conceptual dimensions, connectedness and control asymmetry, previously proposed to parameterize the conceptual system for language. The mapping is modeled as coupling between a neural node representing the lexical item and neural fields representing the conceptual dimensions. While lexical knowledge is modeled as a stable coupling pattern, real-time lexical meaning retrieval is modeled as the motion of neural activation patterns between metastable states corresponding to semantic interpretations or readings. Model simulations capture two previously reported empirical observations: (1) contextual modulation of lexical semantic interpretation, and (2) individual variation in the magnitude of this modulation. Simulations also generate a novel prediction that the by-trial relationship between sentence reading time and acceptability should be contextually modulated. An experiment combining self-paced reading and acceptability judgments replicates previous results and confirms the new model prediction. Altogether, results support a novel perspective on lexical polysemy: that the many related meanings of a word are metastable neural activation states that arise from the nonlinear dynamics of neural populations governing interpretation on continuous semantic dimensions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14701v1,2024-07
Compact Language Models via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation,"Saurav Muralidharan, Sharath Turuvekere Sreenivas, Raviraj Joshi, Marcin Chochowski, Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro, Jan Kautz, Pavlo Molchanov","Large language models (LLMs) targeting different deployment scales and sizes are currently produced by training each variant from scratch; this is extremely compute-intensive. In this paper, we investigate if pruning an existing LLM and then re-training it with a fraction (<3%) of the original training data can be a suitable alternative to repeated, full retraining. To this end, we develop a set of practical and effective compression best practices for LLMs that combine depth, width, attention and MLP pruning with knowledge distillation-based retraining; we arrive at these best practices through a detailed empirical exploration of pruning strategies for each axis, methods to combine axes, distillation strategies, and search techniques for arriving at optimal compressed architectures. We use this guide to compress the Nemotron-4 family of LLMs by a factor of 2-4x, and compare their performance to similarly-sized models on a variety of language modeling tasks. Deriving 8B and 4B models from an already pretrained 15B model using our approach requires up to 40x fewer training tokens per model compared to training from scratch; this results in compute cost savings of 1.8x for training the full model family (15B, 8B, and 4B). Minitron models exhibit up to a 16% improvement in MMLU scores compared to training from scratch, perform comparably to other community models such as Mistral 7B, Gemma 7B and Llama-3 8B, and outperform state-of-the-art compression techniques from the literature.

Advancing Chart Question Answering with Robust Chart Component Recognition,"Hanwen Zheng, Sijia Wang, Chris Thomas, Lifu Huang","Chart comprehension presents significant challenges for machine learning models due to the diverse and intricate shapes of charts. Existing multimodal methods often overlook these visual features or fail to integrate them effectively for chart question answering (ChartQA). To address this, we introduce Chartformer, a unified framework that enhances chart component recognition by accurately identifying and classifying components such as bars, lines, pies, titles, legends, and axes. Additionally, we propose a novel Question-guided Deformable Co-Attention (QDCAt) mechanism, which fuses chart features encoded by Chartformer with the given question, leveraging the question's guidance to ground the correct answer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline models in chart component recognition and ChartQA tasks, achieving improvements of 3.2% in mAP and 15.4% in accuracy, respectively. These results underscore the robustness of our solution for detailed visual data interpretation across various applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21038v1,2024-07
Human-Interpretable Adversarial Prompt Attack on Large Language Models with Situational Context,"Nilanjana Das, Edward Raff, Manas Gaur","Previous research on testing the vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) using adversarial attacks has primarily focused on nonsensical prompt injections, which are easily detected upon manual or automated review (e.g., via byte entropy). However, the exploration of innocuous human-understandable malicious prompts augmented with adversarial injections remains limited. In this research, we explore converting a nonsensical suffix attack into a sensible prompt via a situation-driven contextual re-writing. This allows us to show suffix conversion without any gradients, using only LLMs to perform the attacks, and thus better understand the scope of possible risks. We combine an independent, meaningful adversarial insertion and situations derived from movies to check if this can trick an LLM. The situations are extracted from the IMDB dataset, and prompts are defined following a few-shot chain-of-thought prompting. Our approach demonstrates that a successful situation-driven attack can be executed on both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We find that across many LLMs, as few as 1 attempt produces an attack and that these attacks transfer between LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14644v2,2024-07
CVE-LLM : Automatic vulnerability evaluation in medical device industry using large language models,"Rikhiya Ghosh, Oladimeji Farri, Hans-Martin von Stockhausen, Martin Schmitt, George Marica Vasile","The healthcare industry is currently experiencing an unprecedented wave of cybersecurity attacks, impacting millions of individuals.

Yet, a surprisingly simple and strong inference-time strategy is Best-of-N sampling that selects the best generation among N candidates. In this paper, we propose Best-of-N Distillation (BOND), a novel RLHF algorithm that seeks to emulate Best-of-N but without its significant computational overhead at inference time. Specifically, BOND is a distribution matching algorithm that forces the distribution of generations from the policy to get closer to the Best-of-N distribution. We use the Jeffreys divergence (a linear combination of forward and backward KL) to balance between mode-covering and mode-seeking behavior, and derive an iterative formulation that utilizes a moving anchor for efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and several design choices through experiments on abstractive summarization and Gemma models.

Evaluating language models as risk scores,"André F. Cruz, Moritz Hardt, Celestine Mendler-Dünner","Current question-answering benchmarks predominantly focus on accuracy in realizable prediction tasks. Conditioned on a question and answer-key, does the most likely token match the ground truth? Such benchmarks necessarily fail to evaluate LLMs' ability to quantify ground-truth outcome uncertainty. In this work, we focus on the use of LLMs as risk scores for unrealizable prediction tasks. We introduce folktexts, a software package to systematically generate risk scores using LLMs, and evaluate them against US Census data products. A flexible API enables the use of different prompting schemes, local or web-hosted models, and diverse census columns that can be used to compose custom prediction tasks. We evaluate 17 recent LLMs across five proposed benchmark tasks. We find that zero-shot risk scores produced by multiple-choice question-answering have high predictive signal but are widely miscalibrated. Base models consistently overestimate outcome uncertainty, while instruction-tuned models underestimate uncertainty and produce over-confident risk scores. In fact, instruction-tuning polarizes answer distribution regardless of true underlying data uncertainty. This reveals a general inability of instruction-tuned LLMs to express data uncertainty using multiple-choice answers. A separate experiment using verbalized chat-style risk queries yields substantially improved calibration across instruction-tuned models. These differences in ability to quantify data uncertainty cannot be revealed in realizable settings, and highlight a blind-spot in the current evaluation ecosystem that folktexts covers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14614v3,2024-07
Adversarial Databases Improve Success in Retrieval-based Large Language Models,"Sean Wu, Michael Koo, Li Yo Kao, Andy Black, Lesley Blum, Fabien Scalzo, Ira Kurtz","Open-source LLMs have shown great potential as fine-tuned chatbots, and demonstrate robust abilities in reasoning and surpass many existing benchmarks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for improving the performance of LLMs on tasks that the models weren't explicitly trained on, by leveraging external knowledge databases. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of RAG to more successfully accomplish downstream tasks when using vector datasets that consist of relevant background information. It has been implicitly assumed by those in the field that if adversarial background information is utilized in this context, that the success of using a RAG-based approach would be nonexistent or even negatively impact the results. To address this assumption, we tested several open-source LLMs on the ability of RAG to improve their success in answering multiple-choice questions (MCQ) in the medical subspecialty field of Nephrology. Unlike previous studies, we examined the effect of RAG in utilizing both relevant and adversarial background databases. We set up several open-source LLMs, including Llama 3, Phi-3, Mixtral 8x7b, Zephyr$\beta$, and Gemma 7B Instruct, in a zero-shot RAG pipeline. As adversarial sources of information, text from the Bible and a Random Words generated database were used for comparison. Our data show that most of the open-source LLMs improve their multiple-choice test-taking success as expected when incorporating relevant information vector databases. Surprisingly however, adversarial Bible text significantly improved the success of many LLMs and even random word text improved test taking ability of some of the models. In summary, our results demonstrate for the first time the countertintuitive ability of adversarial information datasets to improve the RAG-based LLM success.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14609v1,2024-07
Internal Consistency and Self-Feedback in Large Language Models: A Survey,"Xun Liang, Shichao Song, Zifan Zheng, Hanyu Wang, Qingchen Yu, Xunkai Li, Rong-Hua Li, Yi Wang, Zhonghao Wang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li","Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit deficient reasoning or generate hallucinations. To address these, studies prefixed with ""Self-"" such as Self-Consistency, Self-Improve, and Self-Refine have been initiated. They share a commonality: involving LLMs evaluating and updating themselves. Nonetheless, these efforts lack a unified perspective on summarization, as existing surveys predominantly focus on categorization.   In this paper, we use a unified perspective of internal consistency, offering explanations for reasoning deficiencies and hallucinations. Internal consistency refers to the consistency in expressions among LLMs' latent, decoding, or response layers based on sampling methodologies. Then, we introduce an effective theoretical framework capable of mining internal consistency, named Self-Feedback. This framework consists of two modules: Self-Evaluation and Self-Update. The former captures internal consistency signals, while the latter leverages the signals to enhance either the model's response or the model itself. This framework has been employed in numerous studies.   We systematically classify these studies by tasks and lines of work; summarize relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks; and delve into the concern, ""Does Self-Feedback Really Work?""

On Pre-training of Multimodal Language Models Customized for Chart Understanding,"Wan-Cyuan Fan, Yen-Chun Chen, Mengchen Liu, Lu Yuan, Leonid Sigal","Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field of scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14506v2,2024-07
Evaluating the Reliability of Self-Explanations in Large Language Models,"Korbinian Randl, John Pavlopoulos, Aron Henriksson, Tony Lindgren","This paper investigates the reliability of explanations generated by large language models (LLMs) when prompted to explain their previous output. We evaluate two kinds of such self-explanations - extractive and counterfactual - using three state-of-the-art LLMs (2B to 8B parameters) on two different classification tasks (objective and subjective). Our findings reveal, that, while these self-explanations can correlate with human judgement, they do not fully and accurately follow the model's decision process, indicating a gap between perceived and actual model reasoning. We show that this gap can be bridged because prompting LLMs for counterfactual explanations can produce faithful, informative, and easy-to-verify results. These counterfactuals offer a promising alternative to traditional explainability methods (e.g. SHAP, LIME), provided that prompts are tailored to specific tasks and checked for validity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14487v1,2024-07
ChatQA 2: Bridging the Gap to Proprietary LLMs in Long Context and RAG Capabilities,"Peng Xu, Wei Ping, Xianchao Wu, Chejian Xu, Zihan Liu, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro","In this work, we introduce ChatQA 2, an Llama 3.0-based model with a 128K context window, designed to bridge the gap between open-source LLMs and leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo) in long-context understanding and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These two capabilities are essential for LLMs to process large volumes of information that cannot fit into a single prompt and are complementary to each other, depending on the downstream tasks and computational budgets. We present a detailed continued training recipe to extend the context window of Llama3-70B-base from 8K to 128K tokens, along with a three-stage instruction tuning process to enhance the model's instruction-following, RAG performance, and long-context understanding capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B model outperforms most existing state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, on ultra-long tasks beyond 100K tokens, as well as on the RAG benchmark using only a 4K context window, showing the strong long context capability across varying sequence lengths. We further provide extensive comparisons between direct long-context and RAG solutions using the same state-of-the-art long-context LLMs. Interestingly, we find that the performance of strong long-context LLMs using RAG improves when retrieving a larger number of chunks. With a large set of top-k chunks, RAG consistently outperforms direct long-context solution using the same state-of-the-art long-context models (e.g., Llama3-ChatQA-2-70B and Qwen2-72B-Instruct) on both 32K benchmarks and real-world 128K tasks.

Check-Eval: A Checklist-based Approach for Evaluating Text Quality,"Jayr Pereira, Andre Assumpcao, Roberto Lotufo","Evaluating the quality of text generated by large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge. Traditional metrics often fail to align well with human judgments, particularly in tasks requiring creativity and nuance. In this paper, we propose \textsc{Check-Eval}, a novel evaluation framework leveraging LLMs to assess the quality of generated text through a checklist-based approach. \textsc{Check-Eval} can be employed as both a reference-free and reference-dependent evaluation method, providing a structured and interpretable assessment of text quality. The framework consists of two main stages: checklist generation and checklist evaluation.

Our results demonstrate that \textsc{Check-Eval} achieves higher correlations with human judgments compared to existing metrics, such as \textsc{G-Eval} and \textsc{GPTScore}, underscoring its potential as a more reliable and effective evaluation framework for natural language generation tasks.

AudioInsight: Detecting Social Contexts Relevant to Social Anxiety from Speech,"Varun Reddy, Zhiyuan Wang, Emma Toner, Max Larrazabal, Mehdi Boukhechba, Bethany A. Teachman, Laura E. Barnes","During social interactions, understanding the intricacies of the context can be vital, particularly for socially anxious individuals. While previous research has found that the presence of a social interaction can be detected from ambient audio, the nuances within social contexts, which influence how anxiety provoking interactions are, remain largely unexplored. As an alternative to traditional, burdensome methods like self-report, this study presents a novel approach that harnesses ambient audio segments to detect social threat contexts. We focus on two key dimensions: number of interaction partners (dyadic vs. group) and degree of evaluative threat (explicitly evaluative vs. not explicitly evaluative). Building on data from a Zoom-based social interaction study (N=52 college students, of whom the majority N=45 are socially anxious), we employ deep learning methods to achieve strong detection performance. Under sample-wide 5-fold Cross Validation (CV), our model distinguished dyadic from group interactions with 90\% accuracy and detected evaluative threat at 83\%. Using a leave-one-group-out CV, accuracies were 82\% and 77\%, respectively. While our data are based on virtual interactions due to pandemic constraints, our method has the potential to extend to diverse real-world settings. This research underscores the potential of passive sensing and AI to differentiate intricate social contexts, and may ultimately advance the ability of context-aware digital interventions to offer personalized mental health support.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14458v1,2024-07
System-1.x: Learning to Balance Fast and Slow Planning with Language Models,"Swarnadeep Saha, Archiki Prasad, Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Peter Hase, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal","Language models can be used to solve long-horizon planning problems in two distinct modes: a fast 'System-1' mode, directly generating plans without any explicit search or backtracking, and a slow 'System-2' mode, planning step-by-step by explicitly searching over possible actions. While System-2 is typically more effective, it is also more computationally expensive, making it infeasible for long plans or large action spaces. Moreover, isolated System-1 or 2 ignores the user's end goals, failing to provide ways to control the model's behavior. To this end, we propose the System-1.x Planner, a controllable planning framework with LLMs that is capable of generating hybrid plans and balancing between the two planning modes based on the difficulty of the problem at hand. System-1.x consists of (i) a controller, (ii) a System-1 Planner, and (iii) a System-2 Planner. Based on a user-specified hybridization factor (x) governing the mixture between System-1 and 2, the controller decomposes a problem into sub-goals, and classifies them as easy or hard to be solved by either System-1 or 2, respectively. We fine-tune all three components on top of a single base LLM, requiring only search traces as supervision. Experiments with two diverse planning tasks -- Maze Navigation and Blocksworld -- show that our System-1.x Planner outperforms a System-1 Planner, a System-2 Planner trained to approximate A* search, and also a symbolic planner (A*). We demonstrate the following key properties of our planner: (1) controllability: increasing the hybridization factor (e.g., System-1.75 vs 1.5) performs more search, improving performance, (2) flexibility: by building a neuro-symbolic variant with a neural System-1 and a symbolic System-2, we can use existing symbolic methods, and (3) generalizability: by being able to learn from different search algorithms, our method is robust to the choice of search algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14414v1,2024-07
The Vision of Autonomic Computing: Can LLMs Make It a Reality?,"Zhiyang Zhang, Fangkai Yang, Xiaoting Qin, Jue Zhang, Qingwei Lin, Gong Cheng, Dongmei Zhang, Saravan Rajmohan, Qi Zhang","The Vision of Autonomic Computing (ACV), proposed over two decades ago, envisions computing systems that self-manage akin to biological organisms, adapting seamlessly to changing environments. Despite decades of research, achieving ACV remains challenging due to the dynamic and complex nature of modern computing systems. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions to these challenges by leveraging their extensive knowledge, language understanding, and task automation capabilities. This paper explores the feasibility of realizing ACV through an LLM-based multi-agent framework for microservice management. We introduce a five-level taxonomy for autonomous service maintenance and present an online evaluation benchmark based on the Sock Shop microservice demo project to assess our framework's performance. Our findings demonstrate significant progress towards achieving Level 3 autonomy, highlighting the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting and resolving issues within microservice architectures. This study contributes to advancing autonomic computing by pioneering the integration of LLMs into microservice management frameworks, paving the way for more adaptive and self-managing computing systems.

Open Artificial Knowledge,"Vadim Borisov, Richard H. Schreiber","The tremendous success of chat-based AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini stems from Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on vast amount of datasets. However, acquiring high-quality, diverse, and ethically sourced training data remains a significant challenge. We introduce the Open Artificial Knowledge (OAK) dataset, a large-scale resource of over 500 million tokens (at the moment of writing) designed to address this issue. OAK leverages an ensemble of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT4o, LLaMa3-70B, LLaMa3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, Gemma-7B, and Gemma-2-9B , to generate high-quality text across diverse domains, guided by Wikipedia's main categories. Our methodology ensures broad knowledge coverage while maintaining coherence and factual accuracy. The OAK dataset aims to foster the development of more capable and aligned language models while addressing critical issues of data scarcity and privacy in LLM training, and it is freely available on www.oakdataset.org.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14371v1,2024-07
Improving Retrieval in Sponsored Search by Leveraging Query Context Signals,"Akash Kumar Mohankumar, Gururaj K, Gagan Madan, Amit Singh","Accurately retrieving relevant bid keywords for user queries is critical in Sponsored Search but remains challenging, particularly for short, ambiguous queries. Existing dense and generative retrieval models often fail to capture nuanced user intent in these cases. To address this, we propose an approach to enhance query understanding by augmenting queries with rich contextual signals derived from web search results and large language models, stored in an online cache. Specifically, we use web search titles and snippets to ground queries in real-world information and utilize GPT-4 to generate query rewrites and explanations that clarify user intent. These signals are efficiently integrated through a Fusion-in-Decoder based Unity architecture, enabling both dense and generative retrieval with serving costs on par with traditional context-free models. To address scenarios where context is unavailable in the cache, we introduce context glancing, a curriculum learning strategy that improves model robustness and performance even without contextual signals during inference. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that our context-aware approach substantially outperforms context-free models. Furthermore, online A/B testing on a prominent search engine across 160+ countries shows significant improvements in user engagement and revenue.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14346v2,2024-07
"LLMs left, right, and center: Assessing GPT's capabilities to label political bias from web domains","Raphael Hernandes, Giulio Corsi","This research investigates whether OpenAI's GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language model, can accurately classify the political bias of news sources based solely on their URLs. Given the subjective nature of political labels, third-party bias ratings like those from Ad Fontes Media, AllSides, and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) are often used in research to analyze news source diversity. This study aims to determine if GPT-4 can replicate these human ratings on a seven-degree scale (""far-left"" to ""far-right""). The analysis compares GPT-4's classifications against MBFC's, and controls for website popularity using Open PageRank scores. Findings reveal a high correlation ($\text{Spearman's } \rho = .89$, $n = 5,877$, $p < 0.001$) between GPT-4's and MBFC's ratings, indicating the model's potential reliability. However, GPT-4 abstained from classifying approximately $\frac{2}{3}$ of the dataset. It is more likely to abstain from rating unpopular websites, which also suffer from less accurate assessments. The LLM tends to avoid classifying sources that MBFC considers to be centrist, resulting in more polarized outputs. Finally, this analysis shows a slight leftward skew in GPT's classifications compared to MBFC's. Therefore, while this paper suggests that while GPT-4 can be a scalable, cost-effective tool for political bias classification of news websites, its use should be as a complement to human judgment to mitigate biases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14344v2,2024-07
Multimodal Misinformation Detection using Large Vision-Language Models,"Sahar Tahmasebi, Eric Müller-Budack, Ralph Ewerth","The increasing proliferation of misinformation and its alarming impact have motivated both industry and academia to develop approaches for misinformation detection and fact checking. Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks, but whether and how LLMs could help with misinformation detection remains relatively underexplored. Most of existing state-of-the-art approaches either do not consider evidence and solely focus on claim related features or assume the evidence to be provided. Few approaches consider evidence retrieval as part of the misinformation detection but rely on fine-tuning models. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs for misinformation detection in a zero-shot setting. We incorporate an evidence retrieval component into the process as it is crucial to gather pertinent information from various sources to detect the veracity of claims. To this end, we propose a novel re-ranking approach for multimodal evidence retrieval using both LLMs and large vision-language models (LVLM). The retrieved evidence samples (images and texts) serve as the input for an LVLM-based approach for multimodal fact verification (LVLM4FV). To enable a fair evaluation, we address the issue of incomplete ground truth for evidence samples in an existing evidence retrieval dataset by annotating a more complete set of evidence samples for both image and text retrieval. Our experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in both evidence retrieval and fact verification tasks and also better generalization capability across dataset compared to the supervised baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14321v1,2024-07
How to Engage Your Readers? Generating Guiding Questions to Promote Active Reading,"Peng Cui, Vilém Zouhar, Xiaoyu Zhang, Mrinmaya Sachan","Using questions in written text is an effective strategy to enhance readability. However, what makes an active reading question good, what the linguistic role of these questions is, and what is their impact on human reading remains understudied. We introduce GuidingQ, a dataset of 10K in-text questions from textbooks and scientific articles. By analyzing the dataset, we present a comprehensive understanding of the use, distribution, and linguistic characteristics of these questions. Then, we explore various approaches to generate such questions using language models. Our results highlight the importance of capturing inter-question relationships and the challenge of question position identification in generating these questions. Finally, we conduct a human study to understand the implication of such questions on reading comprehension. We find that the generated questions are of high quality and are almost as effective as human-written questions in terms of improving readers' memorization and comprehension.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14309v2,2024-07
Foundation Models for Autonomous Robots in Unstructured Environments,"Hossein Naderi, Alireza Shojaei, Lifu Huang","Automating activities through robots in unstructured environments, such as construction sites, has been a long-standing desire. However, the high degree of unpredictable events in these settings has resulted in far less adoption compared to more structured settings, such as manufacturing, where robots can be hard-coded or trained on narrowly defined datasets. Recently, pretrained foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by providing zero-shot solutions for problems do not present in the training data, proposing them as a potential solution for introducing robots to unstructured environments. To this end, this study investigates potential opportunities and challenges of pretrained foundation models from a multi-dimensional perspective. The study systematically reviews application of foundation models in two field of robotic and unstructured environment and then synthesized them with deliberative acting theory. Findings showed that linguistic capabilities of LLMs have been utilized more than other features for improving perception in human-robot interactions. On the other hand, findings showed that the use of LLMs demonstrated more applications in project management and safety in construction, and natural hazard detection in disaster management. Synthesizing these findings, we located the current state-of-the-art in this field on a five-level scale of automation, placing them at conditional automation. This assessment was then used to envision future scenarios, challenges, and solutions toward autonomous safe unstructured environments. Our study can be seen as a benchmark to track our progress toward that future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14296v2,2024-07
CoVoSwitch: Machine Translation of Synthetic Code-Switched Text Based on Intonation Units,Yeeun Kang,"Multilingual code-switching research is often hindered by the lack and linguistically biased status of available datasets. To expand language representation, we synthesize code-switching data by replacing intonation units detected through PSST, a speech segmentation model fine-tuned from OpenAI's Whisper, using a speech-to-text translation dataset, CoVoST 2. With our dataset, CoVoSwitch, spanning 13 languages, we evaluate the code-switching translation performance of two multilingual translation models, M2M-100 418M and NLLB-200 600M. We reveal that the inclusion of code-switching units results in higher translation performance than monolingual settings and that models are better at code-switching translation into English than non-English. Further, low-resource languages gain most from integration of code-switched units when translating into English but much less when translating into non-English. Translations into low-resource languages also perform worse than even raw code-switched inputs. We find that systems excel at copying English tokens but struggle with non-English tokens, that the off-target problem in monolingual settings is also relevant in code-switching settings, and that models hallucinate in code-switching translation by introducing words absent in both of the original source sentences. CoVoSwitch and code are available at https://github.com/sophiayk20/covoswitch.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14295v1,2024-07
Voices in a Crowd: Searching for Clusters of Unique Perspectives,"Nikolas Vitsakis, Amit Parekh, Ioannis Konstas","Language models have been shown to reproduce underlying biases existing in their training data, which is the majority perspective by default. Proposed solutions aim to capture minority perspectives by either modelling annotator disagreements or grouping annotators based on shared metadata, both of which face significant challenges. We propose a framework that trains models without encoding annotator metadata, extracts latent embeddings informed by annotator behaviour, and creates clusters of similar opinions, that we refer to as voices. Resulting clusters are validated post-hoc via internal and external quantitative metrics, as well a qualitative analysis to identify the type of voice that each cluster represents. Our results demonstrate the strong generalisation capability of our framework, indicated by resulting clusters being adequately robust, while also capturing minority perspectives based on different demographic factors throughout two distinct datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14259v1,2024-07

Hierarchical Windowed Graph Attention Network and a Large Scale Dataset for Isolated Indian Sign Language Recognition,"Suvajit Patra, Arkadip Maitra, Megha Tiwari, K. Kumaran, Swathy Prabhu, Swami Punyeshwarananda, Soumitra Samanta","Automatic Sign Language (SL) recognition is an important task in the computer vision community. To build a robust SL recognition system, we need a considerable amount of data which is lacking particularly in Indian sign language (ISL). In this paper, we introduce a large-scale isolated ISL dataset and a novel SL recognition model based on skeleton graph structure. The dataset covers 2002 daily used common words in the deaf community recorded by 20 (10 male and 10 female) deaf adult signers (contains 40033 videos). We propose a SL recognition model namely Hierarchical Windowed Graph Attention Network (HWGAT) by utilizing the human upper body skeleton graph. The HWGAT tries to capture distinctive motions by giving attention to different body parts induced by the human skeleton graph. The utility of the proposed dataset and the usefulness of our model are evaluated through extensive experiments. We pre-trained the proposed model on the presented dataset and fine-tuned it across different sign language datasets further boosting the performance of 1.10, 0.46, 0.78, and 6.84 percentage points on INCLUDE, LSA64, AUTSL and WLASL respectively compared to the existing state-of-the-art keypoints-based models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14224v2,2024-07
Braille-to-Speech Generator: Audio Generation Based on Joint Fine-Tuning of CLIP and Fastspeech2,"Chun Xu, En-Wei Sun","An increasing number of Chinese people are troubled by different degrees of visual impairment, which has made the modal conversion between a single image or video frame in the visual field and the audio expressing the same information a research hotspot. Deep learning technologies such as OCR+Vocoder and Im2Wav enable English audio synthesis or image-to-sound matching in a self-supervised manner. However, the audio data used for training is limited and English is not universal for visually impaired people with different educational levels. Therefore, for the sake of solving the problems of data volume and language applicability to improve the reading efficiency of visually impaired people, a set of image-to-speech framework CLIP-KNN-Fastspeech2 based on the Chinese context was constructed. The framework integrates multiple basic models and adopts the strategy of independent pre-training and joint fine-tuning. First, the Chinese CLIP and Fastspeech2 text-to-speech models were pre-trained on two public datasets, MUGE and Baker, respectively, and their convergence was verified. Subsequently, joint fine-tuning was performed using a self-built Braille image dataset. Experimental results on multiple public datasets such as VGGSound, Flickr8k, ImageHear, and the self-built Braille dataset BIT-DP show that the model has improved objective indicators such as BLEU4,FAD(Fr\'echet Audio Distance), WER(Word Error Ratio), and even inference speed. This verifies that the constructed model still has the ability to synthesize high-quality speech under limited data, and also proves the effectiveness of the joint training strategy that integrates multiple basic models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14212v1,2024-07
LeKUBE: A Legal Knowledge Update BEnchmark,"Changyue Wang, Weihang Su, Hu Yiran, Qingyao Ai, Yueyue Wu, Cheng Luo, Yiqun Liu, Min Zhang, Shaoping Ma","Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly shaped the applications of AI in multiple fields, including the studies of legal intelligence. Trained on extensive legal texts, including statutes and legal documents, the legal LLMs can capture important legal knowledge/concepts effectively and provide important support for downstream legal applications such as legal consultancy. Yet, the dynamic nature of legal statutes and interpretations also poses new challenges to the use of LLMs in legal applications. Particularly, how to update the legal knowledge of LLMs effectively and efficiently has become an important research problem in practice. Existing benchmarks for evaluating knowledge update methods are mostly designed for the open domain and cannot address the specific challenges of the legal domain, such as the nuanced application of new legal knowledge, the complexity and lengthiness of legal regulations, and the intricate nature of legal reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce the Legal Knowledge Update BEnchmark, i.e. LeKUBE, which evaluates knowledge update methods for legal LLMs across five dimensions. Specifically, we categorize the needs of knowledge updates in the legal domain with the help of legal professionals, and then hire annotators from law schools to create synthetic updates to the Chinese Criminal and Civil Code as well as sets of questions of which the answers would change after the updates. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge update methods, we reveal a notable gap between existing knowledge update methods and the unique needs of the legal domain, emphasizing the need for further research and development of knowledge update mechanisms tailored for legal LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14192v2,2024-07
Automatic Classification of News Subjects in Broadcast News: Application to a Gender Bias Representation Analysis,"Valentin Pelloin, Lena Dodson, Émile Chapuis, Nicolas Hervé, David Doukhan","This paper introduces a computational framework designed to delineate gender distribution biases in topics covered by French TV and radio news.

A Large Language Model (LLM) is used in few-shot conversation mode to obtain a topic classification on those transcriptions. Using the generated LLM annotations, we explore the finetuning of a specialized smaller classification model, to reduce the computational cost. To evaluate the performances of these models, we construct and annotate a dataset of 804 dialogues. This dataset is made available free of charge for research purposes. We show that women are notably underrepresented in subjects such as sports, politics and conflicts. Conversely, on topics such as weather, commercials and health, women have more speaking time than their overall average across all subjects.

PassTSL: Modeling Human-Created Passwords through Two-Stage Learning,"Yangde Wang, Haozhang Li, Weidong Qiu, Shujun Li, Peng Tang","Textual passwords are still the most widely used user authentication mechanism. Due to the close connections between textual passwords and natural languages, advanced technologies in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) could be used to model passwords for different purposes such as studying human password-creation behaviors and developing more advanced password cracking methods for informing better defence mechanisms. In this paper, we propose PassTSL (modeling human-created Passwords through Two-Stage Learning), inspired by the popular pretraining-finetuning framework in NLP and deep learning (DL). We report how different pretraining settings affected PassTSL and proved its effectiveness by applying it to six large leaked password databases. Experimental results showed that it outperforms five state-of-the-art (SOTA) password cracking methods on password guessing by a significant margin ranging from 4.11% to 64.69% at the maximum point. Based on PassTSL, we also implemented a password strength meter (PSM), and our experiments showed that it was able to estimate password strength more accurately, causing fewer unsafe errors (overestimating the password strength) than two other SOTA PSMs when they produce the same rate of safe errors (underestimating the password strength): a neural-network based method and zxcvbn. Furthermore, we explored multiple finetuning settings, and our evaluations showed that, even a small amount of additional training data, e.g., only 0.1% of the pretrained data, can lead to over 3% improvement in password guessing on average. We also proposed a heuristic approach to selecting finetuning passwords based on JS (Jensen-Shannon) divergence and experimental results validated its usefulness. In summary, our contributions demonstrate the potential and feasibility of applying advanced NLP and ML methods to password modeling and cracking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14145v1,2024-07
"I Know About ""Up""!

Impact of Model Size on Fine-tuned LLM Performance in Data-to-Text Generation: A State-of-the-Art Investigation,"Joy Mahapatra, Utpal Garain","Data-to-text (D2T) generation aims to generate human-readable text from semi-structured data, such as tables and graphs. The recent success of D2T is largely attributed to advancements in LLMs. Despite the success of LLMs, no research has been conducted to illustrate the impact of model size on the performance of fine-tuned LLMs for D2T tasks. D2T model performance is typically assessed based on three key qualities: \textit{readability} (indicates fluency and coherence), \textit{informativeness} (measures content similarity), and \textit{faithfulness} (assesses consistency of factual information). It is currently uncertain whether increasing the size of LLMs effectively improves performance in D2T tasks across these three qualities. The objective of this study is to investigate the performance of fine-tuned LLMs in D2T tasks in terms of model size. Through extensive comparative analysis, we aim to elucidate both the advantages and limitations of scaling model sizes across five widely used D2T datasets (E2E, ViGGo, WikiTableText, DART, and WebNLG) and twelve state-of-the-art LLMs with varying sizes from five different LLM families (T5, BART, OPT, BLOOM, and Llama 2). To comprehensively cover all the three essential qualities of D2T models, we incorporate six widely recognized automatic metrics -- \textsc{BLEU}, \textsc{METEOR}, \textsc{BERTScore}, \textsc{MoverScore}, \textsc{Parent}, and \textsc{BARTScore}. We also provide an in-depth analysis of LLM performance concerning model size in the presence of source-reference divergence, a critical aspect of D2T tasks. Our investigation reveals that increasing LLM size enhances \textit{readability} and \textit{informativeness} in D2T tasks, but larger (in terms of size) LLMs may sacrifice \textit{faithfulness}. Moreover, small-sized LLMs show more resilience than larger ones when source-reference divergence is present.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14088v1,2024-07
An Improved Method for Class-specific Keyword Extraction: A Case Study in the German Business Registry,"Stephen Meisenbacher, Tim Schopf, Weixin Yan, Patrick Holl, Florian Matthes","The task of $\textit{keyword extraction}$ is often an important initial step in unsupervised information extraction, forming the basis for tasks such as topic modeling or document classification. While recent methods have proven to be quite effective in the extraction of keywords, the identification of $\textit{class-specific}$ keywords, or only those pertaining to a predefined class, remains challenging. In this work, we propose an improved method for class-specific keyword extraction, which builds upon the popular $\textbf{KeyBERT}$ library to identify only keywords related to a class described by $\textit{seed keywords}$. We test this method using a dataset of German business registry entries, where the goal is to classify each business according to an economic sector.

Domain-Specific Pretraining of Language Models: A Comparative Study in the Medical Field,Tobias Kerner,"There are many cases where LLMs are used for specific tasks in a single domain. These usually require less general, but more domain-specific knowledge. Highly capable, general-purpose state-of-the-art language models like GPT-4 or Claude-3-opus can often be used for such tasks, but they are very large and cannot be run locally, even if they were not proprietary. This can be a problem when working with sensitive data. This paper focuses on domain-specific and mixed-domain pretraining as potentially more efficient methods than general pretraining for specialized language models. We will take a look at work related to domain-specific pretraining, specifically in the medical area, and compare benchmark results of specialized language models to general-purpose language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14076v2,2024-07
LazyLLM: Dynamic Token Pruning for Efficient Long Context LLM Inference,"Qichen Fu, Minsik Cho, Thomas Merth, Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Rastegari, Mahyar Najibi","The inference of transformer-based large language models consists of two sequential stages: 1) a prefilling stage to compute the KV cache of prompts and generate the first token, and 2) a decoding stage to generate subsequent tokens. For long prompts, the KV cache must be computed for all tokens during the prefilling stage, which can significantly increase the time needed to generate the first token. Consequently, the prefilling stage may become a bottleneck in the generation process. An open question remains whether all prompt tokens are essential for generating the first token. To answer this, we introduce a novel method, LazyLLM, that selectively computes the KV for tokens important for the next token prediction in both the prefilling and decoding stages. Contrary to static pruning approaches that prune the prompt at once, LazyLLM allows language models to dynamically select different subsets of tokens from the context in different generation steps, even though they might be pruned in previous steps. Extensive experiments on standard datasets across various tasks demonstrate that LazyLLM is a generic method that can be seamlessly integrated with existing language models to significantly accelerate the generation without fine-tuning. For instance, in the multi-document question-answering task, LazyLLM accelerates the prefilling stage of the LLama 2 7B model by 2.34x while maintaining accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14057v1,2024-07
Rasa: Building Expressive Speech Synthesis Systems for Indian Languages in Low-resource Settings,"Praveen Srinivasa Varadhan, Ashwin Sankar, Giri Raju, Mitesh M. Khapra","We release Rasa, the first multilingual expressive TTS dataset for any Indian language, which contains 10 hours of neutral speech and 1-3 hours of expressive speech for each of the 6 Ekman emotions covering 3 languages: Assamese, Bengali, & Tamil. Our ablation studies reveal that just 1 hour of neutral and 30 minutes of expressive data can yield a Fair system as indicated by MUSHRA scores. Increasing neutral data to 10 hours, with minimal expressive data, significantly enhances expressiveness. This offers a practical recipe for resource-constrained languages, prioritizing easily obtainable neutral data alongside smaller amounts of expressive data. We show the importance of syllabically balanced data and pooling emotions to enhance expressiveness. We also highlight challenges in generating specific emotions, e.g., fear and surprise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14056v2,2024-07

A majority of KPA studies for reviews adopt supervised learning to extract short sentences as KPs before matching KPs to review comments for quantification of KP prevalence. Recent abstractive approaches still generate KPs based on sentences, often leading to KPs with overlapping and hallucinated opinions, and inaccurate quantification. In this paper, we propose Prompted Aspect Key Point Analysis (PAKPA) for quantitative review summarization. PAKPA employs aspect sentiment analysis and prompted in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and quantify KPs grounded in aspects for business entities, which achieves faithful KPs with accurate quantification, and removes the need for large amounts of annotated data for supervised training. Experiments on the popular review dataset Yelp and the aspect-oriented review summarization dataset SPACE show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

SQLfuse: Enhancing Text-to-SQL Performance through Comprehensive LLM Synergy,"Tingkai Zhang, Chaoyu Chen, Cong Liao, Jun Wang, Xudong Zhao, Hang Yu, Jianchao Wang, Jianguo Li, Wenhui Shi","Text-to-SQL conversion is a critical innovation, simplifying the transition from complex SQL to intuitive natural language queries, especially significant given SQL's prevalence in the job market across various roles. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 has greatly advanced this field, offering improved natural language understanding and the ability to generate nuanced SQL statements. However, the potential of open-source LLMs in Text-to-SQL applications remains underexplored, with many frameworks failing to leverage their full capabilities, particularly in handling complex database queries and incorporating feedback for iterative refinement. Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces SQLfuse, a robust system integrating open-source LLMs with a suite of tools to enhance Text-to-SQL translation's accuracy and usability. SQLfuse features four modules: schema mining, schema linking, SQL generation, and a SQL critic module, to not only generate but also continuously enhance SQL query quality. Demonstrated by its leading performance on the Spider Leaderboard and deployment by Ant Group, SQLfuse showcases the practical merits of open-source LLMs in diverse business contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14568v1,2024-07
ECCO: Can We Improve Model-Generated Code Efficiency Without Sacrificing Functional Correctness?,"Siddhant Waghjale, Vishruth Veerendranath, Zora Zhiruo Wang, Daniel Fried","Although large language models (LLMs) have been largely successful in generating functionally correct programs, conditioning models to produce efficient solutions while ensuring correctness remains a challenge. Further, unreliability in benchmarking code efficiency is a hurdle across varying hardware specifications for popular interpreted languages such as Python. In this paper, we present ECCO, a reproducible benchmark for evaluating program efficiency via two paradigms: natural language (NL) based code generation and history-based code editing. On ECCO, we adapt and thoroughly investigate the three most promising existing LLM-based approaches: in-context learning, iterative refinement with execution or NL feedback, and fine-tuning conditioned on execution and editing history. While most methods degrade functional correctness and moderately increase program efficiency, we find that adding execution information often helps maintain functional correctness, and NL feedback enhances more on efficiency. We release our benchmark to support future work on LLM-based generation of efficient code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14044v2,2024-07

Clinical Reading Comprehension with Encoder-Decoder Models Enhanced by Direct Preference Optimization,"Md Sultan Al Nahian, Ramakanth Kavuluru","Extractive question answering over clinical text is a crucial need to help deal with the deluge of clinical text generated in hospitals. While encoder models (e.g., BERT) have been popular for this reading comprehension task, recently encoder-decoder models (e.g., T5) are on the rise. There is also the emergence of preference optimization techniques to align decoder-only LLMs with human preferences. In this paper, we combine encoder-decoder models with the direct preference optimization (DPO) method to improve over prior state of the art for the RadQA radiology question answering task by 12-15 F1 points. To the best of our knowledge, this effort is the first to show that DPO method also works for reading comprehension via novel heuristics to generate preference data without human inputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14000v1,2024-07
NeLLCom-X: A Comprehensive Neural-Agent Framework to Simulate Language Learning and Group Communication,"Yuchen Lian, Tessa Verhoef, Arianna Bisazza","Recent advances in computational linguistics include simulating the emergence of human-like languages with interacting neural network agents, starting from sets of random symbols. The recently introduced NeLLCom framework (Lian et al., 2023) allows agents to first learn an artificial language and then use it to communicate, with the aim of studying the emergence of specific linguistics properties. We extend this framework (NeLLCom-X) by introducing more realistic role-alternating agents and group communication in order to investigate the interplay between language learnability, communication pressures, and group size effects. We validate NeLLCom-X by replicating key findings from prior research simulating the emergence of a word-order/case-marking trade-off. Next, we investigate how interaction affects linguistic convergence and emergence of the trade-off. The novel framework facilitates future simulations of diverse linguistic aspects, emphasizing the importance of interaction and group dynamics in language evolution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13999v2,2024-07
RAG-QA Arena: Evaluating Domain Robustness for Long-form Retrieval Augmented Question Answering,"Rujun Han, Yuhao Zhang, Peng Qi, Yumo Xu, Jenyuan Wang, Lan Liu, William Yang Wang, Bonan Min, Vittorio Castelli","Question answering based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG-QA) is an important research topic in NLP and has a wide range of real-world applications. However, most existing datasets for this task are either constructed using a single source corpus or consist of short extractive answers, which fall short of evaluating large language model (LLM) based RAG-QA systems on cross-domain generalization. To address these limitations, we create Long-form RobustQA (LFRQA), a new dataset comprising human-written long-form answers that integrate short extractive answers from multiple documents into a single, coherent narrative, covering 26K queries and large corpora across seven different domains. We further propose RAG-QA Arena by directly comparing model-generated answers against LFRQA's answers using LLMs as evaluators. We show via extensive experiments that RAG-QA Arena and human judgments on answer quality are highly correlated. Moreover, only 41.3% of the most competitive LLM's answers are preferred to LFRQA's answers, demonstrating RAG-QA Arena as a challenging evaluation platform for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13998v2,2024-07
Reexamining Racial Disparities in Automatic Speech Recognition Performance: The Role of Confounding by Provenance,"Changye Li, Trevor Cohen, Serguei Pakhomov","Automatic speech recognition (ASR) models trained on large amounts of audio data are now widely used to convert speech to written text in a variety of applications from video captioning to automated assistants used in healthcare and other domains. As such, it is important that ASR models and their use is fair and equitable. Prior work examining the performance of commercial ASR systems on the Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL) demonstrated significantly worse ASR performance on African American English (AAE). The current study seeks to understand the factors underlying this disparity by examining the performance of the current state-of-the-art neural network based ASR system (Whisper, OpenAI) on the CORAAL dataset. Two key findings have been identified as a result of the current study. The first confirms prior findings of significant dialectal variation even across neighboring communities, and worse ASR performance on AAE that can be improved to some extent with fine-tuning of ASR models. The second is a novel finding not discussed in prior work on CORAAL: differences in audio recording practices within the dataset have a significant impact on ASR accuracy resulting in a ``confounding by provenance'' effect in which both language use and recording quality differ by study location. These findings highlight the need for further systematic investigation to disentangle the effects of recording quality and inherent linguistic diversity when examining the fairness and bias present in neural ASR models, as any bias in ASR accuracy may have negative downstream effects on disparities in various domains of life in which ASR technology is used.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13982v1,2024-07
FANTAstic SEquences and Where to Find Them: Faithful and Efficient API Call Generation through State-tracked Constrained Decoding and Reranking,"Zhuoer Wang, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Alexandros Papangelis, Rohan Mukherjee, Tzu-Yen Wang, Xinyan Zhao, Arijit Biswas, James Caverlee, Angeliki Metallinou","API call generation is the cornerstone of large language models' tool-using ability that provides access to the larger world. However, existing supervised and in-context learning approaches suffer from high training costs, poor data efficiency, and generated API calls that can be unfaithful to the API documentation and the user's request. To address these limitations, we propose an output-side optimization approach called FANTASE. Two of the unique contributions of FANTASE are its State-Tracked Constrained Decoding (SCD) and Reranking components. SCD dynamically incorporates appropriate API constraints in the form of Token Search Trie for efficient and guaranteed generation faithfulness with respect to the API documentation. The Reranking component efficiently brings in the supervised signal by leveraging a lightweight model as the discriminator to rerank the beam-searched candidate generations of the large language model. We demonstrate the superior performance of FANTASE in API call generation accuracy, inference efficiency, and context efficiency with DSTC8 and API Bank datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13945v1,2024-07

In Werewolf Arena, LLMs compete against each other, navigating the game's complex dynamics of deception, deduction, and persuasion. The framework introduces a dynamic turn-taking system based on bidding, mirroring real-world discussions where individuals strategically choose when to speak. We demonstrate the framework's utility through an arena-style tournament featuring Gemini and GPT models.

BiasDPO: Mitigating Bias in Language Models through Direct Preference Optimization,Ahmed Allam,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in advancing natural language processing, yet their potential to perpetuate biases poses significant concerns. This paper introduces a new framework employing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate gender, racial, and religious biases in LLM-generated English text. By developing a loss function that favors less biased over biased completions, our approach cultivates a preference for respectful and non-discriminatory language in LLMs. We also contribute a manually designed dataset for training LLMs to recognize and correct biases. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of prompts paired with both biased and unbiased completions. Implementing this approach on the Microsoft Phi-2 model, we demonstrate substantial reductions in biased outputs as our model outperforms the baseline model on almost all bias benchmarks. Our model also achieves better performance compared to other open-source models on most benchmarks. By reducing biases in the language generated by the model, our study marks a significant step towards developing more ethical and socially responsible LLMs. We publicly release BiasDPO dataset on HuggingFace.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13928v1,2024-07
Crafting Efficient Fine-Tuning Strategies for Large Language Models,"Michael Oliver, Guan Wang","This paper addresses the challenges of efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by exploring data efficiency and hyperparameter optimization. We investigate the minimum data required for effective fine-tuning and propose a novel hyperparameter optimization method that leverages early-stage model performance. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with as few as 200 samples can improve model accuracy from 70\% to 88\% in a product attribute extraction task. We identify a saturation point of approximately 6,500 samples, beyond which additional data yields diminishing returns. Our proposed bayesian hyperparameter optimization method, which evaluates models at 20\% of total training time, correlates strongly with final model performance, with 4 out of 5 top early-stage models remaining in the top 5 at completion. This approach led to a 2\% improvement in accuracy over baseline models when evaluated on an independent test set. These findings offer actionable insights for practitioners, potentially reducing computational load and dependency on extensive datasets while enhancing overall performance of fine-tuned LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13906v1,2024-07
Framework for Curating Speech Datasets and Evaluating ASR Systems: A Case Study for Polish,Michał Junczyk,"Speech datasets available in the public domain are often underutilized because of challenges in discoverability and interoperability. A comprehensive framework has been designed to survey, catalog, and curate available speech datasets, which allows replicable evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. A case study focused on the Polish language was conducted; the framework was applied to curate more than 24 datasets and evaluate 25 combinations of ASR systems and models. This research constitutes the most extensive comparison to date of both commercial and free ASR systems for the Polish language.

High Risk of Political Bias in Black Box Emotion Inference Models,"Hubert Plisiecki, Paweł Lenartowicz, Maria Flakus, Artur Pokropek","This paper investigates the presence of political bias in emotion inference models used for sentiment analysis (SA) in social science research. Machine learning models often reflect biases in their training data, impacting the validity of their outcomes. While previous research has highlighted gender and race biases, our study focuses on political bias - an underexplored yet pervasive issue that can skew the interpretation of text data across a wide array of studies. We conducted a bias audit on a Polish sentiment analysis model developed in our lab. By analyzing valence predictions for names and sentences involving Polish politicians, we uncovered systematic differences influenced by political affiliations. Our findings indicate that annotations by human raters propagate political biases into the model's predictions. To mitigate this, we pruned the training dataset of texts mentioning these politicians and observed a reduction in bias, though not its complete elimination. Given the significant implications of political bias in SA, our study emphasizes caution in employing these models for social science research. We recommend a critical examination of SA results and propose using lexicon-based systems as a more ideologically neutral alternative. This paper underscores the necessity for ongoing scrutiny and methodological adjustments to ensure the reliability and impartiality of the use of machine learning in academic and applied contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13891v2,2024-07
Learning Goal-Conditioned Representations for Language Reward Models,"Vaskar Nath, Dylan Slack, Jeff Da, Yuntao Ma, Hugh Zhang, Spencer Whitehead, Sean Hendryx","Techniques that learn improved representations via offline data or self-supervised objectives have shown impressive results in traditional reinforcement learning (RL). Nevertheless, it is unclear how improved representation learning can benefit reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on language models (LMs). In this work, we propose training reward models (RMs) in a contrastive, $\textit{goal-conditioned}$ fashion by increasing the representation similarity of future states along sampled preferred trajectories and decreasing the similarity along randomly sampled dispreferred trajectories. This objective significantly improves RM performance by up to 0.09 AUROC across challenging benchmarks, such as MATH and GSM8k. These findings extend to general alignment as well -- on the Helpful-Harmless dataset, we observe $2.3\%$ increase in accuracy. Beyond improving reward model performance, we show this way of training RM representations enables improved $\textit{steerability}$ because it allows us to evaluate the likelihood of an action achieving a particular goal-state (e.g., whether a solution is correct or helpful). Leveraging this insight, we find that we can filter up to $55\%$ of generated tokens during majority voting by discarding trajectories likely to end up in an ""incorrect"" state, which leads to significant cost savings. We additionally find that these representations can perform fine-grained control by conditioning on desired future goal-states. For example, we show that steering a Llama 3 model towards helpful generations with our approach improves helpfulness by $9.6\%$ over a supervised-fine-tuning trained baseline. Similarly, steering the model towards complex generations improves complexity by $21.6\%$ over the baseline. Overall, we find that training RMs in this contrastive, goal-conditioned fashion significantly improves performance and enables model steerability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13887v2,2024-07
Thought-Like-Pro: Enhancing Reasoning of Large Language Models through Self-Driven Prolog-based Chain-of-Thought,"Xiaoyu Tan, Yongxin Deng, Xihe Qiu, Weidi Xu, Chao Qu, Wei Chu, Yinghui Xu, Yuan Qi","Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance as general-purpose assistants, excelling across a variety of reasoning tasks. This achievement represents a significant step toward achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Despite these advancements, the effectiveness of LLMs often hinges on the specific prompting strategies employed, and there remains a lack of a robust framework to facilitate learning and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel learning framework, THOUGHT-LIKE-PRO In this framework, we utilize imitation learning to imitate the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process which is verified and translated from reasoning trajectories generated by a symbolic Prolog logic engine. This framework proceeds in a self-driven manner, that enables LLMs to formulate rules and statements from given instructions and leverage the symbolic Prolog engine to derive results. Subsequently, LLMs convert Prolog-derived successive reasoning trajectories into natural language CoT for imitation learning. Our empirical findings indicate that our proposed approach substantially enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs and demonstrates robust generalization across out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14562v2,2024-07

Latent Causal Probing: A Formal Perspective on Probing with Causal Models of Data,"Charles Jin, Martin Rinard","As language models (LMs) deliver increasing performance on a range of NLP tasks, probing classifiers have become an indispensable technique in the effort to better understand their inner workings. A typical setup involves (1) defining an auxiliary task consisting of a dataset of text annotated with labels, then (2) supervising small classifiers to predict the labels from the representations of a pretrained LM as it processed the dataset. A high probing accuracy is interpreted as evidence that the LM has learned to perform the auxiliary task as an unsupervised byproduct of its original pretraining objective. Despite the widespread usage of probes, however, the robust design and analysis of probing experiments remains a challenge. We develop a formal perspective on probing using structural causal models (SCM). Specifically, given an SCM which explains the distribution of tokens observed during training, we frame the central hypothesis as whether the LM has learned to represent the latent variables of the SCM. Empirically, we extend a recent study of LMs in the context of a synthetic grid-world navigation task, where having an exact model of the underlying causal structure allows us to draw strong inferences from the result of probing experiments. Our techniques provide robust empirical evidence for the ability of LMs to induce the latent concepts underlying text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13765v2,2024-07
Black-Box Opinion Manipulation Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models,"Zhuo Chen, Jiawei Liu, Haotan Liu, Qikai Cheng, Fan Zhang, Wei Lu, Xiaozhong Liu","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is applied to solve hallucination problems and real-time constraints of large language models, but it also induces vulnerabilities against retrieval corruption attacks. Existing research mainly explores the unreliability of RAG in white-box and closed-domain QA tasks. In this paper, we aim to reveal the vulnerabilities of Retrieval-Enhanced Generative (RAG) models when faced with black-box attacks for opinion manipulation. We explore the impact of such attacks on user cognition and decision-making, providing new insight to enhance the reliability and security of RAG models. We manipulate the ranking results of the retrieval model in RAG with instruction and use these results as data to train a surrogate model. By employing adversarial retrieval attack methods to the surrogate model, black-box transfer attacks on RAG are further realized. Experiments conducted on opinion datasets across multiple topics show that the proposed attack strategy can significantly alter the opinion polarity of the content generated by RAG. This demonstrates the model's vulnerability and, more importantly, reveals the potential negative impact on user cognition and decision-making, making it easier to mislead users into accepting incorrect or biased information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13757v1,2024-07
"LLMs as Function Approximators: Terminology, Taxonomy, and Questions for Evaluation",David Schlangen,"Natural Language Processing has moved rather quickly from modelling specific tasks to taking more general pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for specific tasks, to a point where we now have what appear to be inherently generalist models. This paper argues that the resultant loss of clarity on what these models model leads to metaphors like ""artificial general intelligences"" that are not helpful for evaluating their strengths and weaknesses. The proposal is to see their generality, and their potential value, in their ability to approximate specialist function, based on a natural language specification. This framing brings to the fore questions of the quality of the approximation, but beyond that, also questions of discoverability, stability, and protectability of these functions. As the paper will show, this framing hence brings together in one conceptual framework various aspects of evaluation, both from a practical and a theoretical perspective, as well as questions often relegated to a secondary status (such as ""prompt injection"" and ""jailbreaking"").",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13744v1,2024-07

Understanding Reference Policies in Direct Preference Optimization,"Yixin Liu, Pengfei Liu, Arman Cohan","Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a widely used training method for the instruction fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we explore an under-investigated aspect of DPO - its dependency on the reference model or policy. Such reference policies, typically instantiated as the model to be further fine-tuned, are important since they can impose an upper limit on DPO's effectiveness. Therefore, we address three related research questions in this work. First, we explore the optimal strength of the KL divergence constraint in DPO, which penalizes deviations from the reference policy, and find that DPO is sensitive to this strength. Next, we examine the necessity of the KL-constraint from the reference policies in DPO by providing both theoretical and empirical comparisons between DPO and related learning objectives, demonstrating DPO's superiority in this controlled setting. Additionally, we investigate whether DPO benefits from stronger reference policies, finding that a stronger reference policy can lead to improved performance, but only when it is similar to the model being fine-tuned. Our findings highlight the confounding role of reference policies in DPO and offer insights for best practices, while also identifying open research questions for future studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13709v2,2024-07

ANHALTEN: Cross-Lingual Transfer for German Token-Level Reference-Free Hallucination Detection,"Janek Herrlein, Chia-Chien Hung, Goran Glavaš","Research on token-level reference-free hallucination detection has predominantly focused on English, primarily due to the scarcity of robust datasets in other languages. This has hindered systematic investigations into the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer for this important NLP application. To address this gap, we introduce ANHALTEN, a new evaluation dataset that extends the English hallucination detection dataset to German. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores cross-lingual transfer for token-level reference-free hallucination detection. ANHALTEN contains gold annotations in German that are parallel (i.e., directly comparable to the original English instances). We benchmark several prominent cross-lingual transfer approaches, demonstrating that larger context length leads to better hallucination detection in German, even without succeeding context. Importantly, we show that the sample-efficient few-shot transfer is the most effective approach in most setups. This highlights the practical benefits of minimal annotation effort in the target language for reference-free hallucination detection. Aiming to catalyze future research on cross-lingual token-level reference-free hallucination detection, we make ANHALTEN publicly available: https://github.com/janekh24/anhalten",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13702v1,2024-07
Do These LLM Benchmarks Agree? Fixing Benchmark Evaluation with BenchBench,"Yotam Perlitz, Ariel Gera, Ofir Arviv, Asaf Yehudai, Elron Bandel, Eyal Shnarch, Michal Shmueli-Scheuer, Leshem Choshen","Recent advancements in Language Models (LMs) have catalyzed the creation of multiple benchmarks, designed to assess these models' general capabilities. A crucial task, however, is assessing the validity of the benchmarks themselves. This is most commonly done via Benchmark Agreement Testing (BAT), where new benchmarks are validated against established ones using some agreement metric (e.g., rank correlation). Despite the crucial role of BAT for benchmark builders and consumers, there are no standardized procedures for such agreement testing. This deficiency can lead to invalid conclusions, fostering mistrust in benchmarks and upending the ability to properly choose the appropriate benchmark to use. By analyzing over 40 prominent benchmarks, we demonstrate how some overlooked methodological choices can significantly influence BAT results, potentially undermining the validity of conclusions. To address these inconsistencies, we propose a set of best practices for BAT and demonstrate how utilizing these methodologies greatly improves BAT robustness and validity. To foster adoption and facilitate future research,, we introduce BenchBench, a python package for BAT, and release the BenchBench-leaderboard, a meta-benchmark designed to evaluate benchmarks using their peers. Our findings underscore the necessity for standardized BAT, ensuring the robustness and validity of benchmark evaluations in the evolving landscape of language model research.

Prover-Verifier Games improve legibility of LLM outputs,"Jan Hendrik Kirchner, Yining Chen, Harri Edwards, Jan Leike, Nat McAleese, Yuri Burda","One way to increase confidence in the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to support them with reasoning that is clear and easy to check -- a property we call legibility. We study legibility in the context of solving grade-school math problems and show that optimizing chain-of-thought solutions only for answer correctness can make them less legible. To mitigate the loss in legibility, we propose a training algorithm inspired by Prover-Verifier Game from Anil et al. (2021). Our algorithm iteratively trains small verifiers to predict solution correctness, ""helpful"" provers to produce correct solutions that the verifier accepts, and ""sneaky"" provers to produce incorrect solutions that fool the verifier. We find that the helpful prover's accuracy and the verifier's robustness to adversarial attacks increase over the course of training. Furthermore, we show that legibility training transfers to time-constrained humans tasked with verifying solution correctness. Over course of LLM training human accuracy increases when checking the helpful prover's solutions, and decreases when checking the sneaky prover's solutions. Hence, training for checkability by small verifiers is a plausible technique for increasing output legibility. Our results suggest legibility training against small verifiers as a practical avenue for increasing legibility of large LLMs to humans, and thus could help with alignment of superhuman models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13692v2,2024-07

Weak-to-Strong Reasoning,"Yuqing Yang, Yan Ma, Pengfei Liu","When large language models (LLMs) exceed human-level capabilities, it becomes increasingly challenging to provide full-scale and accurate supervision for these models. Weak-to-strong learning, which leverages a less capable model to unlock the latent abilities of a stronger model, proves valuable in this context. Yet, the efficacy of this approach for complex reasoning tasks is still untested. Furthermore, tackling reasoning tasks under the weak-to-strong setting currently lacks efficient methods to avoid blindly imitating the weak supervisor including its errors. In this paper, we introduce a progressive learning framework that enables the strong model to autonomously refine its training data, without requiring input from either a more advanced model or human-annotated data. This framework begins with supervised fine-tuning on a selective small but high-quality dataset, followed by preference optimization on contrastive samples identified by the strong model itself. Extensive experiments on the GSM8K and MATH datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of Llama2-70b using three separate weak models. This method is further validated in a forward-looking experimental setup, where Llama3-8b-instruct effectively supervises Llama3-70b on the highly challenging OlympicArena dataset. This work paves the way for a more scalable and sophisticated strategy to enhance AI reasoning powers.

A Comparative Study on Automatic Coding of Medical Letters with Explainability,"Jamie Glen, Lifeng Han, Paul Rayson, Goran Nenadic","This study aims to explore the implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to automate the coding of medical letters with visualised explainability and light-weighted local computer settings. Currently in clinical settings, coding is a manual process that involves assigning codes to each condition, procedure, and medication in a patient's paperwork (e.g., 56265001 heart disease using SNOMED CT code). There are preliminary research on automatic coding in this field using state-of-the-art ML models; however, due to the complexity and size of the models, the real-world deployment is not achieved. To further facilitate the possibility of automatic coding practice, we explore some solutions in a local computer setting; in addition, we explore the function of explainability for transparency of AI models. We used the publicly available MIMIC-III database and the HAN/HLAN network models for ICD code prediction purposes. We also experimented with the mapping between ICD and SNOMED CT knowledge bases. In our experiments, the models provided useful information for 97.98\% of codes. The result of this investigation can shed some light on implementing automatic clinical coding in practice, such as in hospital settings, on the local computers used by clinicians , project page \url{https://github.com/Glenj01/Medical-Coding}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13638v1,2024-07
Scaling Laws with Vocabulary: Larger Models Deserve Larger Vocabularies,"Chaofan Tao, Qian Liu, Longxu Dou, Niklas Muennighoff, Zhongwei Wan, Ping Luo, Min Lin, Ngai Wong","Research on scaling large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on model parameters and training data size, overlooking the role of vocabulary size. We investigate how vocabulary size impacts LLM scaling laws by training models ranging from 33M to 3B parameters on up to 500B characters with various vocabulary configurations. We propose three complementary approaches for predicting the compute-optimal vocabulary size: IsoFLOPs analysis, derivative estimation, and parametric fit of the loss function. Our approaches converge on the conclusion that the optimal vocabulary size depends on the compute budget, with larger models requiring larger vocabularies. Most LLMs, however, use insufficient vocabulary sizes. For example, we predict that the optimal vocabulary size of Llama2-70B should have been at least 216K, 7 times larger than its vocabulary of 32K. We validate our predictions empirically by training models with 3B parameters across different FLOPs budgets. Adopting our predicted optimal vocabulary size consistently improves downstream performance over commonly used vocabulary sizes. By increasing the vocabulary size from the conventional 32K to 43K, we improve performance on ARC-Challenge from 29.1 to 32.0 with the same 2.3e21 FLOPs. Our work highlights the importance of jointly considering tokenization and model scaling for efficient pre-training.

We explored various configurations to address the challenge: in Experiment 1, we utilized a union of n-gram analyzers (word, character, character with word boundaries) with different n-gram values; in Experiment 2, we combined a weighted union of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features with various weights; and in Experiment 3, we implemented a weighted major voting scheme using three classifiers: Linear Support Vector Classifier (LSVC), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).   Our approach, despite its simplicity and reliance on traditional machine learning techniques, demonstrated competitive performance in terms of F1-score and precision. Notably, we achieved the highest precision score of 63.22% among the participating teams. However, our overall F1 score was approximately 21%, significantly impacted by a low recall rate of 12.87%. This indicates that while our models were highly precise, they struggled to recall a broad range of dialect labels, highlighting a critical area for improvement in handling diverse dialectal variations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13608v1,2024-07

PLANTS: A Novel Problem and Dataset for Summarization of Planning-Like (PL) Tasks,"Vishal Pallagani, Biplav Srivastava, Nitin Gupta","Text summarization is a well-studied problem that deals with deriving insights from unstructured text consumed by humans, and it has found extensive business applications. However, many real-life tasks involve generating a series of actions to achieve specific goals, such as workflows, recipes, dialogs, and travel plans. We refer to them as planning-like (PL) tasks noting that the main commonality they share is control flow information. which may be partially specified. Their structure presents an opportunity to create more practical summaries to help users make quick decisions. We investigate this observation by introducing a novel plan summarization problem, presenting a dataset, and providing a baseline method for generating PL summaries. Using quantitative metrics and qualitative user studies to establish baselines, we evaluate the plan summaries from our method and large language models. We believe the novel problem and dataset can reinvigorate research in summarization, which some consider as a solved problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13597v1,2024-07
Towards Zero-Shot Multimodal Machine Translation,"Matthieu Futeral, Cordelia Schmid, Benoît Sagot, Rachel Bawden","Current multimodal machine translation (MMT) systems rely on fully supervised data (i.e models are trained on sentences with their translations and accompanying images). However, this type of data is costly to collect, limiting the extension of MMT to other language pairs for which such data does not exist. In this work, we propose a method to bypass the need for fully supervised data to train MMT systems, using multimodal English data only. Our method, called ZeroMMT, consists in adapting a strong text-only machine translation (MT) model by training it on a mixture of two objectives: visually conditioned masked language modelling and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the original and new MMT outputs. We evaluate on standard MMT benchmarks and the recently released CoMMuTE, a contrastive benchmark aiming to evaluate how well models use images to disambiguate English sentences. We obtain disambiguation performance close to state-of-the-art MMT models trained additionally on fully supervised examples. To prove that our method generalizes to languages with no fully supervised training data available, we extend the CoMMuTE evaluation dataset to three new languages: Arabic, Russian and Chinese. We further show that we can control the trade-off between disambiguation capabilities and translation fidelity at inference time using classifier-free guidance and without any additional data. Our code, data and trained models are publicly accessible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13579v1,2024-07
How Reliable are LLMs as Knowledge Bases? Re-thinking Facutality and Consistency,"Danna Zheng, Mirella Lapata, Jeff Z. Pan","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as knowledge bases (KBs), yet current evaluation methods focus too narrowly on knowledge retention, overlooking other crucial criteria for reliable performance. In this work, we rethink the requirements for evaluating reliable LLM-as-KB usage and highlight two essential factors: factuality, ensuring accurate responses to seen and unseen knowledge, and consistency, maintaining stable answers to questions about the same knowledge. We introduce UnseenQA, a dataset designed to assess LLM performance on unseen knowledge, and propose new criteria and metrics to quantify factuality and consistency, leading to a final reliability score. Our experiments on 26 LLMs reveal several challenges regarding their use as KBs, underscoring the need for more principled and comprehensive evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13578v2,2024-07
New Capability to Look Up an ASL Sign from a Video Example,"Carol Neidle, Augustine Opoku, Carey Ballard, Yang Zhou, Xiaoxiao He, Gregory Dimitriadis, Dimitris Metaxas","Looking up an unknown sign in an ASL dictionary can be difficult. Most ASL dictionaries are organized based on English glosses, despite the fact that (1) there is no convention for assigning English-based glosses to ASL signs; and (2) there is no 1-1 correspondence between ASL signs and English words. Furthermore, what if the user does not know either the meaning of the target sign or its possible English translation(s)? Some ASL dictionaries enable searching through specification of articulatory properties, such as handshapes, locations, movement properties, etc. However, this is a cumbersome process and does not always result in successful lookup. Here we describe a new system, publicly shared on the Web, to enable lookup of a video of an ASL sign (e.g., a webcam recording or a clip from a continuous signing video). The user submits a video for analysis and is presented with the five most likely sign matches, in decreasing order of likelihood, so that the user can confirm the selection and then be taken to our ASLLRP Sign Bank entry for that sign. Furthermore, this video lookup is also integrated into our newest version of SignStream(R) software to facilitate linguistic annotation of ASL video data, enabling the user to directly look up a sign in the video being annotated, and, upon confirmation of the match, to directly enter into the annotation the gloss and features of that sign, greatly increasing the efficiency and consistency of linguistic annotations of ASL video data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13571v1,2024-07

We train Qalam on a diverse dataset, including over 4.5 million images from Arabic manuscripts and a synthetic dataset comprising 60k image-text pairs. Notably, Qalam demonstrates exceptional handling of Arabic diacritics, a critical feature in Arabic scripts. Furthermore, it shows a remarkable ability to process high-resolution inputs, addressing a common limitation in current OCR systems.

Can Open-Source LLMs Compete with Commercial Models? Exploring the Few-Shot Performance of Current GPT Models in Biomedical Tasks,"Samy Ateia, Udo Kruschwitz","Commercial large language models (LLMs), like OpenAI's GPT-4 powering ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus, have dominated natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks across different domains. New competing Open-Source alternatives like Mixtral 8x7B or Llama 3 have emerged and seem to be closing the gap while often offering higher throughput and being less costly to use. Open-Source LLMs can also be self-hosted, which makes them interesting for enterprise and clinical use cases where sensitive data should not be processed by third parties. We participated in the 12th BioASQ challenge, which is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setting, and explored the performance of current GPT models Claude 3 Opus, GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral 8x7b with in-context learning (zero-shot, few-shot) and QLoRa fine-tuning. We also explored how additional relevant knowledge from Wikipedia added to the context-window of the LLM might improve their performance. Mixtral 8x7b was competitive in the 10-shot setting, both with and without fine-tuning, but failed to produce usable results in the zero-shot setting. QLoRa fine-tuning and Wikipedia context did not lead to measurable performance gains. Our results indicate that the performance gap between commercial and open-source models in RAG setups exists mainly in the zero-shot setting and can be closed by simply collecting few-shot examples for domain-specific use cases. The code needed to rerun these experiments is available through GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13511v1,2024-07
Spontaneous Style Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Controllable Spontaneous Behaviors Based on Language Models,"Weiqin Li, Peiji Yang, Yicheng Zhong, Yixuan Zhou, Zhisheng Wang, Zhiyong Wu, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng","Spontaneous style speech synthesis, which aims to generate human-like speech, often encounters challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality data and limitations in model capabilities. Recent language model-based TTS systems can be trained on large, diverse, and low-quality speech datasets, resulting in highly natural synthesized speech. However, they are limited by the difficulty of simulating various spontaneous behaviors and capturing prosody variations in spontaneous speech. In this paper, we propose a novel spontaneous speech synthesis system based on language models. We systematically categorize and uniformly model diverse spontaneous behaviors. Moreover, fine-grained prosody modeling is introduced to enhance the model's ability to capture subtle prosody variations in spontaneous speech.Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of prosody naturalness and spontaneous behavior naturalness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13509v1,2024-07

This approach builds on GenCP, an improved version of On-the-fly Constraint Programming Search (OTFS) using LLM-generated domains.

Attention Overflow: Language Model Input Blur during Long-Context Missing Items Recommendation,Damien Sileo,"Large language models (LLMs) can suggest missing elements from items listed in a prompt, which can be used for list completion or recommendations based on users' history. However, their performance degrades when presented with too many items, as they start to suggest items already included in the input list. This occurs at around 100 items for mid-2024 flagship LLMs. We evaluate this phenomenon on both synthetic problems (e.g., finding missing numbers in a given range of shuffled integers) and realistic movie recommendation scenarios. We refer to this issue as \textit{attention overflow}, as preventing repetition requires attending to all items simultaneously. Although iterative loops can mitigate this problem, their costs increase with the repetition rate, affecting the language models' ability to derive novelty from lengthy inputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13481v1,2024-07
Fixed and Adaptive Simultaneous Machine Translation Strategies Using Adapters,"Abderrahmane Issam, Yusuf Can Semerci, Jan Scholtes, Gerasimos Spanakis","Simultaneous machine translation aims at solving the task of real-time translation by starting to translate before consuming the full input, which poses challenges in terms of balancing quality and latency of the translation. The wait-$k$ policy offers a solution by starting to translate after consuming $k$ words, where the choice of the number $k$ directly affects the latency and quality. In applications where we seek to keep the choice over latency and quality at inference, the wait-$k$ policy obliges us to train more than one model. In this paper, we address the challenge of building one model that can fulfil multiple latency levels and we achieve this by introducing lightweight adapter modules into the decoder. The adapters are trained to be specialized for different wait-$k$ values and compared to other techniques they offer more flexibility to allow for reaping the benefits of parameter sharing and minimizing interference. Additionally, we show that by combining with an adaptive strategy, we can further improve the results. Experiments on two language directions show that our method outperforms or competes with other strong baselines on most latency values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13469v1,2024-07

However, the inconsistent format of medical free text documents and complex trial eligibility criteria make this process extremely challenging and time-consuming for physicians. We investigated whether the entire trial matching process - from identifying relevant trials among 105,600 oncology-related clinical trials on clinicaltrials.gov to generating criterion-level eligibility matches - could be automated using Large Language Models (LLMs). Using GPT-4o and a set of 51 synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHRs), we demonstrate that our approach identifies relevant candidate trials in 93.3% of cases and achieves a preliminary accuracy of 88.0% when matching patient-level information at the criterion level against a baseline defined by human experts. Utilizing LLM feedback reveals that 39.3% criteria that were initially considered incorrect are either ambiguous or inaccurately annotated, leading to a total model accuracy of 92.7% after refining our human baseline. In summary, we present an end-to-end pipeline for clinical trial matching using LLMs, demonstrating high precision in screening and matching trials to individual patients, even outperforming the performance of qualified medical doctors. Our fully end-to-end pipeline can operate autonomously or with human supervision and is not restricted to oncology, offering a scalable solution for enhancing patient-trial matching in real-world settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13463v1,2024-07
BEAF: Observing BEfore-AFter Changes to Evaluate Hallucination in Vision-language Models,"Moon Ye-Bin, Nam Hyeon-Woo, Wonseok Choi, Tae-Hyun Oh","Vision language models (VLMs) perceive the world through a combination of a visual encoder and a large language model (LLM). The visual encoder, pre-trained on large-scale vision-text datasets, provides zero-shot generalization to visual data, and the LLM endows its high reasoning ability to VLMs. It leads VLMs to achieve high performance on wide benchmarks without fine-tuning, exhibiting zero or few-shot capability. However, recent studies show that VLMs are vulnerable to hallucination. This undesirable behavior degrades reliability and credibility, thereby making users unable to fully trust the output from VLMs. To enhance trustworthiness and better tackle the hallucination of VLMs, we curate a new evaluation dataset, called the BEfore-AFter hallucination dataset (BEAF), and introduce new metrics: True Understanding (TU), IGnorance (IG), StuBbornness (SB), and InDecision (ID). Unlike prior works that focus only on constructing questions and answers, the key idea of our benchmark is to manipulate visual scene information by image editing models and to design the metrics based on scene changes. This allows us to clearly assess whether VLMs correctly understand a given scene by observing the ability to perceive changes. We also visualize image-wise object relationship by virtue of our two-axis view: vision and text. Upon evaluating VLMs with our dataset, we observed that our metrics reveal different aspects of VLM hallucination that have not been reported before.

Enhancing Out-of-Vocabulary Performance of Indian TTS Systems for Practical Applications through Low-Effort Data Strategies,"Srija Anand, Praveen Srinivasa Varadhan, Ashwin Sankar, Giri Raju, Mitesh M. Khapra","Publicly available TTS datasets for low-resource languages like Hindi and Tamil typically contain 10-20 hours of data, leading to poor vocabulary coverage. This limitation becomes evident in downstream applications where domain-specific vocabulary coupled with frequent code-mixing with English, results in many OOV words. To highlight this problem, we create a benchmark containing OOV words from several real-world applications. Indeed, state-of-the-art Hindi and Tamil TTS systems perform poorly on this OOV benchmark, as indicated by intelligibility tests. To improve the model's OOV performance, we propose a low-effort and economically viable strategy to obtain more training data. Specifically, we propose using volunteers as opposed to high quality voice artists to record words containing character bigrams unseen in the training data. We show that using such inexpensive data, the model's performance improves on OOV words, while not affecting voice quality and in-domain performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13435v1,2024-07

Correcting the Mythos of KL-Regularization: Direct Alignment without Overoptimization via Chi-Squared Preference Optimization,"Audrey Huang, Wenhao Zhan, Tengyang Xie, Jason D. Lee, Wen Sun, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Dylan J. Foster","Language model alignment methods, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), have led to impressive advances in language model capabilities, but existing techniques are limited by a widely observed phenomenon known as overoptimization, where the quality of the language model plateaus or degrades over the course of the alignment process. Overoptimization is often attributed to overfitting to an inaccurate reward model, and while it can be mitigated through online data collection, this is infeasible in many settings. This raises a fundamental question: Do existing offline alignment algorithms make the most of the data they have, or can their sample-efficiency be improved further?   We address this question with a new algorithm for offline alignment, $\chi^2$-Preference Optimization ($\chi$PO). $\chi$PO is a one-line change to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al., 2023), which only involves modifying the logarithmic link function in the DPO objective. Despite this minimal change, $\chi$PO implicitly implements the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty via regularization with the $\chi^2$-divergence -- which quantifies uncertainty more effectively than KL-regularization -- and provably alleviates overoptimization, achieving sample-complexity guarantees based on single-policy concentrability -- the gold standard in offline reinforcement learning. $\chi$PO's simplicity and strong guarantees make it the first practical and general-purpose offline alignment algorithm that is provably robust to overoptimization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13399v2,2024-07
Linear-Complexity Self-Supervised Learning for Speech Processing,"Shucong Zhang, Titouan Parcollet, Rogier van Dalen, Sourav Bhattacharya","Self-supervised learning (SSL) models usually require weeks of pre-training with dozens of high-end GPUs. These models typically have a multi-headed self-attention (MHSA) context encoder. However, MHSA takes quadratic time and space in the input length, contributing to the high pre-training cost. Linear-complexity alternatives to MHSA have been proposed. For instance, in supervised training, the SummaryMixing model is the first to outperform MHSA across multiple speech processing tasks. However, these cheaper alternatives have not been explored for SSL yet. This paper studies a linear-complexity context encoder for SSL for the first time. With better or equivalent performance for the downstream tasks of the MP3S benchmark, SummaryMixing reduces the pre-training time and peak VRAM of wav2vec 2.0 model by 18% and by 23%, respectively, leading to the pre-training of a 155M wav2vec 2.0 model finished within one week with 4 Tesla A100 GPUs.

These representations can be used for many NLP tasks, such as author identification and classification, or in recommendation systems. A strong limitation of existing works is that they do not explicitly capture writing style, making them hardly applicable to literary data. We therefore propose a new architecture based on Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) that learns embeddings for both authors and documents with a stylistic constraint. Our model fine-tunes a pre-trained document encoder. We stimulate the detection of writing style by adding predefined stylistic features making the representation axis interpretable with respect to writing style indicators. We evaluate our method on three datasets: a literary corpus extracted from the Gutenberg Project, the Blog Authorship Corpus and IMDb62, for which we show that it matches or outperforms strong/recent baselines in authorship attribution while capturing much more accurately the authors stylistic aspects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13358v1,2024-07
Mechanical Self-replication,Ralph P. Lano,"This study presents a theoretical model for a self-replicating mechanical system inspired by biological processes within living cells and supported by computer simulations. The model decomposes self-replication into core components, each of which is executed by a single machine constructed from a set of basic block types. Key functionalities such as sorting, copying, and building, are demonstrated. The model provides valuable insights into the constraints of self-replicating systems. The discussion also addresses the spatial and timing behavior of the system, as well as its efficiency and complexity. This work provides a foundational framework for future studies on self-replicating mechanisms and their information-processing applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14556v2,2024-07
Handling Numeric Expressions in Automatic Speech Recognition,"Christian Huber, Alexander Waibel","This paper addresses the problem of correctly formatting numeric expressions in automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. This is challenging since the expected transcript format depends on the context, e.g., 1945 (year) vs. 19:45 (timestamp). We compare cascaded and end-to-end approaches to recognize and format numeric expression, such as years, timestamps, currency amounts, and quantities. For the end-to-end approach we employed a data generation strategy using a large language model (LLM) together with a text to speech (TTS) model to generate adaptation data. The results on our test dataset show that while approaches based on LLMs perform well on recognizing formatted numeric expressions, adapted end-to-end models offer competitive performance with the advantage of lower latency and inference cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00004v1,2024-07
Learning-From-Mistakes Prompting for Indigenous Language Translation,"You-Cheng Liao, Chen-Jui Yu, Chi-Yi Lin, He-Feng Yun, Yen-Hsiang Wang, Hsiao-Min Li, Yao-Chung Fan","Using large language models, this paper presents techniques to improve extremely low-resourced indigenous language translations. Our approaches are grounded in the use of (1) the presence of a datastore consisting of a limited number of parallel translation examples, (2) the inherent capabilities of LLMs like GPT-3.5, and (3) a word-level translation dictionary. We harness the potential of LLMs and in-context learning techniques in such a setting for using LLMs as universal translators for extremely low-resourced languages. Our methodology hinges on utilizing LLMs as language compilers for selected language pairs, hypothesizing that they could internalize syntactic structures to facilitate accurate translation. We introduce three techniques: KNNPrompting with Retrieved Prompting Context, Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Learningfrom-Mistakes Prompting, with the last method addressing past errors. The evaluation results suggest that, even with limited corpora, LLMs can effectively translate extremely low-resource languages when paired with proper prompting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13343v1,2024-07
Why do you cite? An investigation on citation intents and decision-making classification processes,"Lorenzo Paolini, Sahar Vahdati, Angelo Di Iorio, Robert Wardenga, Ivan Heibi, Silvio Peroni","Identifying the reason for which an author cites another work is essential to understand the nature of scientific contributions and to assess their impact. Citations are one of the pillars of scholarly communication and most metrics employed to analyze these conceptual links are based on quantitative observations. Behind the act of referencing another scholarly work there is a whole world of meanings that needs to be proficiently and effectively revealed. This study emphasizes the importance of trustfully classifying citation intents to provide more comprehensive and insightful analyses in research assessment. We address this task by presenting a study utilizing advanced Ensemble Strategies for Citation Intent Classification (CIC) incorporating Language Models (LMs) and employing Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of models' predictions. Our approach involves two ensemble classifiers that utilize fine-tuned SciBERT and XLNet LMs as baselines. We further demonstrate the critical role of section titles as a feature in improving models' performances. The study also introduces a web application developed with Flask and currently available at http://137.204.64.4:81/cic/classifier, aimed at classifying citation intents. One of our models sets as a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) with an 89.46% Macro-F1 score on the SciCite benchmark. The integration of XAI techniques provides insights into the decision-making processes, highlighting the contributions of individual words for level-0 classifications, and of individual models for the metaclassification. The findings suggest that the inclusion of section titles significantly enhances classification performances in the CIC task. Our contributions provide useful insights for developing more robust datasets and methodologies, thus fostering a deeper understanding of scholarly communication.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13329v1,2024-07
"CoD, Towards an Interpretable Medical Agent using Chain of Diagnosis","Junying Chen, Chi Gui, Anningzhe Gao, Ke Ji, Xidong Wang, Xiang Wan, Benyou Wang","The field of medical diagnosis has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of large language models (LLMs), yet the challenges of interpretability within these models remain largely unaddressed. This study introduces Chain-of-Diagnosis (CoD) to enhance the interpretability of LLM-based medical diagnostics. CoD transforms the diagnostic process into a diagnostic chain that mirrors a physician's thought process, providing a transparent reasoning pathway. Additionally, CoD outputs the disease confidence distribution to ensure transparency in decision-making. This interpretability makes model diagnostics controllable and aids in identifying critical symptoms for inquiry through the entropy reduction of confidences. With CoD, we developed DiagnosisGPT, capable of diagnosing 9604 diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that DiagnosisGPT outperforms other LLMs on diagnostic benchmarks. Moreover, DiagnosisGPT provides interpretability while ensuring controllability in diagnostic rigor.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13301v2,2024-07
Robust ASR Error Correction with Conservative Data Filtering,"Takuma Udagawa, Masayuki Suzuki, Masayasu Muraoka, Gakuto Kurata","Error correction (EC) based on large language models is an emerging technology to enhance the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Generally, training data for EC are collected by automatically pairing a large set of ASR hypotheses (as sources) and their gold references (as targets). However, the quality of such pairs is not guaranteed, and we observed various types of noise which can make the EC models brittle, e.g. inducing overcorrection in out-of-domain (OOD) settings. In this work, we propose two fundamental criteria that EC training data should satisfy: namely, EC targets should (1) improve linguistic acceptability over sources and (2) be inferable from the available context (e.g. source phonemes). Through these criteria, we identify low-quality EC pairs and train the models not to make any correction in such cases, the process we refer to as conservative data filtering. In our experiments, we focus on Japanese ASR using a strong Conformer-CTC as the baseline and finetune Japanese LLMs for EC. Through our evaluation on a suite of 21 internal benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce overcorrection and improve both the accuracy and quality of ASR results in the challenging OOD settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13300v2,2024-07
SpeciaLex: A Benchmark for In-Context Specialized Lexicon Learning,"Joseph Marvin Imperial, Harish Tayyar Madabushi","Specialized lexicons are collections of words with associated constraints such as special definitions, specific roles, and intended target audiences. These constraints are necessary for content generation and documentation tasks (e.g., writing technical manuals or children's reading materials), where the goal is to reduce the ambiguity of text content and increase its overall readability for a specific group of audience. Understanding how large language models can capture these constraints can help researchers build better, more impactful tools for wider use beyond the NLP community. Towards this end, we introduce SpeciaLex, a benchmark for evaluating a language model's ability to follow specialized lexicon-based constraints across 18 diverse subtasks with 1,785 test instances covering core tasks of Checking, Identification, Rewriting, and Open Generation. We present an empirical evaluation of 15 open and closed-source LLMs and discuss insights on how factors such as model scale, openness, setup, and recency affect performance upon evaluating with the benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13297v2,2024-07
Low-Resourced Speech Recognition for Iu Mien Language via Weakly-Supervised Phoneme-based Multilingual Pre-training,"Lukuan Dong, Donghong Qin, Fengbo Bai, Fanhua Song, Yan Liu, Chen Xu, Zhijian Ou","The mainstream automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology usually requires hundreds to thousands of hours of annotated speech data. Three approaches to low-resourced ASR are phoneme or subword based supervised pre-training, and self-supervised pre-training over multilingual data. The Iu Mien language is the main ethnic language of the Yao ethnic group in China and is low-resourced in the sense that the annotated speech is very limited. With less than 10 hours of transcribed Iu Mien language, this paper investigates and compares the three approaches for Iu Mien speech recognition. Our experiments are based on the recently released, three backbone models pretrained over the 10 languages from the CommonVoice dataset (CV-Lang10), which correspond to the three approaches for low-resourced ASR. It is found that phoneme supervision can achieve better results compared to subword supervision and self-supervision, thereby providing higher data-efficiency. Particularly, the Whistle models, i.e., obtained by the weakly-supervised phoneme-based multilingual pre-training, obtain the most competitive results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13292v2,2024-07
Are Large Language Models Capable of Generating Human-Level Narratives?,"Yufei Tian, Tenghao Huang, Miri Liu, Derek Jiang, Alexander Spangher, Muhao Chen, Jonathan May, Nanyun Peng","This paper investigates the capability of LLMs in storytelling, focusing on narrative development and plot progression. We introduce a novel computational framework to analyze narratives through three discourse-level aspects: i) story arcs, ii) turning points, and iii) affective dimensions, including arousal and valence. By leveraging expert and automatic annotations, we uncover significant discrepancies between the LLM- and human- written stories. While human-written stories are suspenseful, arousing, and diverse in narrative structures, LLM stories are homogeneously positive and lack tension. Next, we measure narrative reasoning skills as a precursor to generative capacities, concluding that most LLMs fall short of human abilities in discourse understanding. Finally, we show that explicit integration of aforementioned discourse features can enhance storytelling, as is demonstrated by over 40% improvement in neural storytelling in terms of diversity, suspense, and arousal.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13248v2,2024-07
PM-LLM-Benchmark: Evaluating Large Language Models on Process Mining Tasks,"Alessandro Berti, Humam Kourani, Wil M. P. van der Aalst","Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to semi-automate some process mining (PM) analyses. While commercial models are already adequate for many analytics tasks, the competitive level of open-source LLMs in PM tasks is unknown. In this paper, we propose PM-LLM-Benchmark, the first comprehensive benchmark for PM focusing on domain knowledge (process-mining-specific and process-specific) and on different implementation strategies. We focus also on the challenges in creating such a benchmark, related to the public availability of the data and on evaluation biases by the LLMs. Overall, we observe that most of the considered LLMs can perform some process mining tasks at a satisfactory level, but tiny models that would run on edge devices are still inadequate. We also conclude that while the proposed benchmark is useful for identifying LLMs that are adequate for process mining tasks, further research is needed to overcome the evaluation biases and perform a more thorough ranking of the competitive LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13244v1,2024-07

Transformer-based Single-Cell Language Model: A Survey,"Wei Lan, Guohang He, Mingyang Liu, Qingfeng Chen, Junyue Cao, Wei Peng","The transformers have achieved significant accomplishments in the natural language processing as its outstanding parallel processing capabilities and highly flexible attention mechanism. In addition, increasing studies based on transformers have been proposed to model single-cell data. In this review, we attempt to systematically summarize the single-cell language models and applications based on transformers. First, we provide a detailed introduction about the structure and principles of transformers. Then, we review the single-cell language models and large language models for single-cell data analysis. Moreover, we explore the datasets and applications of single-cell language models in downstream tasks such as batch correction, cell clustering, cell type annotation, gene regulatory network inference and perturbation response. Further, we discuss the challenges of single-cell language models and provide promising research directions.

However, LLMs still suffer from several key issues, such as hallucination problems, knowledge update issues, and lacking domain-specific expertise. The appearance of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which leverages an external knowledge database to augment LLMs, makes up those drawbacks of LLMs. This paper reviews all significant techniques of RAG, especially in the retriever and the retrieval fusions. Besides, tutorial codes are provided for implementing the representative techniques in RAG. This paper further discusses the RAG training, including RAG with/without datastore update. Then, we introduce the application of RAG in representative natural language processing tasks and industrial scenarios.

We address this issue by examining LMs' capabilities to generate code for solving real scientific research problems. Incorporating input from scientists and AI researchers in 16 diverse natural science sub-fields, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, we created a scientist-curated coding benchmark, SciCode. The problems in SciCode naturally factorize into multiple subproblems, each involving knowledge recall, reasoning, and code synthesis. In total, SciCode contains 338 subproblems decomposed from 80 challenging main problems. It offers optional descriptions specifying useful scientific background information and scientist-annotated gold-standard solutions and test cases for evaluation. Claude3.5-Sonnet, the best-performing model among those tested, can solve only 4.6% of the problems in the most realistic setting.

Translate-and-Revise: Boosting Large Language Models for Constrained Translation,"Pengcheng Huang, Yongyu Mu, Yuzhang Wu, Bei Li, Chunyang Xiao, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu","Imposing constraints on machine translation systems presents a challenging issue because these systems are not trained to make use of constraints in generating adequate, fluent translations. In this paper, we leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for constrained translation, given that LLMs can easily adapt to this task by taking translation instructions and constraints as prompts. However, LLMs cannot always guarantee the adequacy of translation, and, in some cases, ignore the given constraints. This is in part because LLMs might be overly confident in their predictions, overriding the influence of the constraints. To overcome this overiding behaviour, we propose to add a revision process that encourages LLMs to correct the outputs by prompting them about the constraints that have not yet been met. We evaluate our approach on four constrained translation tasks, encompassing both lexical and structural constraints in multiple constraint domains. Experiments show 15\% improvement in constraint-based translation accuracy over standard LLMs and the approach also significantly outperforms neural machine translation (NMT) state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13164v1,2024-07
Preset-Voice Matching for Privacy Regulated Speech-to-Speech Translation Systems,"Daniel Platnick, Bishoy Abdelnour, Eamon Earl, Rahul Kumar, Zahra Rezaei, Thomas Tsangaris, Faraj Lagum","In recent years, there has been increased demand for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) systems in industry settings. Although successfully commercialized, cloning-based S2ST systems expose their distributors to liabilities when misused by individuals and can infringe on personality rights when exploited by media organizations. This work proposes a regulated S2ST framework called Preset-Voice Matching (PVM). PVM removes cross-lingual voice cloning in S2ST by first matching the input voice to a similar prior consenting speaker voice in the target-language. With this separation, PVM avoids cloning the input speaker, ensuring PVM systems comply with regulations and reduce risk of misuse. Our results demonstrate PVM can significantly improve S2ST system run-time in multi-speaker settings and the naturalness of S2ST synthesized speech. To our knowledge, PVM is the first explicitly regulated S2ST framework leveraging similarly-matched preset-voices for dynamic S2ST tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13153v1,2024-07
A light-weight and efficient punctuation and word casing prediction model for on-device streaming ASR,"Jian You, Xiangfeng Li","Punctuation and word casing prediction are necessary for automatic speech recognition (ASR). With the popularity of on-device end-to-end streaming ASR systems, the on-device punctuation and word casing prediction become a necessity while we found little discussion on this. With the emergence of Transformer, Transformer based models have been explored for this scenario. However, Transformer based models are too large for on-device ASR systems. In this paper, we propose a light-weight and efficient model that jointly predicts punctuation and word casing in real time. The model is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). Experimental results on the IWSLT2011 test set show that the proposed model obtains 9% relative improvement compared to the best of non-Transformer models on overall F1-score. Compared to the representative of Transformer based models, the proposed model achieves comparable results to the representative model while being only one-fortieth its size and 2.5 times faster in terms of inference time. It is suitable for on-device streaming ASR systems. Our code is publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13142v1,2024-07
TrialEnroll: Predicting Clinical Trial Enrollment Success with Deep & Cross Network and Large Language Models,"Ling Yue, Sixue Xing, Jintai Chen, Tianfan Fu","Clinical trials need to recruit a sufficient number of volunteer patients to demonstrate the statistical power of the treatment (e.g., a new drug) in curing a certain disease. Clinical trial recruitment has a significant impact on trial success. Forecasting whether the recruitment process would be successful before we run the trial would save many resources and time. This paper develops a novel deep & cross network with large language model (LLM)-augmented text feature that learns semantic information from trial eligibility criteria and predicts enrollment success. The proposed method enables interpretability by understanding which sentence/word in eligibility criteria contributes heavily to prediction. We also demonstrate the empirical superiority of the proposed method (0.7002 PR-AUC) over a bunch of well-established machine learning methods.

"Retrieve, Summarize, Plan: Advancing Multi-hop Question Answering with an Iterative Approach","Zhouyu Jiang, Mengshu Sun, Lei Liang, Zhiqiang Zhang","Multi-hop question answering is a challenging task with distinct industrial relevance, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods based on large language models (LLMs) have become a popular approach to tackle this task. Owing to the potential inability to retrieve all necessary information in a single iteration, a series of iterative RAG methods has been recently developed, showing significant performance improvements. However, existing methods still face two critical challenges: context overload resulting from multiple rounds of retrieval, and over-planning and repetitive planning due to the lack of a recorded retrieval trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative RAG method called ReSP, equipped with a dual-function summarizer. This summarizer compresses information from retrieved documents, targeting both the overarching question and the current sub-question concurrently. Experimental results on the multi-hop question-answering datasets HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, and exhibits excellent robustness concerning context length.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13101v1,2024-07
AlcLaM: Arabic Dialectal Language Model,"Murtadha Ahmed, Saghir Alfasly, Bo Wen, Jamaal Qasem, Mohammed Ahmed, Yunfeng Liu","Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are integral to many modern natural language processing (NLP) systems. Although multilingual models cover a wide range of languages, they often grapple with challenges like high inference costs and a lack of diverse non-English training data. Arabic-specific PLMs are trained predominantly on modern standard Arabic, which compromises their performance on regional dialects. To tackle this, we construct an Arabic dialectal corpus comprising 3.4M sentences gathered from social media platforms. We utilize this corpus to expand the vocabulary and retrain a BERT-based model from scratch. Named AlcLaM, our model was trained using only 13 GB of text, which represents a fraction of the data used by existing models such as CAMeL, MARBERT, and ArBERT, compared to 7.8%, 10.2%, and 21.3%, respectively. Remarkably, AlcLaM demonstrates superior performance on a variety of Arabic NLP tasks despite the limited training data.

MetaSumPerceiver: Multimodal Multi-Document Evidence Summarization for Fact-Checking,"Ting-Chih Chen, Chia-Wei Tang, Chris Thomas","Fact-checking real-world claims often requires reviewing multiple multimodal documents to assess a claim's truthfulness, which is a highly laborious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we present a summarization model designed to generate claim-specific summaries useful for fact-checking from multimodal, multi-document datasets. The model takes inputs in the form of documents, images, and a claim, with the objective of assisting in fact-checking tasks. We introduce a dynamic perceiver-based model that can handle inputs from multiple modalities of arbitrary lengths. To train our model, we leverage a novel reinforcement learning-based entailment objective to generate summaries that provide evidence distinguishing between different truthfulness labels. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conduct experiments on both an existing benchmark and a new dataset of multi-document claims that we contribute. Our approach outperforms the SOTA approach by 4.6% in the claim verification task on the MOCHEG dataset and demonstrates strong performance on our new Multi-News-Fact-Checking dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13089v2,2024-07
Dynamic Sentiment Analysis with Local Large Language Models using Majority Voting: A Study on Factors Affecting Restaurant Evaluation,Junichiro Niimi,"User-generated contents (UGCs) on online platforms allow marketing researchers to understand consumer preferences for products and services. With the advance of large language models (LLMs), some studies utilized the models for annotation and sentiment analysis. However, the relationship between the accuracy and the hyper-parameters of LLMs is yet to be thoroughly examined. In addition, the issues of variability and reproducibility of results from each trial of LLMs have rarely been considered in existing literature. Since actual human annotation uses majority voting to resolve disagreements among annotators, this study introduces a majority voting mechanism to a sentiment analysis model using local LLMs. By a series of three analyses of online reviews on restaurant evaluations, we demonstrate that majority voting with multiple attempts using a medium-sized model produces more robust results than using a large model with a single attempt. Furthermore, we conducted further analysis to investigate the effect of each aspect on the overall evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13069v1,2024-07
Establishing Knowledge Preference in Language Models,"Sizhe Zhou, Sha Li, Yu Meng, Yizhu Jiao, Heng Ji, Jiawei Han","Language models are known to encode a great amount of factual knowledge through pretraining. However, such knowledge might be insufficient to cater to user requests, requiring the model to integrate external knowledge sources and adhere to user-provided specifications. When answering questions about ongoing events, the model should use recent news articles to update its response; when asked to provide recommendations, the model should prioritize user specifications over retrieved product reviews; when some facts are edited in the model, the updated facts should override all prior knowledge learned by the model even if they are conflicting. In all of the cases above, the model faces a decision between its own parametric knowledge, (retrieved) contextual knowledge, and user instruction knowledge. In this paper, we (1) unify such settings into the problem of knowledge preference and define a three-level preference hierarchy over these knowledge sources; (2) compile a collection of existing datasets IfQA, MQuAKE, and MRQA covering a combination of settings (with/without user specifications, with/without context documents) to systematically evaluate how well models obey the intended knowledge preference; and (3) propose a dataset synthesis method that composes diverse question-answer pairs with user assumptions and related context to directly fine-tune LMs for instilling the hierarchy of knowledge. We demonstrate that a 7B model, fine-tuned on only a few thousand examples automatically generated by our proposed method, effectively achieves superior performance (more than 18% improvement across all evaluation benchmarks) in adhering to the desired knowledge preference hierarchy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13048v1,2024-07
Steamroller Problems: An Evaluation of LLM Reasoning Capability with Automated Theorem Prover Strategies,"Lachlan McGinness, Peter Baumgartner","This study presents the first examination of the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow reasoning strategies that are used to guide Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs). We evaluate the performance of GPT4, GPT3.5 Turbo and Google's recent Gemini model on problems from a steamroller domain. In addition to determining accuracy we make use of the Natural Language Processing library spaCy to explore new methods of investigating LLM's reasoning capabilities. This led to one alarming result, the low correlation between correct reasoning and correct answers for any of the tested models. We found that the models' performance when using the ATP reasoning strategies was comparable to one-shot chain of thought and observe that attention to uncertainty in the accuracy results is critical when drawing conclusions about model performance. Consistent with previous speculation we confirm that LLMs have a preference for, and are best able to follow, bottom up reasoning processes. However, the reasoning strategies can still be beneficial for deriving small and relevant sets of formulas for external processing by a trusted inference engine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20244v1,2024-07

Pre-Trained Foundation Model representations to uncover Breathing patterns in Speech,"Vikramjit Mitra, Anirban Chatterjee, Ke Zhai, Helen Weng, Ayuko Hill, Nicole Hay, Christopher Webb, Jamie Cheng, Erdrin Azemi","The process of human speech production involves coordinated respiratory action to elicit acoustic speech signals. Typically, speech is produced when air is forced from the lungs and is modulated by the vocal tract, where such actions are interspersed by moments of breathing in air (inhalation) to refill the lungs again. Respiratory rate (RR) is a vital metric that is used to assess the overall health, fitness, and general well-being of an individual. Existing approaches to measure RR (number of breaths one takes in a minute) are performed using specialized equipment or training. Studies have demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate RR using bio-sensor signals as input. Speech-based estimation of RR can offer an effective approach to measure the vital metric without requiring any specialized equipment or sensors. This work investigates a machine learning based approach to estimate RR from speech segments obtained from subjects speaking to a close-talking microphone device. Data were collected from N=26 individuals, where the groundtruth RR was obtained through commercial grade chest-belts and then manually corrected for any errors. A convolutional long-short term memory network (Conv-LSTM) is proposed to estimate respiration time-series data from the speech signal. We demonstrate that the use of pre-trained representations obtained from a foundation model, such as Wav2Vec2, can be used to estimate respiration-time-series with low root-mean-squared error and high correlation coefficient, when compared with the baseline. The model-driven time series can be used to estimate $RR$ with a low mean absolute error (MAE) ~ 1.6 breaths/min.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13035v1,2024-07
A Survey of Prompt Engineering Methods in Large Language Models for Different NLP Tasks,"Shubham Vatsal, Harsh Dubey","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on many different Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Prompt engineering plays a key role in adding more to the already existing abilities of LLMs to achieve significant performance gains on various NLP tasks. Prompt engineering requires composing natural language instructions called prompts to elicit knowledge from LLMs in a structured way. Unlike previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) models, prompt engineering does not require extensive parameter re-training or fine-tuning based on the given NLP task and thus solely operates on the embedded knowledge of LLMs. Additionally, LLM enthusiasts can intelligently extract LLMs' knowledge through a basic natural language conversational exchange or prompt engineering, allowing more and more people even without deep mathematical machine learning background to experiment with LLMs. With prompt engineering gaining popularity in the last two years, researchers have come up with numerous engineering techniques around designing prompts to improve accuracy of information extraction from the LLMs. In this paper, we summarize different prompting techniques and club them together based on different NLP tasks that they have been used for. We further granularly highlight the performance of these prompting strategies on various datasets belonging to that NLP task, talk about the corresponding LLMs used, present a taxonomy diagram and discuss the possible SoTA for specific datasets.

Despite the primary focus on NLP, we posit that the paradigm of retrieval-enhancement can be extended to a broader spectrum of machine learning (ML) such as computer vision, time series prediction, and computational biology. Therefore, this work introduces a formal framework of this paradigm, Retrieval-Enhanced Machine Learning (REML), by synthesizing the literature in various domains in ML with consistent notations which is missing from the current literature. Also, we found that while a number of studies employ retrieval components to augment their models, there is a lack of integration with foundational Information Retrieval (IR) research. We bridge this gap between the seminal IR research and contemporary REML studies by investigating each component that comprises the REML framework. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to equip researchers across various disciplines with a comprehensive, formally structured framework of retrieval-enhanced models, thereby fostering interdisciplinary future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12982v2,2024-07
Less is More: Sparse Watermarking in LLMs with Enhanced Text Quality,"Duy C. Hoang, Hung T. Q. Le, Rui Chu, Ping Li, Weijie Zhao, Yingjie Lao, Khoa D. Doan","With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), concerns about potential misuse have emerged. To this end, watermarking has been adapted to LLM, enabling a simple and effective way to detect and monitor generated text. However, while the existing methods can differentiate between watermarked and unwatermarked text with high accuracy, they often face a trade-off between the quality of the generated text and the effectiveness of the watermarking process. In this work, we present a novel type of LLM watermark, Sparse Watermark, which aims to mitigate this trade-off by applying watermarks to a small subset of generated tokens distributed across the text. The key strategy involves anchoring watermarked tokens to words that have specific Part-of-Speech (POS) tags. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed watermarking scheme achieves high detectability while generating text that outperforms previous LLM watermarking methods in quality across various tasks",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13803v1,2024-07
Halu-J: Critique-Based Hallucination Judge,"Binjie Wang, Steffi Chern, Ethan Chern, Pengfei Liu","Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate non-factual content, known as hallucinations. Existing retrieval-augmented-based hallucination detection approaches typically address this by framing it as a classification task, evaluating hallucinations based on their consistency with retrieved evidence. However, this approach usually lacks detailed explanations for these evaluations and does not assess the reliability of these explanations. Furthermore, deficiencies in retrieval systems can lead to irrelevant or partially relevant evidence retrieval, impairing the detection process. Moreover, while real-world hallucination detection requires analyzing multiple pieces of evidence, current systems usually treat all evidence uniformly without considering its relevance to the content. To address these challenges, we introduce Halu-J, a critique-based hallucination judge with 7 billion parameters. Halu-J enhances hallucination detection by selecting pertinent evidence and providing detailed critiques. Our experiments indicate that Halu-J outperforms GPT-4o in multiple-evidence hallucination detection and matches its capability in critique generation and evidence selection. We also introduce ME-FEVER, a new dataset designed for multiple-evidence hallucination detection. Our code and dataset can be found in https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/factool .",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12943v1,2024-07
Matryoshka-Adaptor: Unsupervised and Supervised Tuning for Smaller Embedding Dimensions,"Jinsung Yoon, Raj Sinha, Sercan O Arik, Tomas Pfister","Embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as critical components in various applications, particularly for information retrieval. While high-dimensional embeddings generally demonstrate superior performance as they contain more salient information, their practical application is frequently hindered by elevated computational latency and the associated higher cost. To address these challenges, we propose Matryoshka-Adaptor, a novel tuning framework designed for the customization of LLM embeddings. Matryoshka-Adaptor facilitates substantial dimensionality reduction while maintaining comparable performance levels, thereby achieving a significant enhancement in computational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our framework directly modifies the embeddings from pre-trained LLMs which is designed to be seamlessly integrated with any LLM architecture, encompassing those accessible exclusively through black-box APIs. Also, it exhibits efficacy in both unsupervised and supervised learning settings. A rigorous evaluation conducted across a diverse corpus of English, multilingual, and multimodal datasets consistently reveals substantial gains with Matryoshka-Adaptor. Notably, with Google and OpenAI Embedding APIs, Matryoshka-Adaptor achieves a reduction in dimensionality ranging from two- to twelve-fold without compromising performance across multiple BEIR datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20243v1,2024-07
LMMs-Eval: Reality Check on the Evaluation of Large Multimodal Models,"Kaichen Zhang, Bo Li, Peiyuan Zhang, Fanyi Pu, Joshua Adrian Cahyono, Kairui Hu, Shuai Liu, Yuanhan Zhang, Jingkang Yang, Chunyuan Li, Ziwei Liu","The advances of large foundation models necessitate wide-coverage, low-cost, and zero-contamination benchmarks. Despite continuous exploration of language model evaluations, comprehensive studies on the evaluation of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) remain limited. In this work, we introduce LMMS-EVAL, a unified and standardized multimodal benchmark framework with over 50 tasks and more than 10 models to promote transparent and reproducible evaluations. Although LMMS-EVAL offers comprehensive coverage, we find it still falls short in achieving low cost and zero contamination. To approach this evaluation trilemma, we further introduce LMMS-EVAL LITE, a pruned evaluation toolkit that emphasizes both coverage and efficiency. Additionally, we present Multimodal LIVEBENCH that utilizes continuously updating news and online forums to assess models' generalization abilities in the wild, featuring a low-cost and zero-contamination evaluation approach. In summary, our work highlights the importance of considering the evaluation trilemma and provides practical solutions to navigate the trade-offs in evaluating large multi-modal models, paving the way for more effective and reliable benchmarking of LMMs. We opensource our codebase and maintain leaderboard of LIVEBENCH at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval and https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmms-lab/LiveBench.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12772v1,2024-07
The Role of Network and Identity in the Diffusion of Hashtags,"Aparna Ananthasubramaniam, Yufei Zhu, David Jurgens, Daniel Romero","Although the spread of behaviors is influenced by many social factors, existing literature tends to study the effects of single factors -- most often, properties of the social network -- on the final cascade. In order to move towards a more integrated view of cascades, this paper offers the first comprehensive investigation into the role of two social factors in the diffusion of 1,337 popular hashtags representing the production of novel culture on Twitter: 1) the topology of the Twitter social network and 2) performance of each user's probable demographic identity. Here, we show that cascades are best modeled using a combination of network and identity, rather than either factor alone. This combined model best reproduces a composite index of ten cascade properties across all 1,337 hashtags. However, there is important heterogeneity in what social factors are required to reproduce different properties of hashtag cascades. For instance, while a combined network+identity model best predicts the popularity of cascades, a network-only model has better performance in predicting cascade growth and an identity-only model in adopter composition. We are able to predict what type of hashtag is best modeled by each combination of features and use this to further improve performance. Additionally, consistent with prior literature on the combined network+identity model most outperforms the single-factor counterfactuals among hashtags used for expressing racial or regional identity, stance-taking, talking about sports, or variants of existing cultural trends with very slow- or fast-growing communicative need. In sum, our results imply the utility of multi-factor models in predicting cascades, in order to account for the varied ways in which network, identity, and other social factors play a role in the diffusion of hashtags on Twitter.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12771v1,2024-07
HDLCopilot: Natural Language Exploration of Hardware Designs and Libraries,"Manar Abdelatty, Jacob Rosenstein, Sherief Reda","Hardware design workflows often involve working with Process Design Kits (PDKs) from various fabrication labs, each containing its own set of standard cell libraries optimized for metrics such as speed, power, or density. These libraries include multiple views for information on timing and electrical properties of cells, cell layout details, and process design rules. Engineers typically navigate between the design and the target technology to make informed decisions on different design scenarios, such as selecting specific gates for area optimization or enhancing critical path speed. Navigating this complex landscape to retrieve specific information about gates or design rules is often time-consuming and error-prone. To address this, we present HDLCopilot, a multi-agent collaborative framework powered by large language models that enables engineers to streamline interactions with hardware design and PDKs through natural language queries. HDLCopilot enables engineers to quickly access relevant information on gates and design rules, evaluate tradeoffs related to area, speed, and power in order to make informed decisions efficiently and accurately. The framework achieves an execution accuracy of 96.33\% on a diverse set of complex natural language queries. HDLCopilot positions itself as a powerful assistant in hardware design workflows, enhancing productivity and reducing potential human errors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12749v2,2024-07

We believe this approach allows us to probe specific strengths and weaknesses of different agents, and test the ability of LLMs in the challenging area of spatial reasoning and vector based math.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12734v1,2024-07
Is Sarcasm Detection A Step-by-Step Reasoning Process in Large Language Models?,"Ben Yao, Yazhou Zhang, Qiuchi Li, Jing Qin","Elaborating a series of intermediate reasoning steps significantly improves the ability of large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems, as such steps would evoke LLMs to think sequentially. However, human sarcasm understanding is often considered an intuitive and holistic cognitive process, in which various linguistic, contextual, and emotional cues are integrated to form a comprehensive understanding, in a way that does not necessarily follow a step-by-step fashion. To verify the validity of this argument, we introduce a new prompting framework (called SarcasmCue) containing four sub-methods, viz. chain of contradiction (CoC), graph of cues (GoC), bagging of cues (BoC) and tensor of cues (ToC), which elicits LLMs to detect human sarcasm by considering sequential and non-sequential prompting methods. Through a comprehensive empirical comparison on four benchmarks, we highlight three key findings: (1) CoC and GoC show superior performance with more advanced models like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5, with an improvement of 3.5%. (2) ToC significantly outperforms other methods when smaller LLMs are evaluated, boosting the F1 score by 29.7% over the best baseline. (3) Our proposed framework consistently pushes the state-of-the-art (i.e., ToT) by 4.2%, 2.0%, 29.7%, and 58.2% in F1 scores across four datasets. This demonstrates the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12725v2,2024-07
TTSDS -- Text-to-Speech Distribution Score,"Christoph Minixhofer, Ondřej Klejch, Peter Bell","Many recently published Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems produce audio close to real speech. However, TTS evaluation needs to be revisited to make sense of the results obtained with the new architectures, approaches and datasets. We propose evaluating the quality of synthetic speech as a combination of multiple factors such as prosody, speaker identity, and intelligibility. Our approach assesses how well synthetic speech mirrors real speech by obtaining correlates of each factor and measuring their distance from both real speech datasets and noise datasets. We benchmark 35 TTS systems developed between 2008 and 2024 and show that our score computed as an unweighted average of factors strongly correlates with the human evaluations from each time period.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12707v3,2024-07
Subgraph-Aware Training of Language Models for Knowledge Graph Completion Using Structure-Aware Contrastive Learning,"Youmin Ko, Hyemin Yang, Taeuk Kim, Hyunjoon Kim","Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) has recently shown a potential to improve knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, most PLM-based methods focus solely on encoding textual information, neglecting the long-tailed nature of knowledge graphs and their various topological structures, e.g., subgraphs, shortest paths, and degrees. We claim that this is a major obstacle to achieving higher accuracy of PLMs for KGC. To this end, we propose a Subgraph-Aware Training framework for KGC (SATKGC) with two ideas: (i) subgraph-aware mini-batching to encourage hard negative sampling and to mitigate an imbalance in the frequency of entity occurrences during training, and (ii) new contrastive learning to focus more on harder in-batch negative triples and harder positive triples in terms of the structural properties of the knowledge graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively incorporate the structural inductive bias of the knowledge graph into fine-tuning PLMs. Extensive experiments on three KGC benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SATKGC. Our code is available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12703v4,2024-07
Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models,"Chenze Shao, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou","As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable progress in language understanding and generation, their training efficiency has become a critical concern. Traditionally, LLMs are trained to predict the next token in a sequence. Despite the success of token-level training, it suffers from considerable computational costs due to the need to process an extensive number of tokens. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces patch-level training for LLMs, which reduces the sequence length by compressing multiple tokens into a single patch. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced computational cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce overall computational costs to 0.5$\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

Domain-specific or Uncertainty-aware models: Does it really make a difference for biomedical text classification?,"Aman Sinha, Timothee Mickus, Marianne Clausel, Mathieu Constant, Xavier Coubez","The success of pretrained language models (PLMs) across a spate of use-cases has led to significant investment from the NLP community towards building domain-specific foundational models. On the other hand, in mission critical settings such as biomedical applications, other aspects also factor in-chief of which is a model's ability to produce reasonable estimates of its own uncertainty. In the present study, we discuss these two desiderata through the lens of how they shape the entropy of a model's output probability distribution. We find that domain specificity and uncertainty awareness can often be successfully combined, but the exact task at hand weighs in much more strongly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12626v1,2024-07

To address those challenges, we propose an alternative development AI cycle based on community engagement and usage. Then, we report encouraging results in the development of high-quality machine learning translators for Indigenous languages by fine-tuning state-of-the-art (SOTA) translators with tiny amounts of data and discuss how to avoid some common pitfalls in the process.

E5-V: Universal Embeddings with Multimodal Large Language Models,"Ting Jiang, Minghui Song, Zihan Zhang, Haizhen Huang, Weiwei Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang, Deqing Wang, Fuzhen Zhuang","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising advancements in general visual and language understanding. However, the representation of multimodal information using MLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a new framework, E5-V, designed to adapt MLLMs for achieving universal multimodal embeddings. Our findings highlight the significant potential of MLLMs in representing multimodal inputs compared to previous approaches. By leveraging MLLMs with prompts, E5-V effectively bridges the modality gap between different types of inputs, demonstrating strong performance in multimodal embeddings even without fine-tuning. We propose a single modality training approach for E5-V, where the model is trained exclusively on text pairs. This method demonstrates significant improvements over traditional multimodal training on image-text pairs, while reducing training costs by approximately 95%. Additionally, this approach eliminates the need for costly multimodal training data collection. Extensive experiments across four types of tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of E5-V. As a universal multimodal model, E5-V not only achieves but often surpasses state-of-the-art performance in each task, despite being trained on a single modality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12580v1,2024-07
Abstraction Alignment: Comparing Model and Human Conceptual Relationships,"Angie Boggust, Hyemin Bang, Hendrik Strobelt, Arvind Satyanarayan","Abstraction -- the process of generalizing specific examples into broad reusable patterns -- is central to how people efficiently process and store information and apply their knowledge to new data. Promisingly, research has shown that ML models learn representations that span levels of abstraction, from specific concepts like ""bolo tie"" and ""car tire"" to more general concepts like ""CEO"" and ""model"". However, existing techniques analyze these representations in isolation, treating learned concepts as independent artifacts rather than an interconnected web of abstraction. As a result, although we can identify the concepts a model uses to produce its output, it is difficult to assess if it has learned a human-aligned abstraction of the concepts that will generalize to new data. To address this gap, we introduce abstraction alignment, a methodology to measure the agreement between a model's learned abstraction and the expected human abstraction. We quantify abstraction alignment by comparing model outputs against a human abstraction graph, such as linguistic relationships or medical disease hierarchies. In evaluation tasks interpreting image models, benchmarking language models, and analyzing medical datasets, abstraction alignment provides a deeper understanding of model behavior and dataset content, differentiating errors based on their agreement with human knowledge, expanding the verbosity of current model quality metrics, and revealing ways to improve existing human abstractions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12543v1,2024-07
Towards Collaborative Intelligence: Propagating Intentions and Reasoning for Multi-Agent Coordination with Large Language Models,"Xihe Qiu, Haoyu Wang, Xiaoyu Tan, Chao Qu, Yujie Xiong, Yuan Cheng, Yinghui Xu, Wei Chu, Yuan Qi","Effective collaboration in multi-agent systems requires communicating goals and intentions between agents. Current agent frameworks often suffer from dependencies on single-agent execution and lack robust inter-module communication, frequently leading to suboptimal multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) policies and inadequate task coordination. To address these challenges, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as collaborative agents to enable coordinated behaviors in cooperative MARL. Each agent maintains a private intention consisting of its current goal and associated sub-tasks. Agents broadcast their intentions periodically, allowing other agents to infer coordination tasks. A propagation network transforms broadcast intentions into teammate-specific communication messages, sharing relevant goals with designated teammates. The architecture of our framework is structured into planning, grounding, and execution modules. During execution, multiple agents interact in a downstream environment and communicate intentions to enable coordinated behaviors. The grounding module dynamically adapts comprehension strategies based on emerging coordination patterns, while feedback from execution agents influnces the planning module, enabling the dynamic re-planning of sub-tasks. Results in collaborative environment simulation demonstrate intention propagation reduces miscoordination errors by aligning sub-task dependencies between agents. Agents learn when to communicate intentions and which teammates require task details, resulting in emergent coordinated behaviors. This demonstrates the efficacy of intention sharing for cooperative multi-agent RL based on LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12532v1,2024-07
Crafting the Path: Robust Query Rewriting for Information Retrieval,"Ingeol Baek, Jimin Lee, Joonho Yang, Hwanhee Lee","Query rewriting aims to generate a new query that can complement the original query to improve the information retrieval system. Recent studies on query rewriting, such as query2doc, query2expand and querey2cot, rely on the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a relevant passage to add information to the query. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these methodologies may markedly decline in instances where the requisite knowledge is not encapsulated within the model's intrinsic parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel structured query rewriting method called Crafting the Path tailored for retrieval systems. Crafting the Path involves a three-step process that crafts query-related information necessary for finding the passages to be searched in each step. Specifically, the Crafting the Path begins with Query Concept Comprehension, proceeds to Query Type Identification, and finally conducts Expected Answer Extraction. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous rewriting methods, especially in less familiar domains for LLMs. We demonstrate that our method is less dependent on the internal parameter knowledge of the model and generates queries with fewer factual inaccuracies. Furthermore, we observe that \name{} demonstrates superior performance in the retrieval-augmented generation scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12529v2,2024-07
Struct-X: Enhancing Large Language Models Reasoning with Structured Data,"Xiaoyu Tan, Haoyu Wang, Xihe Qiu, Yuan Cheng, Yinghui Xu, Wei Chu, Yuan Qi","Structured data, rich in logical and relational information, has the potential to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Still, its integration poses a challenge due to the risk of overwhelming LLMs with excessive tokens and irrelevant context information. To address this, we propose Struct-X, a novel framework that operates through five key phases: ``read-model-fill-reflect-reason'' efficiently enabling LLMs to utilize structured data. It begins by encoding structured data into a topological space using graph embeddings, followed by filling in missing entity information with knowledge retrieval modules, and filtering out irrelevant tokens via a self-supervised module. The final phase involves constructing a topological network with selected tokens to further reduce the total token length for more effective LLM inference. Additionally, Struct-X includes an Auxiliary Module trained to generate prompts, aiding LLMs in analyzing structured data. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including the knowledge graph question-answer task and the long document reading comprehension task, show that Struct-X notably improves LLM reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of structured data augmentation in improving LLM inference with complex input context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12522v1,2024-07
On Initializing Transformers with Pre-trained Embeddings,"Ha Young Kim, Niranjan Balasubramanian, Byungkon Kang","It has become common practice now to use random initialization schemes, rather than the pre-trained embeddings, when training transformer based models from scratch. Indeed, we find that pre-trained word embeddings from GloVe, and some sub-word embeddings extracted from language models such as T5 and mT5 fare much worse compared to random initialization. This is counter-intuitive given the well-known representational and transfer-learning advantages of pre-training. Interestingly, we also find that BERT and mBERT embeddings fare better than random initialization, showing the advantages of pre-trained representations. In this work, we posit two potential factors that contribute to these mixed results: the model sensitivity to parameter distribution and the embedding interactions with position encodings. We observe that pre-trained GloVe, T5, and mT5 embeddings have a wider distribution of values. As argued in the initialization studies, such large value initializations can lead to poor training because of saturated outputs. Further, the larger embedding values can, in effect, absorb the smaller position encoding values when added together, thus losing position information. Standardizing the pre-trained embeddings to a narrow range (e.g. as prescribed by Xavier) leads to substantial gains for Glove, T5, and mT5 embeddings. On the other hand, BERT pre-trained embeddings, while larger, are still relatively closer to Xavier initialization range which may allow it to effectively transfer the pre-trained knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12514v1,2024-07
$\textit{GeoHard}$: Towards Measuring Class-wise Hardness through Modelling Class Semantics,"Fengyu Cai, Xinran Zhao, Hongming Zhang, Iryna Gurevych, Heinz Koeppl","Recent advances in measuring hardness-wise properties of data guide language models in sample selection within low-resource scenarios. However, class-specific properties are overlooked for task setup and learning. How will these properties influence model learning and is it generalizable across datasets? To answer this question, this work formally initiates the concept of $\textit{class-wise hardness}$. Experiments across eight natural language understanding (NLU) datasets demonstrate a consistent hardness distribution across learning paradigms, models, and human judgment. Subsequent experiments unveil a notable challenge in measuring such class-wise hardness with instance-level metrics in previous works. To address this, we propose $\textit{GeoHard}$ for class-wise hardness measurement by modeling class geometry in the semantic embedding space. $\textit{GeoHard}$ surpasses instance-level metrics by over 59 percent on $\textit{Pearson}$'s correlation on measuring class-wise hardness. Our analysis theoretically and empirically underscores the generality of $\textit{GeoHard}$ as a fresh perspective on data diagnosis. Additionally, we showcase how understanding class-wise hardness can practically aid in improving task learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12512v1,2024-07
MERLIN: Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation for Text-Video Retrieval-Rerank Pipeline,"Donghoon Han, Eunhwan Park, Gisang Lee, Adam Lee, Nojun Kwak","The rapid expansion of multimedia content has made accurately retrieving relevant videos from large collections increasingly challenging. Recent advancements in text-video retrieval have focused on cross-modal interactions, large-scale foundation model training, and probabilistic modeling, yet often neglect the crucial user perspective, leading to discrepancies between user queries and the content retrieved. To address this, we introduce MERLIN (Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation), a novel, training-free pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for iterative feedback learning. MERLIN refines query embeddings from a user perspective, enhancing alignment between queries and video content through a dynamic question answering process.

Most LLMs are skilled in deductive reasoning, such as chain-of-thought prompting or iterative tool-using to solve challenging tasks step-by-step. In this paper, we hope to focus on evaluating and teaching LLMs to conduct inductive reasoning, that is, LLMs are supposed to infer underlying rules by observing examples or sequential transformations. However, collecting large-scale and diverse human-generated inductive data is challenging. We focus on data synthesis in the code domain and propose a \textbf{Case2Code} task by exploiting the expressiveness and correctness of programs. Specifically, we collect a diverse set of executable programs, synthesize input-output transformations for each program, and force LLMs to infer the underlying code implementations based on the synthetic I/O cases. We first evaluate representative LLMs on the synthesized Case2Code task and demonstrate that the Case-to-code induction is challenging for LLMs. Then, we synthesize large-scale Case2Code training samples to train LLMs to perform inductive reasoning. Experimental results show that such induction training benefits not only in distribution Case2Code performance but also enhances various coding abilities of trained LLMs, demonstrating the great potential of learning inductive reasoning via synthetic data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12504v1,2024-07
Automate or Assist? The Role of Computational Models in Identifying Gendered Discourse in US Capital Trial Transcripts,"Andrea W Wen-Yi, Kathryn Adamson, Nathalie Greenfield, Rachel Goldberg, Sandra Babcock, David Mimno, Allison Koenecke","The language used by US courtroom actors in criminal trials has long been studied for biases. However, systematic studies for bias in high-stakes court trials have been difficult, due to the nuanced nature of bias and the legal expertise required. Large language models offer the possibility to automate annotation. But validating the computational approach requires both an understanding of how automated methods fit in existing annotation workflows and what they really offer. We present a case study of adding a computational model to a complex and high-stakes problem: identifying gender-biased language in US capital trials for women defendants. Our team of experienced death-penalty lawyers and NLP technologists pursue a three-phase study: first annotating manually, then training and evaluating computational models, and finally comparing expert annotations to model predictions. Unlike many typical NLP tasks, annotating for gender bias in months-long capital trials is complicated, with many individual judgment calls. Contrary to standard arguments for automation that are based on efficiency and scalability, legal experts find the computational models most useful in providing opportunities to reflect on their own bias in annotation and to build consensus on annotation rules. This experience suggests that seeking to replace experts with computational models for complex annotation is both unrealistic and undesirable. Rather, computational models offer valuable opportunities to assist the legal experts in annotation-based studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12500v2,2024-07

For each Indic language, we design a custom preprocessing pipeline to effectively eliminate redundant and low-quality text content. Additionally, we perform deduplication on Common Crawl data to address the redundancy present in 70% of the crawled web pages. This study focuses on developing high-quality data, optimizing tokenization for our multilingual dataset for Indic large language models with 3B and 7B parameters, engineered for superior performance in Indic languages. We introduce a novel multilingual tokenizer training strategy, demonstrating our custom-trained Indic tokenizer outperforms the state-of-the-art OpenAI Tiktoken tokenizer, achieving a superior token-to-word ratio for Indic languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12481v1,2024-07
A Novel Dependency Framework for Enhancing Discourse Data Analysis,"Kun Sun, Rong Wang","The development of different theories of discourse structure has led to the establishment of discourse corpora based on these theories. However, the existence of discourse corpora established on different theoretical bases creates challenges when it comes to exploring them in a consistent and cohesive way. This study has as its primary focus the conversion of PDTB annotations into dependency structures. It employs refined BERT-based discourse parsers to test the validity of the dependency data derived from the PDTB-style corpora in English, Chinese, and several other languages. By converting both PDTB and RST annotations for the same texts into dependencies, this study also applies ``dependency distance'' metrics to examine the correlation between RST dependencies and PDTB dependencies in English. The results show that the PDTB dependency data is valid and that there is a strong correlation between the two types of dependency distance. This study presents a comprehensive approach for analyzing and evaluating discourse corpora by employing discourse dependencies to achieve unified analysis. By applying dependency representations, we can extract data from PDTB, RST, and SDRT corpora in a coherent and unified manner. Moreover, the cross-linguistic validation establishes the framework's generalizability beyond English. The establishment of this comprehensive dependency framework overcomes limitations of existing discourse corpora, supporting a diverse range of algorithms and facilitating further studies in computational discourse analysis and language sciences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12473v1,2024-07
Characterization of Political Polarized Users Attacked by Language Toxicity on Twitter,Wentao Xu,"Understanding the dynamics of language toxicity on social media is important for us to investigate the propagation of misinformation and the development of echo chambers for political scenarios such as U.S. presidential elections. Recent research has used large-scale data to investigate the dynamics across social media platforms. However, research on the toxicity dynamics is not enough. This study aims to provide a first exploration of the potential language toxicity flow among Left, Right and Center users. Specifically, we aim to examine whether Left users were easier to be attacked by language toxicity. In this study, more than 500M Twitter posts were examined. It was discovered that Left users received much more toxic replies than Right and Center users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12471v2,2024-07
Continual Learning for Temporal-Sensitive Question Answering,"Wanqi Yang, Yunqiu Xu, Yanda Li, Kunze Wang, Binbin Huang, Ling Chen","In this study, we explore an emerging research area of Continual Learning for Temporal Sensitive Question Answering (CLTSQA). Previous research has primarily focused on Temporal Sensitive Question Answering (TSQA), often overlooking the unpredictable nature of future events. In real-world applications, it's crucial for models to continually acquire knowledge over time, rather than relying on a static, complete dataset. Our paper investigates strategies that enable models to adapt to the ever-evolving information landscape, thereby addressing the challenges inherent in CLTSQA. To support our research, we first create a novel dataset, divided into five subsets, designed specifically for various stages of continual learning. We then propose a training framework for CLTSQA that integrates temporal memory replay and temporal contrastive learning. Our experimental results highlight two significant insights: First, the CLTSQA task introduces unique challenges for existing models. Second, our proposed framework effectively navigates these challenges, resulting in improved performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12470v1,2024-07
"Across Platforms and Languages: Dutch Influencers and Legal Disclosures on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok","Haoyang Gui, Thales Bertaglia, Catalina Goanta, Sybe de Vries, Gerasimos Spanakis","Content monetization on social media fuels a growing influencer economy. Influencer marketing remains largely undisclosed or inappropriately disclosed on social media. Non-disclosure issues have become a priority for national and supranational authorities worldwide, who are starting to impose increasingly harsher sanctions on them. This paper proposes a transparent methodology for measuring whether and how influencers comply with disclosures based on legal standards. We introduce a novel distinction between disclosures that are legally sufficient (green) and legally insufficient (yellow). We apply this methodology to an original dataset reflecting the content of 150 Dutch influencers publicly registered with the Dutch Media Authority based on recently introduced registration obligations. The dataset consists of 292,315 posts and is multi-language (English and Dutch) and cross-platform (Instagram, YouTube and TikTok). We find that influencer marketing remains generally underdisclosed on social media, and that bigger influencers are not necessarily more compliant with disclosure standards.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12451v2,2024-07
Sharif-STR at SemEval-2024 Task 1: Transformer as a Regression Model for Fine-Grained Scoring of Textual Semantic Relations,"Seyedeh Fatemeh Ebrahimi, Karim Akhavan Azari, Amirmasoud Iravani, Hadi Alizadeh, Zeinab Sadat Taghavi, Hossein Sameti","Semantic Textual Relatedness holds significant relevance in Natural Language Processing, finding applications across various domains. Traditionally, approaches to STR have relied on knowledge-based and statistical methods. However, with the emergence of Large Language Models, there has been a paradigm shift, ushering in new methodologies. In this paper, we delve into the investigation of sentence-level STR within Track A (Supervised) by leveraging fine-tuning techniques on the RoBERTa transformer. Our study focuses on assessing the efficacy of this approach across different languages. Notably, our findings indicate promising advancements in STR performance, particularly in Latin languages. Specifically, our results demonstrate notable improvements in English, achieving a correlation of 0.82 and securing a commendable 19th rank. Similarly, in Spanish, we achieved a correlation of 0.67, securing the 15th position. However, our approach encounters challenges in languages like Arabic, where we observed a correlation of only 0.38, resulting in a 20th rank.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12426v1,2024-07
Navigating the Noisy Crowd: Finding Key Information for Claim Verification,"Haisong Gong, Huanhuan Ma, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang","Claim verification is a task that involves assessing the truthfulness of a given claim based on multiple evidence pieces. Using large language models (LLMs) for claim verification is a promising way. However, simply feeding all the evidence pieces to an LLM and asking if the claim is factual does not yield good results. The challenge lies in the noisy nature of both the evidence and the claim: evidence passages typically contain irrelevant information, with the key facts hidden within the context, while claims often convey multiple aspects simultaneously. To navigate this ""noisy crowd"" of information, we propose EACon (Evidence Abstraction and Claim Deconstruction), a framework designed to find key information within evidence and verify each aspect of a claim separately. EACon first finds keywords from the claim and employs fuzzy matching to select relevant keywords for each raw evidence piece. These keywords serve as a guide to extract and summarize critical information into abstracted evidence. Subsequently, EACon deconstructs the original claim into subclaims, which are then verified against both abstracted and raw evidence individually. We evaluate EACon using two open-source LLMs on two challenging datasets. Results demonstrate that EACon consistently and substantially improve LLMs' performance in claim verification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12425v1,2024-07
TurkishMMLU: Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding in Turkish,"Arda Yüksel, Abdullatif Köksal, Lütfi Kerem Şenel, Anna Korhonen, Hinrich Schütze","Multiple choice question answering tasks evaluate the reasoning, comprehension, and mathematical abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing benchmarks employ automatic translation for multilingual evaluation, this approach is error-prone and potentially introduces culturally biased questions, especially in social sciences. We introduce the first multitask, multiple-choice Turkish QA benchmark, TurkishMMLU, to evaluate LLMs' understanding of the Turkish language. TurkishMMLU includes over 10,000 questions, covering 9 different subjects from Turkish high-school education curricula. These questions are written by curriculum experts, suitable for the high-school curricula in Turkey, covering subjects ranging from natural sciences and math questions to more culturally representative topics such as Turkish Literature and the history of the Turkish Republic. We evaluate over 20 LLMs, including multilingual open-source (e.g., Gemma, Llama, MT5), closed-source (GPT 4o, Claude, Gemini), and Turkish-adapted (e.g., Trendyol) models. We provide an extensive evaluation, including zero-shot and few-shot evaluation of LLMs, chain-of-thought reasoning, and question difficulty analysis along with model performance. We provide an in-depth analysis of the Turkish capabilities and limitations of current LLMs to provide insights for future LLMs for the Turkish language.

PersLLM: A Personified Training Approach for Large Language Models,"Zheni Zeng, Jiayi Chen, Huimin Chen, Yukun Yan, Yuxuan Chen, Zhenghao Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Large language models exhibit aspects of human-level intelligence that catalyze their application as human-like agents in domains such as social simulations, human-machine interactions, and collaborative multi-agent systems. However, the absence of distinct personalities, such as displaying ingratiating behaviors, inconsistent opinions, and uniform response patterns, diminish LLMs utility in practical applications. Addressing this, the development of personality traits in LLMs emerges as a crucial area of research to unlock their latent potential. Existing methods to personify LLMs generally involve strategies like employing stylized training data for instruction tuning or using prompt engineering to simulate different personalities. These methods only capture superficial linguistic styles instead of the core of personalities and are therefore not stable. In this study, we propose PersLLM, integrating psychology-grounded principles of personality: social practice, consistency, and dynamic development, into a comprehensive training methodology. We incorporate personality traits directly into the model parameters, enhancing the model's resistance to induction, promoting consistency, and supporting the dynamic evolution of personality. Single-agent evaluation validates our method's superiority, as it produces responses more aligned with reference personalities compared to other approaches. Case studies for multi-agent communication highlight its benefits in enhancing opinion consistency within individual agents and fostering collaborative creativity among multiple agents in dialogue contexts, potentially benefiting human simulation and multi-agent cooperation. Additionally, human-agent interaction evaluations indicate that our personified models significantly enhance interactive experiences, underscoring the practical implications of our research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12393v4,2024-07
Morphosyntactic Analysis for CHILDES,"Houjun Liu, Brian MacWhinney","Language development researchers are interested in comparing the process of language learning across languages. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to construct a consistent quantitative framework for such comparisons. However, recent advances in AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) are providing new methods for ASR (automatic speech recognition) and NLP (natural language processing) that can be brought to bear on this problem. Using the Batchalign2 program (Liu et al., 2023), we have been transcribing and linking data for the CHILDES database and have applied the UD (Universal Dependencies) framework to provide a consistent and comparable morphosyntactic analysis for 27 languages. These new resources open possibilities for deeper crosslinguistic study of language learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12389v1,2024-07

This study attempts to develop an advanced deep learning (DL) model for SA to understand global audience emotions through tweets in the context of the Olympic Games. The findings represent global attitudes around the Olympics and contribute to advancing the SA models. We have used NLP for tweet pre-processing and sophisticated DL models for arguing with SA, this research enhances the reliability and accuracy of sentiment classification. The study focuses on data selection, preprocessing, visualization, feature extraction, and model building, featuring a baseline Na\""ive Bayes (NB) model and three advanced DL models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).

NavGPT-2: Unleashing Navigational Reasoning Capability for Large Vision-Language Models,"Gengze Zhou, Yicong Hong, Zun Wang, Xin Eric Wang, Qi Wu","Capitalizing on the remarkable advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a burgeoning initiative to harness LLMs for instruction following robotic navigation. Such a trend underscores the potential of LLMs to generalize navigational reasoning and diverse language understanding. However, a significant discrepancy in agent performance is observed when integrating LLMs in the Vision-and-Language navigation (VLN) tasks compared to previous downstream specialist models. Furthermore, the inherent capacity of language to interpret and facilitate communication in agent interactions is often underutilized in these integrations. In this work, we strive to bridge the divide between VLN-specialized models and LLM-based navigation paradigms, while maintaining the interpretative prowess of LLMs in generating linguistic navigational reasoning. By aligning visual content in a frozen LLM, we encompass visual observation comprehension for LLMs and exploit a way to incorporate LLMs and navigation policy networks for effective action predictions and navigational reasoning. We demonstrate the data efficiency of the proposed methods and eliminate the gap between LM-based agents and state-of-the-art VLN specialists.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12366v2,2024-07
Explainable Biomedical Hypothesis Generation via Retrieval Augmented Generation enabled Large Language Models,"Alexander R. Pelletier, Joseph Ramirez, Irsyad Adam, Simha Sankar, Yu Yan, Ding Wang, Dylan Steinecke, Wei Wang, Peipei Ping","The vast amount of biomedical information available today presents a significant challenge for investigators seeking to digest, process, and understand these findings effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools to navigate this complex and challenging data landscape. However, LLMs may lead to hallucinatory responses, making Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) crucial for achieving accurate information. In this protocol, we present RUGGED (Retrieval Under Graph-Guided Explainable disease Distinction), a comprehensive workflow designed to support investigators with knowledge integration and hypothesis generation, identifying validated paths forward. Relevant biomedical information from publications and knowledge bases are reviewed, integrated, and extracted via text-mining association analysis and explainable graph prediction models on disease nodes, forecasting potential links among drugs and diseases. These analyses, along with biomedical texts, are integrated into a framework that facilitates user-directed mechanism elucidation as well as hypothesis exploration through RAG-enabled LLMs. A clinical use-case demonstrates RUGGED's ability to evaluate and recommend therapeutics for Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) and Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), analyzing prescribed drugs for molecular interactions and unexplored uses.

Conversational Query Reformulation with the Guidance of Retrieved Documents,"Jeonghyun Park, Hwanhee Lee","Conversational search seeks to retrieve relevant passages for the given questions in conversational question answering. Conversational Query Reformulation (CQR) improves conversational search by refining the original queries into de-contextualized forms to resolve the issues in the original queries, such as omissions and coreferences. Previous CQR methods focus on imitating human written queries which may not always yield meaningful search results for the retriever. In this paper, we introduce GuideCQR, a framework that refines queries for CQR by leveraging key information from the initially retrieved documents. Specifically, GuideCQR extracts keywords and generates expected answers from the retrieved documents, then unifies them with the queries after filtering to add useful information that enhances the search process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, outperforming previous CQR methods. Additionally, we show that GuideCQR can get additional performance gains in conversational search using various types of queries, even for queries written by humans.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12363v4,2024-07
ProcTag: Process Tagging for Assessing the Efficacy of Document Instruction Data,"Yufan Shen, Chuwei Luo, Zhaoqing Zhu, Yang Chen, Qi Zheng, Zhi Yu, Jiajun Bu, Cong Yao","Recently, large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising results on document visual question answering (VQA) task, particularly after training on document instruction datasets. An effective evaluation method for document instruction data is crucial in constructing instruction data with high efficacy, which, in turn, facilitates the training of LLMs and MLLMs for document VQA. However, most existing evaluation methods for instruction data are limited to the textual content of the instructions themselves, thereby hindering the effective assessment of document instruction datasets and constraining their construction. In this paper, we propose ProcTag, a data-oriented method that assesses the efficacy of document instruction data. ProcTag innovatively performs tagging on the execution process of instructions rather than the instruction text itself. By leveraging the diversity and complexity of these tags to assess the efficacy of the given dataset, ProcTag enables selective sampling or filtering of document instructions. Furthermore, DocLayPrompt, a novel semi-structured layout-aware document prompting strategy, is proposed for effectively representing documents. Experiments demonstrate that sampling existing open-sourced and generated document VQA/instruction datasets with ProcTag significantly outperforms current methods for evaluating instruction data. Impressively, with ProcTag-based sampling in the generated document datasets, only 30.5\% of the document instructions are required to achieve 100\% efficacy compared to the complete dataset.

The Better Angels of Machine Personality: How Personality Relates to LLM Safety,"Jie Zhang, Dongrui Liu, Chen Qian, Ziyue Gan, Yong Liu, Yu Qiao, Jing Shao","Personality psychologists have analyzed the relationship between personality and safety behaviors in human society. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate personality traits, the relationship between personality traits and safety abilities in LLMs still remains a mystery. In this paper, we discover that LLMs' personality traits are closely related to their safety abilities, i.e., toxicity, privacy, and fairness, based on the reliable MBTI-M scale. Meanwhile, the safety alignment generally increases various LLMs' Extraversion, Sensing, and Judging traits. According to such findings, we can edit LLMs' personality traits and improve their safety performance, e.g., inducing personality from ISTJ to ISTP resulted in a relative improvement of approximately 43% and 10% in privacy and fairness performance, respectively. Additionally, we find that LLMs with different personality traits are differentially susceptible to jailbreak. This study pioneers the investigation of LLM safety from a personality perspective, providing new insights into LLM safety enhancement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12344v1,2024-07
Word Embedding Dimension Reduction via Weakly-Supervised Feature Selection,"Jintang Xue, Yun-Cheng Wang, Chengwei Wei, C. -C. Jay Kuo","As a fundamental task in natural language processing, word embedding converts each word into a representation in a vector space. A challenge with word embedding is that as the vocabulary grows, the vector space's dimension increases, which can lead to a vast model size. Storing and processing word vectors are resource-demanding, especially for mobile edge-devices applications. This paper explores word embedding dimension reduction. To balance computational costs and performance, we propose an efficient and effective weakly-supervised feature selection method named WordFS. It has two variants, each utilizing novel criteria for feature selection. Experiments on various tasks (e.g., word and sentence similarity and binary and multi-class classification) indicate that the proposed WordFS model outperforms other dimension reduction methods at lower computational costs. We have released the code for reproducibility along with the paper.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12342v2,2024-07
M2DS: Multilingual Dataset for Multi-document Summarisation,"Kushan Hewapathirana, Nisansa de Silva, C. D. Athuraliya","In the rapidly evolving digital era, there is an increasing demand for concise information as individuals seek to distil key insights from various sources. Recent attention from researchers on Multi-document Summarisation (MDS) has resulted in diverse datasets covering customer reviews, academic papers, medical and legal documents, and news articles. However, the English-centric nature of these datasets has created a conspicuous void for multilingual datasets in today's globalised digital landscape, where linguistic diversity is celebrated. Media platforms such as British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) have disseminated news in 20+ languages for decades. With only 380 million people speaking English natively as their first language, accounting for less than 5% of the global population, the vast majority primarily relies on other languages. These facts underscore the need for inclusivity in MDS research, utilising resources from diverse languages. Recognising this gap, we present the Multilingual Dataset for Multi-document Summarisation (M2DS), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first dataset of its kind. It includes document-summary pairs in five languages from BBC articles published during the 2010-2023 period. This paper introduces M2DS, emphasising its unique multilingual aspect, and includes baseline scores from state-of-the-art MDS models evaluated on our dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12336v1,2024-07
Spectra: Surprising Effectiveness of Pretraining Ternary Language Models at Scale,"Ayush Kaushal, Tejas Vaidhya, Arnab Kumar Mondal, Tejas Pandey, Aaryan Bhagat, Irina Rish","Rapid advancements in GPU computational power has outpaced memory capacity and bandwidth growth, creating bottlenecks in Large Language Model (LLM) inference. Post-training quantization is the leading method for addressing memory-related bottlenecks in LLM inference, but it suffers from significant performance degradation below 4-bit precision. This paper addresses these challenges by investigating the pretraining of low-bitwidth models specifically Ternary Language Models (TriLMs) as an alternative to traditional floating-point models (FloatLMs) and their post-training quantized versions (QuantLMs). We present Spectra LLM suite, the first open suite of LLMs spanning multiple bit-widths, including FloatLMs, QuantLMs, and TriLMs, ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters trained on 300B tokens. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that TriLMs offer superior scaling behavior in terms of model size (in bits). Surprisingly, at scales exceeding one billion parameters, TriLMs consistently outperform their QuantLM and FloatLM counterparts for a given bit size across various benchmarks. Notably, the 3.9B parameter TriLM matches the performance of the FloatLM 3.9B across all benchmarks, despite having fewer bits than FloatLM 830M. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the feasibility and scalability of low-bitwidth language models, paving the way for the development of more efficient LLMs.   To enhance understanding of low-bitwidth models, we are releasing 500+ intermediate checkpoints of the Spectra suite at https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12327v5,2024-07
Multi-Grained Query-Guided Set Prediction Network for Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition,"Jielong Tang, Zhenxing Wang, Ziyang Gong, Jianxing Yu, Xiangwei Zhu, Jian Yin","Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is an emerging information extraction (IE) task, aiming to simultaneously extract entity spans, types, and corresponding visual regions of entities from given sentence-image pairs data. Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension or sequence generation-based frameworks show limitations in this difficult task. The former, utilizing human-designed queries, struggles to differentiate ambiguous entities, such as Jordan (Person) and off-White x Jordan (Shoes). The latter, following the one-by-one decoding order, suffers from exposure bias issues. We maintain that these works misunderstand the relationships of multimodal entities. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN consists of a Multi-grained Query Set (MQS) and a Multimodal Set Prediction Network (MSP). MQS explicitly aligns entity regions with entity spans by employing a set of learnable queries to strengthen intra-entity connections. Based on distinct intra-entity modeling, MSP reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a global matching perspective. Additionally, we incorporate a query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) to work as a glue network between MQS and MSP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21033v2,2024-07
MEDFuse: Multimodal EHR Data Fusion with Masked Lab-Test Modeling and Large Language Models,"Thao Minh Nguyen Phan, Cong-Tinh Dao, Chenwei Wu, Jian-Zhe Wang, Shun Liu, Jun-En Ding, David Restrepo, Feng Liu, Fang-Ming Hung, Wen-Chih Peng","Electronic health records (EHRs) are multimodal by nature, consisting of structured tabular features like lab tests and unstructured clinical notes. In real-life clinical practice, doctors use complementary multimodal EHR data sources to get a clearer picture of patients' health and support clinical decision-making. However, most EHR predictive models do not reflect these procedures, as they either focus on a single modality or overlook the inter-modality interactions/redundancy. In this work, we propose MEDFuse, a Multimodal EHR Data Fusion framework that incorporates masked lab-test modeling and large language models (LLMs) to effectively integrate structured and unstructured medical data. MEDFuse leverages multimodal embeddings extracted from two sources: LLMs fine-tuned on free clinical text and masked tabular transformers trained on structured lab test results. We design a disentangled transformer module, optimized by a mutual information loss to 1) decouple modality-specific and modality-shared information and 2) extract useful joint representation from the noise and redundancy present in clinical notes. Through comprehensive validation on the public MIMIC-III dataset and the in-house FEMH dataset, MEDFuse demonstrates great potential in advancing clinical predictions, achieving over 90% F1 score in the 10-disease multi-label classification task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12309v1,2024-07
Multimodal Reranking for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Question Answering,"Haoyang Wen, Honglei Zhuang, Hamed Zamani, Alexander Hauptmann, Michael Bendersky","Knowledge-intensive visual question answering requires models to effectively use external knowledge to help answer visual questions. A typical pipeline includes a knowledge retriever and an answer generator. However, a retriever that utilizes local information, such as an image patch, may not provide reliable question-candidate relevance scores. Besides, the two-tower architecture also limits the relevance score modeling of a retriever to select top candidates for answer generator reasoning. In this paper, we introduce an additional module, a multi-modal reranker, to improve the ranking quality of knowledge candidates for answer generation. Our reranking module takes multi-modal information from both candidates and questions and performs cross-item interaction for better relevance score modeling. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that multi-modal reranker from distant supervision provides consistent improvements. We also find a training-testing discrepancy with reranking in answer generation, where performance improves if training knowledge candidates are similar to or noisier than those used in testing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12277v1,2024-07
In-Context Probing Approximates Influence Function for Data Valuation,"Cathy Jiao, Gary Gao, Chenyan Xiong","Data valuation quantifies the value of training data, and is used for data attribution (i.e., determining the contribution of training data towards model predictions), and data selection; both of which are important for curating high-quality datasets to train large language models. In our paper, we show that data valuation through in-context probing (i.e., prompting a LLM) approximates influence functions for selecting training data. We provide a theoretical sketch on this connection based on transformer models performing ""implicit"" gradient descent on its in-context inputs. Our empirical findings show that in-context probing and gradient-based influence frameworks are similar in how they rank training data. Furthermore, fine-tuning experiments on data selected by either method reveal similar model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12259v1,2024-07
Lacuna Language Learning: Leveraging RNNs for Ranked Text Completion in Digitized Coptic Manuscripts,"Lauren Levine, Cindy Tung Li, Lydia Bremer-McCollum, Nicholas Wagner, Amir Zeldes","Ancient manuscripts are frequently damaged, containing gaps in the text known as lacunae. In this paper, we present a bidirectional RNN model for character prediction of Coptic characters in manuscript lacunae. Our best model performs with 72% accuracy on single character reconstruction, but falls to 37% when reconstructing lacunae of various lengths. While not suitable for definitive manuscript reconstruction, we argue that our RNN model can help scholars rank the likelihood of textual reconstructions. As evidence, we use our RNN model to rank reconstructions in two early Coptic manuscripts. Our investigation shows that neural models can augment traditional methods of textual restoration, providing scholars with an additional tool to assess lacunae in Coptic manuscripts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12247v1,2024-07

A Language Modeling Approach to Diacritic-Free Hebrew TTS,"Amit Roth, Arnon Turetzky, Yossi Adi","We tackle the task of text-to-speech (TTS) in Hebrew. Traditional Hebrew contains Diacritics, which dictate the way individuals should pronounce given words, however, modern Hebrew rarely uses them. The lack of diacritics in modern Hebrew results in readers expected to conclude the correct pronunciation and understand which phonemes to use based on the context. This imposes a fundamental challenge on TTS systems to accurately map between text-to-speech. In this work, we propose to adopt a language modeling Diacritics-Free approach, for the task of Hebrew TTS. The model operates on discrete speech representations and is conditioned on a word-piece tokenizer. We optimize the proposed method using in-the-wild weakly supervised data and compare it to several diacritic-based TTS systems. Results suggest the proposed method is superior to the evaluated baselines considering both content preservation and naturalness of the generated speech.

MASIVE: Open-Ended Affective State Identification in English and Spanish,"Nicholas Deas, Elsbeth Turcan, Iván Pérez Mejía, Kathleen McKeown","In the field of emotion analysis, much NLP research focuses on identifying a limited number of discrete emotion categories, often applied across languages. These basic sets, however, are rarely designed with textual data in mind, and culture, language, and dialect can influence how particular emotions are interpreted. In this work, we broaden our scope to a practically unbounded set of \textit{affective states}, which includes any terms that humans use to describe their experiences of feeling. We collect and publish MASIVE, a dataset of Reddit posts in English and Spanish containing over 1,000 unique affective states each. We then define the new problem of \textit{affective state identification} for language generation models framed as a masked span prediction task. On this task, we find that smaller finetuned multilingual models outperform much larger LLMs, even on region-specific Spanish affective states. Additionally, we show that pretraining on MASIVE improves model performance on existing emotion benchmarks. Finally, through machine translation experiments, we find that native speaker-written data is vital to good performance on this task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12196v2,2024-07
GPT-4V Cannot Generate Radiology Reports Yet,"Yuyang Jiang, Chacha Chen, Dang Nguyen, Benjamin M. Mervak, Chenhao Tan","GPT-4V's purported strong multimodal abilities raise interests in using it to automate radiology report writing, but there lacks thorough evaluations. In this work, we perform a systematic evaluation of GPT-4V in generating radiology reports on two chest X-ray report datasets: MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray. We attempt to directly generate reports using GPT-4V through different prompting strategies and find that it fails terribly in both lexical metrics and clinical efficacy metrics. To understand the low performance, we decompose the task into two steps: 1) the medical image reasoning step of predicting medical condition labels from images; and 2) the report synthesis step of generating reports from (groundtruth) conditions. We show that GPT-4V's performance in image reasoning is consistently low across different prompts. In fact, the distributions of model-predicted labels remain constant regardless of which groundtruth conditions are present on the image, suggesting that the model is not interpreting chest X-rays meaningfully. Even when given groundtruth conditions in report synthesis, its generated reports are less correct and less natural-sounding than a finetuned LLaMA-2. Altogether, our findings cast doubt on the viability of using GPT-4V in a radiology workflow.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12176v4,2024-07
Continuous Embedding Attacks via Clipped Inputs in Jailbreaking Large Language Models,"Zihao Xu, Yi Liu, Gelei Deng, Kailong Wang, Yuekang Li, Ling Shi, Stjepan Picek","Security concerns for large language models (LLMs) have recently escalated, focusing on thwarting jailbreaking attempts in discrete prompts. However, the exploration of jailbreak vulnerabilities arising from continuous embeddings has been limited, as prior approaches primarily involved appending discrete or continuous suffixes to inputs. Our study presents a novel channel for conducting direct attacks on LLM inputs, eliminating the need for suffix addition or specific questions provided that the desired output is predefined. We additionally observe that extensive iterations often lead to overfitting, characterized by repetition in the output. To counteract this, we propose a simple yet effective strategy named CLIP. Our experiments show that for an input length of 40 at iteration 1000, applying CLIP improves the ASR from 62% to 83%",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13796v1,2024-07
Predicting Emotion Intensity in Polish Political Texts: Comparing Supervised Models and Large Language Models in a Resource-Poor Language,"Hubert Plisiecki, Piotr Koc, Maria Flakus, Artur Pokropek","This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to predict emotion intensity in Polish political texts, a resource-poor language context. The research compares the performance of several LLMs against a supervised model trained on an annotated corpus of 10,000 social media texts, evaluated for the intensity of emotions by expert judges. The findings indicate that while the supervised model generally outperforms LLMs, offering higher accuracy and lower variance, LLMs present a viable alternative, especially given the high costs associated with data annotation. The study highlights the potential of LLMs in low-resource language settings and underscores the need for further research on emotion intensity prediction and its application across different languages and continuous features. The implications suggest a nuanced decision-making process to choose the right approach to emotion prediction for researchers and practitioners based on resource availability and the specific requirements of their tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12141v1,2024-07
LLMs-in-the-loop Part-1: Expert Small AI Models for Bio-Medical Text Translation,"Bunyamin Keles, Murat Gunay, Serdar I. Caglar","Machine translation is indispensable in healthcare for enabling the global dissemination of medical knowledge across languages. However, complex medical terminology poses unique challenges to achieving adequate translation quality and accuracy. This study introduces a novel ""LLMs-in-the-loop"" approach to develop supervised neural machine translation models optimized specifically for medical texts. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities, this research shows that small, specialized models trained on high-quality in-domain (mostly synthetic) data can outperform even vastly larger LLMs.   Custom parallel corpora in six languages were compiled from scientific articles, synthetically generated clinical documents, and medical texts. Our LLMs-in-the-loop methodology employs synthetic data generation, rigorous evaluation, and agent orchestration to enhance performance. We developed small medical translation models using the MarianMT base model. We introduce a new medical translation test dataset to standardize evaluation in this domain. Assessed using BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and BERT scores on this test set, our MarianMT-based models outperform Google Translate, DeepL, and GPT-4-Turbo.   Results demonstrate that our LLMs-in-the-loop approach, combined with fine-tuning high-quality, domain-specific data, enables specialized models to outperform general-purpose and some larger systems. This research, part of a broader series on expert small models, paves the way for future healthcare-related AI developments, including deidentification and bio-medical entity extraction models. Our study underscores the potential of tailored neural translation models and the LLMs-in-the-loop methodology to advance the field through improved data generation, evaluation, agent, and modeling techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12126v2,2024-07
Private prediction for large-scale synthetic text generation,"Kareem Amin, Alex Bie, Weiwei Kong, Alexey Kurakin, Natalia Ponomareva, Umar Syed, Andreas Terzis, Sergei Vassilvitskii","We present an approach for generating differentially private synthetic text using large language models (LLMs), via private prediction. In the private prediction framework, we only require the output synthetic data to satisfy differential privacy guarantees. This is in contrast to approaches that train a generative model on potentially sensitive user-supplied source data and seek to ensure the model itself is safe to release.   We prompt a pretrained LLM with source data, but ensure that next-token predictions are made with differential privacy guarantees. Previous work in this paradigm reported generating a small number of examples (<10) at reasonable privacy levels, an amount of data that is useful only for downstream in-context learning or prompting. In contrast, we make changes that allow us to generate thousands of high-quality synthetic data points, greatly expanding the set of potential applications. Our improvements come from an improved privacy analysis and a better private selection mechanism, which makes use of the equivalence between the softmax layer for sampling tokens in LLMs and the exponential mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a novel use of public predictions via the sparse vector technique, in which we do not pay privacy costs for tokens that are predictable without sensitive data; we find this to be particularly effective for structured data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12108v2,2024-07
Better RAG using Relevant Information Gain,"Marc Pickett, Jeremy Hartman, Ayan Kumar Bhowmick, Raquib-ul Alam, Aditya Vempaty","A common way to extend the memory of large language models (LLMs) is by retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which inserts text retrieved from a larger memory into an LLM's context window. However, the context window is typically limited to several thousand tokens, which limits the number of retrieved passages that can inform a model's response. For this reason, it's important to avoid occupying context window space with redundant information by ensuring a degree of diversity among retrieved passages. At the same time, the information should also be relevant to the current task. Most prior methods that encourage diversity among retrieved results, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), do so by incorporating an objective that explicitly trades off diversity and relevance. We propose a novel simple optimization metric based on relevant information gain, a probabilistic measure of the total information relevant to a query for a set of retrieved results. By optimizing this metric, diversity organically emerges from our system. When used as a drop-in replacement for the retrieval component of a RAG system, this method yields state-of-the-art performance on question answering tasks from the Retrieval Augmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), outperforming existing metrics that directly optimize for relevance and diversity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12101v1,2024-07
Identifying Speakers in Dialogue Transcripts: A Text-based Approach Using Pretrained Language Models,"Minh Nguyen, Franck Dernoncourt, Seunghyun Yoon, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Hao Tan, Ryan Rossi, Quan Hung Tran, Trung Bui, Thien Huu Nguyen","We introduce an approach to identifying speaker names in dialogue transcripts, a crucial task for enhancing content accessibility and searchability in digital media archives. Despite the advancements in speech recognition, the task of text-based speaker identification (SpeakerID) has received limited attention, lacking large-scale, diverse datasets for effective model training. Addressing these gaps, we present a novel, large-scale dataset derived from the MediaSum corpus, encompassing transcripts from a wide range of media sources. We propose novel transformer-based models tailored for SpeakerID, leveraging contextual cues within dialogues to accurately attribute speaker names. Through extensive experiments, our best model achieves a great precision of 80.3\%, setting a new benchmark for SpeakerID.

GoldFinch: High Performance RWKV/Transformer Hybrid with Linear Pre-Fill and Extreme KV-Cache Compression,"Daniel Goldstein, Fares Obeid, Eric Alcaide, Guangyu Song, Eugene Cheah","We introduce GoldFinch, a hybrid Linear Attention/Transformer sequence model that uses a new technique to efficiently generate a highly compressed and reusable KV-Cache in linear time and space with respect to sequence length. GoldFinch stacks our new GOLD transformer on top of an enhanced version of the Finch (RWKV-6) architecture. We train up to 1.5B parameter class models of the Finch, Llama, and GoldFinch architectures, and find dramatically improved modeling performance relative to both Finch and Llama. Our cache size savings increase linearly with model layer count, ranging from 756-2550 times smaller than the traditional transformer cache for common sizes, enabling inference of extremely large context lengths even on limited hardware. Although autoregressive generation has O(n) time complexity per token because of attention, pre-fill computation of the entire initial cache state for a submitted context costs only O(1) time per token due to the use of a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate this cache. We release our trained weights and training code under the Apache 2.0 license for community use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12077v1,2024-07
Does Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?,"Maksym Andriushchenko, Nicolas Flammarion","Refusal training is widely used to prevent LLMs from generating harmful, undesirable, or illegal outputs. We reveal a curious generalization gap in the current refusal training approaches: simply reformulating a harmful request in the past tense (e.g., ""How to make a Molotov cocktail?"" to ""How did people make a Molotov cocktail?"") is often sufficient to jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs. We systematically evaluate this method on Llama-3 8B, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3-Mini, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and R2D2 models using GPT-3.5 Turbo as a reformulation model. For example, the success rate of this simple attack on GPT-4o increases from 1% using direct requests to 88% using 20 past tense reformulation attempts on harmful requests from JailbreakBench with GPT-4 as a jailbreak judge. Interestingly, we also find that reformulations in the future tense are less effective, suggesting that refusal guardrails tend to consider past historical questions more benign than hypothetical future questions. Moreover, our experiments on fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo show that defending against past reformulations is feasible when past tense examples are explicitly included in the fine-tuning data. Overall, our findings highlight that the widely used alignment techniques -- such as SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training -- employed to align the studied models can be brittle and do not always generalize as intended. We provide code and jailbreak artifacts at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-past-tense.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11969v3,2024-07
NeedleBench: Can LLMs Do Retrieval and Reasoning in 1 Million Context Window?,"Mo Li, Songyang Zhang, Yunxin Liu, Kai Chen","In evaluating the long-context capabilities of large language models (LLMs), identifying content relevant to a user's query from original long documents is a crucial prerequisite for any LLM to answer questions based on long text. We present NeedleBench, a framework consisting of a series of progressively more challenging tasks for assessing bilingual long-context capabilities, spanning multiple length intervals (4k, 8k, 32k, 128k, 200k, 1000k, and beyond) and different depth ranges, allowing the strategic insertion of critical data points in different text depth zones to rigorously test the retrieval and reasoning capabilities of models in diverse contexts. We use the NeedleBench framework to assess how well the leading open-source models can identify key information relevant to the question and apply that information to reasoning in bilingual long texts. Furthermore, we propose the Ancestral Trace Challenge (ATC) to mimic the complexity of logical reasoning challenges that are likely to be present in real-world long-context tasks, providing a simple method for evaluating LLMs in dealing with complex long-context situations. Our results suggest that current LLMs have significant room for improvement in practical long-context applications, as they struggle with the complexity of logical reasoning challenges that are likely to be present in real-world long-context tasks.

BRIGHT: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval,"Hongjin Su, Howard Yen, Mengzhou Xia, Weijia Shi, Niklas Muennighoff, Han-yu Wang, Haisu Liu, Quan Shi, Zachary S. Siegel, Michael Tang, Ruoxi Sun, Jinsung Yoon, Sercan O. Arik, Danqi Chen, Tao Yu","Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. Our dataset consists of 1,384 real-world queries spanning diverse domains, such as economics, psychology, mathematics, and coding. These queries are drawn from naturally occurring and carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2023), which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10, produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.3 on BRIGHT. We show that incorporating explicit reasoning about the query improves retrieval performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, incorporating retrieved documents from the top-performing retriever boosts question-answering performance by over 6.6 points. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12883v3,2024-07
Rethinking Transformer-based Multi-document Summarization: An Empirical Investigation,"Congbo Ma, Wei Emma Zhang, Dileepa Pitawela, Haojie Zhuang, Yanfeng Shu","The utilization of Transformer-based models prospers the growth of multi-document summarization (MDS). Given the huge impact and widespread adoption of Transformer-based models in various natural language processing tasks, investigating their performance and behaviors in the context of MDS becomes crucial for advancing the field and enhancing the quality of summary. To thoroughly examine the behaviours of Transformer-based MDS models, this paper presents five empirical studies on (1) measuring the impact of document boundary separators quantitatively; (2) exploring the effectiveness of different mainstream Transformer structures; (3) examining the sensitivity of the encoder and decoder; (4) discussing different training strategies; and (5) discovering the repetition in a summary generation. The experimental results on prevalent MDS datasets and eleven evaluation metrics show the influence of document boundary separators, the granularity of different level features and different model training strategies. The results also reveal that the decoder exhibits greater sensitivity to noises compared to the encoder. This underscores the important role played by the decoder, suggesting a potential direction for future research in MDS. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that the repetition problem in the generated summaries has correlations with the high uncertainty scores.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11948v1,2024-07
Localizing and Mitigating Errors in Long-form Question Answering,"Rachneet Sachdeva, Yixiao Song, Mohit Iyyer, Iryna Gurevych","Long-form question answering (LFQA) aims to provide thorough and in-depth answers to complex questions, enhancing comprehension. However, such detailed responses are prone to hallucinations and factual inconsistencies, challenging their faithful evaluation. This work introduces HaluQuestQA, the first hallucination dataset with localized error annotations for human-written and model-generated LFQA answers. HaluQuestQA comprises 698 QA pairs with 1.8k span-level error annotations for five different error types by expert annotators, along with preference judgments. Using our collected data, we thoroughly analyze the shortcomings of long-form answers and find that they lack comprehensiveness and provide unhelpful references. We train an automatic feedback model on this dataset that predicts error spans with incomplete information and provides associated explanations. Finally, we propose a prompt-based approach, Error-informed refinement, that uses signals from the learned feedback model to refine generated answers, which we show reduces errors and improves answer quality across multiple models. Furthermore, humans find answers generated by our approach comprehensive and highly prefer them (84%) over the baseline answers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11930v3,2024-07
What's Wrong? Refining Meeting Summaries with LLM Feedback,"Frederic Kirstein, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp","Meeting summarization has become a critical task since digital encounters have become a common practice. Large language models (LLMs) show great potential in summarization, offering enhanced coherence and context understanding compared to traditional methods. However, they still struggle to maintain relevance and avoid hallucination. We introduce a multi-LLM correction approach for meeting summarization using a two-phase process that mimics the human review process: mistake identification and summary refinement. We release QMSum Mistake, a dataset of 200 automatically generated meeting summaries annotated by humans on nine error types, including structural, omission, and irrelevance errors. Our experiments show that these errors can be identified with high accuracy by an LLM. We transform identified mistakes into actionable feedback to improve the quality of a given summary measured by relevance, informativeness, conciseness, and coherence. This post-hoc refinement effectively improves summary quality by leveraging multiple LLMs to validate output quality. Our multi-LLM approach for meeting summarization shows potential for similar complex text generation tasks requiring robustness, action planning, and discussion towards a goal.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11919v1,2024-07
InstructAV: Instruction Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Authorship Verification,"Yujia Hu, Zhiqiang Hu, Chun-Wei Seah, Roy Ka-Wei Lee","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in a wide range of NLP tasks. However, when it comes to authorship verification (AV) tasks, which involve determining whether two given texts share the same authorship, even advanced models like ChatGPT exhibit notable limitations. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed InstructAV, for authorship verification. This approach utilizes LLMs in conjunction with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method to simultaneously improve accuracy and explainability. The distinctiveness of InstructAV lies in its ability to align classification decisions with transparent and understandable explanations, representing a significant progression in the field of authorship verification. Through comprehensive experiments conducted across various datasets, InstructAV demonstrates its state-of-the-art performance on the AV task, offering high classification accuracy coupled with enhanced explanation reliability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12882v1,2024-07
A Novel Lexicon for the Moral Foundation of Liberty,"Oscar Araque, Lorenzo Gatti, Sergio Consoli, Kyriaki Kalimeri","The moral value of liberty is a central concept in our inference system when it comes to taking a stance towards controversial social issues such as vaccine hesitancy, climate change, or the right to abortion. Here, we propose a novel Liberty lexicon evaluated on more than 3,000 manually annotated data both in in- and out-of-domain scenarios. As a result of this evaluation, we produce a combined lexicon that constitutes the main outcome of this work. This final lexicon incorporates information from an ensemble of lexicons that have been generated using word embedding similarity (WE) and compositional semantics (CS). Our key contributions include enriching the liberty annotations, developing a robust liberty lexicon for broader application, and revealing the complexity of expressions related to liberty across different platforms. Through the evaluation, we show that the difficulty of the task calls for designing approaches that combine knowledge, in an effort of improving the representations of learning systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11862v1,2024-07
Evaluating Task-Oriented Dialogue Consistency through Constraint Satisfaction,"Tiziano Labruna, Bernardo Magnini","Task-oriented dialogues must maintain consistency both within the dialogue itself, ensuring logical coherence across turns, and with the conversational domain, accurately reflecting external knowledge. We propose to conceptualize dialogue consistency as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), wherein variables represent segments of the dialogue referencing the conversational domain, and constraints among variables reflect dialogue properties, including linguistic, conversational, and domain-based aspects. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we utilize a CSP solver to detect inconsistencies in dialogues re-lexicalized by an LLM. Our findings indicate that: (i) CSP is effective to detect dialogue inconsistencies; and (ii) consistent dialogue re-lexicalization is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving only a 0.15 accuracy rate when compared to a CSP solver. Furthermore, through an ablation study, we reveal that constraints derived from domain knowledge pose the greatest difficulty in being respected. We argue that CSP captures core properties of dialogue consistency that have been poorly considered by approaches based on component pipelines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11857v1,2024-07
Scaling Sign Language Translation,"Biao Zhang, Garrett Tanzer, Orhan Firat","Sign language translation (SLT) addresses the problem of translating information from a sign language in video to a spoken language in text. Existing studies, while showing progress, are often limited to narrow domains and/or few sign languages and struggle with open-domain tasks. In this paper, we push forward the frontier of SLT by scaling pretraining data, model size, and number of translation directions. We perform large-scale SLT pretraining on different data including 1) noisy multilingual YouTube SLT data, 2) parallel text corpora, and 3) SLT data augmented by translating video captions to other languages with off-the-shelf machine translation models. We unify different pretraining tasks with task-specific prompts under the encoder-decoder architecture, and initialize the SLT model with pretrained (m/By)T5 models across model sizes. SLT pretraining results on How2Sign and FLEURS-ASL#0 (ASL to 42 spoken languages) demonstrate the significance of data/model scaling and cross-lingual cross-modal transfer, as well as the feasibility of zero-shot SLT. We finetune the pretrained SLT models on 5 downstream open-domain SLT benchmarks covering 5 sign languages. Experiments show substantial quality improvements over the vanilla baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by wide margins.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11855v1,2024-07
Zero-shot Cross-Lingual Transfer for Synthetic Data Generation in Grammatical Error Detection,"Gaetan Lopez Latouche, Marc-André Carbonneau, Ben Swanson","Grammatical Error Detection (GED) methods rely heavily on human annotated error corpora. However, these annotations are unavailable in many low-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate GED in this context. Leveraging the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities of multilingual pre-trained language models, we train a model using data from a diverse set of languages to generate synthetic errors in other languages. These synthetic error corpora are then used to train a GED model. Specifically we propose a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline where the GED model is first fine-tuned on multilingual synthetic data from target languages followed by fine-tuning on human-annotated GED corpora from source languages. This approach outperforms current state-of-the-art annotation-free GED methods. We also analyse the errors produced by our method and other strong baselines, finding that our approach produces errors that are more diverse and more similar to human errors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11854v1,2024-07
Preemptive Detection and Correction of Misaligned Actions in LLM Agents,"Haishuo Fang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych","Deploying LLM-based agents in real-life applications often faces a critical challenge: the misalignment between agents' behavior and user intent. Such misalignment may lead agents to unintentionally execute critical actions that carry negative outcomes (e.g., accidentally triggering a ""buy-now"" in web shopping), resulting in undesirable or even irreversible consequences. Although addressing these issues is crucial, the preemptive detection and correction of misaligned actions remains relatively underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to detect misaligned actions before execution. Once the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts users for timely correction, preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing the reliability of LLM agents' decision-making processes. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate that InferAct achieves up to 20% improvements on Marco-F1 against baselines in misaligned action detection. An in-depth evaluation of misalignment correction further highlights InferAct's effectiveness in improving agent alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11843v3,2024-07
LoFTI: Localization and Factuality Transfer to Indian Locales,"Sona Elza Simon, Soumen Kumar Mondal, Abhishek Singhania, Sayambhu Sen, Preethi Jyothi","Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge acquired via training on large web-scale datasets crawled from the internet. However, these datasets typically exhibit a geographical bias towards English-speaking Western countries. This results in LLMs producing biased or hallucinated responses to queries that require answers localized to other geographical regions. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark named LoFTI (Localization and Factuality Transfer to Indian Locales) that can be used to evaluate an LLM's localization and factual text transfer capabilities. LoFTI consists of factual statements about entities in source and target locations; the source locations are spread across the globe and the target locations are all within India with varying degrees of hyperlocality (country, states, cities). The entities span a wide variety of categories. We use LoFTI to evaluate Mixtral, GPT-4 and two other Mixtral-based approaches well-suited to the task of localized factual transfer. We demonstrate that LoFTI is a high-quality evaluation benchmark and all the models, including GPT-4, produce skewed results across varying levels of hyperlocality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11833v1,2024-07
GPT Assisted Annotation of Rhetorical and Linguistic Features for Interpretable Propaganda Technique Detection in News Text,"Kyle Hamilton, Luca Longo, Bojan Bozic","While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on ""black-box"" solutions with opaque inner workings. Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data. Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning. This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques. To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort. Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy. This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts. The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost. Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11827v1,2024-07

However, the state-of-the-art for this task recommends a different model class depending on the availability of gold alignment training data for a particular language pair. We propose BinaryAlign, a novel word alignment technique based on binary sequence labeling that outperforms existing approaches in both scenarios, offering a unifying approach to the task. Additionally, we vary the specific choice of multilingual foundation model, perform stratified error analysis over alignment error type, and explore the performance of BinaryAlign on non-English language pairs.

PipeInfer: Accelerating LLM Inference using Asynchronous Pipelined Speculation,"Branden Butler, Sixing Yu, Arya Mazaheri, Ali Jannesari","Inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) across computer clusters has become a focal point of research in recent times, with many acceleration techniques taking inspiration from CPU speculative execution. These techniques reduce bottlenecks associated with memory bandwidth, but also increase end-to-end latency per inference run, requiring high speculation acceptance rates to improve performance. Combined with a variable rate of acceptance across tasks, speculative inference techniques can result in reduced performance. Additionally, pipeline-parallel designs require many user requests to maintain maximum utilization. As a remedy, we propose PipeInfer, a pipelined speculative acceleration technique to reduce inter-token latency and improve system utilization for single-request scenarios while also improving tolerance to low speculation acceptance rates and low-bandwidth interconnects. PipeInfer exhibits up to a 2.15$\times$ improvement in generation speed over standard speculative inference. PipeInfer achieves its improvement through Continuous Asynchronous Speculation and Early Inference Cancellation, the former improving latency and generation speed by running single-token inference simultaneously with several speculative runs, while the latter improves speed and latency by skipping the computation of invalidated runs, even in the middle of inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11798v2,2024-07
Large Language Models as Misleading Assistants in Conversation,"Betty Li Hou, Kejian Shi, Jason Phang, James Aung, Steven Adler, Rosie Campbell","Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to provide assistance on a wide range of information-seeking tasks. However, model outputs may be misleading, whether unintentionally or in cases of intentional deception. We investigate the ability of LLMs to be deceptive in the context of providing assistance on a reading comprehension task, using LLMs as proxies for human users. We compare outcomes of (1) when the model is prompted to provide truthful assistance, (2) when it is prompted to be subtly misleading, and (3) when it is prompted to argue for an incorrect answer. Our experiments show that GPT-4 can effectively mislead both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, with deceptive assistants resulting in up to a 23% drop in accuracy on the task compared to when a truthful assistant is used. We also find that providing the user model with additional context from the passage partially mitigates the influence of the deceptive model. This work highlights the ability of LLMs to produce misleading information and the effects this may have in real-world situations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11789v1,2024-07
SwitchCIT: Switching for Continual Instruction Tuning,"Xinbo Wu, Max Hartman, Vidhata Arjun Jayaraman, Lav R. Varshney","Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (MMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in various domains, particularly in general language understanding and visual reasoning. However, these models, trained on massive data, may not be finely optimized for specific tasks triggered by instructions. Continual instruction tuning is crucial to adapt a large model to evolving tasks and domains, ensuring their effectiveness and relevance across a wide range of applications. In the context of continual instruction tuning, where models are sequentially trained on different tasks, catastrophic forgetting can occur, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. This work addresses the catastrophic forgetting in continual instruction learning through a switching mechanism for routing computations to parameter-efficient tuned models.

Sharif-MGTD at SemEval-2024 Task 8: A Transformer-Based Approach to Detect Machine Generated Text,"Seyedeh Fatemeh Ebrahimi, Karim Akhavan Azari, Amirmasoud Iravani, Arian Qazvini, Pouya Sadeghi, Zeinab Sadat Taghavi, Hossein Sameti","Detecting Machine-Generated Text (MGT) has emerged as a significant area of study within Natural Language Processing. While language models generate text, they often leave discernible traces, which can be scrutinized using either traditional feature-based methods or more advanced neural language models. In this research, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning a RoBERTa-base transformer, a powerful neural architecture, to address MGT detection as a binary classification task. Focusing specifically on Subtask A (Monolingual-English) within the SemEval-2024 competition framework, our proposed system achieves an accuracy of 78.9% on the test dataset, positioning us at 57th among participants. Our study addresses this challenge while considering the limited hardware resources, resulting in a system that excels at identifying human-written texts but encounters challenges in accurately discerning MGTs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11774v1,2024-07
Educational Personalized Learning Path Planning with Large Language Models,"Chee Ng, Yuen Fung","Educational Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to tailor learning experiences to individual learners' needs, enhancing learning efficiency and engagement. Despite its potential, traditional PLPP systems often lack adaptability, interactivity, and transparency. This paper proposes a novel approach integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering to address these challenges. By designing prompts that incorporate learner-specific information, our method guides LLMs like LLama-2-70B and GPT-4 to generate personalized, coherent, and pedagogically sound learning paths. We conducted experiments comparing our method with a baseline approach across various metrics, including accuracy, user satisfaction, and the quality of learning paths. The results show significant improvements in all areas, particularly with GPT-4, demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt engineering in enhancing PLPP. Additional long-term impact analysis further validates our method's potential to improve learner performance and retention. This research highlights the promise of LLMs and prompt engineering in advancing personalized education.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11773v1,2024-07
Robust Utility-Preserving Text Anonymization Based on Large Language Models,"Tianyu Yang, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych","Text anonymization is crucial for sharing sensitive data while maintaining privacy. Existing techniques face the emerging challenges of re-identification attack ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have shown advanced capability in memorizing detailed information and patterns as well as connecting disparate pieces of information. In defending against LLM-based re-identification attacks, anonymization could jeopardize the utility of the resulting anonymized data in downstream tasks -- the trade-off between privacy and data utility requires deeper understanding within the context of LLMs. This paper proposes a framework composed of three LLM-based components -- a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator, and an optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization. To provide a practical model for large-scale and real-time environments, we distill the anonymization capabilities into a lightweight model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed models outperform baseline models, showing robustness in reducing the risk of re-identification while preserving greater data utility in downstream tasks.

Vectoring Languages,Joseph Chen,"Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLM) have stirred up global attention, and the research has been accelerating non-stop since then. Philosophers and psychologists have also been researching the structure of language for decades, but they are having a hard time finding a theory that directly benefits from the breakthroughs of LLMs. In this article, we propose a novel structure of language that reflects well on the mechanisms behind language models and go on to show that this structure is also better at capturing the diverse nature of language compared to previous methods. An analogy of linear algebra is adapted to strengthen the basis of this perspective. We further argue about the difference between this perspective and the design philosophy for current language models. Lastly, we discuss how this perspective can lead us to research directions that may accelerate the improvements of science fastest.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11766v1,2024-07
How Are LLMs Mitigating Stereotyping Harms? Learning from Search Engine Studies,"Alina Leidinger, Richard Rogers","With the widespread availability of LLMs since the release of ChatGPT and increased public scrutiny, commercial model development appears to have focused their efforts on 'safety' training concerning legal liabilities at the expense of social impact evaluation. This mimics a similar trend which we could observe for search engine autocompletion some years prior. We draw on scholarship from NLP and search engine auditing and present a novel evaluation task in the style of autocompletion prompts to assess stereotyping in LLMs. We assess LLMs by using four metrics, namely refusal rates, toxicity, sentiment and regard, with and without safety system prompts. Our findings indicate an improvement to stereotyping outputs with the system prompt, but overall a lack of attention by LLMs under study to certain harms classified as toxic, particularly for prompts about peoples/ethnicities and sexual orientation. Mentions of intersectional identities trigger a disproportionate amount of stereotyping. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings about stereotyping harms in light of the coming intermingling of LLMs and search and the choice of stereotyping mitigation policy to adopt. We address model builders, academics, NLP practitioners and policy makers, calling for accountability and awareness concerning stereotyping harms, be it for training data curation, leader board design and usage, or social impact measurement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11733v2,2024-07
CCoE: A Compact LLM with Collaboration of Experts,"Shaomang Huang, Jianfeng Pan, Hanzhong Zheng","In the domain of Large Language Model (LLM), LLMs demonstrate significant capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. With the growing needs of applying LLMs on various domains, it is a research question that how to efficiently train and build a model that has expertise in different domains but with a low training cost. We propose CCoE architecture, a framework of easily coupling multiple strong domain experts together to fuse into a big LLM, provides a collective way of utilizing the different domain expert LLMs. Besides, training a large collaborative of multiple expert LLMs requires a high requirements on training sources. CCoE bypasses this problem through isolating other experts and train each expert separately. The design of CCoE assembles multiple expert LLMs through the CoE (Collaboration of Experts) layer. Each CoE layer could have one or more expert LLMs. Expert LLMs have different number of layers and have been well-trained for different domain tasks. Each expert is fine-tuned to be able to achieve the comparable results with SOTA domain LLMs. We start from 5 experts in the domain of Code, Math, Law, text-to-SQL and Medical. The results indicate that our CCoE framework can easily and efficiently boost nearly 10%-20% performance on original base model in different domains but using less resources on training, as well as inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11686v3,2024-07
MINI-LLM: Memory-Efficient Structured Pruning for Large Language Models,"Hongrong Cheng, Miao Zhang, Javen Qinfeng Shi","As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow dramatically in size, there is an increasing trend in compressing and speeding up these models. Previous studies have highlighted the usefulness of gradients for importance scoring in neural network compressing, especially in pruning medium-size networks. However, the substantial memory requirements involved in calculating gradients with backpropagation impede the utilization of gradients in guiding LLM pruning. As a result, most pruning strategies for LLMs rely on gradient-free criteria, such as weight magnitudes or a mix of magnitudes and activations. In this paper, we devise a hybrid pruning criterion, which appropriately integrates magnitude, activation, and gradient to capitalize on feature map sensitivity for pruning LLMs. To overcome memory requirement barriers, we estimate gradients using only forward passes. Based on this, we propose a Memory-effIcieNt structured prunIng procedure for LLMs (MINI-LLM) to remove no-critical channels and multi-attention heads. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MINI-LLM over existing gradient-free methods on three LLMs: LLaMA, BLOOM, and OPT across various downstream tasks (classification, multiple-choice, and generation), while MINI-LLM maintains a GPU memory footprint akin to gradient-free methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11681v1,2024-07
ECoh: Turn-level Coherence Evaluation for Multilingual Dialogues,"John Mendonça, Isabel Trancoso, Alon Lavie","Despite being heralded as the new standard for dialogue evaluation, the closed-source nature of GPT-4 poses challenges for the community. Motivated by the need for lightweight, open source, and multilingual dialogue evaluators, this paper introduces GenResCoh (Generated Responses targeting Coherence). GenResCoh is a novel LLM generated dataset comprising over 130k negative and positive responses and accompanying explanations seeded from XDailyDialog and XPersona covering English, French, German, Italian, and Chinese. Leveraging GenResCoh, we propose ECoh (Evaluation of Coherence), a family of evaluators trained to assess response coherence across multiple languages. Experimental results demonstrate that ECoh achieves multilingual detection capabilities superior to the teacher model (GPT-3.5-Turbo) on GenResCoh, despite being based on a much smaller architecture. Furthermore, the explanations provided by ECoh closely align in terms of quality with those generated by the teacher model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11660v1,2024-07
A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Temporal Event Forecasting,"He Chang, Chenchen Ye, Zhulin Tao, Jie Wu, Zhengmao Yang, Yunshan Ma, Xianglin Huang, Tat-Seng Chua","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting. Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various input formats and retrieval augmented generation(RAG) modules. From extensive experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast, incorporating raw texts in specific complex events and fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance. Moreover, enhanced with retrieval modules, LLM can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. Meanwhile, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem still persist in LLMs, particularly in the RAG-based method. These findings not only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also highlight several promising research directions.We consider that this comprehensive evaluation, along with the identified research opportunities, will significantly contribute to future research on temporal event forecasting through LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11638v1,2024-07
The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns,"Juan Luis Gastaldi, John Terilla, Luca Malagutti, Brian DuSell, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell","Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters from an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical step in the NLP pipeline. The use of token representations is widely credited with increased model performance but is also the source of many undesirable behaviors, such as spurious ambiguity or inconsistency. Despite its recognized importance as a standard representation method in NLP, the theoretical underpinnings of tokenization are not yet fully understood. In particular, the impact of tokenization on statistical estimation has been investigated mostly through empirical means. The present paper contributes to addressing this theoretical gap by proposing a unified formal framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. Based on the category of stochastic maps, this framework enables us to establish general conditions for a principled use of tokenizers, and most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for designing and implementing tokenizer models, such as inconsistency, ambiguity, tractability, and boundedness. The framework and results advanced in this paper contribute to building robust theoretical foundations for representations in neural language modeling that can inform future empirical research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11606v3,2024-07

We evaluate the domain adaptation abilities of a wide range of LLMs on the summarization task across various domains in both fine-tuning and in-context learning settings. We also present AdaptEval, the first domain adaptation evaluation suite. AdaptEval includes a domain benchmark and a set of metrics to facilitate the analysis of domain adaptation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit comparable performance in the in-context learning setting, regardless of their parameter scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11591v3,2024-07
Ada-KV: Optimizing KV Cache Eviction by Adaptive Budget Allocation for Efficient LLM Inference,"Yuan Feng, Junlin Lv, Yukun Cao, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou","Large Language Models have excelled in various fields but encounter challenges in memory and time efficiency due to the expanding Key-Value (KV) cache required for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts try to reduce KV cache size to a given memory budget by evicting vast non-critical cache elements during runtime, while preserving generation quality. Our revisiting of current eviction methods reveals that they fundamentally minimize an upper bound of the $L_1$ eviction loss between the pre- and post-eviction outputs of multi-head self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the common practices of uniformly assigning budgets across attention heads harm their post-eviction generation quality. In light of these findings, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm not only optimizes the theoretical loss upper bound but also reduces the $L_1$ eviction loss in practice by aligning with the varied characteristics across different heads. By integrating this algorithm into two state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using adaptive budget allocation to optimize KV cache eviction. Extensive evaluations on 16 datasets and the Needle-in-a-Haystack test confirm significant performance improvements across various tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11550v3,2024-07
How Personality Traits Influence Negotiation Outcomes? A Simulation based on Large Language Models,"Yin Jou Huang, Rafik Hadfi","Psychological evidence reveals the influence of personality traits on decision-making. For instance, agreeableness is generally associated with positive outcomes in negotiations, whereas neuroticism is often linked to less favorable outcomes. This paper introduces a simulation framework centered on Large Language Model (LLM) agents endowed with synthesized personality traits. The agents negotiate within bargaining domains and possess customizable personalities and objectives. The experimental results show that the behavioral tendencies of LLM-based simulations could reproduce behavioral patterns observed in human negotiations. The contribution is twofold. First, we propose a simulation methodology that investigates the alignment between the linguistic and economic capabilities of LLM agents. Secondly, we offer empirical insights into the strategic impact of Big-Five personality traits on the outcomes of bilateral negotiations. We also provide a case study based on synthesized bargaining dialogues to reveal intriguing behaviors, including deceitful and compromising behaviors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11549v2,2024-07
Fine-Tuning Medical Language Models for Enhanced Long-Contextual Understanding and Domain Expertise,"Qimin Yang, Rongsheng Wang, Jiexin Chen, Runqi Su, Tao Tan","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied in various professional fields. By fine-tuning the models using domain specific question and answer datasets, the professional domain knowledge and Q\&A abilities of these models have significantly improved, for example, medical professional LLMs that use fine-tuning of doctor-patient Q\&A data exhibit extraordinary disease diagnostic abilities. However, we observed that despite improvements in specific domain knowledge, the performance of medical LLM in long-context understanding has significantly declined, especially compared to general language models with similar parameters. The purpose of this study is to investigate the phenomenon of reduced performance in understanding long-context in medical LLM. We designed a series of experiments to conduct open-book professional knowledge exams on all models to evaluate their ability to read long-context. By adjusting the proportion and quantity of general data and medical data in the process of fine-tuning, we can determine the best data composition to optimize the professional model and achieve a balance between long-context performance and specific domain knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11536v1,2024-07
Cross-Modal Augmentation for Few-Shot Multimodal Fake News Detection,"Ye Jiang, Taihang Wang, Xiaoman Xu, Yimin Wang, Xingyi Song, Diana Maynard","The nascent topic of fake news requires automatic detection methods to quickly learn from limited annotated samples. Therefore, the capacity to rapidly acquire proficiency in a new task with limited guidance, also known as few-shot learning, is critical for detecting fake news in its early stages. Existing approaches either involve fine-tuning pre-trained language models which come with a large number of parameters, or training a complex neural network from scratch with large-scale annotated datasets. This paper presents a multimodal fake news detection model which augments multimodal features using unimodal features. For this purpose, we introduce Cross-Modal Augmentation (CMA), a simple approach for enhancing few-shot multimodal fake news detection by transforming n-shot classification into a more robust (n $\times$ z)-shot problem, where z represents the number of supplementary features. The proposed CMA achieves SOTA results over three benchmark datasets, utilizing a surprisingly simple linear probing method to classify multimodal fake news with only a few training samples. Furthermore, our method is significantly more lightweight than prior approaches, particularly in terms of the number of trainable parameters and epoch times.

Large Visual-Language Models Are Also Good Classifiers: A Study of In-Context Multimodal Fake News Detection,"Ye Jiang, Yimin Wang","Large visual-language models (LVLMs) exhibit exceptional performance in visual-language reasoning across diverse cross-modal benchmarks. Despite these advances, recent research indicates that Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5-turbo, underachieve compared to well-trained smaller models, such as BERT, in Fake News Detection (FND), prompting inquiries into LVLMs' efficacy in FND tasks. Although performance could improve through fine-tuning LVLMs, the substantial parameters and requisite pre-trained weights render it a resource-heavy endeavor for FND applications. This paper initially assesses the FND capabilities of two notable LVLMs, CogVLM and GPT4V, in comparison to a smaller yet adeptly trained CLIP model in a zero-shot context. The findings demonstrate that LVLMs can attain performance competitive with that of the smaller model. Next, we integrate standard in-context learning (ICL) with LVLMs, noting improvements in FND performance, though limited in scope and consistency. To address this, we introduce the \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{F}ake \textbf{N}ews \textbf{D}etection (IMFND) framework, enriching in-context examples and test inputs with predictions and corresponding probabilities from a well-trained smaller model. This strategic integration directs the LVLMs' focus towards news segments associated with higher probabilities, thereby improving their analytical accuracy. The experimental results suggest that the IMFND framework significantly boosts the FND efficiency of LVLMs, achieving enhanced accuracy over the standard ICL approach across three publicly available FND datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12879v3,2024-07
Do LLMs have Consistent Values?,"Naama Rozen, Liat Bezalel, Gal Elidan, Amir Globerson, Ella Daniel","Large Language Models (LLM) technology is constantly improving towards human-like dialogue. Values are a basic driving force underlying human behavior, but little research has been done to study the values exhibited in text generated by LLMs. Here we study this question by turning to the rich literature on value structure in psychology. We ask whether LLMs exhibit the same value structure that has been demonstrated in humans, including the ranking of values, and correlation between values. We show that the results of this analysis depend on how the LLM is prompted, and that under a particular prompting strategy (referred to as ""Value Anchoring"") the agreement with human data is quite compelling. Our results serve both to improve our understanding of values in LLMs, as well as introduce novel methods for assessing consistency in LLM responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12878v3,2024-07
"Reasoning with Large Language Models, a Survey","Aske Plaat, Annie Wong, Suzan Verberne, Joost Broekens, Niki van Stein, Thomas Back","Scaling up language models to billions of parameters has opened up possibilities for in-context learning, allowing instruction tuning and few-shot learning on tasks that the model was not specifically trained for. This has achieved breakthrough performance on language tasks such as translation, summarization, and question-answering. Furthermore, in addition to these associative ""System 1"" tasks, recent advances in Chain-of-thought prompt learning have demonstrated strong ""System 2"" reasoning abilities, answering a question in the field of artificial general intelligence whether LLMs can reason. The field started with the question whether LLMs can solve grade school math word problems. This paper reviews the rapidly expanding field of prompt-based reasoning with LLMs. Our taxonomy identifies different ways to generate, evaluate, and control multi-step reasoning. We provide an in-depth coverage of core approaches and open problems, and we propose a research agenda for the near future. Finally, we highlight the relation between reasoning and prompt-based learning, and we discuss the relation between reasoning, sequential decision processes, and reinforcement learning.

MMSD-Net: Towards Multi-modal Stuttering Detection,"Liangyu Nie, Sudarsana Reddy Kadiri, Ruchit Agrawal","Stuttering is a common speech impediment that is caused by irregular disruptions in speech production, affecting over 70 million people across the world. Standard automatic speech processing tools do not take speech ailments into account and are thereby not able to generate meaningful results when presented with stuttered speech as input. The automatic detection of stuttering is an integral step towards building efficient, context-aware speech processing systems. While previous approaches explore both statistical and neural approaches for stuttering detection, all of these methods are uni-modal in nature. This paper presents MMSD-Net, the first multi-modal neural framework for stuttering detection. Experiments and results demonstrate that incorporating the visual signal significantly aids stuttering detection, and our model yields an improvement of 2-17% in the F1-score over existing state-of-the-art uni-modal approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11492v1,2024-07
ReFeR: Improving Evaluation and Reasoning through Hierarchy of Models,"Yaswanth Narsupalli, Abhranil Chandra, Sreevatsa Muppirala, Manish Gupta, Pawan Goyal","Assessing the quality of outputs generated by generative models, such as large language models and vision language models, presents notable challenges. Traditional methods for evaluation typically rely on either human assessments, which are resource-intensive, or automatic metrics that often show a low correlation with human judgment. Another common approach is to use deep learning systems, which not only consume a substantial amount of compute and time but also require extensive training data. In this study, we introduce a tuning-free framework called ReFeR, designed to evaluate generative outputs, including both text and images, by leveraging a 2-level hierarchy of LLMs and VLMs themselves. We rigorously evaluate our framework, ReFeR, across four diverse evaluation tasks. The framework not only improves the accuracy of these evaluations, surpassing previous benchmarks but also generates constructive feedback. Interestingly, the framework is also applicable to reasoning tasks. Experiments on four reasoning tasks demonstrate superior collective reasoning abilities of the framework. We present two variants of the framework: ReFeR-Turbo, optimized for accelerated performance, and ReFeR-Lite, offering a more cost-effective solution. ReFeR-Lite is $\sim7.7\times$ more efficient while being comparably accurate to ReFeR-Turbo. We make code, data and PIP package publicly available.

Scientific QA System with Verifiable Answers,"Adela Ljajić, Miloš Košprdić, Bojana Bašaragin, Darija Medvecki, Lorenzo Cassano, Nikola Milošević","In this paper, we introduce the VerifAI project, a pioneering open-source scientific question-answering system, designed to provide answers that are not only referenced but also automatically vetted and verifiable. The components of the system are (1) an Information Retrieval system combining semantic and lexical search techniques over scientific papers (PubMed), (2) a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module using fine-tuned generative model (Mistral 7B) and retrieved articles to generate claims with references to the articles from which it was derived, and (3) a Verification engine, based on a fine-tuned DeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa models on Natural Language Inference task using SciFACT dataset. The verification engine cross-checks the generated claim and the article from which the claim was derived, verifying whether there may have been any hallucinations in generating the claim. By leveraging the Information Retrieval and RAG modules, Verif.ai excels in generating factual information from a vast array of scientific sources. At the same time, the Verification engine rigorously double-checks this output, ensuring its accuracy and reliability. This dual-stage process plays a crucial role in acquiring and confirming factual information, significantly enhancing the information landscape.

We provide a comprehensive taxonomy of the critical components in designing these systems, including data, models and alignment, agent architecture and evaluation. This survey not only outlines the current methodologies and challenges, such as managing dynamic personal profiles and achieving high-level persona consistency but also suggests avenues for future research in improving the depth and realism of role-playing applications.

Beyond Correctness: Benchmarking Multi-dimensional Code Generation for Large Language Models,"Jiasheng Zheng, Boxi Cao, Zhengzhao Ma, Ruotong Pan, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun","In recent years, researchers have proposed numerous benchmarks to evaluate the impressive coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, current benchmarks primarily assess the accuracy of LLM-generated code, while neglecting other critical dimensions that also significantly impact code quality in real-world development. Moreover, relying exclusively on correctness as the guiding metric renders LLMs susceptible to data contamination. Therefore, this paper proposes the RACE benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates the quality of code generated by LLMs across 4 dimensions: Readability, mAintainability, Correctness, and Efficiency. Specifically, considering the demand-dependent nature of dimensions beyond correctness, we design various types of user requirements for each dimension to assess the model's ability to generate correct code that also meets user demands. We analyze 28 representative LLMs based on RACE and find that: 1) current correctness-centric benchmarks fail to capture the multifaceted requirements of code in real-world scenarios, while RACE provides a comprehensive evaluation that reveals the defects of LLMs across multiple dimensions; 2) the RACE benchmark serves as an effective tool for resisting the risk of data contamination; 3) even the most advanced code LLMs still encounter significant challenges in customized requirements involving complex instructions; 4) most LLMs exhibit an inherent preference for specific coding style. These findings highlight the need for a multidimensional evaluation of code LLMs, emphasizing metrics beyond correctness for real-world applications. Future efforts should aim to develop novel learning algorithms to enhance code generation under varied constraints and improve coverage and usability for diverse user needs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11470v2,2024-07
Trust No Bot: Discovering Personal Disclosures in Human-LLM Conversations in the Wild,"Niloofar Mireshghallah, Maria Antoniak, Yash More, Yejin Choi, Golnoosh Farnadi","Measuring personal disclosures made in human-chatbot interactions can provide a better understanding of users' AI literacy and facilitate privacy research for large language models (LLMs). We run an extensive, fine-grained analysis on the personal disclosures made by real users to commercial GPT models, investigating the leakage of personally identifiable and sensitive information. To understand the contexts in which users disclose to chatbots, we develop a taxonomy of tasks and sensitive topics, based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of naturally occurring conversations. We discuss these potential privacy harms and observe that: (1) personally identifiable information (PII) appears in unexpected contexts such as in translation or code editing (48% and 16% of the time, respectively) and (2) PII detection alone is insufficient to capture the sensitive topics that are common in human-chatbot interactions, such as detailed sexual preferences or specific drug use habits. We believe that these high disclosure rates are of significant importance for researchers and data curators, and we call for the design of appropriate nudging mechanisms to help users moderate their interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11438v2,2024-07
States Hidden in Hidden States: LLMs Emerge Discrete State Representations Implicitly,"Junhao Chen, Shengding Hu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit various emergent abilities. Among these abilities, some might reveal the internal working mechanisms of models. In this paper, we uncover a novel emergent capability in models: the intrinsic ability to perform extended sequences of calculations without relying on chain-of-thought step-by-step solutions. Remarkably, the most advanced models can directly output the results of two-digit number additions with lengths extending up to 15 addends. We hypothesize that the model emerges Implicit Discrete State Representations (IDSRs) within its hidden states and performs symbolic calculations internally. To test this hypothesis, we design a sequence of experiments that look into the hidden states. Specifically, we first confirm that IDSRs exist. Then, we provide interesting observations about the formation of IDSRs from layer, digit, and sequence perspectives. Finally, we confirm that models indeed use IDSRs to produce the final answers. However, we also discover that these state representations are far from lossless in current open-sourced models, leading to inaccuracies in their final performance. Our work presents a novel exploration of LLMs' symbolic calculation abilities and the underlying mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11421v1,2024-07
"Semantic Operators: A Declarative Model for Rich, AI-based Analytics Over Text Data","Liana Patel, Siddharth Jha, Parth Asawa, Melissa Pan, Carlos Guestrin, Matei Zaharia","The semantic capabilities of language models (LMs) have the potential to enable rich analytics and reasoning over vast knowledge corpora. Unfortunately, existing systems lack high-level abstractions to perform bulk semantic queries across large corpora. We introduce semantic operators, a declarative programming interface that extends the relational model with composable AI-based operations for bulk semantic queries (e.g., filtering, sorting, joining or aggregating records using natural language criteria). Each operator can be implemented and optimized in multiple ways, opening a rich space for execution plans similar to relational operators. We implement our operators in LOTUS, an open source query engine with a DataFrame API. Furthermore, we develop several novel optimizations that take advantage of the declarative nature of semantic operators to accelerate semantic filtering, clustering and join operators by up to $400\times$ while offering statistical accuracy guarantees. We demonstrate LOTUS' effectiveness on real AI applications including fact-checking, extreme multi-label classification, and search. We show that the semantic operator model is expressive, capturing state-of-the-art AI pipelines in a few operator calls, and making it easy to express new pipelines that achieve up to $180\%$ higher quality. Overall, LOTUS queries match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art AI pipelines for each task while running up to 28$\times$ faster.

We introduce the SPINACH dataset, an expert-annotated KBQA dataset collected from discussions on Wikidata's ""Request a Query"" forum with 320 decontextualized question-SPARQL pairs. The complexity of these in-the-wild queries calls for a KBQA system that can dynamically explore large and often incomplete schemas and reason about them, as it is infeasible to create a comprehensive training dataset.   We also introduce an in-context learning KBQA agent, also called SPINACH, that mimics how a human expert would write SPARQLs to handle challenging questions. SPINACH achieves a new state of the art on the QALD-7, QALD-9 Plus and QALD-10 datasets by 31.0%, 27.0%, and 10.0% in $F_1$, respectively, and coming within 1.6% of the fine-tuned LLaMA SOTA model on WikiWebQuestions. On our new SPINACH dataset, the SPINACH agent outperforms all baselines, including the best GPT-4-based KBQA agent, by at least 38.1% in $F_1$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11417v2,2024-07
Exploring the Use of Abusive Generative AI Models on Civitai,"Yiluo Wei, Yiming Zhu, Pan Hui, Gareth Tyson","The rise of generative AI is transforming the landscape of digital imagery, and exerting a significant influence on online creative communities. This has led to the emergence of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) social platforms, such as Civitai. These distinctive social platforms allow users to build and share their own generative AI models, thereby enhancing the potential for more diverse artistic expression. Designed in the vein of social networks, they also provide artists with the means to showcase their creations (generated from the models), engage in discussions, and obtain feedback, thus nurturing a sense of community. Yet, this openness also raises concerns about the abuse of such platforms, e.g., using models to disseminate deceptive deepfakes or infringe upon copyrights. To explore this, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of an AIGC social platform, focusing on its use for generating abusive content. As an exemplar, we construct a comprehensive dataset covering Civitai, the largest available AIGC social platform. Based on this dataset of 87K models and 2M images, we explore the characteristics of content and discuss strategies for moderation to better govern these platforms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12876v2,2024-07
Representation Bias in Political Sample Simulations with Large Language Models,"Weihong Qi, Hanjia Lyu, Jiebo Luo","This study seeks to identify and quantify biases in simulating political samples with Large Language Models, specifically focusing on vote choice and public opinion. Using the GPT-3.5-Turbo model, we leverage data from the American National Election Studies, German Longitudinal Election Study, Zuobiao Dataset, and China Family Panel Studies to simulate voting behaviors and public opinions. This methodology enables us to examine three types of representation bias: disparities based on the the country's language, demographic groups, and political regime types. The findings reveal that simulation performance is generally better for vote choice than for public opinions, more accurate in English-speaking countries, more effective in bipartisan systems than in multi-partisan systems, and stronger in democratic settings than in authoritarian regimes. These results contribute to enhancing our understanding and developing strategies to mitigate biases in AI applications within the field of computational social science.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11409v1,2024-07
Revisiting the Impact of Pursuing Modularity for Code Generation,"Deokyeong Kang, Ki Jung Seo, Taeuk Kim","Modular programming, which aims to construct the final program by integrating smaller, independent building blocks, has been regarded as a desirable practice in software development. However, with the rise of recent code generation agents built upon large language models (LLMs), a question emerges: is this traditional practice equally effective for these new tools? In this work, we assess the impact of modularity in code generation by introducing a novel metric for its quantitative measurement. Surprisingly, unlike conventional wisdom on the topic, we find that modularity is not a core factor for improving the performance of code generation models. We also explore potential explanations for why LLMs do not exhibit a preference for modular code compared to non-modular code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11406v3,2024-07
CIC-BART-SSA: Controllable Image Captioning with Structured Semantic Augmentation,"Kalliopi Basioti, Mohamed A. Abdelsalam, Federico Fancellu, Vladimir Pavlovic, Afsaneh Fazly","Controllable Image Captioning (CIC) aims at generating natural language descriptions for an image, conditioned on information provided by end users, e.g., regions, entities or events of interest. However, available image-language datasets mainly contain captions that describe the entirety of an image, making them ineffective for training CIC models that can potentially attend to any subset of regions or relationships. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel, fully automatic method to sample additional focused and visually grounded captions using a unified structured semantic representation built on top of the existing set of captions associated with an image. We leverage Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), a cross-lingual graph-based semantic formalism, to encode all possible spatio-semantic relations between entities, beyond the typical spatial-relations-only focus of current methods. We use this Structured Semantic Augmentation (SSA) framework to augment existing image-caption datasets with the grounded controlled captions, increasing their spatial and semantic diversity and focal coverage. We then develop a new model, CIC-BART-SSA, specifically tailored for the CIC task, that sources its control signals from SSA-diversified datasets. We empirically show that, compared to SOTA CIC models, CIC-BART-SSA generates captions that are superior in diversity and text quality, are competitive in controllability, and, importantly, minimize the gap between broad and highly focused controlled captioning performance by efficiently generalizing to the challenging highly focused scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/SamsungLabs/CIC-BART-SSA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11393v2,2024-07
InvAgent: A Large Language Model based Multi-Agent System for Inventory Management in Supply Chains,"Yinzhu Quan, Zefang Liu","Supply chain management (SCM) involves coordinating the flow of goods, information, and finances across various entities to deliver products efficiently. Effective inventory management is crucial in today's volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world. Previous research has demonstrated the superiority of heuristic methods and reinforcement learning applications in inventory management. However, the application of large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents in multi-agent systems for inventory management remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel approach using LLMs to manage multi-agent inventory systems. Leveraging their zero-shot learning capabilities, our model, InvAgent, enhances resilience and improves efficiency across the supply chain network. Our contributions include utilizing LLMs for zero-shot learning to enable adaptive and informed decision-making without prior training, providing significant explainability and clarity through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and demonstrating dynamic adaptability to varying demand scenarios while minimizing costs and avoiding stockouts. Extensive evaluations across different scenarios highlight the efficiency of our model in SCM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11384v1,2024-07
SELF-GUIDE: Better Task-Specific Instruction Following via Self-Synthetic Finetuning,"Chenyang Zhao, Xueying Jia, Vijay Viswanathan, Tongshuang Wu, Graham Neubig","Large language models (LLMs) hold the promise of solving diverse tasks when provided with appropriate natural language prompts. However, prompting often leads models to make predictions with lower accuracy compared to finetuning a model with ample training data. On the other hand, while finetuning LLMs on task-specific data generally improves their performance, abundant annotated datasets are not available for all tasks. Previous work has explored generating task-specific data from state-of-the-art LLMs and using this data to finetune smaller models, but this approach requires access to a language model other than the one being trained, which introduces cost, scalability challenges, and legal hurdles associated with continuously relying on more powerful LLMs. In response to these, we propose SELF-GUIDE, a multi-stage mechanism in which we synthesize task-specific input-output pairs from the student LLM, then use these input-output pairs to finetune the student LLM itself. In our empirical evaluation of the Natural Instructions V2 benchmark, we find that SELF-GUIDE improves the performance of LLM by a substantial margin. Specifically, we report an absolute improvement of approximately 15% for classification tasks and 18% for generation tasks in the benchmark's metrics. This sheds light on the promise of self-synthesized data guiding LLMs towards becoming task-specific experts without any external learning signals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12874v2,2024-07
Reliable Reasoning Beyond Natural Language,"Nasim Borazjanizadeh, Steven T. Piantadosi","Despite their linguistic competence, Large Language models (LLMs) often exhibit limitations in their ability to reason reliably and flexibly. To address this, we propose a neurosymbolic approach that prompts LLMs to extract and encode all relevant information from a problem statement as logical code statements, and then use a logic programming language (Prolog) to conduct the iterative computations of explicit deductive reasoning. Our approach significantly enhances the performance of LLMs on the standard mathematical reasoning benchmark, GSM8k, and the Navigate dataset from the BIG-bench dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, the Non-Linear Reasoning (NLR) dataset, consisting of 55 unique word problems that target the shortcomings of the next token prediction paradigm of LLMs and require complex non-linear reasoning but only basic arithmetic skills to solve. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of Prolog enables LLMs to achieve high performance on the NLR dataset, which even the most advanced language models (including GPT4) fail to solve using text only.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11373v2,2024-07
Estimating Agreement by Chance for Sequence Annotation,"Diya Li, Carolyn Rosé, Ao Yuan, Chunxiao Zhou","In the field of natural language processing, correction of performance assessment for chance agreement plays a crucial role in evaluating the reliability of annotations. However, there is a notable dearth of research focusing on chance correction for assessing the reliability of sequence annotation tasks, despite their widespread prevalence in the field. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel model for generating random annotations, which serves as the foundation for estimating chance agreement in sequence annotation tasks. Utilizing the proposed randomization model and a related comparison approach, we successfully derive the analytical form of the distribution, enabling the computation of the probable location of each annotated text segment and subsequent chance agreement estimation. Through a combination simulation and corpus-based evaluation, we successfully assess its applicability and validate its accuracy and efficacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11371v1,2024-07
A Pilot Study of GSLM-based Simulation of Foreign Accentuation Only Using Native Speech Corpora,"Kentaro Onda, Joonyong Park, Nobuaki Minematsu, Daisuke Saito","We propose a method of simulating the human process of foreign accentuation using Generative Spoken Language Model (GSLM) only with native speech corpora. When one listens to spoken words of a foreign language and repeats them, the repeated speech is often with the accent of that listener's L1. This is said to be because the spoken words are mentally represented as a sequence of phonological units of the L1, and those units are used for oral reproduction. We simulate this process by inputting speech of language A into GSLM of language B to add B's accent onto the input speech. The process of running ASR of the L1 for foreign input speech and giving the ASR result to TTS of the L1 can be viewed as a naive implementation of this approach. The results of our experiments show that the synthesized accent of the output speech is highly natural, compared to real samples of A generated by speakers whose L1 is B, and that the degree of accentuation is controllable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11370v1,2024-07

Performance Evaluation of Lightweight Open-source Large Language Models in Pediatric Consultations: A Comparative Analysis,"Qiuhong Wei, Ying Cui, Mengwei Ding, Yanqin Wang, Lingling Xiang, Zhengxiong Yao, Ceran Chen, Ying Long, Zhezhen Jin, Ximing Xu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential applications in medicine, yet data privacy and computational burden limit their deployment in healthcare institutions. Open-source and lightweight versions of LLMs emerge as potential solutions, but their performance, particularly in pediatric settings remains underexplored. In this cross-sectional study, 250 patient consultation questions were randomly selected from a public online medical forum, with 10 questions from each of 25 pediatric departments, spanning from December 1, 2022, to October 30, 2023. Two lightweight open-source LLMs, ChatGLM3-6B and Vicuna-7B, along with a larger-scale model, Vicuna-13B, and the widely-used proprietary ChatGPT-3.5, independently answered these questions in Chinese between November 1, 2023, and November 7, 2023. To assess reproducibility, each inquiry was replicated once. We found that ChatGLM3-6B demonstrated higher accuracy and completeness than Vicuna-13B and Vicuna-7B (P < .001), but all were outperformed by ChatGPT-3.5. ChatGPT-3.5 received the highest ratings in accuracy (65.2%) compared to ChatGLM3-6B (41.2%), Vicuna-13B (11.2%), and Vicuna-7B (4.4%). Similarly, in completeness, ChatGPT-3.5 led (78.4%), followed by ChatGLM3-6B (76.0%), Vicuna-13B (34.8%), and Vicuna-7B (22.0%) in highest ratings. ChatGLM3-6B matched ChatGPT-3.5 in readability, both outperforming Vicuna models (P < .001). In terms of empathy, ChatGPT-3.5 outperformed the lightweight LLMs (P < .001). In safety, all models performed comparably well (P > .05), with over 98.4% of responses being rated as safe. Repetition of inquiries confirmed these findings. In conclusion, Lightweight LLMs demonstrate promising application in pediatric healthcare. However, the observed gap between lightweight and large-scale proprietary LLMs underscores the need for continued development efforts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15862v1,2024-07
Beyond Binary: Multiclass Paraphasia Detection with Generative Pretrained Transformers and End-to-End Models,"Matthew Perez, Aneesha Sampath, Minxue Niu, Emily Mower Provost","Aphasia is a language disorder that can lead to speech errors known as paraphasias, which involve the misuse, substitution, or invention of words. Automatic paraphasia detection can help those with Aphasia by facilitating clinical assessment and treatment planning options. However, most automatic paraphasia detection works have focused solely on binary detection, which involves recognizing only the presence or absence of a paraphasia. Multiclass paraphasia detection represents an unexplored area of research that focuses on identifying multiple types of paraphasias and where they occur in a given speech segment. We present novel approaches that use a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) to identify paraphasias from transcripts as well as two end-to-end approaches that focus on modeling both automatic speech recognition (ASR) and paraphasia classification as multiple sequences vs. a single sequence. We demonstrate that a single sequence model outperforms GPT baselines for multiclass paraphasia detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11345v1,2024-07

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize vision-language models for the novel task of joint localization and classification in medical images. Besides, we are pioneers in providing baselines for disease localization in chest X-rays.

Uncertainty is Fragile: Manipulating Uncertainty in Large Language Models,"Qingcheng Zeng, Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Zhenting Wang, Wenyue Hua, Zihao Zhou, Guangyan Sun, Yanda Meng, Shiqing Ma, Qifan Wang, Felix Juefei-Xu, Kaize Ding, Fan Yang, Ruixiang Tang, Yongfeng Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed across various high-stakes domains, where the reliability of their outputs is crucial. One commonly used method to assess the reliability of LLMs' responses is uncertainty estimation, which gauges the likelihood of their answers being correct. While many studies focus on improving the accuracy of uncertainty estimations for LLMs, our research investigates the fragility of uncertainty estimation and explores potential attacks. We demonstrate that an attacker can embed a backdoor in LLMs, which, when activated by a specific trigger in the input, manipulates the model's uncertainty without affecting the final output. Specifically, the proposed backdoor attack method can alter an LLM's output probability distribution, causing the probability distribution to converge towards an attacker-predefined distribution while ensuring that the top-1 prediction remains unchanged. Our experimental results demonstrate that this attack effectively undermines the model's self-evaluation reliability in multiple-choice questions. For instance, we achieved a 100 attack success rate (ASR) across three different triggering strategies in four models. Further, we investigate whether this manipulation generalizes across different prompts and domains. This work highlights a significant threat to the reliability of LLMs and underscores the need for future defenses against such attacks.

Target conversation extraction: Source separation using turn-taking dynamics,"Tuochao Chen, Qirui Wang, Bohan Wu, Malek Itani, Sefik Emre Eskimez, Takuya Yoshioka, Shyamnath Gollakota","Extracting the speech of participants in a conversation amidst interfering speakers and noise presents a challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of target conversation extraction, where the goal is to extract the audio of a target conversation based on the speaker embedding of one of its participants. To accomplish this, we propose leveraging temporal patterns inherent in human conversations, particularly turn-taking dynamics, which uniquely characterize speakers engaged in conversation and distinguish them from interfering speakers and noise. Using neural networks, we show the feasibility of our approach on English and Mandarin conversation datasets. In the presence of interfering speakers, our results show an 8.19 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio for 2-speaker conversations and a 7.92 dB improvement for 2-4-speaker conversations.

Bridging Sequence-Structure Alignment in RNA Foundation Models,"Heng Yang, Renzhi Chen, Ke Li","The alignment between RNA sequences and structures in foundation models (FMs) has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Existing FMs have struggled to establish sequence-structure alignment, hindering the free flow of genomic information between RNA sequences and structures. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, an RNA FM trained to align RNA sequences with respect to secondary structures based on structure-contextualised modelling. The alignment enables free and bidirectional mappings between sequences and structures by utilising the flexible RNA modelling paradigm that supports versatile input and output modalities, i.e., sequence and/or structure as input/output. We implement RNA design and zero-shot secondary structure prediction as case studies to evaluate the Seq2Str and Str2Seq mapping capacity of OmniGenome. Results on the EternaV2 benchmark show that OmniGenome solved 74% of puzzles, whereas existing FMs only solved up to 3% of the puzzles due to the oversight of sequence-structure alignment. We leverage four comprehensive in-silico genome modelling benchmarks to evaluate performance across a diverse set of genome downstream tasks, where the results show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on RNA and DNA benchmarks, even without any training on DNA genomes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11242v3,2024-07
Making New Connections: LLMs as Puzzle Generators for The New York Times' Connections Word Game,"Tim Merino, Sam Earle, Ryan Sudhakaran, Shyam Sudhakaran, Julian Togelius","The Connections puzzle is a word association game published daily by The New York Times (NYT). In this game, players are asked to find groups of four words that are connected by a common theme. While solving a given Connections puzzle requires both semantic knowledge and abstract reasoning, generating novel puzzles additionally requires a form of metacognition: generators must be able to accurately model the downstream reasoning of potential solvers. In this paper, we investigate the ability of the GPT family of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate challenging and creative word games for human players. We start with an analysis of the word game Connections and the unique challenges it poses as a Procedural Content Generation (PCG) domain. We then propose a method for generating Connections puzzles using LLMs by adapting a Tree of Thoughts (ToT) prompting approach. We evaluate this method by conducting a user study, asking human players to compare AI-generated puzzles against published Connections puzzles. Our findings show that LLMs are capable puzzle creators, and can generate diverse sets of enjoyable, challenging, and creative Connections puzzles as judged by human users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11240v1,2024-07

We investigate two key aspects: 1) the models' ability to handle varying levels of chart and question complexity, and 2) their robustness across different visual representations of the same underlying data. Our analysis reveals significant performance variations based on question and chart types, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of current models.

Mechanistic interpretability of large language models with applications to the financial services industry,"Ashkan Golgoon, Khashayar Filom, Arjun Ravi Kannan","Large Language Models such as GPTs (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a broad spectrum of applications. Nevertheless, due to their intrinsic complexity, these models present substantial challenges in interpreting their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency poses critical challenges when it comes to their adaptation by financial institutions, where concerns and accountability regarding bias, fairness, and reliability are of paramount importance. Mechanistic interpretability aims at reverse engineering complex AI models such as transformers. In this paper, we are pioneering the use of mechanistic interpretability to shed some light on the inner workings of large language models for use in financial services applications. We offer several examples of how algorithmic tasks can be designed for compliance monitoring purposes. In particular, we investigate GPT-2 Small's attention pattern when prompted to identify potential violation of Fair Lending laws. Using direct logit attribution, we study the contributions of each layer and its corresponding attention heads to the logit difference in the residual stream. Finally, we design clean and corrupted prompts and use activation patching as a causal intervention method to localize our task completion components further.

Automated essay scoring in Arabic: a dataset and analysis of a BERT-based system,"Rayed Ghazawi, Edwin Simpson","Automated Essay Scoring (AES) holds significant promise in the field of education, helping educators to mark larger volumes of essays and provide timely feedback. However, Arabic AES research has been limited by the lack of publicly available essay data. This study introduces AR-AES, an Arabic AES benchmark dataset comprising 2046 undergraduate essays, including gender information, scores, and transparent rubric-based evaluation guidelines, providing comprehensive insights into the scoring process. These essays come from four diverse courses, covering both traditional and online exams. Additionally, we pioneer the use of AraBERT for AES, exploring its performance on different question types. We find encouraging results, particularly for Environmental Chemistry and source-dependent essay questions. For the first time, we examine the scale of errors made by a BERT-based AES system, observing that 96.15 percent of the errors are within one point of the first human marker's prediction, on a scale of one to five, with 79.49 percent of predictions matching exactly. In contrast, additional human markers did not exceed 30 percent exact matches with the first marker, with 62.9 percent within one mark.

Unconstrained Open Vocabulary Image Classification: Zero-Shot Transfer from Text to Image via CLIP Inversion,"Philipp Allgeuer, Kyra Ahrens, Stefan Wermter","We introduce NOVIC, an innovative real-time uNconstrained Open Vocabulary Image Classifier that uses an autoregressive transformer to generatively output classification labels as language. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of CLIP models, NOVIC harnesses the embedding space to enable zero-shot transfer from pure text to images. Traditional CLIP models, despite their ability for open vocabulary classification, require an exhaustive prompt of potential class labels, restricting their application to images of known content or context. To address this, we propose an ""object decoder"" model that is trained on a large-scale 92M-target dataset of templated object noun sets and LLM-generated captions to always output the object noun in question. This effectively inverts the CLIP text encoder and allows textual object labels from essentially the entire English language to be generated directly from image-derived embedding vectors, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the potential content of an image, and without any label biases. The trained decoders are tested on a mix of manually and web-curated datasets, as well as standard image classification benchmarks, and achieve fine-grained prompt-free prediction scores of up to 87.5%, a strong result considering the model must work for any conceivable image and without any contextual clues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11211v4,2024-07
Actuation without production bias,"James Kirby, Morgan Sonderegger","Phonetic production bias is the external force most commonly invoked in computational models of sound change, despite the fact that it is not responsible for all, or even most, sound changes. Furthermore, the existence of production bias alone cannot account for how changes do or do not propagate throughout a speech community. While many other factors have been invoked by (socio)phoneticians, including but not limited to contact (between subpopulations) and differences in social evaluation (of variants, groups, or individuals), these are not typically modeled in computational simulations of sound change. In this paper, we consider whether production biases have a unique dynamics in terms of how they impact the population-level spread of change in a setting where agents learn from multiple teachers. We show that, while the dynamics conditioned by production bias are not unique, it is not the case that all perturbing forces have the same dynamics: in particular, if social weight is a function of individual teachers and the correlation between a teacher's social weight and the extent to which they realize a production bias is weak, change is unlikely to propagate. Nevertheless, it remains the case that changes initiated from different sources may display a similar dynamics. A more nuanced understanding of how population structure interacts with individual biases can thus provide a (partial) solution to the `non-phonologization problem'.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11202v1,2024-07
AstroMLab 1: Who Wins Astronomy Jeopardy!?,"Yuan-Sen Ting, Tuan Dung Nguyen, Tirthankar Ghosal, Rui Pan, Hardik Arora, Zechang Sun, Tijmen de Haan, Nesar Ramachandra, Azton Wells, Sandeep Madireddy, Alberto Accomazzi","We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. open-weights models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy.

Through comprehensive statistical data analysis, the study investigates various linguistic traits, patterns of creativity, and potential biases inherent in human-written and AI- generated texts. The significance of this research lies in its contribution to understanding AI's creative capabilities and its impact on literature, communication, and societal frameworks. By examining a meticulously curated dataset comprising 500K essays spanning diverse topics and genres, generated by LLMs, or written by humans, the study uncovers the deeper layers of linguistic expression and provides insights into the cognitive processes underlying both AI and human-driven textual compositions. The analysis revealed that human-authored essays tend to have a higher total word count on average than AI-generated essays but have a shorter average word length compared to AI- generated essays, and while both groups exhibit high levels of fluency, the vocabulary diversity of Human authored content is higher than AI generated content. However, AI- generated essays show a slightly higher level of novelty, suggesting the potential for generating more original content through AI systems. The paper addresses challenges in assessing the language generation capabilities of AI models and emphasizes the importance of datasets that reflect the complexities of human-AI collaborative writing. Through systematic preprocessing and rigorous statistical analysis, this study offers valuable insights into the evolving landscape of AI-generated content and informs future developments in natural language processing (NLP).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00769v1,2024-07
"YouTube-SL-25: A Large-Scale, Open-Domain Multilingual Sign Language Parallel Corpus","Garrett Tanzer, Biao Zhang","Even for better-studied sign languages like American Sign Language (ASL), data is the bottleneck for machine learning research. The situation is worse yet for the many other sign languages used by Deaf/Hard of Hearing communities around the world. In this paper, we present YouTube-SL-25, a large-scale, open-domain multilingual corpus of sign language videos with seemingly well-aligned captions drawn from YouTube. With >3000 hours of videos across >25 sign languages, YouTube-SL-25 is a) >3x the size of YouTube-ASL, b) the largest parallel sign language dataset to date, and c) the first or largest parallel dataset for many of its component languages. We provide baselines for sign-to-text tasks using a unified multilingual multitask model based on T5 and report scores on benchmarks across 4 sign languages. The results demonstrate that multilingual transfer benefits both higher- and lower-resource sign languages within YouTube-SL-25.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11144v1,2024-07
Q-Sparse: All Large Language Models can be Fully Sparsely-Activated,"Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma, Ruiping Wang, Furu Wei","We introduce, Q-Sparse, a simple yet effective approach to training sparsely-activated large language models (LLMs). Q-Sparse enables full sparsity of activations in LLMs which can bring significant efficiency gains in inference. This is achieved by applying top-K sparsification to the activations and the straight-through-estimator to the training. We also introduce Block Q-Sparse for batch training and inference. The key results from this work are, (1) Q-Sparse can achieve results comparable to those of baseline LLMs while being much more efficient at inference time; (2) We present an inference-optimal scaling law for sparsely-activated LLMs; (3) Q-Sparse is effective in different settings, including training-from-scratch, continue-training of off-the-shelf LLMs, and finetuning; (4) Q-Sparse works for both full-precision and 1-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet b1.58). Particularly, the synergy of BitNet b1.58 and Q-Sparse (can be equipped with MoE) provides the cornerstone and a clear path to revolutionize the efficiency, including cost and energy consumption, of future LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10969v3,2024-07
"No Train, all Gain: Self-Supervised Gradients Improve Deep Frozen Representations","Walter Simoncini, Spyros Gidaris, Andrei Bursuc, Yuki M. Asano","This paper introduces FUNGI, Features from UNsupervised GradIents, a method to enhance the features of transformer encoders by leveraging self-supervised gradients. Our method is simple: given any pretrained model, we first compute gradients from various self-supervised objectives for each input. These gradients are projected to a lower dimension and then concatenated with the model's output embedding. The resulting features are evaluated on k-nearest neighbor classification over 11 datasets from vision, 5 from natural language processing, and 2 from audio. Across backbones spanning various sizes and pretraining strategies, FUNGI features provide consistent performance improvements over the embeddings. We also show that using FUNGI features can benefit linear classification, clustering and image retrieval, and that they significantly improve the retrieval-based in-context scene understanding abilities of pretrained models, for example improving upon DINO by +17% for semantic segmentation - without any training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10964v2,2024-07
Fast Matrix Multiplications for Lookup Table-Quantized LLMs,"Han Guo, William Brandon, Radostin Cholakov, Jonathan Ragan-Kelley, Eric P. Xing, Yoon Kim","The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by memory bandwidth, where the primary bottleneck is the cost of transferring model parameters from the GPU's global memory to its registers. When coupled with custom kernels that fuse the dequantization and matmul operations, weight-only quantization can thus enable faster inference by reducing the amount of memory movement. However, developing high-performance kernels for weight-quantized LLMs presents substantial challenges, especially when the weights are compressed to non-evenly-divisible bit widths (e.g., 3 bits) with non-uniform, lookup table (LUT) quantization. This paper describes FLUTE, a flexible lookup table engine for LUT-quantized LLMs, which uses offline restructuring of the quantized weight matrix to minimize bit manipulations associated with unpacking, and vectorization and duplication of the lookup table to mitigate shared memory bandwidth constraints. At batch sizes < 32 and quantization group size of 128 (typical in LLM inference), the FLUTE kernel can be 2-4x faster than existing GEMM kernels. As an application of FLUTE, we explore a simple extension to lookup table-based NormalFloat quantization and apply it to quantize LLaMA3 to various configurations, obtaining competitive quantization performance against strong baselines while obtaining an end-to-end throughput increase of 1.5 to 2 times.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10960v3,2024-07

As vision language models (VLMs) advance in multimodal understanding and code generation, VLM-based agents could potentially automate these workflows by generating SQL queries, Python code, and GUI operations. This automation can improve the productivity of experts while democratizing access to large-scale data analysis. In this paper, we introduce Spider2-V, the first multimodal agent benchmark focusing on professional data science and engineering workflows, featuring 494 real-world tasks in authentic computer environments and incorporating 20 enterprise-level professional applications. These tasks, derived from real-world use cases, evaluate the ability of a multimodal agent to perform data-related tasks by writing code and managing the GUI in enterprise data software systems. To balance realistic simulation with evaluation simplicity, we devote significant effort to developing automatic configurations for task setup and carefully crafting evaluation metrics for each task. Furthermore, we supplement multimodal agents with comprehensive documents of these enterprise data software systems. Our empirical evaluation reveals that existing state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents do not reliably automate full data workflows (14.0% success). Even with step-by-step guidance, these agents still underperform in tasks that require fine-grained, knowledge-intensive GUI actions (16.2%) and involve remote cloud-hosted workspaces (10.6%). We hope that Spider2-V paves the way for autonomous multimodal agents to transform the automation of data science and engineering workflow.

MMM: Multilingual Mutual Reinforcement Effect Mix Datasets & Test with Open-domain Information Extraction Large Language Models,"Chengguang Gan, Sunbowen Lee, Qingyu Yin, Xinyang He, Hanjun Wei, Yunhao Liang, Younghun Lim, Shijian Wang, Hexiang Huang, Qinghao Zhang, Shiwen Ni, Tatsunori Mori","The Mutual Reinforcement Effect (MRE) represents a promising avenue in information extraction and multitasking research. Nevertheless, its applicability has been constrained due to the exclusive availability of MRE mix datasets in Japanese, thereby limiting comprehensive exploration by the global research community. To address this limitation, we introduce a Multilingual MRE mix dataset (MMM) that encompasses 21 sub-datasets in English, Japanese, and Chinese. In this paper, we also propose a method for dataset translation assisted by Large Language Models (LLMs), which significantly reduces the manual annotation time required for dataset construction by leveraging LLMs to translate the original Japanese datasets. Additionally, we have enriched the dataset by incorporating open-domain Named Entity Recognition (NER) and sentence classification tasks. Utilizing this expanded dataset, we developed a unified input-output framework to train an Open-domain Information Extraction Large Language Model (OIELLM). The OIELLM model demonstrates the capability to effectively process novel MMM datasets, exhibiting significant improvements in performance.

Representing Rule-based Chatbots with Transformers,"Dan Friedman, Abhishek Panigrahi, Danqi Chen","Transformer-based chatbots can conduct fluent, natural-sounding conversations, but we have limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying their behavior. Prior work has taken a bottom-up approach to understanding Transformers by constructing Transformers for various synthetic and formal language tasks, such as regular expressions and Dyck languages. However, it is not obvious how to extend this approach to understand more naturalistic conversational agents. In this work, we take a step in this direction by constructing a Transformer that implements the ELIZA program, a classic, rule-based chatbot. ELIZA illustrates some of the distinctive challenges of the conversational setting, including both local pattern matching and long-term dialog state tracking. We build on constructions from prior work -- in particular, for simulating finite-state automata -- showing how simpler constructions can be composed and extended to give rise to more sophisticated behavior. Next, we train Transformers on a dataset of synthetically generated ELIZA conversations and investigate the mechanisms the models learn. Our analysis illustrates the kinds of mechanisms these models tend to prefer -- for example, models favor an induction head mechanism over a more precise, position based copying mechanism; and using intermediate generations to simulate recurrent data structures, like ELIZA's memory mechanisms. Overall, by drawing an explicit connection between neural chatbots and interpretable, symbolic mechanisms, our results offer a new setting for mechanistic analysis of conversational agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10949v1,2024-07
Learning from Naturally Occurring Feedback,"Shachar Don-Yehiya, Leshem Choshen, Omri Abend","Human feedback data is a critical component in developing language models. However, collecting this feedback is costly and ultimately not scalable. We propose a scalable method for extracting feedback that users naturally include when interacting with chat models, and leveraging it for model training. We are further motivated by previous work that showed there are also qualitative advantages to using naturalistic (rather than auto-generated) feedback, such as less hallucinations and biases. We manually annotated conversation data to confirm the presence of naturally occurring feedback in a standard corpus, finding that as much as 30% of the chats include explicit feedback. We apply our method to over 1M conversations to obtain hundreds of thousands of feedback samples. Training with the extracted feedback shows significant performance improvements over baseline models, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in enhancing model alignment to human preferences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10944v1,2024-07
Evaluation of RAG Metrics for Question Answering in the Telecom Domain,"Sujoy Roychowdhury, Sumit Soman, H G Ranjani, Neeraj Gunda, Vansh Chhabra, Sai Krishna Bala","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) perform Question Answering (QA) tasks in various domains. However, RAG based on open-source LLM for specialized domains has challenges of evaluating generated responses. A popular framework in the literature is the RAG Assessment (RAGAS), a publicly available library which uses LLMs for evaluation. One disadvantage of RAGAS is the lack of details of derivation of numerical value of the evaluation metrics. One of the outcomes of this work is a modified version of this package for few metrics (faithfulness, context relevance, answer relevance, answer correctness, answer similarity and factual correctness) through which we provide the intermediate outputs of the prompts by using any LLMs. Next, we analyse the expert evaluations of the output of the modified RAGAS package and observe the challenges of using it in the telecom domain. We also study the effect of the metrics under correct vs. wrong retrieval and observe that few of the metrics have higher values for correct retrieval. We also study for differences in metrics between base embeddings and those domain adapted via pre-training and fine-tuning. Finally, we comment on the suitability and challenges of using these metrics for in-the-wild telecom QA task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12873v1,2024-07
Fine-Tuning and Prompt Optimization: Two Great Steps that Work Better Together,"Dilara Soylu, Christopher Potts, Omar Khattab","Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly taking the form of sophisticated modular pipelines, e.g., Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where each module may involve a distinct Language Model (LM) and an associated prompt template. These compound systems often lack intermediate labels or gradient flow to optimize each module, making their end-to-end optimization challenging. Here we seek strategies to optimize both the module-level LM weights and the associated prompt templates of such systems to maximize a downstream task metric. We propose for the first time combining the weight and prompt optimization strategies to optimize a modular LM pipeline by alternating between the two to get the same LM to teach itself. In experiments with multi-hop QA, mathematical reasoning, and feature-based classification using mistral-7b, llama-2-7b, and llama-3-8b, these BetterTogether strategies optimizing the weights and prompts of a pipeline together outperform directly optimizing weights alone and prompts alone by up to 60% and 6%, respectively, on average across LMs and tasks.

Benchmarking Vision Language Models for Cultural Understanding,"Shravan Nayak, Kanishk Jain, Rabiul Awal, Siva Reddy, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Lisa Anne Hendricks, Karolina Stańczak, Aishwarya Agrawal","Foundation models and vision-language pre-training have notably advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs), enabling multimodal processing of visual and linguistic data. However, their performance has been typically assessed on general scene understanding - recognizing objects, attributes, and actions - rather than cultural comprehension. This study introduces CulturalVQA, a visual question-answering benchmark aimed at assessing VLM's geo-diverse cultural understanding. We curate a collection of 2,378 image-question pairs with 1-5 answers per question representing cultures from 11 countries across 5 continents. The questions probe understanding of various facets of culture such as clothing, food, drinks, rituals, and traditions. Benchmarking VLMs on CulturalVQA, including GPT-4V and Gemini, reveals disparity in their level of cultural understanding across regions, with strong cultural understanding capabilities for North America while significantly lower performance for Africa. We observe disparity in their performance across cultural facets too, with clothing, rituals, and traditions seeing higher performances than food and drink. These disparities help us identify areas where VLMs lack cultural understanding and demonstrate the potential of CulturalVQA as a comprehensive evaluation set for gauging VLM progress in understanding diverse cultures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10920v3,2024-07
Leveraging LLM-Respondents for Item Evaluation: a Psychometric Analysis,"Yunting Liu, Shreya Bhandari, Zachary A. Pardos","Effective educational measurement relies heavily on the curation of well-designed item pools (i.e., possessing the right psychometric properties). However, item calibration is time-consuming and costly, requiring a sufficient number of respondents for the response process. We explore using six different LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama 2, Llama 3, Gemini-Pro, and Cohere Command R Plus) and various combinations of them using sampling methods to produce responses with psychometric properties similar to human answers. Results show that some LLMs have comparable or higher proficiency in College Algebra than college students. No single LLM mimics human respondents due to narrow proficiency distributions, but an ensemble of LLMs can better resemble college students' ability distribution. The item parameters calibrated by LLM-Respondents have high correlations (e.g. > 0.8 for GPT-3.5) compared to their human calibrated counterparts, and closely resemble the parameters of the human subset (e.g. 0.02 Spearman correlation difference). Several augmentation strategies are evaluated for their relative performance, with resampling methods proving most effective, enhancing the Spearman correlation from 0.89 (human only) to 0.93 (augmented human).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10899v1,2024-07
Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers,"Sai Sena Chinnakonduru, Astarag Mohapatra","The attention mechanism forms the foundational blocks for transformer language models. Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10855v1,2024-07
An Actionable Framework for Assessing Bias and Fairness in Large Language Model Use Cases,Dylan Bouchard,"Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit bias in a variety of ways. Such biases can create or exacerbate unfair outcomes for certain groups within a protected attribute, including, but not limited to sex, race, sexual orientation, or age. This paper aims to provide a technical guide for practitioners to assess bias and fairness risks in LLM use cases. The main contribution of this work is a decision framework that allows practitioners to determine which metrics to use for a specific LLM use case. To achieve this, this study categorizes LLM bias and fairness risks, maps those risks to a taxonomy of LLM use cases, and then formally defines various metrics to assess each type of risk. As part of this work, several new bias and fairness metrics are introduced, including innovative counterfactual metrics as well as metrics based on stereotype classifiers. Instead of focusing solely on the model itself, the sensitivity of both prompt-risk and model-risk are taken into account by defining evaluations at the level of an LLM use case, characterized by a model and a population of prompts. Furthermore, because all of the evaluation metrics are calculated solely using the LLM output, the proposed framework is highly practical and easily actionable for practitioners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10853v2,2024-07
BiasScanner: Automatic Detection and Classification of News Bias to Strengthen Democracy,"Tim Menzner, Jochen L. Leidner","The increasing consumption of news online in the 21st century coincided with increased publication of disinformation, biased reporting, hate speech and other unwanted Web content. We describe BiasScanner, an application that aims to strengthen democracy by supporting news consumers with scrutinizing news articles they are reading online. BiasScanner contains a server-side pre-trained large language model to identify biased sentences of news articles and a front-end Web browser plug-in. At the time of writing, BiasScanner can identify and classify more than two dozen types of media bias at the sentence level, making it the most fine-grained model and only deployed application (automatic system in use) of its kind. It was implemented in a light-weight and privacy-respecting manner, and in addition to highlighting likely biased sentence it also provides explanations for each classification decision as well as a summary analysis for each news article. While prior research has addressed news bias detection, we are not aware of any work that resulted in a deployed browser plug-in (c.f. also biasscanner.org for a Web demo).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10829v1,2024-07
LLM Circuit Analyses Are Consistent Across Training and Scale,"Curt Tigges, Michael Hanna, Qinan Yu, Stella Biderman","Most currently deployed large language models (LLMs) undergo continuous training or additional finetuning. By contrast, most research into LLMs' internal mechanisms focuses on models at one snapshot in time (the end of pre-training), raising the question of whether their results generalize to real-world settings. Existing studies of mechanisms over time focus on encoder-only or toy models, which differ significantly from most deployed models. In this study, we track how model mechanisms, operationalized as circuits, emerge and evolve across 300 billion tokens of training in decoder-only LLMs, in models ranging from 70 million to 2.8 billion parameters. We find that task abilities and the functional components that support them emerge consistently at similar token counts across scale. Moreover, although such components may be implemented by different attention heads over time, the overarching algorithm that they implement remains. Surprisingly, both these algorithms and the types of components involved therein can replicate across model scale. These results suggest that circuit analyses conducted on small models at the end of pre-training can provide insights that still apply after additional pre-training and over model scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10827v2,2024-07
Foundational Autoraters: Taming Large Language Models for Better Automatic Evaluation,"Tu Vu, Kalpesh Krishna, Salaheddin Alzubi, Chris Tar, Manaal Faruqui, Yun-Hsuan Sung","As large language models (LLMs) advance, it becomes more challenging to reliably evaluate their output due to the high costs of human evaluation. To make progress towards better LLM autoraters, we introduce FLAMe, a family of Foundational Large Autorater Models. FLAMe is trained on our large and diverse collection of 100+ quality assessment tasks comprising 5M+ human judgments, curated and standardized using publicly released human evaluations from previous research. FLAMe significantly improves generalization to a wide variety of held-out tasks, outperforming LLMs trained on proprietary data like GPT-4 and Claude-3 on many tasks. We show that FLAMe can also serve as a powerful starting point for further downstream fine-tuning, using reward modeling evaluation as a case study (FLAMe-RM). Notably, on RewardBench, our FLAMe-RM-24B model (with an accuracy of 87.8%) is the top-performing generative model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, outperforming both GPT-4-0125 (85.9%) and GPT-4o (84.7%). Additionally, we explore a more computationally efficient approach using a novel tail-patch fine-tuning strategy to optimize our FLAMe multitask mixture for reward modeling evaluation (FLAMe-Opt-RM), offering competitive RewardBench performance while requiring approximately 25x less training datapoints. Overall, our FLAMe variants outperform all popular proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge models we consider across 8 out of 12 autorater evaluation benchmarks, encompassing 53 quality assessment tasks, including RewardBench and LLM-AggreFact. Finally, our analysis reveals that FLAMe is significantly less biased than these LLM-as-a-Judge models on the CoBBLEr autorater bias benchmark, while effectively identifying high-quality responses for code generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10817v1,2024-07
Employing Sentence Space Embedding for Classification of Data Stream from Fake News Domain,"Paweł Zyblewski, Jakub Klikowski, Weronika Borek-Marciniec, Paweł Ksieniewicz","Tabular data is considered the last unconquered castle of deep learning, yet the task of data stream classification is stated to be an equally important and demanding research area. Due to the temporal constraints, it is assumed that deep learning methods are not the optimal solution for application in this field. However, excluding the entire -- and prevalent -- group of methods seems rather rash given the progress that has been made in recent years in its development. For this reason, the following paper is the first to present an approach to natural language data stream classification using the sentence space method, which allows for encoding text into the form of a discrete digital signal. This allows the use of convolutional deep networks dedicated to image classification to solve the task of recognizing fake news based on text data.

Think-on-Graph 2.0: Deep and Faithful Large Language Model Reasoning with Knowledge-guided Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Shengjie Ma, Chengjin Xu, Xuhui Jiang, Muzhi Li, Huaren Qu, Cehao Yang, Jiaxin Mao, Jian Guo","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has improved large language models (LLMs) by using knowledge retrieval to overcome knowledge deficiencies. However, current RAG methods often fall short of ensuring the depth and completeness of retrieved information, which is necessary for complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we introduce Think-on-Graph 2.0 (ToG-2), a hybrid RAG framework that iteratively retrieves information from both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in a tight-coupling manner. Specifically, ToG-2 leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to link documents via entities, facilitating deep and knowledge-guided context retrieval. Simultaneously, it utilizes documents as entity contexts to achieve precise and efficient graph retrieval. ToG-2 alternates between graph retrieval and context retrieval to search for in-depth clues relevant to the question, enabling LLMs to generate answers. We conduct a series of well-designed experiments to highlight the following advantages of ToG-2: 1) ToG-2 tightly couples the processes of context retrieval and graph retrieval, deepening context retrieval via the KG while enabling reliable graph retrieval based on contexts; 2) it achieves deep and faithful reasoning in LLMs through an iterative knowledge retrieval process of collaboration between contexts and the KG; and 3) ToG-2 is training-free and plug-and-play compatible with various LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToG-2 achieves overall state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 6 out of 7 knowledge-intensive datasets with GPT-3.5, and can elevate the performance of smaller models (e.g., LLAMA-2-13B) to the level of GPT-3.5's direct reasoning.

Mix-CPT: A Domain Adaptation Framework via Decoupling Knowledge Learning and Format Alignment,"Jinhao Jiang, Junyi Li, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yang Song, Tao Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen","Adapting general large language models (LLMs) to specialized domains presents great challenges due to varied data distributions. This adaptation typically requires continual pre-training on massive domain-specific corpora to facilitate knowledge memorization, followed by training to apply this knowledge following human instructions and preferences. However, this method may result in inefficient knowledge memorization due to a lack of awareness of knowledge utilization and imposes substantial demands on LLMs to simultaneously learn knowledge utilization and format alignment with limited training samples. To facilitate the domain adaptation of LLM, we revise this process and propose a new domain adaptation framework including domain knowledge learning and general format alignment, called Mix-CPT. Specifically, we first conduct a knowledge mixture continual pre-training that concurrently focuses on knowledge memorization and utilization, allowing for mutual reinforcement. To avoid catastrophic forgetting during the continual pre-training process, we further incorporate a logit swap self-distillation constraint. Subsequently, leveraging the knowledge and capabilities acquired during continual pre-training, we efficiently perform instruction tuning and alignment with a few general training samples to achieve format alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed Mix-CPT framework can simultaneously improve the task-solving capabilities of LLMs on the target and general domains compared to the traditional adaptation methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10804v1,2024-07
Multilingual Contrastive Decoding via Language-Agnostic Layers Skipping,"Wenhao Zhu, Sizhe Liu, Shujian Huang, Shuaijie She, Chris Wendler, Jiajun Chen","Decoding by contrasting layers (DoLa), is designed to improve the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) by contrasting the prediction probabilities between an early exit output (amateur logits) and the final output (expert logits). However, we find that this approach does not work well on non-English tasks. Inspired by previous interpretability work on language transition during the model's forward pass, we discover that this issue arises from a language mismatch between early exit output and final output. In this work, we propose an improved contrastive decoding algorithm that is effective for diverse languages beyond English. To obtain more helpful amateur logits, we devise two strategies to skip a set of bottom, language-agnostic layers based on our preliminary analysis. Experimental results on multilingual reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous contrastive decoding baselines and substantially improves LLM's chain-of-thought reasoning accuracy across 11 languages.

Graphusion: Leveraging Large Language Models for Scientific Knowledge Graph Fusion and Construction in NLP Education,"Rui Yang, Boming Yang, Sixun Ouyang, Tianwei She, Aosong Feng, Yuang Jiang, Freddy Lecue, Jinghui Lu, Irene Li","Knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial in the field of artificial intelligence and are widely applied in downstream tasks, such as enhancing Question Answering (QA) systems. The construction of KGs typically requires significant effort from domain experts. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for knowledge graph construction (KGC), however, most existing approaches focus on a local perspective, extracting knowledge triplets from individual sentences or documents. In this work, we introduce Graphusion, a zero-shot KGC framework from free text. The core fusion module provides a global view of triplets, incorporating entity merging, conflict resolution, and novel triplet discovery. We showcase how Graphusion could be applied to the natural language processing (NLP) domain and validate it in the educational scenario. Specifically, we introduce TutorQA, a new expert-verified benchmark for graph reasoning and QA, comprising six tasks and a total of 1,200 QA pairs. Our evaluation demonstrates that Graphusion surpasses supervised baselines by up to 10% in accuracy on link prediction. Additionally, it achieves average scores of 2.92 and 2.37 out of 3 in human evaluations for concept entity extraction and relation recognition, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10794v1,2024-07
GraphEval: A Knowledge-Graph Based LLM Hallucination Evaluation Framework,"Hannah Sansford, Nicholas Richardson, Hermina Petric Maretic, Juba Nait Saada","Methods to evaluate Large Language Model (LLM) responses and detect inconsistencies, also known as hallucinations, with respect to the provided knowledge, are becoming increasingly important for LLM applications. Current metrics fall short in their ability to provide explainable decisions, systematically check all pieces of information in the response, and are often too computationally expensive to be used in practice. We present GraphEval: a hallucination evaluation framework based on representing information in Knowledge Graph (KG) structures. Our method identifies the specific triples in the KG that are prone to hallucinations and hence provides more insight into where in the response a hallucination has occurred, if at all, than previous methods. Furthermore, using our approach in conjunction with state-of-the-art natural language inference (NLI) models leads to an improvement in balanced accuracy on various hallucination benchmarks, compared to using the raw NLI models.

In contrast to complex hierarchical tags, we have simplified the pre-training process by utilizing natural language prompts for different data and tasks, and have further expanded the data volume. We have boosted the instruction-following capability of Qwen2-Audio and implemented two distinct audio interaction modes for voice chat and audio analysis. In the voice chat mode, users can freely engage in voice interactions with Qwen2-Audio without text input. In the audio analysis mode, users could provide audio and text instructions for analysis during the interaction. Note that we do not use any system prompts to switch between voice chat and audio analysis modes. Qwen2-Audio is capable of intelligently comprehending the content within audio and following voice commands to respond appropriately. For instance, in an audio segment that simultaneously contains sounds, multi-speaker conversations, and a voice command, Qwen2-Audio can directly understand the command and provide an interpretation and response to the audio. Additionally, DPO has optimized the model's performance in terms of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. According to the evaluation results from AIR-Bench, Qwen2-Audio outperformed previous SOTAs, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, in tests focused on audio-centric instruction-following capabilities. Qwen2-Audio is open-sourced with the aim of fostering the advancement of the multi-modal language community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10759v1,2024-07
Codebook LLMs: Evaluating LLMs as Measurement Tools for Political Science Concepts,"Andrew Halterman, Katherine A. Keith","Codebooks -- documents that operationalize concepts and outline annotation procedures -- are used almost universally by social scientists when coding political texts. To code these texts automatically, researchers are increasing turning to generative large language models (LLMs). However, there is limited empirical evidence on whether ""off-the-shelf"" LLMs faithfully follow real-world codebook operationalizations and measure complex political constructs with sufficient accuracy. To address this, we gather and curate three real-world political science codebooks -- covering protest events, political violence and manifestos -- along with their unstructured texts and human labels. We also propose a five-stage framework for codebook-LLM measurement: preparing a codebook for both humans and LLMs, testing LLMs' basic capabilities on a codebook, evaluating zero-shot measurement accuracy (i.e. off-the-shelf performance), analyzing errors, and further (parameter-efficient) supervised training of LLMs. We provide an empirical demonstration of this framework using our three codebook datasets and several pretrained 7-12 billion open-weight LLMs. We find current open-weight LLMs have limitations in following codebooks zero-shot, but that supervised instruction tuning can substantially improve performance. Rather than suggesting the ""best"" LLM, our contribution lies in our codebook datasets, evaluation framework, and guidance for applied researchers who wish to implement their own codebook-LLM measurement projects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10747v2,2024-07
What distinguishes conspiracy from critical narratives? A computational analysis of oppositional discourse,"Damir Korenčić, Berta Chulvi, Xavier Bonet Casals, Alejandro Toselli, Mariona Taulé, Paolo Rosso","The current prevalence of conspiracy theories on the internet is a significant issue, tackled by many computational approaches. However, these approaches fail to recognize the relevance of distinguishing between texts which contain a conspiracy theory and texts which are simply critical and oppose mainstream narratives. Furthermore, little attention is usually paid to the role of inter-group conflict in oppositional narratives. We contribute by proposing a novel topic-agnostic annotation scheme that differentiates between conspiracies and critical texts, and that defines span-level categories of inter-group conflict. We also contribute with the multilingual XAI-DisInfodemics corpus (English and Spanish), which contains a high-quality annotation of Telegram messages related to COVID-19 (5,000 messages per language). We also demonstrate the feasibility of an NLP-based automatization by performing a range of experiments that yield strong baseline solutions. Finally, we perform an analysis which demonstrates that the promotion of intergroup conflict and the presence of violence and anger are key aspects to distinguish between the two types of oppositional narratives, i.e., conspiracy vs. critical.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10745v1,2024-07
Transforming Agency. On the mode of existence of Large Language Models,"Xabier E. Barandiaran, Lola S. Almendros","This paper investigates the ontological characterization of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Between inflationary and deflationary accounts, we pay special attention to their status as agents. This requires explaining in detail the architecture, processing, and training procedures that enable LLMs to display their capacities, and the extensions used to turn LLMs into agent-like systems. After a systematic analysis we conclude that a LLM fails to meet necessary and sufficient conditions for autonomous agency in the light of embodied theories of mind: the individuality condition (it is not the product of its own activity, it is not even directly affected by it), the normativity condition (it does not generate its own norms or goals), and, partially the interactional asymmetry condition (it is not the origin and sustained source of its interaction with the environment). If not agents, then ... what are LLMs? We argue that ChatGPT should be characterized as an interlocutor or linguistic automaton, a library-that-talks, devoid of (autonomous) agency, but capable to engage performatively on non-purposeful yet purpose-structured and purpose-bounded tasks. When interacting with humans, a ""ghostly"" component of the human-machine interaction makes it possible to enact genuine conversational experiences with LLMs. Despite their lack of sensorimotor and biological embodiment, LLMs textual embodiment (the training corpus) and resource-hungry computational embodiment, significantly transform existing forms of human agency. Beyond assisted and extended agency, the LLM-human coupling can produce midtended forms of agency, closer to the production of intentional agency than to the extended instrumentality of any previous technologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10735v2,2024-07
CLAVE: An Adaptive Framework for Evaluating Values of LLM Generated Responses,"Jing Yao, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xing Xie","The rapid progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) poses potential risks such as generating unethical content. Assessing LLMs' values can help expose their misalignment, but relies on reference-free evaluators, e.g., fine-tuned LLMs or close-source ones like GPT-4, to identify values reflected in generated responses. Nevertheless, these evaluators face two challenges in open-ended value evaluation: they should align with changing human value definitions with minimal annotation, against their own bias (adaptability), and detect varying value expressions and scenarios robustly (generalizability). To handle these challenges, we introduce CLAVE, a novel framework which integrates two complementary LLMs, a large one to extract high-level value concepts from a few human labels, leveraging its extensive knowledge and generalizability, and a smaller one fine-tuned on such concepts to better align with human value understanding. This dual-model approach enables calibration with any value systems using <100 human-labeled samples per value type. Then we present ValEval, a comprehensive dataset comprising 13k+ (text,value,label) tuples across diverse domains, covering three major value systems. We benchmark the capabilities of 12+ popular LLM evaluators and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. Our findings reveal that combining fine-tuned small models and prompt-based large ones serves as a superior balance in value evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10725v1,2024-07
Sibyl: Simple yet Effective Agent Framework for Complex Real-world Reasoning,"Yulong Wang, Tianhao Shen, Lifeng Liu, Jian Xie","Existing agents based on large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust problem-solving capabilities by integrating LLMs' inherent knowledge, strong in-context learning and zero-shot capabilities, and the use of tools combined with intricately designed LLM invocation workflows by humans. However, these agents still exhibit shortcomings in long-term reasoning and under-use the potential of existing tools, leading to noticeable deficiencies in complex real-world reasoning scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce Sibyl, a simple yet powerful LLM-based agent framework designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks by efficiently leveraging a minimal set of tools. Drawing inspiration from Global Workspace Theory, Sibyl incorporates a global workspace to enhance the management and sharing of knowledge and conversation history throughout the system. Furthermore, guided by Society of Mind Theory, Sibyl implements a multi-agent debate-based jury to self-refine the final answers, ensuring a comprehensive and balanced approach. This approach aims to reduce system complexity while expanding the scope of problems solvable-from matters typically resolved by humans in minutes to those requiring hours or even days, thus facilitating a shift from System-1 to System-2 thinking. Sibyl has been designed with a focus on scalability and ease of debugging by incorporating the concept of reentrancy from functional programming from its inception, with the aim of seamless and low effort integration in other LLM applications to improve capabilities. Our experimental results on the GAIA benchmark test set reveal that the Sibyl agent instantiated with GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average score of 34.55%, compared to other agents based on GPT-4. We hope that Sibyl can inspire more reliable and reusable LLM-based agent solutions to address complex real-world reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10718v2,2024-07
DOCBENCH: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Document Reading Systems,"Anni Zou, Wenhao Yu, Hongming Zhang, Kaixin Ma, Deng Cai, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao, Dong Yu","Recently, there has been a growing interest among large language model (LLM) developers in LLM-based document reading systems, which enable users to upload their own documents and pose questions related to the document contents, going beyond simple reading comprehension tasks. Consequently, these systems have been carefully designed to tackle challenges such as file parsing, metadata extraction, multi-modal information understanding and long-context reading. However, no current benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in such scenarios, where a raw file and questions are provided as input, and a corresponding response is expected as output. In this paper, we introduce DocBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based document reading systems. Our benchmark involves a meticulously crafted process, including the recruitment of human annotators and the generation of synthetic questions. It includes 229 real documents and 1,102 questions, spanning across five different domains and four major types of questions. We evaluate both proprietary LLM-based systems accessible via web interfaces or APIs, and a parse-then-read pipeline employing open-source LLMs. Our evaluations reveal noticeable gaps between existing LLM-based document reading systems and human performance, underscoring the challenges of developing proficient systems. To summarize, DocBench aims to establish a standardized benchmark for evaluating LLM-based document reading systems under diverse real-world scenarios, thereby guiding future advancements in this research area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10701v1,2024-07
$\texttt{MixGR}$: Enhancing Retriever Generalization for Scientific Domain through Complementary Granularity,"Fengyu Cai, Xinran Zhao, Tong Chen, Sihao Chen, Hongming Zhang, Iryna Gurevych, Heinz Koeppl","Recent studies show the growing significance of document retrieval in the generation of LLMs, i.e., RAG, within the scientific domain by bridging their knowledge gap. However, dense retrievers often struggle with domain-specific retrieval and complex query-document relationships, particularly when query segments correspond to various parts of a document. To alleviate such prevalent challenges, this paper introduces $\texttt{MixGR}$, which improves dense retrievers' awareness of query-document matching across various levels of granularity in queries and documents using a zero-shot approach. $\texttt{MixGR}$ fuses various metrics based on these granularities to a united score that reflects a comprehensive query-document similarity. Our experiments demonstrate that $\texttt{MixGR}$ outperforms previous document retrieval by 24.7%, 9.8%, and 6.9% on nDCG@5 with unsupervised, supervised, and LLM-based retrievers, respectively, averaged on queries containing multiple subqueries from five scientific retrieval datasets. Moreover, the efficacy of two downstream scientific question-answering tasks highlights the advantage of $\texttt{MixGR}$ to boost the application of LLMs in the scientific domain.

We release a comprehensive suite of foundational and instruction-tuned language models, encompassing a parameter range from 0.5 to 72 billion, featuring dense models and a Mixture-of-Experts model. Qwen2 surpasses most prior open-weight models, including its predecessor Qwen1.5, and exhibits competitive performance relative to proprietary models across diverse benchmarks on language understanding, generation, multilingual proficiency, coding, mathematics, and reasoning.

Enhancing Retrieval and Managing Retrieval: A Four-Module Synergy for Improved Quality and Efficiency in RAG Systems,"Yunxiao Shi, Xing Zi, Zijing Shi, Haimin Zhang, Qiang Wu, Min Xu","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques leverage the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to produce more accurate and relevant responses. Originating from the simple 'retrieve-then-read' approach, the RAG framework has evolved into a highly flexible and modular paradigm. A critical component, the Query Rewriter module, enhances knowledge retrieval by generating a search-friendly query. This method aligns input questions more closely with the knowledge base. Our research identifies opportunities to enhance the Query Rewriter module to Query Rewriter+ by generating multiple queries to overcome the Information Plateaus associated with a single query and by rewriting questions to eliminate Ambiguity, thereby clarifying the underlying intent. We also find that current RAG systems exhibit issues with Irrelevant Knowledge; to overcome this, we propose the Knowledge Filter. These two modules are both based on the instruction-tuned Gemma-2B model, which together enhance response quality. The final identified issue is Redundant Retrieval; we introduce the Memory Knowledge Reservoir and the Retriever Trigger to solve this. The former supports the dynamic expansion of the RAG system's knowledge base in a parameter-free manner, while the latter optimizes the cost for accessing external knowledge, thereby improving resource utilization and response efficiency. These four RAG modules synergistically improve the response quality and efficiency of the RAG system. The effectiveness of these modules has been validated through experiments and ablation studies across six common QA datasets.

An Empirical Study of Validating Synthetic Data for Formula Generation,"Usneek Singh, José Cambronero, Sumit Gulwani, Aditya Kanade, Anirudh Khatry, Vu Le, Mukul Singh, Gust Verbruggen","Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to help with writing formulas in spreadsheets, but resources on these formulas are scarce, impacting both the base performance of pre-trained models and limiting the ability to fine-tune them. Given a corpus of formulas, we can use a(nother) model to generate synthetic natural language utterances for fine-tuning. However, it is important to validate whether the NL generated by the LLM is indeed accurate to be beneficial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we provide empirical results on the impact of validating these synthetic training examples with surrogate objectives that evaluate the accuracy of the synthetic annotations. We demonstrate that validation improves performance over raw data across four models (2 open and 2 closed weight). Interestingly, we show that although validation tends to prune more challenging examples, it increases the complexity of problems that models can solve after being fine-tuned on validated data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10657v3,2024-07

Balancing the Scales: Reinforcement Learning for Fair Classification,"Leon Eshuijs, Shihan Wang, Antske Fokkens","Fairness in classification tasks has traditionally focused on bias removal from neural representations, but recent trends favor algorithmic methods that embed fairness into the training process. These methods steer models towards fair performance, preventing potential elimination of valuable information that arises from representation manipulation. Reinforcement Learning (RL), with its capacity for learning through interaction and adjusting reward functions to encourage desired behaviors, emerges as a promising tool in this domain. In this paper, we explore the usage of RL to address bias in imbalanced classification by scaling the reward function to mitigate bias. We employ the contextual multi-armed bandit framework and adapt three popular RL algorithms to suit our objectives, demonstrating a novel approach to mitigating bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10629v1,2024-07
Arena Learning: Build Data Flywheel for LLMs Post-training via Simulated Chatbot Arena,"Haipeng Luo, Qingfeng Sun, Can Xu, Pu Zhao, Qingwei Lin, Jianguang Lou, Shifeng Chen, Yansong Tang, Weizhu Chen","Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) presents substantial challenges. The method of conducting human-annotated battles in an online Chatbot Arena is a highly effective evaluative technique. However, this approach is limited by the costs and time required for human annotation. In this paper, we introduce Arena Learning, an innovative offline strategy designed to simulate these arena battles using AI-driven annotations to evaluate battle outcomes, thus facilitating the continuous improvement of the target model through both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Arena Learning comprises two key elements. First, it ensures precise evaluations and maintains consistency between offline simulations and online competitions via WizardArena, a pipeline developed to accurately predict the Elo rankings of various models using a meticulously designed offline test set. Our results demonstrate that WizardArena's predictions closely align with those from the online Arena. Second, it involves the continuous improvement of training data based on the battle results and the refined model. We establish a data flywheel to iteratively update the training data by highlighting the weaknesses of the target model based on its battle results, enabling it to learn from the strengths of multiple different models. We apply Arena Learning to train our target model, WizardLM-$\beta$, and demonstrate significant performance enhancements across various metrics. This fully automated training and evaluation pipeline sets the stage for continuous advancements in various LLMs via post-training. Notably, Arena Learning plays a pivotal role in the success of WizardLM-2, and this paper serves both as an exploration of its efficacy and a foundational study for future discussions related to WizardLM-2 and its derivatives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10627v1,2024-07
NoviCode: Generating Programs from Natural Language Utterances by Novices,"Asaf Achi Mordechai, Yoav Goldberg, Reut Tsarfaty","Current Text-to-Code models demonstrate impressive capabilities in generating executable code from natural language snippets. However, current studies focus on technical instructions and programmer-oriented language, and it is an open question whether these models can effectively translate natural language descriptions given by non-technical users and express complex goals, to an executable program that contains an intricate flow - composed of API access and control structures as loops, conditions, and sequences. To unlock the challenge of generating a complete program from a plain non-technical description we present NoviCode, a novel NL Programming task, which takes as input an API and a natural language description by a novice non-programmer and provides an executable program as output. To assess the efficacy of models on this task, we provide a novel benchmark accompanied by test suites wherein the generated program code is assessed not according to their form, but according to their functional execution. Our experiments show that, first, NoviCode is indeed a challenging task in the code synthesis domain, and that generating complex code from non-technical instructions goes beyond the current Text-to-Code paradigm. Second, we show that a novel approach wherein we align the NL utterances with the compositional hierarchical structure of the code, greatly enhances the performance of LLMs on this task, compared with the end-to-end Text-to-Code counterparts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10626v2,2024-07
Leave No Knowledge Behind During Knowledge Distillation: Towards Practical and Effective Knowledge Distillation for Code-Switching ASR Using Realistic Data,"Liang-Hsuan Tseng, Zih-Ching Chen, Wei-Shun Chang, Cheng-Kuang Lee, Tsung-Ren Huang, Hung-yi Lee","Recent advances in automatic speech recognition (ASR) often rely on large speech foundation models for generating high-quality transcriptions. However, these models can be impractical due to limited computing resources. The situation is even more severe in terms of more realistic or difficult scenarios, such as code-switching ASR (CS-ASR). To address this, we present a framework for developing more efficient models for CS-ASR through knowledge distillation using realistic speech-only data. Our proposed method, Leave No Knowledge Behind During Knowledge Distillation (K$^2$D), leverages both the teacher model's knowledge and additional insights from a small auxiliary model. We evaluate our approach on two in-domain and two out-domain datasets, demonstrating that K$^2$D is effective. By conducting K$^2$D on the unlabeled realistic data, we have successfully obtained a 2-time smaller model with 5-time faster generation speed while outperforming the baseline methods and the teacher model on all the testing sets.

MetaTool: Facilitating Large Language Models to Master Tools with Meta-task Augmentation,"Xiaohan Wang, Dian Li, Yilin Zhao, Sinbadliu, Hui Wang","Utilizing tools with Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for grounding AI agents in real-world applications. The prevailing approach involves few-shot prompting with demonstrations or fine-tuning with expert annotations. However, mere in-context demonstrations may fail to cover sufficient knowledge for complex tools and tasks. Training on solution paths is also hindered by the high cost of expert annotations and generalizing to new tools. A core challenge of generalizable tool use lies in understanding the ""meta"", or fundamental natures of tools that are transferable across tasks, such as causality and constraints. In this paper, we present MetaTool, a novel tool learning methodology designed to generalize across any reusable toolset. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised augmentation technique derived from a series of meta-tasks. This involves predicting masked elements in the tool execution process. The self-supervised procedure enables scalable generation of high-quality QA data, which is handy for supervising tool understanding. By incorporating meta-task data into task-oriented training, our method significantly enhances the performance of open-source LLMs, achieving results comparable to ChatGPT in both tool-based planning and chatting scenarios.

Boosting Zero-Shot Crosslingual Performance using LLM-Based Augmentations with Effective Data Selection,"Barah Fazili, Ashish Sunil Agrawal, Preethi Jyothi","Large language models (LLMs) are very proficient text generators. We leverage this capability of LLMs to generate task-specific data via zero-shot prompting and promote cross-lingual transfer for low-resource target languages. Given task-specific data in a source language and a teacher model trained on this data, we propose using this teacher to label LLM generations and employ a set of simple data selection strategies that use the teacher's label probabilities. Our data selection strategies help us identify a representative subset of diverse generations that help boost zero-shot accuracies while being efficient, in comparison to using all the LLM generations (without any subset selection). We also highlight other important design choices that affect cross-lingual performance such as the use of translations of source data and what labels are best to use for the LLM generations. We observe significant performance gains across sentiment analysis and natural language inference tasks (of up to a maximum of 7.13 absolute points and 1.5 absolute points on average) across a number of target languages (Hindi, Marathi, Urdu, Swahili) and domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10582v1,2024-07

Within the growing LLM family are the popular GPT-4, Bard and more specifically, tools such as ChatGPT have become a benchmark for other LLMs when solving most of the tasks involved in NLG research. This scenario poses new questions about the next steps for NLG and how the field can adapt and evolve to deal with new challenges in the era of LLMs. To address this, the present paper conducts a review of a representative sample of surveys recently published in NLG. By doing so, we aim to provide the scientific community with a research roadmap to identify which NLG aspects are still not suitably addressed by LLMs, as well as suggest future lines of research that should be addressed going forward.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10554v1,2024-07
TCM-FTP: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Herbal Prescription Prediction,"Xingzhi Zhou, Xin Dong, Chunhao Li, Yuning Bai, Yulong Xu, Ka Chun Cheung, Simon See, Xinpeng Song, Runshun Zhang, Xuezhong Zhou, Nevin L. Zhang","Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has relied on specific combinations of herbs in prescriptions to treat various symptoms and signs for thousands of years. Predicting TCM prescriptions poses a fascinating technical challenge with significant practical implications. However, this task faces limitations due to the scarcity of high-quality clinical datasets and the complex relationship between symptoms and herbs. To address these issues, we introduce \textit{DigestDS}, a novel dataset comprising practical medical records from experienced experts in digestive system diseases. We also propose a method, TCM-FTP (TCM Fine-Tuning Pre-trained), to leverage pre-trained large language models (LLMs) via supervised fine-tuning on \textit{DigestDS}. Additionally, we enhance computational efficiency using a low-rank adaptation technique. Moreover, TCM-FTP incorporates data augmentation by permuting herbs within prescriptions, exploiting their order-agnostic nature. Impressively, TCM-FTP achieves an F1-score of 0.8031, significantly outperforming previous methods. Furthermore, it demonstrates remarkable accuracy in dosage prediction, achieving a normalized mean square error of 0.0604. In contrast, LLMs without fine-tuning exhibit poor performance. Although LLMs have demonstrated wide-ranging capabilities, our work underscores the necessity of fine-tuning for TCM prescription prediction and presents an effective way to accomplish this.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10510v2,2024-07

Our evaluation framework includes an evaluation dataset and two evaluation modes. The evaluation dataset is constructed using an LLM-human cooperative approach and simulates an authentic workflow by leveraging consecutive and interactive IPython sessions.

Learning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning,"Yi Ren, Danica J. Sutherland","Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique ""squeezing effect"" to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10490v2,2024-07
How and where does CLIP process negation?,"Vincent Quantmeyer, Pablo Mosteiro, Albert Gatt","Various benchmarks have been proposed to test linguistic understanding in pre-trained vision \& language (VL) models. Here we build on the existence task from the VALSE benchmark (Parcalabescu et al, 2022) which we use to test models' understanding of negation, a particularly interesting issue for multimodal models. However, while such VL benchmarks are useful for measuring model performance, they do not reveal anything about the internal processes through which these models arrive at their outputs in such visio-linguistic tasks. We take inspiration from the growing literature on model interpretability to explain the behaviour of VL models on the understanding of negation. Specifically, we approach these questions through an in-depth analysis of the text encoder in CLIP (Radford et al, 2021), a highly influential VL model. We localise parts of the encoder that process negation and analyse the role of attention heads in this task. Our contributions are threefold. We demonstrate how methods from the language model interpretability literature (such as causal tracing) can be translated to multimodal models and tasks; we provide concrete insights into how CLIP processes negation on the VALSE existence task; and we highlight inherent limitations in the VALSE dataset as a benchmark for linguistic understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10488v1,2024-07
Building Intelligence Identification System via Large Language Model Watermarking: A Survey and Beyond,"Xuhong Wang, Haoyu Jiang, Yi Yu, Jingru Yu, Yilun Lin, Ping Yi, Yingchun Wang, Yu Qiao, Li Li, Fei-Yue Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into diverse industries, posing substantial security risks due to unauthorized replication and misuse. To mitigate these concerns, robust identification mechanisms are widely acknowledged as an effective strategy. Identification systems for LLMs now rely heavily on watermarking technology to manage and protect intellectual property and ensure data security. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on the basic principles of algorithms and lacked a comprehensive analysis of watermarking theory and practice from the perspective of intelligent identification. To bridge this gap, firstly, we explore how a robust identity recognition system can be effectively implemented and managed within LLMs by various participants using watermarking technology. Secondly, we propose a mathematical framework based on mutual information theory, which systematizes the identification process to achieve more precise and customized watermarking. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of performance metrics for LLM watermarking, reflecting participant preferences and advancing discussions on its identification applications. Lastly, we outline the existing challenges in current watermarking technologies and theoretical frameworks, and provide directional guidance to address these challenges. Our systematic classification and detailed exposition aim to enhance the comparison and evaluation of various methods, fostering further research and development toward a transparent, secure, and equitable LLM ecosystem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11100v3,2024-07
IDEAL: Leveraging Infinite and Dynamic Characterizations of Large Language Models for Query-focused Summarization,"Jie Cao, Dian Jiao, Qiang Yan, Wenqiao Zhang, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang","Query-focused summarization (QFS) aims to produce summaries that answer particular questions of interest, enabling greater user control and personalization. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), shows their impressive capability of textual understanding through large-scale pretraining, which implies the great potential of extractive snippet generation. In this paper, we systematically investigated two indispensable characteristics that the LLMs-based QFS models should be harnessed, Lengthy Document Summarization and Efficiently Fine-grained Query-LLM Alignment, respectively. Correspondingly, we propose two modules called Query-aware HyperExpert and Query-focused Infini-attention to access the aforementioned characteristics. These innovations pave the way for broader application and accessibility in the field of QFS technology. Extensive experiments conducted on existing QFS benchmarks indicate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed approach.

SuperPADL: Scaling Language-Directed Physics-Based Control with Progressive Supervised Distillation,"Jordan Juravsky, Yunrong Guo, Sanja Fidler, Xue Bin Peng","Physically-simulated models for human motion can generate high-quality responsive character animations, often in real-time. Natural language serves as a flexible interface for controlling these models, allowing expert and non-expert users to quickly create and edit their animations. Many recent physics-based animation methods, including those that use text interfaces, train control policies using reinforcement learning (RL). However, scaling these methods beyond several hundred motions has remained challenging. Meanwhile, kinematic animation models are able to successfully learn from thousands of diverse motions by leveraging supervised learning methods. Inspired by these successes, in this work we introduce SuperPADL, a scalable framework for physics-based text-to-motion that leverages both RL and supervised learning to train controllers on thousands of diverse motion clips. SuperPADL is trained in stages using progressive distillation, starting with a large number of specialized experts using RL. These experts are then iteratively distilled into larger, more robust policies using a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised learning. Our final SuperPADL controller is trained on a dataset containing over 5000 skills and runs in real time on a consumer GPU. Moreover, our policy can naturally transition between skills, allowing for users to interactively craft multi-stage animations. We experimentally demonstrate that SuperPADL significantly outperforms RL-based baselines at this large data scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10481v1,2024-07
"The Good, The Bad, and The Greedy: Evaluation of LLMs Should Not Ignore Non-Determinism","Yifan Song, Guoyin Wang, Sujian Li, Bill Yuchen Lin","Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often overlook non-determinism, typically focusing on a single output per example. This limits our understanding of LLM performance variability in real-world applications. Our study addresses this issue by exploring key questions about the performance differences between greedy decoding and sampling, identifying benchmarks' consistency regarding non-determinism, and examining unique model behaviors. Through extensive experiments, we observe that greedy decoding generally outperforms sampling methods for most evaluated tasks. We also observe consistent performance across different LLM sizes and alignment methods, noting that alignment can reduce sampling variance. Moreover, our best-of-N sampling approach demonstrates that smaller LLMs can match or surpass larger models such as GPT-4-Turbo, highlighting the untapped potential of smaller LLMs. This research shows the importance of considering non-determinism in LLM evaluations and provides insights for future LLM development and evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10457v1,2024-07
Don't Throw Away Data: Better Sequence Knowledge Distillation,"Jun Wang, Eleftheria Briakou, Hamid Dadkhahi, Rishabh Agarwal, Colin Cherry, Trevor Cohn","A critical component in knowledge distillation is the means of coupling the teacher and student. The predominant sequence knowledge distillation method involves supervised learning of the student against teacher-decoded outputs, and is exemplified by the current state of the art, which incorporates minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding. In this paper we seek to integrate MBR more tightly in distillation training, specifically by using several high scoring MBR translations, rather than a single selected sequence, thus capturing a rich diversity of teacher outputs. Our experiments on English to German and English to Japanese translation show consistent improvements over strong baseline methods for both tasks and with varying model sizes. Additionally, we conduct a detailed analysis focusing on data efficiency and capacity curse aspects to elucidate MBR-n and explore its further potential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10456v1,2024-07
Enhancing Medication Recommendation with LLM Text Representation,Yu-Tzu Lee,"Most of the existing medication recommendation models are predicted with only structured data such as medical codes, with the remaining other large amount of unstructured or semi-structured data underutilization. To increase the utilization effectively, we proposed a method of enhancing medication recommendation with Large Language Model (LLM) text representation. LLM harnesses powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, enabling the extraction of information from complex and lengthy unstructured data such as clinical notes which contain complex terminology. This method can be applied to several existing base models we selected and improve medication recommendation performance with the combination representation of text and medical codes experiments on two different datasets. LLM text representation alone can even demonstrate a comparable ability to the medical code representation alone. Overall, this is a general method that can be applied to other models for improved recommendations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10453v1,2024-07
Expanding the Scope: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Multi-Starting Progressive Propagation,"Zhoutian Shao, Yuanning Cui, Wei Hu","Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely acknowledged as incomplete, and new entities are constantly emerging in the real world. Inductive KG reasoning aims to predict missing facts for these new entities. Among existing models, graph neural networks (GNNs) based ones have shown promising performance for this task. However, they are still challenged by inefficient message propagation due to the distance and scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a new inductive KG reasoning model, MStar, by leveraging conditional message passing neural networks (C-MPNNs). Our key insight is to select multiple query-specific starting entities to expand the scope of progressive propagation. To propagate query-related messages to a farther area within limited steps, we subsequently design a highway layer to propagate information toward these selected starting entities. Moreover, we introduce a training strategy called LinkVerify to mitigate the impact of noisy training samples. Experimental results validate that MStar achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art models, especially for distant entities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10430v1,2024-07
Quantification and Validation for Degree of Understanding in M2M Semantic Communications,"Linhan Xia, Jiaxin Cai, Ricky Yuen-Tan Hou, Seon-Phil Jeong","With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, network communications based on the Shannon-Nyquist theorem gradually reveal their limitations due to the neglect of semantic information in the transmitted content. Semantic communication (SemCom) provides a solution for extracting information meanings from the transmitted content. The semantic information can be successfully interpreted by a receiver with the help of a shared knowledge base (KB). This paper proposes a two-stage hierarchical qualification and validation model for natural language-based machine-to-machine (M2M) SemCom. The approach can be applied in various applications, such as autonomous driving and edge computing. In the proposed model, we quantitatively measure the degree of understanding (DoU) between two communication parties at the word and sentence levels. The DoU is validated and ensured at each level before moving to the next step. The model's effectiveness is verified through a series of experiments, and the results show that the quantification and validation method proposed in this paper can significantly improve the DoU of inter-machine SemCom.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00767v1,2024-07
By My Eyes: Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Sensor Data via Visual Prompting,"Hyungjun Yoon, Biniyam Aschalew Tolera, Taesik Gong, Kimin Lee, Sung-Ju Lee","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities across various domains. However, utilizing LLMs for ubiquitous sensing applications remains challenging as existing text-prompt methods show significant performance degradation when handling long sensor data sequences. We propose a visual prompting approach for sensor data using multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We design a visual prompt that directs MLLMs to utilize visualized sensor data alongside the target sensory task descriptions. Additionally, we introduce a visualization generator that automates the creation of optimal visualizations tailored to a given sensory task, eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge. We evaluated our approach on nine sensory tasks involving four sensing modalities, achieving an average of 10% higher accuracy than text-based prompts and reducing token costs by 15.8 times. Our findings highlight the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of visual prompts with MLLMs for various sensory tasks.

NTSEBENCH: Cognitive Reasoning Benchmark for Vision Language Models,"Pranshu Pandya, Vatsal Gupta, Agney S Talwarr, Tushar Kataria, Dan Roth, Vivek Gupta","Cognitive textual and visual reasoning tasks, including puzzles, series, and analogies, demand the ability to quickly reason, decipher, and evaluate patterns both textually and spatially. Due to extensive training on vast amounts of human-curated data, LLMs and VLMs excel in common-sense reasoning tasks, however still struggle with more complex reasoning that demands deeper cognitive understanding. We introduce NTSEBench, a new dataset designed to evaluate cognitive multi-modal reasoning and problem-solving skills of large models. The dataset contains 2728 multiple-choice questions, accompanied by a total of 4,642 images, categorized into 26 different types. These questions are drawn from the nationwide NTSE examination in India and feature a mix of visual and textual general aptitude challenges, designed to assess intelligence and critical thinking skills beyond mere rote learning. We establish baselines on the dataset using state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs. To facilitate a comparison between open source and propriety models, we propose four distinct modeling strategies to handle different modalities -- text and images -- in the dataset instances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10380v2,2024-07
Large Language Model-based FMRI Encoding of Language Functions for Subjects with Neurocognitive Disorder,"Yuejiao Wang, Xianmin Gong, Lingwei Meng, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for developing encoding models that identify functional changes in language-related brain areas of individuals with Neurocognitive Disorders (NCD). While large language model (LLM)-based fMRI encoding has shown promise, existing studies predominantly focus on healthy, young adults, overlooking older NCD populations and cognitive level correlations. This paper explores language-related functional changes in older NCD adults using LLM-based fMRI encoding and brain scores, addressing current limitations. We analyze the correlation between brain scores and cognitive scores at both whole-brain and language-related ROI levels. Our findings reveal that higher cognitive abilities correspond to better brain scores, with correlations peaking in the middle temporal gyrus. This study highlights the potential of fMRI encoding models and brain scores for detecting early functional changes in NCD patients.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10376v1,2024-07
Comparing Complex Concepts with Transformers: Matching Patent Claims Against Natural Language Text,"Matthias Blume, Ghobad Heidari, Christoph Hewel","A key capability in managing patent applications or a patent portfolio is comparing claims to other text, e.g. a patent specification. Because the language of claims is different from language used elsewhere in the patent application or in non-patent text, this has been challenging for computer based natural language processing. We test two new LLM-based approaches and find that both provide substantially better performance than previously published values. The ability to match dense information from one domain against much more distributed information expressed in a different vocabulary may also be useful beyond the intellectual property space.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10351v1,2024-07
Enhancing Long-Range Dependency with State Space Model and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Adamu Lawan, Juhua Pu, Haruna Yunusa, Aliyu Umar, Muhammad Lawan","Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) evaluates sentiments toward specific aspects of entities within the text. However, attention mechanisms and neural network models struggle with syntactic constraints. The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms also limits their adoption for capturing long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA. This complexity can lead to the misinterpretation of irrelevant contextual words, restricting their effectiveness to short-range dependencies. To address the above problem, we present a novel approach to enhance long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA (MambaForGCN). This approach incorporates syntax-based Graph Convolutional Network (SynGCN) and MambaFormer (Mamba-Transformer) modules to encode input with dependency relations and semantic information. The Multihead Attention (MHA) and Selective State Space model (Mamba) blocks in the MambaFormer module serve as channels to enhance the model with short and long-range dependencies between aspect and opinion words. We also introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) gated fusion, an adaptive feature representation system that integrates SynGCN and MambaFormer and captures non-linear, complex dependencies. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate MambaForGCN's effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10347v3,2024-07
Improving Neural Biasing for Contextual Speech Recognition by Early Context Injection and Text Perturbation,"Ruizhe Huang, Mahsa Yarmohammadi, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Daniel Povey","Existing research suggests that automatic speech recognition (ASR) models can benefit from additional contexts (e.g., contact lists, user specified vocabulary). Rare words and named entities can be better recognized with contexts. In this work, we propose two simple yet effective techniques to improve context-aware ASR models. First, we inject contexts into the encoders at an early stage instead of merely at their last layers. Second, to enforce the model to leverage the contexts during training, we perturb the reference transcription with alternative spellings so that the model learns to rely on the contexts to make correct predictions. On LibriSpeech, our techniques together reduce the rare word error rate by 60% and 25% relatively compared to no biasing and shallow fusion, making the new state-of-the-art performance. On SPGISpeech and a real-world dataset ConEC, our techniques also yield good improvements over the baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10303v1,2024-07

"Cross-Lingual Multi-Hop Knowledge Editing -- Benchmarks, Analysis and a Simple Contrastive Learning based Approach","Aditi Khandelwal, Harman Singh, Hengrui Gu, Tianlong Chen, Kaixiong Zhou","Large language models are often expected to constantly adapt to new sources of knowledge and knowledge editing techniques aim to efficiently patch the outdated model knowledge, with minimal modification. Most prior works focus on monolingual knowledge editing in English, even though new information can emerge in any language from any part of the world. We propose the Cross-Lingual Multi-Hop Knowledge Editing paradigm, for measuring and analyzing the performance of various SoTA knowledge editing techniques in a cross-lingual setup. Specifically, we create a parallel cross-lingual benchmark, CROLIN-MQUAKE for measuring the knowledge editing capabilities. Our extensive analysis over various knowledge editing techniques uncover significant gaps in performance between the cross-lingual and English-centric setting. Following this, we propose a significantly improved system for cross-lingual multi-hop knowledge editing, CLEVER-CKE. CLEVER-CKE is based on a retrieve, verify and generate knowledge editing framework, where a retriever is formulated to recall edited facts and support an LLM to adhere to knowledge edits. We develop language-aware and hard-negative based contrastive objectives for improving the cross-lingual and fine-grained fact retrieval and verification process used in this framework. Extensive experiments on three LLMs, eight languages, and two datasets show CLEVER-CKE's significant gains of up to 30% over prior methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10275v1,2024-07
psifx -- Psychological and Social Interactions Feature Extraction Package,"Guillaume Rochette, Matthew J. Vowels, Mathieu Rochat","psifx is a plug-and-play multi-modal feature extraction toolkit, aiming to facilitate and democratize the use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for human sciences research.

What Makes and Breaks Safety Fine-tuning? A Mechanistic Study,"Samyak Jain, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Kemal Oksuz, Tom Joy, Philip H. S. Torr, Amartya Sanyal, Puneet K. Dokania","Safety fine-tuning helps align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences for their safe deployment. To better understand the underlying factors that make models safe via safety fine-tuning, we design a synthetic data generation framework that captures salient aspects of an unsafe input by modeling the interaction between the task the model is asked to perform (e.g., ""design"") versus the specific concepts the task is asked to be performed upon (e.g., a ""cycle"" vs. a ""bomb""). Using this, we investigate three well-known safety fine-tuning methods -- supervised safety fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and unlearning -- and provide significant evidence demonstrating that these methods minimally transform MLP weights to specifically align unsafe inputs into its weights' null space. This yields a clustering of inputs based on whether the model deems them safe or not. Correspondingly, when an adversarial input (e.g., a jailbreak) is provided, its activations are closer to safer samples, leading to the model processing such an input as if it were safe. We validate our findings, wherever possible, on real-world models -- specifically, Llama-2 7B and Llama-3 8B.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10264v3,2024-07

We fine-tuned the sentiment-based Transformer model 'MarieAngeA13/Sentiment-Analysis-BERT' on our dataset.

GenSco: Can Question Decomposition based Passage Alignment improve Question Answering?,"Barah Fazili, Koustava Goswami, Natwar Modani, Inderjeet Nair","Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) for Question Answering (QA) entails furnishing relevant context within the prompt to facilitate the LLM in answer generation. During the generation, inaccuracies or hallucinations frequently occur due to two primary factors: inadequate or distracting context in the prompts, and the inability of LLMs to effectively reason through the facts. In this paper, we investigate whether providing aligned context via a carefully selected passage sequence leads to better answer generation by the LLM for multi-hop QA. We introduce, ""GenSco"", a novel approach of selecting passages based on the predicted decomposition of the multi-hop questions}. The framework consists of two distinct LLMs: (i) Generator LLM, which is used for question decomposition and final answer generation; (ii) an auxiliary open-sourced LLM, used as the scorer, to semantically guide the Generator for passage selection. The generator is invoked only once for the answer generation, resulting in a cost-effective and efficient approach. We evaluate on three broadly established multi-hop question answering datasets: 2WikiMultiHop, Adversarial HotPotQA and MuSiQue and achieve an absolute gain of $15.1$ and $5.9$ points in Exact Match score with respect to the best performing baselines over MuSiQue and 2WikiMultiHop respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10245v1,2024-07

Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiasAlert significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods like GPT4-as-A-Judge in detecting bias. Furthermore, through application studies, we demonstrate the utility of BiasAlert in reliable LLM bias evaluation and bias mitigation across various scenarios.

Key-Point-Driven Mathematical Reasoning Distillation of Large Language Model,"Xunyu Zhu, Jian Li, Can Ma, Weiping Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in mathematical reasoning tasks due to their extensive parameter counts and training on vast datasets. Despite these capabilities, deploying LLMs is hindered by their computational demands. Distilling LLM mathematical reasoning into Smaller Language Models (SLMs) has emerged as a solution to this challenge, although these smaller models often suffer from errors in calculation and semantic understanding. Prior work has proposed Program-of-Thought Distillation (PoTD) to avoid calculation error. To further address semantic understanding errors, we propose Key-Point-Driven Mathematical Reasoning Distillation (KPDD). KPDD enhances the reasoning performance of SLMs by breaking down the problem-solving process into three stages: Core Question Extraction, Problem-Solving Information Extraction, and Step-by-Step Solution. This method is further divided into KPDD-CoT, which generates Chain-of-Thought rationales, and KPDD-PoT, which creates Program-of-Thought rationales. The experiment results show that KPDD-CoT significantly improves reasoning abilities, while KPDD-PoT achieves state-of-the-art performance in mathematical reasoning tasks.

"Look Within, Why LLMs Hallucinate: A Causal Perspective","He Li, Haoang Chi, Mingyu Liu, Wenjing Yang","The emergence of large language models (LLMs) is a milestone in generative artificial intelligence, achieving significant success in text comprehension and generation tasks. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs in many downstream tasks, they suffer from severe hallucination problems, posing significant challenges to the practical applications of LLMs. Most of the works about LLMs' hallucinations focus on data quality. Self-attention is a core module in transformer-based LLMs, while its potential relationship with LLMs' hallucination has been hardly investigated. To fill this gap, we study this problem from a causal perspective. We propose a method to intervene in LLMs' self-attention layers and maintain their structures and sizes intact. Specifically, we disable different self-attention layers in several popular open-source LLMs and then compare their degrees of hallucination with the original ones. We evaluate the intervened LLMs on hallucination assessment benchmarks and conclude that disabling some specific self-attention layers in the front or tail of the LLMs can alleviate hallucination issues. The study paves a new way for understanding and mitigating LLMs' hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10153v1,2024-07

TokenSHAP leverages Monte Carlo sampling for computational efficiency, providing interpretable, quantitative measures of token importance. We demonstrate its efficacy across diverse prompts and LLM architectures, showing consistent improvements over existing baselines in alignment with human judgments, faithfulness to model behavior, and consistency.   Our method's ability to capture nuanced interactions between tokens provides valuable insights into LLM behavior, enhancing model transparency, improving prompt engineering, and aiding in the development of more reliable AI systems.

Enhancing Emotion Prediction in News Headlines: Insights from ChatGPT and Seq2Seq Models for Free-Text Generation,"Ge Gao, Jongin Kim, Sejin Paik, Ekaterina Novozhilova, Yi Liu, Sarah T. Bonna, Margrit Betke, Derry Tanti Wijaya","Predicting emotions elicited by news headlines can be challenging as the task is largely influenced by the varying nature of people's interpretations and backgrounds. Previous works have explored classifying discrete emotions directly from news headlines. We provide a different approach to tackling this problem by utilizing people's explanations of their emotion, written in free-text, on how they feel after reading a news headline. Using the dataset BU-NEmo+ (Gao et al., 2022), we found that for emotion classification, the free-text explanations have a strong correlation with the dominant emotion elicited by the headlines. The free-text explanations also contain more sentimental context than the news headlines alone and can serve as a better input to emotion classification models. Therefore, in this work we explored generating emotion explanations from headlines by training a sequence-to-sequence transformer model and by using pretrained large language model, ChatGPT (GPT-4). We then used the generated emotion explanations for emotion classification. In addition, we also experimented with training the pretrained T5 model for the intermediate task of explanation generation before fine-tuning it for emotion classification. Using McNemar's significance test, methods that incorporate GPT-generated free-text emotion explanations demonstrated significant improvement (P-value < 0.05) in emotion classification from headlines, compared to methods that only use headlines. This underscores the value of using intermediate free-text explanations for emotion prediction tasks with headlines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10091v1,2024-07

Our approach builds on human-annotated projects, which are allocated one or more categories from a predefined list. A large language model is then used to generate `rationales' explaining the reasoning behind these annotations. This augmented data, comprising expert annotations and rationales, is subsequently used to fine-tune a smaller, more efficient model. Developed as part of the Pandemic PACT project, which aims to track and analyse research funding and clinical evidence for a wide range of diseases with outbreak potential, PPACE supports informed decision-making by research funders, policymakers, and independent researchers. We introduce and release both the trained model and the instruction-based dataset used for its training. Our evaluation shows that PPACE significantly outperforms its baselines. The release of PPACE and its associated dataset offers valuable resources for researchers in multilabel biomedical document classification and supports advancements in aligning biomedical research with key global health priorities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10086v2,2024-07
Multi-Granularity Semantic Revision for Large Language Model Distillation,"Xiaoyu Liu, Yun Zhang, Wei Li, Simiao Li, Xudong Huang, Hanting Chen, Yehui Tang, Jie Hu, Zhiwei Xiong, Yunhe Wang","Knowledge distillation plays a key role in compressing the Large Language Models (LLMs), which boosts a small-size student model under large teacher models' guidance. However, existing LLM distillation methods overly rely on student-generated outputs, which may introduce generation errors and misguide the distillation process. Moreover, the distillation loss functions introduced in previous art struggle to align the most informative part due to the complex distribution of LLMs' outputs. To address these problems, we propose a multi-granularity semantic revision method for LLM distillation. At the sequence level, we propose a sequence correction and re-generation (SCRG) strategy. SCRG first calculates the semantic cognitive difference between the teacher and student to detect the error token, then corrects it with the teacher-generated one, and re-generates the sequence to reduce generation errors and enhance generation diversity. At the token level, we design a distribution adaptive clipping Kullback-Leibler (DAC-KL) loss as the distillation objective function. DAC-KL loss exploits a learnable sub-network to adaptively extract semantically dense areas from the teacher's output, avoiding the interference of redundant information in the distillation process. Finally, at the span level, we leverage the span priors of a sequence to compute the probability correlations within spans, and constrain the teacher and student's probability correlations to be consistent, further enhancing the transfer of semantic information. Extensive experiments across different model families with parameters ranging from 0.1B to 13B demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10068v1,2024-07
Learning to Refuse: Towards Mitigating Privacy Risks in LLMs,"Zhenhua Liu, Tong Zhu, Chuanyuan Tan, Wenliang Chen","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating natural language. However, these models can inadvertently memorize private information, posing significant privacy risks. This study addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to protect specific individuals' private data without the need for complete retraining. We propose \return, a Real-world pErsonal daTa UnleaRNing dataset, comprising 2,492 individuals from Wikipedia with associated QA pairs, to evaluate machine unlearning (MU) methods for protecting personal data in a realistic scenario. Additionally, we introduce the Name-Aware Unlearning Framework (NAUF) for Privacy Protection, which enables the model to learn which individuals' information should be protected without affecting its ability to answer questions related to other unrelated individuals. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NAUF achieves a state-of-the-art average unlearning score, surpassing the best baseline method by 5.65 points, effectively protecting target individuals' personal data while maintaining the model's general capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10058v2,2024-07
AutoGRAMS: Autonomous Graphical Agent Modeling Software,"Ben Krause, Lucia Chen, Emmanuel Kahembwe","We introduce the AutoGRAMS framework for programming multi-step interactions with language models. AutoGRAMS represents AI agents as a graph, where each node can execute either a language modeling instruction or traditional code. Likewise, transitions in the graph can be governed by either language modeling decisions or traditional branch logic. AutoGRAMS supports using variables as memory and allows nodes to call other AutoGRAMS graphs as functions. We show how AutoGRAMS can be used to design highly sophisticated agents, including self-referential agents that can modify their own graph. AutoGRAMS's graph-centric approach aids interpretability, controllability, and safety during the design, development, and deployment of AI agents.

Document-level Clinical Entity and Relation Extraction via Knowledge Base-Guided Generation,"Kriti Bhattarai, Inez Y. Oh, Zachary B. Abrams, Albert M. Lai","Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models have shown promise in clinical entity and relation extraction tasks because of their precise extraction and contextual understanding capability. In this work, we further leverage the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge base to accurately identify medical concepts and improve clinical entity and relation extraction at the document level. Our framework selects UMLS concepts relevant to the text and combines them with prompts to guide language models in extracting entities. Our experiments demonstrate that this initial concept mapping and the inclusion of these mapped concepts in the prompts improves extraction results compared to few-shot extraction tasks on generic language models that do not leverage UMLS. Further, our results show that this approach is more effective than the standard Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, where retrieved data is compared with prompt embeddings to generate results. Overall, we find that integrating UMLS concepts with GPT models significantly improves entity and relation identification, outperforming the baseline and RAG models. By combining the precise concept mapping capability of knowledge-based approaches like UMLS with the contextual understanding capability of GPT, our method highlights the potential of these approaches in specialized domains like healthcare.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10021v1,2024-07

"Fine-grained Analysis of In-context Linear Estimation: Data, Architecture, and Beyond","Yingcong Li, Ankit Singh Rawat, Samet Oymak","Recent research has shown that Transformers with linear attention are capable of in-context learning (ICL) by implementing a linear estimator through gradient descent steps. However, the existing results on the optimization landscape apply under stylized settings where task and feature vectors are assumed to be IID and the attention weights are fully parameterized. In this work, we develop a stronger characterization of the optimization and generalization landscape of ICL through contributions on architectures, low-rank parameterization, and correlated designs: (1) We study the landscape of 1-layer linear attention and 1-layer H3, a state-space model. Under a suitable correlated design assumption, we prove that both implement 1-step preconditioned gradient descent. We show that thanks to its native convolution filters, H3 also has the advantage of implementing sample weighting and outperforming linear attention in suitable settings. (2) By studying correlated designs, we provide new risk bounds for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and task-feature alignment which reveal how ICL sample complexity benefits from distributional alignment. (3) We derive the optimal risk for low-rank parameterized attention weights in terms of covariance spectrum. Through this, we also shed light on how LoRA can adapt to a new distribution by capturing the shift between task covariances. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings. Overall, this work explores the optimization and risk landscape of ICL in practically meaningful settings and contributes to a more thorough understanding of its mechanics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10005v1,2024-07

By continually pre-training on a mix of Arabic and English corpora, the model retains its proficiency in English while acquiring capabilities in Arabic. Our approach results in significant improvements in Arabic and slight enhancements in English, demonstrating cost-effective cross-lingual transfer.

However, deploying these detectors in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices poses challenges due to their large sizes. In this work, we aim to address this issue by exploring techniques to minimize the size of PLM-based intent detectors trained with few-shot data. Specifically, we utilize large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation, employ a cutting-edge model compression method for knowledge distillation, and devise a vocabulary pruning mechanism called V-Prune. Through these approaches, we successfully achieve a compression ratio of 21 in model memory usage, including both Transformer and the vocabulary, while maintaining almost identical performance levels on four real-world benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09943v2,2024-07

Cohesive Conversations: Enhancing Authenticity in Multi-Agent Simulated Dialogues,"KuanChao Chu, Yi-Pei Chen, Hideki Nakayama","This paper investigates the quality of multi-agent dialogues in simulations powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Analyzing dialogues and memory over multiple sessions revealed significant issues such as repetition, inconsistency, and hallucination, exacerbated by the propagation of erroneous information. To combat these challenges, we propose a novel Screening, Diagnosis, and Regeneration (SDR) framework that detects and corrects utterance errors through a comprehensive process involving immediate issue identification, evidence gathering from past dialogues, and LLM analysis for utterance revision.

An Autonomous GIS Agent Framework for Geospatial Data Retrieval,"Huan Ning, Zhenlong Li, Temitope Akinboyewa, M. Naser Lessani","Powered by the emerging large language models (LLMs), autonomous geographic information systems (GIS) agents have the potential to accomplish spatial analyses and cartographic tasks. However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of retrieving required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. The framework utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add new data sources by adding new handbooks. We developed a prototype agent based on the framework, released as a QGIS plugin (GeoData Retrieve Agent) and a Python program. Experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving data from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries and demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI World Imagery, global digital elevation model (DEM) from OpenTopography.org, weather data from a commercial provider, the COVID-19 cases from the NYTimes GitHub.

Transferring Structure Knowledge: A New Task to Fake news Detection Towards Cold-Start Propagation,"Lingwei Wei, Dou Hu, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu","Many fake news detection studies have achieved promising performance by extracting effective semantic and structure features from both content and propagation trees. However, it is challenging to apply them to practical situations, especially when using the trained propagation-based models to detect news with no propagation data. Towards this scenario, we study a new task named cold-start fake news detection, which aims to detect content-only samples with missing propagation. To achieve the task, we design a simple but effective Structure Adversarial Net (SAN) framework to learn transferable features from available propagation to boost the detection of content-only samples. SAN introduces a structure discriminator to estimate dissimilarities among learned features with and without propagation, and further learns structure-invariant features to enhance the generalization of existing propagation-based methods for content-only samples. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on three datasets. Results show the challenge of the new task and the effectiveness of our SAN framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09894v1,2024-07
Synergistic Multi-Agent Framework with Trajectory Learning for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks,"Shengbin Yue, Siyuan Wang, Wei Chen, Xuanjing Huang, Zhongyu Wei","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in various natural language processing tasks.

Using entity linking and semantic similarity, we offer a way for collecting and combining information from diverse sources in order to generate evidence relevant to the user's claim. Then, we leverage textual entailment recognition to quantitatively determine whether this assertion is credible, based on the created evidence.

In order to address this, we introduce a novel recipe for creating a multilingual synthetic instruction tuning dataset, sPhinX, which is created by selectively translating instruction response pairs from English into 50 languages. We test the effectiveness of sPhinx by using it to fine-tune two state-of-the-art models, Mistral-7B and Phi-Small and then evaluating them across a comprehensive suite of multilingual benchmarks that test reasoning, question answering, reading comprehension and machine translation. Our results show that Mistral-7B and Phi-Small fine-tuned with sPhinX perform better on an average by 5%pt for both the models when compared to the base variants of these models. We also devise a strategy to incorporate N-shot examples in each fine-tuning sample which further boosts the performance of these models by 9%pt and 4%pt respectively respectively compared to vanilla fine-tuning. To show efficacy of our data curation approach, we also directly translate our original dataset to the target languages, and observe an increase of 7%pt and 4%pt on both the models respectively. sPhinX outperforms other multilingual instruction tuning datasets in both efficiency and diversity, reducing dataset creation costs.

Towards Systematic Monolingual NLP Surveys: GenA of Greek NLP,"Juli Bakagianni, Kanella Pouli, Maria Gavriilidou, John Pavlopoulos","Natural Language Processing (NLP) research has traditionally been predominantly focused on English, driven by the availability of resources, the size of the research community, and market demands. Recently, there has been a noticeable shift towards multilingualism in NLP, recognizing the need for inclusivity and effectiveness across diverse languages and cultures. Monolingual surveys have the potential to complement the broader trend towards multilingualism in NLP by providing foundational insights and resources necessary for effectively addressing the linguistic diversity of global communication. However, monolingual NLP surveys are extremely rare in literature. This study fills the gap by introducing a method for creating systematic and comprehensive monolingual NLP surveys. Characterized by a structured search protocol, it can be used to select publications and organize them through a taxonomy of NLP tasks. We include a classification of Language Resources (LRs), according to their availability, and datasets, according to their annotation, to highlight publicly-available and machine-actionable LRs. By applying our method, we conducted a systematic literature review of Greek NLP from 2012 to 2022, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state and challenges of Greek NLP research. We discuss the progress of Greek NLP and outline encountered Greek LRs, classified by availability and usability. As we show, our proposed method helps avoid common pitfalls, such as data leakage and contamination, and to assess language support per NLP task.

The task of finding hold scripts in dialogue was formulated as a multiclass text classification problem with three mutually exclusive classes: scripts for putting a client on hold, scripts for returning to a client, and phrases irrelevant to on-hold scripts. We collected an in-house dataset of calls and labeled each dialogue turn in each call. We fine-tuned RuBERT on the dataset by exploring various hyperparameter sets and achieved high model performance.

MaskMoE: Boosting Token-Level Learning via Routing Mask in Mixture-of-Experts,"Zhenpeng Su, Zijia Lin, Xue Bai, Xing Wu, Yizhe Xiong, Haoran Lian, Guangyuan Ma, Hui Chen, Guiguang Ding, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu","Scaling the size of a model enhances its capabilities but significantly increases computation complexity. Mixture-of-Experts models (MoE) address the issue by allowing model size to scale up without substantially increasing training or inference costs. In MoE, there is an important module called the router, which is used to distribute each token to the experts. Currently, the mainstream routing methods include dynamic routing and fixed routing. Despite their promising results, MoE models encounter several challenges. Primarily, for dynamic routing methods, the dispersion of training tokens across multiple experts can lead to underfitting, particularly for infrequent tokens. Additionally, though fixed routing methods can mitigate that issue, they compromise on the diversity of representations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MaskMoE}, a method designed to enhance token-level learning by employing a routing \textbf{mask}ing technique within the \textbf{M}ixture-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{E}xperts model.

Beyond KV Caching: Shared Attention for Efficient LLMs,"Bingli Liao, Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas","The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, particularly in contexts where computational resources are limited. Traditional attention mechanisms in these models, while powerful, require significant computational and memory resources due to the necessity of recalculating and storing attention weights across different layers. This paper introduces a novel Shared Attention (SA) mechanism, designed to enhance the efficiency of LLMs by directly sharing computed attention weights across multiple layers. Unlike previous methods that focus on sharing intermediate Key-Value (KV) caches, our approach utilizes the isotropic tendencies of attention distributions observed in advanced LLMs post-pretraining to reduce both the computational flops and the size of the KV cache required during inference. We empirically demonstrate that implementing SA across various LLMs results in minimal accuracy loss on standard benchmarks. Our findings suggest that SA not only conserves computational resources but also maintains robust model performance, thereby facilitating the deployment of more efficient LLMs in resource-constrained environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12866v1,2024-07
LLM-Collaboration on Automatic Science Journalism for the General Audience,"Gongyao Jiang, Xinran Shi, Qiong Luo","Science journalism reports current scientific discoveries to non-specialists, aiming to enable public comprehension of the state of the art. However, this task can be challenging as the audience often lacks specific knowledge about the presented research. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that integrates three LLMs mimicking the real-world writing-reading-feedback-revision workflow, with one LLM acting as the journalist, a smaller LLM as the general public reader, and the third LLM as an editor. The journalist's writing is iteratively refined by feedback from the reader and suggestions from the editor. Our experiments demonstrate that by leveraging the collaboration of two 7B and one 1.8B open-source LLMs, we can generate articles that are more accessible than those generated by existing methods, including advanced models such as GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09756v1,2024-07
On Mitigating Code LLM Hallucinations with API Documentation,"Nihal Jain, Robert Kwiatkowski, Baishakhi Ray, Murali Krishna Ramanathan, Varun Kumar","In this study, we address the issue of API hallucinations in various software engineering contexts. We introduce CloudAPIBench, a new benchmark designed to measure API hallucination occurrences. CloudAPIBench also provides annotations for frequencies of API occurrences in the public domain, allowing us to study API hallucinations at various frequency levels. Our findings reveal that Code LLMs struggle with low frequency APIs: for e.g., GPT-4o achieves only 38.58% valid low frequency API invocations. We demonstrate that Documentation Augmented Generation (DAG) significantly improves performance for low frequency APIs (increase to 47.94% with DAG) but negatively impacts high frequency APIs when using sub-optimal retrievers (a 39.02% absolute drop). To mitigate this, we propose to intelligently trigger DAG where we check against an API index or leverage Code LLMs' confidence scores to retrieve only when needed. We demonstrate that our proposed methods enhance the balance between low and high frequency API performance, resulting in more reliable API invocations (8.20% absolute improvement on CloudAPIBench for GPT-4o).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09726v1,2024-07
Optimized Multi-Token Joint Decoding with Auxiliary Model for LLM Inference,"Zongyue Qin, Ziniu Hu, Zifan He, Neha Prakriya, Jason Cong, Yizhou Sun","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, yet their inference processes are hindered by substantial time and energy demands due to single-token generation at each decoding step. While previous methods such as speculative decoding mitigate these inefficiencies by producing multiple tokens per step, each token is still generated by its single-token distribution, thereby enhancing speed without improving effectiveness. In contrast, our work simultaneously enhances inference speed and improves the output effectiveness. We consider multi-token joint decoding (MTJD), which generates multiple tokens from their joint distribution at each iteration, theoretically reducing perplexity and enhancing task performance. However, MTJD suffers from the high cost of sampling from the joint distribution of multiple tokens. Inspired by speculative decoding, we introduce multi-token assisted decoding (MTAD), a novel framework designed to accelerate MTJD. MTAD leverages a smaller auxiliary model to approximate the joint distribution of a larger model, incorporating a verification mechanism that not only ensures the accuracy of this approximation, but also improves the decoding efficiency over conventional speculative decoding. Theoretically, we demonstrate that MTAD closely approximates exact MTJD with bounded error. Empirical evaluations using Llama-2 and OPT models ranging from 13B to 70B parameters across various tasks reveal that MTAD reduces perplexity by 21.2% and improves downstream performance compared to standard single-token sampling. Furthermore, MTAD achieves a 1.42x speed-up and consumes 1.54x less energy than conventional speculative decoding methods. These results highlight MTAD's ability to make multi-token joint decoding both effective and efficient, promoting more sustainable and high-performance deployment of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09722v2,2024-07
GOFA: A Generative One-For-All Model for Joint Graph Language Modeling,"Lecheng Kong, Jiarui Feng, Hao Liu, Chengsong Huang, Jiaxin Huang, Yixin Chen, Muhan Zhang","Foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Models (LVMs), have emerged as one of the most powerful tools in the respective fields. However, unlike text and image data, graph data do not have a definitive structure, posing great challenges to developing a Graph Foundation Model (GFM). For example, current attempts at designing general graph models either transform graph data into a language format for LLM-based prediction or still train a GNN model with LLM as an assistant. The former can handle unlimited tasks, while the latter captures graph structure much better -- yet, no existing work can achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we identify three key desirable properties of a GFM: self-supervised pretraining, fluidity in tasks, and graph awareness. To account for these properties, we extend the conventional language modeling to the graph domain and propose a novel generative graph language model GOFA to solve the problem. The model interleaves randomly initialized GNN layers into a frozen pre-trained LLM so that the semantic and structural modeling abilities are organically combined. GOFA is pre-trained on newly proposed graph-level next-word prediction, question-answering, and structural tasks to obtain the above GFM properties. The pre-trained model is further fine-tuned on downstream tasks to obtain task-solving ability. The fine-tuned model is evaluated on various downstream tasks, demonstrating a strong ability to solve structural and contextual problems in zero-shot scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/JiaruiFeng/GOFA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09709v1,2024-07
What an Elegant Bridge: Multilingual LLMs are Biased Similarly in Different Languages,"Viktor Mihaylov, Aleksandar Shtedritski","This paper investigates biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the lens of grammatical gender. Drawing inspiration from seminal works in psycholinguistics, particularly the study of gender's influence on language perception, we leverage multilingual LLMs to revisit and expand upon the foundational experiments of Boroditsky (2003). Employing LLMs as a novel method for examining psycholinguistic biases related to grammatical gender, we prompt a model to describe nouns with adjectives in various languages, focusing specifically on languages with grammatical gender. In particular, we look at adjective co-occurrences across gender and languages, and train a binary classifier to predict grammatical gender given adjectives an LLM uses to describe a noun. Surprisingly, we find that a simple classifier can not only predict noun gender above chance but also exhibit cross-language transferability. We show that while LLMs may describe words differently in different languages, they are biased similarly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09704v1,2024-07
Large Language Models for Integrating Social Determinant of Health Data: A Case Study on Heart Failure 30-Day Readmission Prediction,"Chase Fensore, Rodrigo M. Carrillo-Larco, Shivani A. Patel, Alanna A. Morris, Joyce C. Ho","Social determinants of health (SDOH) $-$ the myriad of circumstances in which people live, grow, and age $-$ play an important role in health outcomes. However, existing outcome prediction models often only use proxies of SDOH as features. Recent open data initiatives present an opportunity to construct a more comprehensive view of SDOH, but manually integrating the most relevant data for individual patients becomes increasingly challenging as the volume and diversity of public SDOH data grows. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise at automatically annotating structured data. Here, we conduct an end-to-end case study evaluating the feasibility of using LLMs to integrate SDOH data, and the utility of these SDOH features for clinical prediction. We first manually label 700+ variables from two publicly-accessible SDOH data sources to one of five semantic SDOH categories. Then, we benchmark performance of 9 open-source LLMs on this classification task. Finally, we train ML models to predict 30-day hospital readmission among 39k heart failure (HF) patients, and we compare the prediction performance of the categorized SDOH variables with standard clinical variables. Additionally, we investigate the impact of few-shot LLM prompting on LLM annotation performance, and perform a metadata ablation study on prompts to evaluate which information helps LLMs accurately annotate these variables. We find that some open-source LLMs can effectively, accurately annotate SDOH variables with zero-shot prompting without the need for fine-tuning. Crucially, when combined with standard clinical features, the LLM-annotated Neighborhood and Built Environment subset of the SDOH variables shows the best performance predicting 30-day readmission of HF patients.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09688v1,2024-07
Bridging Dictionary: AI-Generated Dictionary of Partisan Language Use,"Hang Jiang, Doug Beeferman, William Brannon, Andrew Heyward, Deb Roy","Words often carry different meanings for people from diverse backgrounds. Today's era of social polarization demands that we choose words carefully to prevent miscommunication, especially in political communication and journalism. To address this issue, we introduce the Bridging Dictionary, an interactive tool designed to illuminate how words are perceived by people with different political views. The Bridging Dictionary includes a static, printable document featuring 796 terms with summaries generated by a large language model. These summaries highlight how the terms are used distinctively by Republicans and Democrats. Additionally, the Bridging Dictionary offers an interactive interface that lets users explore selected words, visualizing their frequency, sentiment, summaries, and examples across political divides. We present a use case for journalists and emphasize the importance of human agency and trust in further enhancing this tool.

Bridging the Gap Between Information Seeking and Product Search Systems: Q&A Recommendation for E-commerce,"Saar Kuzi, Shervin Malmasi","Consumers on a shopping mission often leverage both product search and information seeking systems, such as web search engines and Question Answering (QA) systems, in an iterative process to improve their understanding of available products and reach a purchase decision. While product search is useful for shoppers to find the actual products meeting their requirements in the catalog, information seeking systems can be utilized to answer any questions they may have to refine those requirements. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up an opportunity to bridge the gap between the two tasks to help customers achieve their goals quickly and effectively by integrating conversational QA within product search. In this paper, we propose to recommend users Question-Answer (Q&A) pairs that are relevant to their product search and can help them make a purchase decision. We discuss the different aspects of the problem including the requirements and characteristics of the Q&A pairs, their generation, and the optimization of the Q&A recommendation task. We highlight the challenges, open problems, and suggested solutions to encourage future research in this emerging area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09653v2,2024-07
How Chinese are Chinese Language Models? The Puzzling Lack of Language Policy in China's LLMs,"Andrea W Wen-Yi, Unso Eun Seo Jo, Lu Jia Lin, David Mimno","Contemporary language models are increasingly multilingual, but Chinese LLM developers must navigate complex political and business considerations of language diversity. Language policy in China aims at influencing the public discourse and governing a multi-ethnic society, and has gradually transitioned from a pluralist to a more assimilationist approach since 1949. We explore the impact of these influences on current language technology. We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs pre-trained by Chinese companies on 18 languages, spanning a wide range of Chinese, Asian, and Anglo-European languages. Our experiments show Chinese LLMs performance on diverse languages is indistinguishable from international LLMs. Similarly, the models' technical reports also show lack of consideration for pretraining data language coverage except for English and Mandarin Chinese. Examining Chinese AI policy, model experiments, and technical reports, we find no sign of any consistent policy, either for or against, language diversity in China's LLM development. This leaves a puzzling fact that while China regulates both the languages people use daily as well as language model development, they do not seem to have any policy on the languages in language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09652v1,2024-07
GRAD-SUM: Leveraging Gradient Summarization for Optimal Prompt Engineering,"Derek Austin, Elliott Chartock","Prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) is often a manual time-intensive process that involves generating, evaluating, and refining prompts iteratively to ensure high-quality outputs. While there has been work on automating prompt engineering, the solutions generally are either tuned to specific tasks with given answers or are quite costly. We introduce GRAD-SUM, a scalable and flexible method for automatic prompt engineering that builds on gradient-based optimization techniques. Our approach incorporates user-defined task descriptions and evaluation criteria, and features a novel gradient summarization module to generalize feedback effectively. Our results demonstrate that GRAD-SUM consistently outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in automatic prompt optimization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12865v1,2024-07
"Weight Block Sparsity: Training, Compilation, and AI Engine Accelerators","Paolo D'Alberto, Taehee Jeong, Akshai Jain, Shreyas Manjunath, Mrinal Sarmah, Samuel Hsu, Yaswanth Raparti, Nitesh Pipralia","Nowadays, increasingly larger Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are being developed, trained, and utilized. These networks require significant computational resources, putting a strain on both advanced and limited devices. Our solution is to implement {\em weight block sparsity}, which is a structured sparsity that is friendly to hardware. By zeroing certain sections of the convolution and fully connected layers parameters of pre-trained DNN models, we can efficiently speed up the DNN's inference process. This results in a smaller memory footprint, faster communication, and fewer operations.   Our work presents a vertical system that allows for the training of convolution and matrix multiplication weights to exploit 8x8 block sparsity on a single GPU within a reasonable amount of time. Compilers recognize this sparsity and use it for both data compaction and computation splitting into threads. Blocks like these take full advantage of both spatial and temporal locality, paving the way for fast vector operations and memory reuse. By using this system on a Resnet50 model, we were able to reduce the weight by half with minimal accuracy loss, resulting in a two-times faster inference speed. We will present performance estimates using accurate and complete code generation for AIE2 configuration sets (AMD Versal FPGAs) with Resnet50, Inception V3, and VGG16 to demonstrate the necessary synergy between hardware overlay designs and software stacks for compiling and executing machine learning applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09453v1,2024-07
Human-like Episodic Memory for Infinite Context LLMs,"Zafeirios Fountas, Martin A Benfeghoul, Adnan Oomerjee, Fenia Christopoulou, Gerasimos Lampouras, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and InfiniteBench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens - a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09450v2,2024-07
ASTPrompter: Weakly Supervised Automated Language Model Red-Teaming to Identify Likely Toxic Prompts,"Amelia F. Hardy, Houjun Liu, Bernard Lange, Mykel J. Kochenderfer","Typical schemes for the automated red-teaming of large language models (LLMs) focus on discovering prompts that trigger a frozen language model (the defender) to generate toxic text. This often results in the prompting model (the adversary) producing text that is unintelligible and unlikely to arise. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning formulation of the LLM red-teaming task that allows us to discover prompts that both (1) trigger toxic outputs from a frozen defender and (2) have low perplexity as scored by that defender. We argue these cases are the most pertinent in a red-teaming setting because they are likely to arise during normal use of the defender model. We solve this formulation through a novel online and weakly supervised variant of Identity Preference Optimization (IPO) on GPT-2, GPT-2 XL, and TinyLlama defenders. We demonstrate that our policy is capable of generating likely (low-perplexity) prompts that also trigger toxicity from all of these architectures. Furthermore, we show that this policy outperforms baselines by producing attacks that are occur with higher probability and are more effective. Finally, we discuss our findings and the observed trade-offs between likelihood vs toxicity.

Diversifying the Expert Knowledge for Task-Agnostic Pruning in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts,"Zeliang Zhang, Xiaodong Liu, Hao Cheng, Chenliang Xu, Jianfeng Gao","By increasing model parameters but activating them sparsely when performing a task, the use of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture significantly improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without increasing the inference cost. However, the memory consumption due to the growing number of experts presents a challenge to the deployment of these models in many real world settings. Our empirical study reveals that some experts encode redundant knowledge during pre-training. We thus propose a method of grouping and pruning similar experts to improve the model's parameter efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of our method by pruning three state-of-the-art MoE architectures, including Mixtral, Deepseek-MoE, and Qwen. The evaluation shows that our method outperforms other model pruning methods on a range of natural language tasks. We will release our code to facilitate future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09590v3,2024-07
Open (Clinical) LLMs are Sensitive to Instruction Phrasings,"Alberto Mario Ceballos Arroyo, Monica Munnangi, Jiuding Sun, Karen Y. C. Zhang, Denis Jered McInerney, Byron C. Wallace, Silvio Amir","Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform a wide range of tasks given natural language instructions to do so, but they are sensitive to how such instructions are phrased. This issue is especially concerning in healthcare, as clinicians are unlikely to be experienced prompt engineers and the potential consequences of inaccurate outputs are heightened in this domain.   This raises a practical question: How robust are instruction-tuned LLMs to natural variations in the instructions provided for clinical NLP tasks? We collect prompts from medical doctors across a range of tasks and quantify the sensitivity of seven LLMs -- some general, others specialized -- to natural (i.e., non-adversarial) instruction phrasings. We find that performance varies substantially across all models, and that -- perhaps surprisingly -- domain-specific models explicitly trained on clinical data are especially brittle, compared to their general domain counterparts. Further, arbitrary phrasing differences can affect fairness, e.g., valid but distinct instructions for mortality prediction yield a range both in overall performance, and in terms of differences between demographic groups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09429v1,2024-07
Mitigating Entity-Level Hallucination in Large Language Models,"Weihang Su, Yichen Tang, Qingyao Ai, Changyue Wang, Zhijing Wu, Yiqun Liu","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized how users access information, shifting from traditional search engines to direct question-and-answer interactions with LLMs. However, the widespread adoption of LLMs has revealed a significant challenge known as hallucination, wherein LLMs generate coherent yet factually inaccurate responses. This hallucination phenomenon has led to users' distrust in information retrieval systems based on LLMs. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes Dynamic Retrieval Augmentation based on hallucination Detection (DRAD) as a novel method to detect and mitigate hallucinations in LLMs. DRAD improves upon traditional retrieval augmentation by dynamically adapting the retrieval process based on real-time hallucination detection. It features two main components: Real-time Hallucination Detection (RHD) for identifying potential hallucinations without external models, and Self-correction based on External Knowledge (SEK) for correcting these errors using external knowledge. Experiment results show that DRAD demonstrates superior performance in both detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs. All of our code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/oneal2000/EntityHallucination.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09417v2,2024-07
SPIQA: A Dataset for Multimodal Question Answering on Scientific Papers,"Shraman Pramanick, Rama Chellappa, Subhashini Venugopalan","Seeking answers to questions within long scientific research articles is a crucial area of study that aids readers in quickly addressing their inquiries. However, existing question-answering (QA) datasets based on scientific papers are limited in scale and focus solely on textual content. We introduce SPIQA (Scientific Paper Image Question Answering), the first large-scale QA dataset specifically designed to interpret complex figures and tables within the context of scientific research articles across various domains of computer science. Leveraging the breadth of expertise and ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand figures, we employ automatic and manual curation to create the dataset. We craft an information-seeking task on interleaved images and text that involves multiple images covering plots, charts, tables, schematic diagrams, and result visualizations. SPIQA comprises 270K questions divided into training, validation, and three different evaluation splits. Through extensive experiments with 12 prominent foundational models, we evaluate the ability of current multimodal systems to comprehend the nuanced aspects of research articles. Additionally, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy with in-context retrieval that allows fine-grained, step-by-step assessment and improves model performance. We further explore the upper bounds of performance enhancement with additional textual information, highlighting its promising potential for future research and the dataset's impact on revolutionizing how we interact with scientific literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09413v2,2024-07
Deep Bag-of-Words Model: An Efficient and Interpretable Relevance Architecture for Chinese E-Commerce,"Zhe Lin, Jiwei Tan, Dan Ou, Xi Chen, Shaowei Yao, Bo Zheng","Text relevance or text matching of query and product is an essential technique for the e-commerce search system to ensure that the displayed products can match the intent of the query. Many studies focus on improving the performance of the relevance model in search system. Recently, pre-trained language models like BERT have achieved promising performance on the text relevance task. While these models perform well on the offline test dataset, there are still obstacles to deploy the pre-trained language model to the online system as their high latency. The two-tower model is extensively employed in industrial scenarios, owing to its ability to harmonize performance with computational efficiency. Regrettably, such models present an opaque ``black box'' nature, which prevents developers from making special optimizations. In this paper, we raise deep Bag-of-Words (DeepBoW) model, an efficient and interpretable relevance architecture for Chinese e-commerce. Our approach proposes to encode the query and the product into the sparse BoW representation, which is a set of word-weight pairs. The weight means the important or the relevant score between the corresponding word and the raw text. The relevance score is measured by the accumulation of the matched word between the sparse BoW representation of the query and the product. Compared to popular dense distributed representation that usually suffers from the drawback of black-box, the most advantage of the proposed representation model is highly explainable and interventionable, which is a superior advantage to the deployment and operation of online search engines. Moreover, the online efficiency of the proposed model is even better than the most efficient inner product form of dense representation ...",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09395v1,2024-07
Is Contrasting All You Need? Contrastive Learning for the Detection and Attribution of AI-generated Text,"Lucio La Cava, Davide Costa, Andrea Tagarelli","The significant progress in the development of Large Language Models has contributed to blurring the distinction between human and AI-generated text. The increasing pervasiveness of AI-generated text and the difficulty in detecting it poses new challenges for our society. In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting and attributing AI-generated text by proposing WhosAI, a triplet-network contrastive learning framework designed to predict whether a given input text has been generated by humans or AI and to unveil the authorship of the text. Unlike most existing approaches, our proposed framework is conceived to learn semantic similarity representations from multiple generators at once, thus equally handling both detection and attribution tasks. Furthermore, WhosAI is model-agnostic and scalable to the release of new AI text-generation models by incorporating their generated instances into the embedding space learned by our framework. Experimental results on the TuringBench benchmark of 200K news articles show that our proposed framework achieves outstanding results in both the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution tasks, outperforming all the methods listed in the TuringBench benchmark leaderboards.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09364v1,2024-07

Scalability of Bayesian Network Structure Elicitation with Large Language Models: a Novel Methodology and Comparative Analysis,"Nikolay Babakov, Ehud Reiter, Alberto Bugarin","In this work, we propose a novel method for Bayesian Networks (BNs) structure elicitation that is based on the initialization of several LLMs with different experiences, independently querying them to create a structure of the BN, and further obtaining the final structure by majority voting. We compare the method with one alternative method on various widely and not widely known BNs of different sizes and study the scalability of both methods on them. We also propose an approach to check the contamination of BNs in LLM, which shows that some widely known BNs are inapplicable for testing the LLM usage for BNs structure elicitation. We also show that some BNs may be inapplicable for such experiments because their node names are indistinguishable. The experiments on the other BNs show that our method performs better than the existing method with one of the three studied LLMs; however, the performance of both methods significantly decreases with the increase in BN size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09311v1,2024-07
Transformer Layers as Painters,"Qi Sun, Marc Pickett, Aakash Kumar Nain, Llion Jones","Despite their nearly universal adoption for large language models, the internal workings of transformers are not well understood. We aim to better understand the impact of removing or reorganizing information throughout the layers of a pretrained transformer. Such an understanding could both yield better usage of existing models as well as to make architectural improvements to produce new variants. We present a series of empirical studies on frozen models that show that the lower and final layers of pretrained transformers differ from middle layers, but that middle layers have a surprising amount of uniformity. We further show that some classes of problems have robustness to skipping layers, running the layers in an order different from how they were trained, or running the layers in parallel. Our observations suggest that even frozen pretrained models may gracefully trade accuracy for latency by skipping layers or running layers in parallel.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09298v3,2024-07
"Show, Don't Tell: Evaluating Large Language Models Beyond Textual Understanding with ChildPlay","Gonçalo Hora de Carvalho, Oscar Knap, Robert Pollice","We explore the hypothesis that LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, possess broader cognitive functions, particularly in non-linguistic domains. Our approach extends beyond standard linguistic benchmarks by incorporating games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Battleship, encoded via ASCII, to assess strategic thinking and decision-making. To evaluate the models' ability to generalize beyond their training data, we introduce two additional games. The first game, LEGO Connect Language (LCL), tests the models' capacity to understand spatial logic and follow assembly instructions. The second game, the game of shapes, challenges the models to identify shapes represented by 1s within a matrix of zeros, further testing their spatial reasoning skills. This ""show, don't tell"" strategy uses games instead of simply querying the models. Our results show that despite their proficiency on standard benchmarks, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's abilities to play and reason about fully observable games without pre-training is mediocre. Both models fail to anticipate losing moves in Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four, and they are unable to play Battleship correctly. While GPT-4 shows some success in the game of shapes, both models fail at the assembly tasks presented in the LCL game. These results suggest that while GPT models can emulate conversational proficiency and basic rule comprehension, their performance in strategic gameplay and spatial reasoning tasks is very limited. Importantly, this reveals a blind spot in current LLM benchmarks that we highlight with our gameplay benchmark suite ChildPlay (https://github.com/child-play-neurips/child-play). Our findings provide a cautionary tale about claims of emergent intelligence and reasoning capabilities of LLMs that are roughly the size of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11068v3,2024-07
DAHRS: Divergence-Aware Hallucination-Remediated SRL Projection,"Sangpil Youm, Brodie Mather, Chathuri Jayaweera, Juliana Prada, Bonnie Dorr","Semantic role labeling (SRL) enriches many downstream applications, e.g., machine translation, question answering, summarization, and stance/belief detection. However, building multilingual SRL models is challenging due to the scarcity of semantically annotated corpora for multiple languages. Moreover, state-of-the-art SRL projection (XSRL) based on large language models (LLMs) yields output that is riddled with spurious role labels. Remediation of such hallucinations is not straightforward due to the lack of explainability of LLMs. We show that hallucinated role labels are related to naturally occurring divergence types that interfere with initial alignments. We implement Divergence-Aware Hallucination-Remediated SRL projection (DAHRS), leveraging linguistically-informed alignment remediation followed by greedy First-Come First-Assign (FCFA) SRL projection. DAHRS improves the accuracy of SRL projection without additional transformer-based machinery, beating XSRL in both human and automatic comparisons, and advancing beyond headwords to accommodate phrase-level SRL projection (e.g., EN-FR, EN-ES). Using CoNLL-2009 as our ground truth, we achieve a higher word-level F1 over XSRL: 87.6% vs. 77.3% (EN-FR) and 89.0% vs. 82.7% (EN-ES). Human phrase-level assessments yield 89.1% (EN-FR) and 91.0% (EN-ES). We also define a divergence metric to adapt our approach to other language pairs (e.g., English-Tagalog).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09283v1,2024-07

Context Embeddings for Efficient Answer Generation in RAG,"David Rau, Shuai Wang, Hervé Déjean, Stéphane Clinchant","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows overcoming the limited knowledge of LLMs by extending the input with external information. As a consequence, the contextual inputs to the model become much longer which slows down decoding time directly translating to the time a user has to wait for an answer. We address this challenge by presenting COCOM, an effective context compression method, reducing long contexts to only a handful of Context Embeddings speeding up the generation time by a large margin. Our method allows for different compression rates trading off decoding time for answer quality. Compared to earlier methods, COCOM allows for handling multiple contexts more effectively, significantly reducing decoding time for long inputs. Our method demonstrates a speed-up of up to 5.69 $\times$ while achieving higher performance compared to existing efficient context compression methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09252v3,2024-07
Token-Supervised Value Models for Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models,"Jung Hyun Lee, June Yong Yang, Byeongho Heo, Dongyoon Han, Kang Min Yoo","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive problem-solving capabilities in mathematics through step-by-step reasoning chains. However, they are susceptible to reasoning errors that impact the quality of subsequent reasoning chains and the final answer due to language models' autoregressive token-by-token generating nature. Recent works have proposed adopting external verifiers to guide the generation of reasoning paths, but existing works utilize models that have been trained with step-by-step labels to assess the correctness of token-by-token reasoning chains. Consequently, they struggle to recognize discriminative details of tokens within a reasoning path and lack the ability to evaluate whether an intermediate reasoning path is on a promising track toward the correct final answer. To amend the lack of sound and token-grained math-verification signals, we devise a novel training scheme for verifiers that apply token-level supervision with the expected cumulative reward (i.e., value). Furthermore, we propose a practical formulation of the cumulative reward by reducing it to finding the probability of future correctness of the final answer and thereby enabling the empirical estimation of the value. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that Token-Supervised Value Model (TVM) can outperform step-by-step verifiers on GSM8K and MATH with Mistral and Llama.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12863v1,2024-07
The Sociolinguistic Foundations of Language Modeling,"Jack Grieve, Sara Bartl, Matteo Fuoli, Jason Grafmiller, Weihang Huang, Alejandro Jawerbaum, Akira Murakami, Marcus Perlman, Dana Roemling, Bodo Winter","In this paper, we introduce a sociolinguistic perspective on language modeling. We claim that large language models are inherently models of varieties of language, and we consider how this insight can inform the development and deployment of large language models. We begin by presenting a technical definition of the concept of a variety of language as developed in sociolinguistics. We then discuss how this perspective can help address five basic challenges in language modeling: social bias, domain adaptation, alignment, language change, and scale. Ultimately, we argue that it is crucial to carefully define and compile training corpora that accurately represent the specific varieties of language being modeled to maximize the performance and societal value of large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09241v1,2024-07
A Survey on Symbolic Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models,"Kamal Acharya, Alvaro Velasquez, Houbing Herbert Song","This survey paper delves into the emerging and critical area of symbolic knowledge distillation in Large Language Models (LLMs). As LLMs like Generative Pre-trained Transformer-3 (GPT-3) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) continue to expand in scale and complexity, the challenge of effectively harnessing their extensive knowledge becomes paramount. This survey concentrates on the process of distilling the intricate, often implicit knowledge contained within these models into a more symbolic, explicit form. This transformation is crucial for enhancing the interpretability, efficiency, and applicability of LLMs. We categorize the existing research based on methodologies and applications, focusing on how symbolic knowledge distillation can be used to improve the transparency and functionality of smaller, more efficient Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. The survey discusses the core challenges, including maintaining the depth of knowledge in a comprehensible format, and explores the various approaches and techniques that have been developed in this field. We identify gaps in current research and potential opportunities for future advancements. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of symbolic knowledge distillation in LLMs, spotlighting its significance in the progression towards more accessible and efficient AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10210v1,2024-07
Pronunciation Assessment with Multi-modal Large Language Models,"Kaiqi Fu, Linkai Peng, Nan Yang, Shuran Zhou","Large language models (LLMs), renowned for their powerful conversational abilities, are widely recognized as exceptional tools in the field of education, particularly in the context of automated intelligent instruction systems for language learning. In this paper, we propose a scoring system based on LLMs, motivated by their positive impact on text-related scoring tasks. Specifically, the speech encoder first maps the learner's speech into contextual features. The adapter layer then transforms these features to align with the text embedding in latent space. The assessment task-specific prefix and prompt text are embedded and concatenated with the features generated by the modality adapter layer, enabling the LLMs to predict accuracy and fluency scores. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed scoring systems achieve competitive results compared to the baselines on the Speechocean762 datasets. Moreover, we also conducted an ablation study to better understand the contributions of the prompt text and training strategy in the proposed scoring system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09209v2,2024-07

"Enhancing Depressive Post Detection in Bangla: A Comparative Study of TF-IDF, BERT and FastText Embeddings","Saad Ahmed Sazan, Mahdi H. Miraz, A B M Muntasir Rahman","Due to massive adoption of social media, detection of users' depression through social media analytics bears significant importance, particularly for underrepresented languages, such as Bangla. This study introduces a well-grounded approach to identify depressive social media posts in Bangla, by employing advanced natural language processing techniques. The dataset used in this work, annotated by domain experts, includes both depressive and non-depressive posts, ensuring high-quality data for model training and evaluation. To address the prevalent issue of class imbalance, we utilised random oversampling for the minority class, thereby enhancing the model's ability to accurately detect depressive posts. We explored various numerical representation techniques, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) embedding and FastText embedding, by integrating them with a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM) model. The results obtained through extensive experimentation, indicate that the BERT approach performed better the others, achieving a F1-score of 84%. This indicates that BERT, in combination with the CNN-BiLSTM architecture, effectively recognises the nuances of Bangla texts relevant to depressive contents. Comparative analysis with the existing state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that our approach with BERT embedding performs better than others in terms of evaluation metrics and the reliability of dataset annotations. Our research significantly contribution to the development of reliable tools for detecting depressive posts in the Bangla language. By highlighting the efficacy of different embedding techniques and deep learning models, this study paves the way for improved mental health monitoring through social media platforms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09187v1,2024-07
Does Incomplete Syntax Influence Korean Language Model? Focusing on Word Order and Case Markers,"Jong Myoung Kim, Young-Jun Lee, Yong-jin Han, Sangkeun Jung, Ho-Jin Choi","Syntactic elements, such as word order and case markers, are fundamental in natural language processing. Recent studies show that syntactic information boosts language model performance and offers clues for people to understand their learning mechanisms. Unlike languages with a fixed word order such as English, Korean allows for varied word sequences, despite its canonical structure, due to case markers that indicate the functions of sentence components. This study explores whether Korean language models can accurately capture this flexibility. We note that incomplete word orders and omitted case markers frequently appear in ordinary Korean communication. To investigate this further, we introduce the Syntactically Incomplete Korean (SIKO) dataset. Through SIKO, we assessed Korean language models' flexibility with incomplete syntax and confirmed the dataset's training value. Results indicate these models reflect Korean's inherent flexibility, accurately handling incomplete inputs. Moreover, fine-tuning with SIKO enhances the ability to handle common incomplete Korean syntactic forms. The dataset's simple construction process, coupled with significant performance enhancements, solidifies its standing as an effective data augmentation technique.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09184v1,2024-07
The Honorific Effect: Exploring the Impact of Japanese Linguistic Formalities on AI-Generated Physics Explanations,Keisuke Sato,"This study investigates the influence of Japanese honorifics on the responses of large language models (LLMs) when explaining the law of conservation of momentum. We analyzed the outputs of six state-of-the-art AI models, including variations of ChatGPT, Coral, and Gemini, using 14 different honorific forms. Our findings reveal that honorifics significantly affect the quality, consistency, and formality of AI-generated responses, demonstrating LLMs' ability to interpret and adapt to social context cues embedded in language. Notable variations were observed across different models, with some emphasizing historical context and derivations, while others focused on intuitive explanations. The study highlights the potential for using honorifics to adjust the depth and complexity of AI-generated explanations in educational contexts. Furthermore, the responsiveness of AI models to cultural linguistic elements underscores the importance of considering cultural factors in AI development for educational applications. These results open new avenues for research in AI-assisted education and cultural adaptation in AI systems, with significant implications for personalizing learning experiences and developing culturally sensitive AI tools for global education.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13787v2,2024-07
Exploring the Effectiveness of Methods for Persona Extraction,Konstantin Zaitsev,"The paper presents a study of methods for extracting information about dialogue participants and evaluating their performance in Russian. To train models for this task, the Multi-Session Chat dataset was translated into Russian using multiple translation models, resulting in improved data quality. A metric based on the F-score concept is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the extraction models. The metric uses a trained classifier to identify the dialogue participant to whom the persona belongs. Experiments were conducted on MBart, FRED-T5, Starling-7B, which is based on the Mistral, and Encoder2Encoder models. The results demonstrated that all models exhibited an insufficient level of recall in the persona extraction task. The incorporation of the NCE Loss improved the model's precision at the expense of its recall. Furthermore, increasing the model's size led to enhanced extraction of personas.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09181v1,2024-07

A Look Into News Avoidance Through AWRS: An Avoidance-Aware Recommender System,"Igor L. R. Azevedo, Toyotaro Suzumura, Yuichiro Yasui","In recent years, journalists have expressed concerns about the increasing trend of news article avoidance, especially within specific domains. This issue has been exacerbated by the rise of recommender systems. Our research indicates that recommender systems should consider avoidance as a fundamental factor. We argue that news articles can be characterized by three principal elements: exposure, relevance, and avoidance, all of which are closely interconnected. To address these challenges, we introduce AWRS, an Avoidance-Aware Recommender System. This framework incorporates avoidance awareness when recommending news, based on the premise that news article avoidance conveys significant information about user preferences. Evaluation results on three news datasets in different languages (English, Norwegian, and Japanese) demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09137v1,2024-07
Stepwise Verification and Remediation of Student Reasoning Errors with Large Language Model Tutors,"Nico Daheim, Jakub Macina, Manu Kapur, Iryna Gurevych, Mrinmaya Sachan","Large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to scale high-quality personalized education to all. A promising approach towards this means is to build dialog tutoring models that scaffold students' problem-solving. However, even though existing LLMs perform well in solving reasoning questions, they struggle to precisely detect student's errors and tailor their feedback to these errors. Inspired by real-world teaching practice where teachers identify student errors and customize their response based on them, we focus on verifying student solutions and show how grounding to such verification improves the overall quality of tutor response generation. We collect a dataset of 1K stepwise math reasoning chains with the first error step annotated by teachers. We show empirically that finding the mistake in a student solution is challenging for current models. We propose and evaluate several verifiers for detecting these errors. Using both automatic and human evaluation we show that the student solution verifiers steer the generation model towards highly targeted responses to student errors which are more often correct with less hallucinations compared to existing baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09136v1,2024-07
Refuse Whenever You Feel Unsafe: Improving Safety in LLMs via Decoupled Refusal Training,"Youliang Yuan, Wenxiang Jiao, Wenxuan Wang, Jen-tse Huang, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Pinjia He, Zhaopeng Tu","This study addresses a critical gap in safety tuning practices for Large Language Models (LLMs) by identifying and tackling a refusal position bias within safety tuning data, which compromises the models' ability to appropriately refuse generating unsafe content. We introduce a novel approach, Decoupled Refusal Training (DeRTa), designed to empower LLMs to refuse compliance to harmful prompts at any response position, significantly enhancing their safety capabilities. DeRTa incorporates two novel components: (1) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Harmful Response Prefix, which trains models to recognize and avoid unsafe content by appending a segment of harmful response to the beginning of a safe response, and (2) Reinforced Transition Optimization (RTO), which equips models with the ability to transition from potential harm to safety refusal consistently throughout the harmful response sequence. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using LLaMA3 and Mistral model families across six attack scenarios, demonstrates that our method not only improves model safety without compromising performance but also surpasses well-known models such as GPT-4 in defending against attacks. Importantly, our approach successfully defends recent advanced attack methods (e.g., CodeAttack) that have jailbroken GPT-4 and LLaMA3-70B-Instruct. Our code and data can be found at https://github.com/RobustNLP/DeRTa.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09121v1,2024-07
URRL-IMVC: Unified and Robust Representation Learning for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering,"Ge Teng, Ting Mao, Chen Shen, Xiang Tian, Xuesong Liu, Yaowu Chen, Jieping Ye","Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) aims to cluster multi-view data that are only partially available. This poses two main challenges: effectively leveraging multi-view information and mitigating the impact of missing views. Prevailing solutions employ cross-view contrastive learning and missing view recovery techniques. However, they either neglect valuable complementary information by focusing only on consensus between views or provide unreliable recovered views due to the absence of supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Unified and Robust Representation Learning for Incomplete Multi-View Clustering (URRL-IMVC). URRL-IMVC directly learns a unified embedding that is robust to view missing conditions by integrating information from multiple views and neighboring samples. Firstly, to overcome the limitations of cross-view contrastive learning, URRL-IMVC incorporates an attention-based auto-encoder framework to fuse multi-view information and generate unified embeddings. Secondly, URRL-IMVC directly enhances the robustness of the unified embedding against view-missing conditions through KNN imputation and data augmentation techniques, eliminating the need for explicit missing view recovery. Finally, incremental improvements are introduced to further enhance the overall performance, such as the Clustering Module and the customization of the Encoder. We extensively evaluate the proposed URRL-IMVC framework on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09120v1,2024-07
New Desiderata for Direct Preference Optimization,"Xiangkun Hu, Tong He, David Wipf","Large language models in the past have typically relied on some form of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to better align model responses with human preferences. However, because of oft-observed instabilities when implementing these RLHF pipelines, various reparameterization techniques have recently been introduced to sidestep the need for separately learning an RL reward model. Instead, directly fine-tuning for human preferences is achieved via the minimization of a single closed-form training objective, a process originally referred to as direct preference optimization (DPO) and followed by several notable descendants. Although effective in certain real-world settings, we introduce new evaluation criteria that serve to highlight unresolved shortcomings in the ability of existing DPO methods to interpolate between a pre-trained reference model and empirical measures of human preferences, as well as unavoidable trade-offs in how low- and high-quality responses are regularized and constraints are handled. Our insights then motivate an alternative DPO-like loss that provably mitigates these limitations. Empirical results serve to corroborate notable aspects of our analyses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09072v1,2024-07
3M-Health: Multimodal Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation for Mental Health Detection,"Rina Carines Cabral, Siwen Luo, Josiah Poon, Soyeon Caren Han","The significance of mental health classification is paramount in contemporary society, where digital platforms serve as crucial sources for monitoring individuals' well-being. However, existing social media mental health datasets primarily consist of text-only samples, potentially limiting the efficacy of models trained on such data. Recognising that humans utilise cross-modal information to comprehend complex situations or issues, we present a novel approach to address the limitations of current methodologies. In this work, we introduce a Multimodal and Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation model for Mental Health Classification, leveraging insights from cross-modal human understanding. Unlike conventional approaches that often rely on simple concatenation to integrate diverse features, our model addresses the challenge of appropriately representing inputs of varying natures (e.g., texts and sounds). To mitigate the computational complexity associated with integrating all features into a single model, we employ a multimodal and multi-teacher architecture. By distributing the learning process across multiple teachers, each specialising in a particular feature extraction aspect, we enhance the overall mental health classification performance. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate the efficacy of our model in achieving improved performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09020v3,2024-07
CompAct: Compressing Retrieved Documents Actively for Question Answering,"Chanwoong Yoon, Taewhoo Lee, Hyeon Hwang, Minbyul Jeong, Jaewoo Kang","Retrieval-augmented generation supports language models to strengthen their factual groundings by providing external contexts. However, language models often face challenges when given extensive information, diminishing their effectiveness in solving questions. Context compression tackles this issue by filtering out irrelevant information, but current methods still struggle in realistic scenarios where crucial information cannot be captured with a single-step approach. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CompAct, a novel framework that employs an active strategy to condense extensive documents without losing key information. Our experiments demonstrate that CompAct brings significant improvements in both performance and compression rate on multi-hop question-answering benchmarks. CompAct flexibly operates as a cost-efficient plug-in module with various off-the-shelf retrievers or readers, achieving exceptionally high compression rates (47x).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09014v3,2024-07
"One Stone, Four Birds: A Comprehensive Solution for QA System Using Supervised Contrastive Learning","Bo Wang, Tsunenori Mine","This paper presents a novel and comprehensive solution to enhance both the robustness and efficiency of question answering (QA) systems through supervised contrastive learning (SCL). Training a high-performance QA system has become straightforward with pre-trained language models, requiring only a small amount of data and simple fine-tuning. However, despite recent advances, existing QA systems still exhibit significant deficiencies in functionality and training efficiency. We address the functionality issue by defining four key tasks: user input intent classification, out-of-domain input detection, new intent discovery, and continual learning. We then leverage a unified SCL-based representation learning method to efficiently build an intra-class compact and inter-class scattered feature space, facilitating both known intent classification and unknown intent detection and discovery. Consequently, with minimal additional tuning on downstream tasks, our approach significantly improves model efficiency and achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09011v2,2024-07
Benchmarking Language Model Creativity: A Case Study on Code Generation,"Yining Lu, Dixuan Wang, Tianjian Li, Dongwei Jiang, Daniel Khashabi","As LLMs become increasingly prevalent, it is interesting to consider how ``creative'' these models can be. From cognitive science, creativity consists of at least two key characteristics: \emph{convergent} thinking (purposefulness to achieve a given goal) and \emph{divergent} thinking (adaptability to new environments or constraints) \citep{runco2003critical}. In this work, we introduce a framework for quantifying LLM creativity that incorporates the two characteristics. This is achieved by (1) Denial Prompting pushes LLMs to come up with more creative solutions to a given problem by incrementally imposing new constraints on the previous solution, compelling LLMs to adopt new strategies, and (2) defining and computing the NeoGauge metric which examines both convergent and divergent thinking in the generated creative responses by LLMs. We apply the proposed framework on Codeforces problems, a natural data source for collecting human coding solutions. We quantify NeoGauge for various proprietary and open-source models and find that even the most creative model, GPT-4, still falls short of demonstrating human-like creativity. We also experiment with advanced reasoning strategies (MCTS, self-correction, etc.) and observe no significant improvement in creativity. As a by-product of our analysis, we release NeoCoder dataset for reproducing our results on future models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09007v1,2024-07
Self-Prompt Tuning: Enable Autonomous Role-Playing in LLMs,"Aobo Kong, Shiwan Zhao, Hao Chen, Qicheng Li, Yong Qin, Ruiqi Sun, Xin Zhou, Jiaming Zhou, Haoqin Sun","Recent advancements in LLMs have showcased their remarkable role-playing capabilities, able to accurately simulate the dialogue styles and cognitive processes of various roles based on different instructions and contexts. Studies indicate that assigning LLMs the roles of experts, a strategy known as role-play prompting, can enhance their performance in the corresponding domains. However, the prompt needs to be manually designed for the given problem, requiring certain expertise and iterative modifications. To this end, we propose self-prompt tuning, making LLMs themselves generate role-play prompts through fine-tuning. Leveraging the LIMA dataset as our foundational corpus, we employ GPT-4 to annotate role-play prompts for each data points, resulting in the creation of the LIMA-Role dataset. We then fine-tune LLMs like Llama-2-7B and Mistral-7B on LIMA-Role. Consequently, the self-prompt tuned LLMs can automatically generate expert role prompts for any given question. We extensively evaluate self-prompt tuned LLMs on widely used NLP benchmarks and open-ended question test. Our empirical results illustrate that self-prompt tuned LLMs outperform standard instruction tuned baselines across most datasets. This highlights the great potential of utilizing fine-tuning to enable LLMs to self-prompt, thereby automating complex prompting strategies. We release the dataset, models, and code at this \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Self-Prompt-Tuning-739E/}{url}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08995v1,2024-07
Robustness of LLMs to Perturbations in Text,"Ayush Singh, Navpreet Singh, Shubham Vatsal","Having a clean dataset has been the foundational assumption of most natural language processing (NLP) systems. However, properly written text is rarely found in real-world scenarios and hence, oftentimes invalidates the aforementioned foundational assumption. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance, but can they handle the inevitable noise in real-world data? This work tackles this critical question by investigating LLMs' resilience against morphological variations in text. To that end, we artificially introduce varying levels of noise into a diverse set of datasets and systematically evaluate LLMs' robustness against the corrupt variations of the original text. Our findings show that contrary to popular beliefs, generative LLMs are quiet robust to noisy perturbations in text. This is a departure from pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa whose performance has been shown to be sensitive to deteriorating noisy text. Additionally, we test LLMs' resilience on multiple real-world benchmarks that closely mimic commonly found errors in the wild. With minimal prompting, LLMs achieve a new state-of-the-art on the benchmark tasks of Grammar Error Correction (GEC) and Lexical Semantic Change (LSC). To empower future research, we also release a dataset annotated by humans stating their preference for LLM vs. human-corrected outputs along with the code to reproduce our results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08989v1,2024-07
Towards Chapter-to-Chapter Context-Aware Literary Translation via Large Language Models,"Linghao Jin, Li An, Xuezhe Ma","Discourse phenomena in existing document-level translation datasets are sparse, which has been a fundamental obstacle in the development of context-aware machine translation models. Moreover, most existing document-level corpora and context-aware machine translation methods rely on an unrealistic assumption on sentence-level alignments. To mitigate these issues, we first curate a novel dataset of Chinese-English literature, which consists of 160 books with intricate discourse structures. Then, we propose a more pragmatic and challenging setting for context-aware translation, termed chapter-to-chapter (Ch2Ch) translation, and investigate the performance of commonly-used machine translation models under this setting. Furthermore, we introduce a potential approach of finetuning large language models (LLMs) within the domain of Ch2Ch literary translation, yielding impressive improvements over baselines. Through our comprehensive analysis, we unveil that literary translation under the Ch2Ch setting is challenging in nature, with respect to both model learning methods and translation decoding algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08978v1,2024-07
Empowering Few-Shot Relation Extraction with The Integration of Traditional RE Methods and Large Language Models,"Ye Liu, Kai Zhang, Aoran Gan, Linan Yue, Feng Hu, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen","Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE), a subtask of Relation Extraction (RE) that utilizes limited training instances, appeals to more researchers in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its capability to extract textual information in extremely low-resource scenarios. The primary methodologies employed for FSRE have been fine-tuning or prompt tuning techniques based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted numerous researchers to explore FSRE through In-Context Learning (ICL). However, there are substantial limitations associated with methods based on either traditional RE models or LLMs. Traditional RE models are hampered by a lack of necessary prior knowledge, while LLMs fall short in their task-specific capabilities for RE. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Dual-System Augmented Relation Extractor (DSARE), which synergistically combines traditional RE models with LLMs. Specifically, DSARE innovatively injects the prior knowledge of LLMs into traditional RE models, and conversely enhances LLMs' task-specific aptitude for RE through relation extraction augmentation. Moreover, an Integrated Prediction module is employed to jointly consider these two respective predictions and derive the final results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08967v1,2024-07
Domain-Hierarchy Adaptation via Chain of Iterative Reasoning for Few-shot Hierarchical Text Classification,"Ke Ji, Peng Wang, Wenjun Ke, Guozheng Li, Jiajun Liu, Jingsheng Gao, Ziyu Shang","Recently, various pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed to prove their impressive performances on a wide range of few-shot tasks. However, limited by the unstructured prior knowledge in PLMs, it is difficult to maintain consistent performance on complex structured scenarios, such as hierarchical text classification (HTC), especially when the downstream data is extremely scarce. The main challenge is how to transfer the unstructured semantic space in PLMs to the downstream domain hierarchy. Unlike previous work on HTC which directly performs multi-label classification or uses graph neural network (GNN) to inject label hierarchy, in this work, we study the HTC problem under a few-shot setting to adapt knowledge in PLMs from an unstructured manner to the downstream hierarchy. Technically, we design a simple yet effective method named Hierarchical Iterative Conditional Random Field (HierICRF) to search the most domain-challenging directions and exquisitely crafts domain-hierarchy adaptation as a hierarchical iterative language modeling problem, and then it encourages the model to make hierarchical consistency self-correction during the inference, thereby achieving knowledge transfer with hierarchical consistency preservation. We perform HierICRF on various architectures, and extensive experiments on two popular HTC datasets demonstrate that prompt with HierICRF significantly boosts the few-shot HTC performance with an average Micro-F1 by 28.80% to 1.50% and Macro-F1 by 36.29% to 1.5% over the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under few-shot settings, while remaining SOTA hierarchical consistency performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08959v1,2024-07
"Detect, Investigate, Judge and Determine: A Novel LLM-based Framework for Few-shot Fake News Detection","Ye Liu, Jiajun Zhu, Kai Zhang, Haoyu Tang, Yanghai Zhang, Xukai Liu, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen","Few-Shot Fake News Detection (FS-FND) aims to distinguish inaccurate news from real ones in extremely low-resource scenarios. This task has garnered increased attention due to the widespread dissemination and harmful impact of fake news on social media. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated competitive performance with the help of their rich prior knowledge and excellent in-context learning abilities. However, existing methods face significant limitations, such as the Understanding Ambiguity and Information Scarcity, which significantly undermine the potential of LLMs. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Dual-perspective Augmented Fake News Detection (DAFND) model, designed to enhance LLMs from both inside and outside perspectives. Specifically, DAFND first identifies the keywords of each news article through a Detection Module. Subsequently, DAFND creatively designs an Investigation Module to retrieve inside and outside valuable information concerning to the current news, followed by another Judge Module to derive its respective two prediction results. Finally, a Determination Module further integrates these two predictions and derives the final result. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets show the efficacy of our proposed method, particularly in low-resource settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08952v1,2024-07
Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation,"Biqing Qi, Kaiyan Zhang, Kai Tian, Haoxiang Li, Zhang-Ren Chen, Sihang Zeng, Ermo Hua, Hu Jinfang, Bowen Zhou","The rapid growth of biomedical knowledge has outpaced our ability to efficiently extract insights and generate novel hypotheses. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool to revolutionize knowledge interaction and potentially accelerate biomedical discovery. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs as biomedical hypothesis generators. We construct a dataset of background-hypothesis pairs from biomedical literature, carefully partitioned into training, seen, and unseen test sets based on publication date to mitigate data contamination. Using this dataset, we assess the hypothesis generation capabilities of top-tier instructed models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. To enhance the exploration of uncertainty, a crucial aspect of scientific discovery, we incorporate tool use and multi-agent interactions in our evaluation framework. Furthermore, we propose four novel metrics grounded in extensive literature review to evaluate the quality of generated hypotheses, considering both LLM-based and human assessments. Our experiments yield two key findings: 1) LLMs can generate novel and validated hypotheses, even when tested on literature unseen during training, and 2) Increasing uncertainty through multi-agent interactions and tool use can facilitate diverse candidate generation and improve zero-shot hypothesis generation performance. However, we also observe that the integration of additional knowledge through few-shot learning and tool use may not always lead to performance gains, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the type and scope of external knowledge incorporated. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as powerful aids in biomedical hypothesis generation and provide valuable insights to guide further research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08940v2,2024-07
Self-Evolving GPT: A Lifelong Autonomous Experiential Learner,"Jinglong Gao, Xiao Ding, Yiming Cui, Jianbai Zhao, Hepeng Wang, Ting Liu, Bing Qin","To improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), researchers have explored providing LLMs with textual task-solving experience via prompts. However, they rely on manual efforts to acquire and apply such experience for each task, which is not feasible for the growing demand for LLMs and the variety of user questions. To address this issue, we design a lifelong autonomous experiential learning framework based on LLMs to explore whether LLMs can imitate human ability for learning and utilizing experience. It autonomously learns and accumulates experience through experience transfer and induction, categorizing the types of input questions to select which accumulated experience to employ for them. Experimental results on six widely used NLP datasets show that our framework performs reliably in each intermediate step and effectively improves the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. This validates the feasibility of using LLMs to mimic human experiential learning and application capabilities. Additionally, we provide a detailed analysis of the behavior of our framework at each step.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08937v1,2024-07
IDAT: A Multi-Modal Dataset and Toolkit for Building and Evaluating Interactive Task-Solving Agents,"Shrestha Mohanty, Negar Arabzadeh, Andrea Tupini, Yuxuan Sun, Alexey Skrynnik, Artem Zholus, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Julia Kiseleva","Seamless interaction between AI agents and humans using natural language remains a key goal in AI research. This paper addresses the challenges of developing interactive agents capable of understanding and executing grounded natural language instructions through the IGLU competition at NeurIPS. Despite advancements, challenges such as a scarcity of appropriate datasets and the need for effective evaluation platforms persist. We introduce a scalable data collection tool for gathering interactive grounded language instructions within a Minecraft-like environment, resulting in a Multi-Modal dataset with around 9,000 utterances and over 1,000 clarification questions. Additionally, we present a Human-in-the-Loop interactive evaluation platform for qualitative analysis and comparison of agent performance through multi-turn communication with human annotators. We offer to the community these assets referred to as IDAT (IGLU Dataset And Toolkit) which aim to advance the development of intelligent, interactive AI agents and provide essential resources for further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08898v1,2024-07
Characterizing Prompt Compression Methods for Long Context Inference,"Siddharth Jha, Lutfi Eren Erdogan, Sehoon Kim, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami","Long context inference presents challenges at the system level with increased compute and memory requirements, as well as from an accuracy perspective in being able to reason over long contexts. Recently, several methods have been proposed to compress the prompt to reduce the context length. However, there has been little work on comparing the different proposed methods across different tasks through a standardized analysis. This has led to conflicting results. To address this, here we perform a comprehensive characterization and evaluation of different prompt compression methods. In particular, we analyze extractive compression, summarization-based abstractive compression, and token pruning methods. Surprisingly, we find that extractive compression often outperforms all the other approaches, and enables up to 10x compression with minimal accuracy degradation. Interestingly, we also find that despite several recent claims, token pruning methods often lag behind extractive compression. We only found marginal improvements on summarization tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08892v1,2024-07
Automatic Pruning of Fine-tuning Datasets for Transformer-based Language Models,"Mohammadreza Tayaranian, Seyyed Hasan Mozafari, Brett H. Meyer, James J. Clark, Warren J. Gross","Transformer-based language models have shown state-of-the-art performance on a variety of natural language understanding tasks. To achieve this performance, these models are first pre-trained on general corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. Previous work studied the effect of pruning the training set of the downstream tasks on the performance of the model on its evaluation set. In this work, we propose an automatic dataset pruning method for the training set of fine-tuning tasks. Our method is based on the model's success rate in correctly classifying each training data point. Unlike previous work which relies on user feedback to determine subset size, our method automatically extracts training subsets that are adapted for each pair of model and fine-tuning task. Our method provides multiple subsets for use in dataset pruning that navigate the trade-off between subset size and evaluation accuracy. Our largest subset, which we also refer to as the winning ticket subset, is on average $3 \times$ smaller than the original training set of the fine-tuning task. Our experiments on 5 downstream tasks and 2 language models show that, on average, fine-tuning on the winning ticket subsets results in a $0.1 \%$ increase in the evaluation performance of the model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08887v1,2024-07
GPT-4 is judged more human than humans in displaced and inverted Turing tests,"Ishika Rathi, Sydney Taylor, Benjamin K. Bergen, Cameron R. Jones","Everyday AI detection requires differentiating between people and AI in informal, online conversations. In many cases, people will not interact directly with AI systems but instead read conversations between AI systems and other people. We measured how well people and large language models can discriminate using two modified versions of the Turing test: inverted and displaced. GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and displaced human adjudicators judged whether an agent was human or AI on the basis of a Turing test transcript. We found that both AI and displaced human judges were less accurate than interactive interrogators, with below chance accuracy overall. Moreover, all three judged the best-performing GPT-4 witness to be human more often than human witnesses. This suggests that both humans and current LLMs struggle to distinguish between the two when they are not actively interrogating the person, underscoring an urgent need for more accurate tools to detect AI in conversations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08853v1,2024-07
Evaluating Nuanced Bias in Large Language Model Free Response Answers,"Jennifer Healey, Laurie Byrum, Md Nadeem Akhtar, Moumita Sinha","Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) can now be easily adapted for specific business purposes using custom prompts or fine tuning. These customizations are often iteratively re-engineered to improve some aspect of performance, but after each change businesses want to ensure that there has been no negative impact on the system's behavior around such critical issues as bias. Prior methods of benchmarking bias use techniques such as word masking and multiple choice questions to assess bias at scale, but these do not capture all of the nuanced types of bias that can occur in free response answers, the types of answers typically generated by LLM systems. In this paper, we identify several kinds of nuanced bias in free text that cannot be similarly identified by multiple choice tests. We describe these as: confidence bias, implied bias, inclusion bias and erasure bias. We present a semi-automated pipeline for detecting these types of bias by first eliminating answers that can be automatically classified as unbiased and then co-evaluating name reversed pairs using crowd workers. We believe that the nuanced classifications our method generates can be used to give better feedback to LLMs, especially as LLM reasoning capabilities become more advanced.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08842v1,2024-07
Fault Diagnosis in Power Grids with Large Language Model,"Liu Jing, Amirul Rahman","Power grid fault diagnosis is a critical task for ensuring the reliability and stability of electrical infrastructure. Traditional diagnostic systems often struggle with the complexity and variability of power grid data. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT and GPT-4, combined with advanced prompt engineering to enhance fault diagnosis accuracy and explainability. We designed comprehensive, context-aware prompts to guide the LLMs in interpreting complex data and providing detailed, actionable insights. Our method was evaluated against baseline techniques, including standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) methods, using a newly constructed dataset comprising real-time sensor data, historical fault records, and component descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, explainability quality, response coherence, and contextual understanding, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach. These findings suggest that prompt-engineered LLMs offer a promising solution for robust and reliable power grid fault diagnosis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08836v1,2024-07
Proving that Cryptic Crossword Clue Answers are Correct,"Martin Andrews, Sam Witteveen","Cryptic crossword clues are challenging cognitive tasks, for which new test sets are released on a daily basis by multiple international newspapers. Each cryptic clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword grid (in common with regular crosswords), and `wordplay' that proves that the answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is correct without needing crossing words to confirm it). Using an existing cryptic wordplay proving framework (operating on Python proofs created by an LLM), we show that it is possible to distinguish between correct answers and almost-correct ones based upon whether the wordplay `works'.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08824v1,2024-07
"Rule-Based, Neural and LLM Back-Translation: Comparative Insights from a Variant of Ladin","Samuel Frontull, Georg Moser","This paper explores the impact of different back-translation approaches on machine translation for Ladin, specifically the Val Badia variant. Given the limited amount of parallel data available for this language (only 18k Ladin-Italian sentence pairs), we investigate the performance of a multilingual neural machine translation model fine-tuned for Ladin-Italian. In addition to the available authentic data, we synthesise further translations by using three different models: a fine-tuned neural model, a rule-based system developed specifically for this language pair, and a large language model. Our experiments show that all approaches achieve comparable translation quality in this low-resource scenario, yet round-trip translations highlight differences in model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08819v1,2024-07
MAGNET: Improving the Multilingual Fairness of Language Models with Adaptive Gradient-Based Tokenization,"Orevaoghene Ahia, Sachin Kumar, Hila Gonen, Valentin Hofmann, Tomasz Limisiewicz, Yulia Tsvetkov, Noah A. Smith","In multilingual settings, non-Latin scripts and low-resource languages are usually disadvantaged in terms of language models' utility, efficiency, and cost. Specifically, previous studies have reported multiple modeling biases that the current tokenization algorithms introduce to non-Latin script languages, the main one being over-segmentation. In this work, we propose MAGNET; multilingual adaptive gradient-based tokenization to reduce over-segmentation via adaptive gradient-based subword tokenization. MAGNET learns to predict segment boundaries between byte tokens in a sequence via sub-modules within the model, which act as internal boundary predictors (tokenizers). Previous gradient-based tokenization methods aimed for uniform compression across sequences by integrating a single boundary predictor during training and optimizing it end-to-end through stochastic reparameterization alongside the next token prediction objective. However, this approach still results in over-segmentation for non-Latin script languages in multilingual settings. In contrast, MAGNET offers a customizable architecture where byte-level sequences are routed through language-script-specific predictors, each optimized for its respective language script. This modularity enforces equitable segmentation granularity across different language scripts compared to previous methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that in addition to reducing segmentation disparities, MAGNET also enables faster language modelling and improves downstream utility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08818v2,2024-07
Brief state of the art in social information mining: Practical application in analysis of trends in French legislative 2024,Jose A.

Large Models of What? Mistaking Engineering Achievements for Human Linguistic Agency,"Abeba Birhane, Marek McGann","In this paper we argue that key, often sensational and misleading, claims regarding linguistic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are based on at least two unfounded assumptions; the assumption of language completeness and the assumption of data completeness. Language completeness assumes that a distinct and complete thing such as `a natural language' exists, the essential characteristics of which can be effectively and comprehensively modelled by an LLM. The assumption of data completeness relies on the belief that a language can be quantified and wholly captured by data. Work within the enactive approach to cognitive science makes clear that, rather than a distinct and complete thing, language is a means or way of acting. Languaging is not the kind of thing that can admit of a complete or comprehensive modelling. From an enactive perspective we identify three key characteristics of enacted language; embodiment, participation, and precariousness, that are absent in LLMs, and likely incompatible in principle with current architectures. We argue that these absences imply that LLMs are not now and cannot in their present form be linguistic agents the way humans are. We illustrate the point in particular through the phenomenon of `algospeak', a recently described pattern of high stakes human language activity in heavily controlled online environments. On the basis of these points, we conclude that sensational and misleading claims about LLM agency and capabilities emerge from a deep misconception of both what human language is and what LLMs are.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08790v1,2024-07
Transformer Circuit Faithfulness Metrics are not Robust,"Joseph Miller, Bilal Chughtai, William Saunders","Mechanistic interpretability work attempts to reverse engineer the learned algorithms present inside neural networks. One focus of this work has been to discover 'circuits' -- subgraphs of the full model that explain behaviour on specific tasks. But how do we measure the performance of such circuits? Prior work has attempted to measure circuit 'faithfulness' -- the degree to which the circuit replicates the performance of the full model. In this work, we survey many considerations for designing experiments that measure circuit faithfulness by ablating portions of the model's computation. Concerningly, we find existing methods are highly sensitive to seemingly insignificant changes in the ablation methodology. We conclude that existing circuit faithfulness scores reflect both the methodological choices of researchers as well as the actual components of the circuit - the task a circuit is required to perform depends on the ablation used to test it. The ultimate goal of mechanistic interpretability work is to understand neural networks, so we emphasize the need for more clarity in the precise claims being made about circuits. We open source a library at https://github.com/UFO-101/auto-circuit that includes highly efficient implementations of a wide range of ablation methodologies and circuit discovery algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08734v1,2024-07
Is Your Model Really A Good Math Reasoner? Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning with Checklist,"Zihao Zhou, Shudong Liu, Maizhen Ning, Wei Liu, Jindong Wang, Derek F. Wong, Xiaowei Huang, Qiufeng Wang, Kaizhu Huang","Exceptional mathematical reasoning ability is one of the key features that demonstrate the power of large language models (LLMs). How to comprehensively define and evaluate the mathematical abilities of LLMs, and even reflect the user experience in real-world scenarios, has emerged as a critical issue. Current benchmarks predominantly concentrate on problem-solving capabilities, presenting a substantial risk of model overfitting and fails to accurately measure the genuine mathematical reasoning abilities. In this paper, we argue that if a model really understands a problem, it should be robustly applied across a diverse array of tasks. To this end, we introduce MathCheck, a well-designed checklist for testing task generalization and reasoning robustness, as well as an automatic tool to generate checklists efficiently. MathCheck includes multiple mathematical reasoning tasks and robustness tests to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of both mathematical reasoning ability and behavior testing. Utilizing MathCheck, we develop MathCheck-GSM and MathCheck-GEO to assess math textual reasoning and multi-modal reasoning abilities, respectively, serving as upgraded versions of benchmarks including GSM8k, GeoQA, UniGeo, and Geometry3K. We adopt MathCheck-GSM and MathCheck-GEO to evaluate 26 LLMs and 17 MLLMs. Our results demonstrate that while frontier LLMs like GPT-4o continue to excel in various abilities on the checklist, many other model families exhibit a significant decline. Further experiments indicate that, compared to traditional math benchmarks, MathCheck better reflects true mathematical abilities and represents mathematical intelligence more linearly, thereby supporting our design. Using MathCheck, we can efficiently conduct informative behavior analysis to deeply investigate models. Finally, we show that our checklist paradigm can easily extend to other reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08733v2,2024-07
A Taxonomy for Data Contamination in Large Language Models,"Medha Palavalli, Amanda Bertsch, Matthew R. Gormley","Large language models pretrained on extensive web corpora demonstrate remarkable performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, a growing concern is data contamination, where evaluation datasets may be contained in the pretraining corpus, inflating model performance. Decontamination, the process of detecting and removing such data, is a potential solution; yet these contaminants may originate from altered versions of the test set, evading detection during decontamination. How different types of contamination impact the performance of language models on downstream tasks is not fully understood. We present a taxonomy that categorizes the various types of contamination encountered by LLMs during the pretraining phase and identify which types pose the highest risk. We analyze the impact of contamination on two key NLP tasks -- summarization and question answering -- revealing how different types of contamination influence task performance during evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08716v1,2024-07
GTA: A Benchmark for General Tool Agents,"Jize Wang, Zerun Ma, Yining Li, Songyang Zhang, Cailian Chen, Kai Chen, Xinyi Le","Significant focus has been placed on integrating large language models (LLMs) with various tools in developing general-purpose agents. This poses a challenge to LLMs' tool-use capabilities. However, there are evident gaps between existing tool-use evaluations and real-world scenarios. Current evaluations often use AI-generated queries, single-step tasks, dummy tools, and text-only interactions, failing to reveal the agents' real-world problem-solving abilities effectively. To address this, we propose GTA, a benchmark for General Tool Agents, featuring three main aspects: (i) Real user queries: human-written queries with simple real-world objectives but implicit tool-use, requiring the LLM to reason the suitable tools and plan the solution steps. (ii) Real deployed tools: an evaluation platform equipped with tools across perception, operation, logic, and creativity categories to evaluate the agents' actual task execution performance. (iii) Real multimodal inputs: authentic image files, such as spatial scenes, web page screenshots, tables, code snippets, and printed/handwritten materials, used as the query contexts to align with real-world scenarios closely. We design 229 real-world tasks and executable tool chains to evaluate mainstream LLMs. Our findings show that real-world user queries are challenging for existing LLMs, with GPT-4 completing less than 50% of the tasks and most LLMs achieving below 25%. This evaluation reveals the bottlenecks in the tool-use capabilities of current LLMs in real-world scenarios, which provides future direction for advancing general-purpose tool agents.

Uncertainty Estimation of Large Language Models in Medical Question Answering,"Jiaxin Wu, Yizhou Yu, Hong-Yu Zhou","Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for natural language generation in healthcare, but risk hallucinating factually incorrect information. Deploying LLMs for medical question answering necessitates reliable uncertainty estimation (UE) methods to detect hallucinations. In this work, we benchmark popular UE methods with different model sizes on medical question-answering datasets. Our results show that current approaches generally perform poorly in this domain, highlighting the challenge of UE for medical applications. We also observe that larger models tend to yield better results, suggesting a correlation between model size and the reliability of UE. To address these challenges, we propose Two-phase Verification, a probability-free Uncertainty Estimation approach. First, an LLM generates a step-by-step explanation alongside its initial answer, followed by formulating verification questions to check the factual claims in the explanation. The model then answers these questions twice: first independently, and then referencing the explanation. Inconsistencies between the two sets of answers measure the uncertainty in the original response. We evaluate our approach on three biomedical question-answering datasets using Llama 2 Chat models and compare it against the benchmarked baseline methods. The results show that our Two-phase Verification method achieves the best overall accuracy and stability across various datasets and model sizes, and its performance scales as the model size increases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08662v1,2024-07
Towards Building Specialized Generalist AI with System 1 and System 2 Fusion,"Kaiyan Zhang, Biqing Qi, Bowen Zhou","In this perspective paper, we introduce the concept of Specialized Generalist Artificial Intelligence (SGAI or simply SGI) as a crucial milestone toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to directly scaling general abilities, SGI is defined as AI that specializes in at least one task, surpassing human experts, while also retaining general abilities. This fusion path enables SGI to rapidly achieve high-value areas. We categorize SGI into three stages based on the level of mastery over professional skills and generality performance. Additionally, we discuss the necessity of SGI in addressing issues associated with large language models, such as their insufficient generality, specialized capabilities, uncertainty in innovation, and practical applications. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for developing SGI that integrates the strengths of Systems 1 and 2 cognitive processing. This framework comprises three layers and four key components, which focus on enhancing individual abilities and facilitating collaborative evolution. We conclude by summarizing the potential challenges and suggesting future directions. We hope that the proposed SGI will provide insights into further research and applications towards achieving AGI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08642v1,2024-07

On the Universal Truthfulness Hyperplane Inside LLMs,"Junteng Liu, Shiqi Chen, Yu Cheng, Junxian He","While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various fields, hallucination remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs' adherence to facts. However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results indicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly enhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples plays a less critical role. This finding supports the optimistic hypothesis that a universal truthfulness hyperplane may indeed exist within the model, offering promising directions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08582v3,2024-07
Autoregressive Speech Synthesis without Vector Quantization,"Lingwei Meng, Long Zhou, Shujie Liu, Sanyuan Chen, Bing Han, Shujie Hu, Yanqing Liu, Jinyu Li, Sheng Zhao, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng, Furu Wei","We present MELLE, a novel continuous-valued tokens based language modeling approach for text to speech synthesis (TTS). MELLE autoregressively generates continuous mel-spectrogram frames directly from text condition, bypassing the need for vector quantization, which are originally designed for audio compression and sacrifice fidelity compared to mel-spectrograms. Specifically, (i) instead of cross-entropy loss, we apply regression loss with a proposed spectrogram flux loss function to model the probability distribution of the continuous-valued tokens. (ii) we have incorporated variational inference into MELLE to facilitate sampling mechanisms, thereby enhancing the output diversity and model robustness. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to the two-stage codec language models VALL-E and its variants, the single-stage MELLE mitigates robustness issues by avoiding the inherent flaws of sampling discrete codes, achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, and, most importantly, offers a more streamlined paradigm.

Emergent Visual-Semantic Hierarchies in Image-Text Representations,"Morris Alper, Hadar Averbuch-Elor","While recent vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP are a powerful tool for analyzing text and images in a shared semantic space, they do not explicitly model the hierarchical nature of the set of texts which may describe an image. Conversely, existing multimodal hierarchical representation learning methods require costly training from scratch, failing to leverage the knowledge encoded by state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models. In this work, we study the knowledge of existing foundation models, finding that they exhibit emergent understanding of visual-semantic hierarchies despite not being directly trained for this purpose. We propose the Radial Embedding (RE) framework for probing and optimizing hierarchical understanding, and contribute the HierarCaps dataset, a benchmark facilitating the study of hierarchical knowledge in image--text representations, constructed automatically via large language models. Our results show that foundation VLMs exhibit zero-shot hierarchical understanding, surpassing the performance of prior models explicitly designed for this purpose.

Investigating LLMs as Voting Assistants via Contextual Augmentation: A Case Study on the European Parliament Elections 2024,Ilias Chalkidis,"In light of the recent 2024 European Parliament elections, we are investigating if LLMs can be used as Voting Advice Applications (VAAs). We audit MISTRAL and MIXTRAL models and evaluate their accuracy in predicting the stance of political parties based on the latest ""EU and I"" voting assistance questionnaire. Furthermore, we explore alternatives to improve models' performance by augmenting the input context via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) relying on web search, and Self-Reflection using staged conversations that aim to re-collect relevant content from the model's internal memory. We find that MIXTRAL is highly accurate with an 82% accuracy on average with a significant performance disparity across different political groups (50-95%). Augmenting the input context with expert-curated information can lead to a significant boost of approx. 9%, which remains an open challenge for automated RAG approaches, even considering curated content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08495v2,2024-07

Investigating Public Fine-Tuning Datasets: A Complex Review of Current Practices from a Construction Perspective,"Runyuan Ma, Wei Li, Fukai Shang","With the rapid development of the large model domain, research related to fine-tuning has concurrently seen significant advancement, given that fine-tuning is a constituent part of the training process for large-scale models. Data engineering plays a fundamental role in the training process of models, which includes data infrastructure, data processing, etc. Data during fine-tuning likewise forms the base for large models. In order to embrace the power and explore new possibilities of fine-tuning datasets, this paper reviews current public fine-tuning datasets from the perspective of data construction. An overview of public fine-tuning datasets from two sides: evolution and taxonomy, is provided in this review, aiming to chart the development trajectory. Construction techniques and methods for public fine-tuning datasets of Large Language Models (LLMs), including data generation and data augmentation among others, are detailed.

Model Tells You Where to Merge: Adaptive KV Cache Merging for LLMs on Long-Context Tasks,"Zheng Wang, Boxiao Jin, Zhongzhi Yu, Minjia Zhang","How to efficiently serve Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a pressing issue because of their huge computational cost in their autoregressive generation process. To mitigate computational costs, LLMs often employ the KV Cache technique to improve the generation speed. While improving the computational efficiency, the storage requirements of the KV cache are substantial, particularly in long-context scenarios, leading to significant memory consumption. Existing KV cache eviction methods often degrade the performance of LLMs in long-context scenarios due to the information loss introduced by eviction. In this paper, we propose a novel KV cache merging approach, called KVMerger, to achieve adaptive KV cache compression for long-context tasks without significant performance degradation under constrained memory budgets. Our approach is inspired by the intriguing observation that key states exhibit high similarity at the token level within a single sequence. To facilitate merging, we develop an effective yet straightforward merging set identification algorithm to identify suitable KV states for merging. Our merging set identification algorithm stimulates the second observation that KV cache sparsity, from similarity perspective, is independent of the dataset and remains persistent at the model level. Subsequently, we propose a Gaussian kernel weighted merging algorithm to selectively merge all states within each merging set. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of KVMerger for long-context tasks under constrained memory budgets, applying it to models including Llama2-7B-chat and Llama2-13B-chat. Using the LongBench and ZeroScroll benchmarks, we compare our method with other KV cache compression techniques, including H2O and CaM, showing that our method achieves superior performance across tasks with both 50% and 35% KV cache budgets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08454v2,2024-07
Are Large Language Models Really Bias-Free? Jailbreak Prompts for Assessing Adversarial Robustness to Bias Elicitation,"Riccardo Cantini, Giada Cosenza, Alessio Orsino, Domenico Talia","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, demonstrating remarkable computational power and linguistic capabilities. However, these models are inherently prone to various biases stemming from their training data. These include selection, linguistic, and confirmation biases, along with common stereotypes related to gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic status, disability, and age. This study explores the presence of these biases within the responses given by the most recent LLMs, analyzing the impact on their fairness and reliability. We also investigate how known prompt engineering techniques can be exploited to effectively reveal hidden biases of LLMs, testing their adversarial robustness against jailbreak prompts specially crafted for bias elicitation. Extensive experiments are conducted using the most widespread LLMs at different scales, confirming that LLMs can still be manipulated to produce biased or inappropriate responses, despite their advanced capabilities and sophisticated alignment processes. Our findings underscore the importance of enhancing mitigation techniques to address these safety issues, toward a more sustainable and inclusive artificial intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08441v1,2024-07
Beyond Instruction Following: Evaluating Inferential Rule Following of Large Language Models,"Wangtao Sun, Chenxiang Zhang, XueYou Zhang, Xuanqing Yu, Ziyang Huang, Pei Chen, Haotian Xu, Shizhu He, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu","Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong ability, they are further supposed to be controlled and guided by in real-world scenarios to be safe, accurate, and intelligent. This demands the possession of capability of LLMs. However, no prior work has made a clear evaluation of the inferential rule-following capability of LLMs. Previous studies that try to evaluate the inferential rule-following capability of LLMs fail to distinguish the inferential rule-following scenarios from the instruction-following scenarios. Therefore, this paper first clarifies the concept of inferential rule-following and proposes a comprehensive benchmark, RuleBench, to evaluate a diversified range of inferential rule-following abilities. Our experimental results on a variety of LLMs show that they are still limited in following rules. Our analysis based on the evaluation results provides insights into the improvements for LLMs toward a better inferential rule-following intelligent agent. We further propose Inferential Rule-Following Tuning (IRFT). The experimental results show that through IRFT, LLMs can learn abstract rule-following abilities from purely synthetic data and then generalize to RuleBench.

Self-training Language Models for Arithmetic Reasoning,"Marek Kadlčík, Michal Štefánik","Recent language models achieve impressive results in tasks involving complex multistep reasoning, but scaling these capabilities further traditionally requires expensive collection of more annotated data. In this work, we explore the potential of improving models' reasoning capabilities without new data, merely using automated feedback to the validity of their predictions in arithmetic reasoning (self-training).   In systematic experimentation across six different arithmetic reasoning datasets, we find that models can substantially improve in both single-round (offline) and online self-training, reaching a correct result in +13.9% and +25.9% more cases, respectively, underlining the importance of actuality of self-training feedback. We further find that in the single-round, offline self-training, traditional supervised training can deliver gains comparable to preference optimization, but in online self-training, preference optimization methods largely outperform supervised training thanks to their superior stability and robustness on unseen types of problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08400v3,2024-07
On the attribution of confidence to large language models,"Geoff Keeling, Winnie Street","Credences are mental states corresponding to degrees of confidence in propositions. Attribution of credences to Large Language Models (LLMs) is commonplace in the empirical literature on LLM evaluation. Yet the theoretical basis for LLM credence attribution is unclear. We defend three claims. First, our semantic claim is that LLM credence attributions are (at least in general) correctly interpreted literally, as expressing truth-apt beliefs on the part of scientists that purport to describe facts about LLM credences. Second, our metaphysical claim is that the existence of LLM credences is at least plausible, although current evidence is inconclusive. Third, our epistemic claim is that LLM credence attributions made in the empirical literature on LLM evaluation are subject to non-trivial sceptical concerns. It is a distinct possibility that even if LLMs have credences, LLM credence attributions are generally false because the experimental techniques used to assess LLM credences are not truth-tracking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08388v1,2024-07
"AutoBencher: Creating Salient, Novel, Difficult Datasets for Language Models","Xiang Lisa Li, Evan Zheran Liu, Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto","Evaluation is critical for assessing capabilities, tracking scientific progress, and informing model selection. In this paper, we present three desiderata for a good benchmark for language models: (i) salience (e.g., knowledge about World War II is more salient than a random day in history), (ii) novelty (i.e., the benchmark reveals new trends in model rankings not shown by previous benchmarks), and (iii) difficulty (i.e., the benchmark should be difficult for existing models, leaving headroom for future improvement). We operationalize these three desiderata and cast benchmark creation as a search problem, that of finding benchmarks that that satisfy all three desiderata. To tackle this search problem, we present AutoBencher, which uses a language model to automatically search for datasets that meet the three desiderata. AutoBencher uses privileged information (e.g. relevant documents) to construct reliable datasets, and adaptivity with reranking to optimize for the search objective. We use AutoBencher to create datasets for math, multilingual, and knowledge-intensive question answering. The scalability of AutoBencher allows it to test fine-grained categories and tail knowledge, creating datasets that are on average 27% more novel and 22% more difficult than existing benchmarks. A closer investigation of our constructed datasets shows that we can identify specific gaps in LM knowledge in language models that are not captured by existing benchmarks, such as Gemini Pro performing much worse on question answering about the Permian Extinction and Fordism, while OpenAGI-7B performing surprisingly well on QA about COVID-19.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08351v1,2024-07
Skywork-Math: Data Scaling Laws for Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models -- The Story Goes On,"Liang Zeng, Liangjun Zhong, Liang Zhao, Tianwen Wei, Liu Yang, Jujie He, Cheng Cheng, Rui Hu, Yang Liu, Shuicheng Yan, Han Fang, Yahui Zhou","In this paper, we investigate the underlying factors that potentially enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We argue that the data scaling law for math reasoning capabilities in modern LLMs is far from being saturated, highlighting how the model's quality improves with increases in data quantity. To support this claim, we introduce the Skywork-Math model series, supervised fine-tuned (SFT) on common 7B LLMs using our proposed 2.5M-instance Skywork-MathQA dataset. Skywork-Math 7B has achieved impressive accuracies of 51.2% on the competition-level MATH benchmark and 83.9% on the GSM8K benchmark using only SFT data, outperforming an early version of GPT-4 on MATH. The superior performance of Skywork-Math models contributes to our novel two-stage data synthesis and model SFT pipelines, which include three different augmentation methods and a diverse seed problem set, ensuring both the quantity and quality of Skywork-MathQA dataset across varying difficulty levels. Most importantly, we provide several practical takeaways to enhance math reasoning abilities in LLMs for both research and industry applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08348v2,2024-07
Towards Explainable Evolution Strategies with Large Language Models,"Jill Baumann, Oliver Kramer","This paper introduces an approach that integrates self-adaptive Evolution Strategies (ES) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the explainability of complex optimization processes. By employing a self-adaptive ES equipped with a restart mechanism, we effectively navigate the challenging landscapes of benchmark functions, capturing detailed logs of the optimization journey. The logs include fitness evolution, step-size adjustments and restart events due to stagnation. An LLM is then utilized to process these logs, generating concise, user-friendly summaries that highlight key aspects such as convergence behavior, optimal fitness achievements, and encounters with local optima. Our case study on the Rastrigin function demonstrates how our approach makes the complexities of ES optimization transparent. Our findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to bridge the gap between advanced optimization algorithms and their interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08331v2,2024-07
RB-SQL: A Retrieval-based LLM Framework for Text-to-SQL,"Zhenhe Wu, Zhongqiu Li, Jie Zhang, Mengxiang Li, Yu Zhao, Ruiyu Fang, Zhongjiang He, Xuelong Li, Zhoujun Li, Shuangyong Song","Large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning have significantly improved the performance of text-to-SQL task. Previous works generally focus on using exclusive SQL generation prompt to improve the LLMs' reasoning ability. However, they are mostly hard to handle large databases with numerous tables and columns, and usually ignore the significance of pre-processing database and extracting valuable information for more efficient prompt engineering. Based on above analysis, we propose RB-SQL, a novel retrieval-based LLM framework for in-context prompt engineering, which consists of three modules that retrieve concise tables and columns as schema, and targeted examples for in-context learning. Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than several competitive baselines on public datasets BIRD and Spider.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08273v2,2024-07
LLMs' morphological analyses of complex FST-generated Finnish words,"Anssi Moisio, Mathias Creutz, Mikko Kurimo","Rule-based language processing systems have been overshadowed by neural systems in terms of utility, but it remains unclear whether neural NLP systems, in practice, learn the grammar rules that humans use. This work aims to shed light on the issue by evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs in a task of morphological analysis of complex Finnish noun forms. We generate the forms using an FST tool, and they are unlikely to have occurred in the training sets of the LLMs, therefore requiring morphological generalisation capacity. We find that GPT-4-turbo has some difficulties in the task while GPT-3.5-turbo struggles and smaller models Llama2-70B and Poro-34B fail nearly completely.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08269v1,2024-07

Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 51% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08223v1,2024-07

In this work, we construct a dataset of images and goals across different scenarios such as searching through kitchens or navigating outdoors. We then investigate how grounded instruction generation methods can provide contextually-relevant navigational guidance to users in these instances. Through a sighted user study, we demonstrate that large pretrained language models can produce correct and useful instructions perceived as beneficial for BLV users. We also conduct a survey and interview with 4 BLV users and observe useful insights on preferences for different instructions based on the scenario.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08219v1,2024-07

A Text-to-Game Engine for UGC-Based Role-Playing Games,"Lei Zhang, Xuezheng Peng, Shuyi Yang, Feiyang Wang","The shift from professionally generated content (PGC) to user-generated content (UGC) has revolutionized various media formats, from text to video. With the rapid advancements in generative AI, a similar shift is set to transform the game industry, particularly in the realm of role-playing games (RPGs). This paper introduces a new framework for a text-to-game engine that utilizes foundation models to convert simple textual inputs into complex, interactive RPG experiences. The engine dynamically renders the game story in a multi-modal format and adjusts the game character, environment, and mechanics in real-time in response to player actions. Using this framework, we developed the ""Zagii"" game engine, which has successfully supported hundreds of RPG games across a diverse range of genres and facilitated tens of thousands of online user gameplay instances. This validates the effectiveness of our frame-work.

fairBERTs: Erasing Sensitive Information Through Semantic and Fairness-aware Perturbations,"Jinfeng Li, Yuefeng Chen, Xiangyu Liu, Longtao Huang, Rong Zhang, Hui Xue","Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have revolutionized both the natural language processing research and applications. However, stereotypical biases (e.g., gender and racial discrimination) encoded in PLMs have raised negative ethical implications for PLMs, which critically limits their broader applications. To address the aforementioned unfairness issues, we present fairBERTs, a general framework for learning fair fine-tuned BERT series models by erasing the protected sensitive information via semantic and fairness-aware perturbations generated by a generative adversarial network. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two real-world tasks, we demonstrate the great superiority of fairBERTs in mitigating unfairness while maintaining the model utility. We also verify the feasibility of transferring adversarial components in fairBERTs to other conventionally trained BERT-like models for yielding fairness improvements. Our findings may shed light on further research on building fairer fine-tuned PLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08189v1,2024-07
Automatic Generation of Web Censorship Probe Lists,"Jenny Tang, Leo Alvarez, Arjun Brar, Nguyen Phong Hoang, Nicolas Christin","Domain probe lists--used to determine which URLs to probe for Web censorship--play a critical role in Internet censorship measurement studies. Indeed, the size and accuracy of the domain probe list limits the set of censored pages that can be detected; inaccurate lists can lead to an incomplete view of the censorship landscape or biased results. Previous efforts to generate domain probe lists have been mostly manual or crowdsourced. This approach is time-consuming, prone to errors, and does not scale well to the ever-changing censorship landscape.   In this paper, we explore methods for automatically generating probe lists that are both comprehensive and up-to-date for Web censorship measurement. We start from an initial set of 139,957 unique URLs from various existing test lists consisting of pages from a variety of languages to generate new candidate pages. By analyzing content from these URLs (i.e., performing topic and keyword extraction), expanding these topics, and using them as a feed to search engines, our method produces 119,255 new URLs across 35,147 domains. We then test the new candidate pages by attempting to access each URL from servers in eleven different global locations over a span of four months to check for their connectivity and potential signs of censorship. Our measurements reveal that our method discovered over 1,400 domains--not present in the original dataset--we suspect to be blocked. In short, automatically updating probe lists is possible, and can help further automate censorship measurements at scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08185v1,2024-07

Privacy-Preserving Data Deduplication for Enhancing Federated Learning of Language Models (Extended Version),"Aydin Abadi, Vishnu Asutosh Dasu, Sumanta Sarkar","Deduplication is a vital preprocessing step that enhances machine learning model performance and saves training time and energy. However, enhancing federated learning through deduplication poses challenges, especially regarding scalability and potential privacy violations if deduplication involves sharing all clients' data. In this paper, we address the problem of deduplication in a federated setup by introducing a pioneering protocol, Efficient Privacy-Preserving Multi-Party Deduplication (EP-MPD). It efficiently removes duplicates from multiple clients' datasets without compromising data privacy. EP-MPD is constructed in a modular fashion, utilizing two novel variants of the Private Set Intersection protocol. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of deduplication in federated learning of large language models. For instance, we observe up to 19.62\% improvement in perplexity and up to 27.95\% reduction in running time while varying the duplication level between 10\% and 30\%. EP-MPD effectively balances privacy and performance in federated learning, making it a valuable solution for large-scale applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08152v2,2024-07
Looks can be Deceptive: Distinguishing Repetition Disfluency from Reduplication,"Arif Ahmad, Mothika Gayathri Khyathi, Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Reduplication and repetition, though similar in form, serve distinct linguistic purposes. Reduplication is a deliberate morphological process used to express grammatical, semantic, or pragmatic nuances, while repetition is often unintentional and indicative of disfluency. This paper presents the first large-scale study of reduplication and repetition in speech using computational linguistics. We introduce IndicRedRep, a new publicly available dataset containing Hindi, Telugu, and Marathi text annotated with reduplication and repetition at the word level. We evaluate transformer-based models for multi-class reduplication and repetition token classification, utilizing the Reparandum-Interregnum-Repair structure to distinguish between the two phenomena.

How Well Can a Long Sequence Model Model Long Sequences? Comparing Architechtural Inductive Biases on Long-Context Abilities,Jerry Huang,"Long sequences occur in abundance within real-world scenarios, hence properly modelling them opens numerous down-stream use-cases. Deep neural networks, however, have often struggled with these for a variety of reasons. Recent advances, both in system engineering as well as model design, have enabled the scaling up of model that are purported to support extended context length. In particular, the state-space and linear recurrent neural network families of models hypothetically can entend to infinite sequence lenth. However, is this too good to be true? We conduct an evaluation to show that while such claims may be sound theoretically, there remain large practical gaps that are empirically observed. In particular, recurrent models still suffer in the same settings as long-context LLMs with attention. We further show that different inductive biases have inconsistent extrapolation capabilities, highlighting the need to further study such paradigms and investigate why long-context models seemingly fail to behave as one might expect.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08112v2,2024-07
Automata-based constraints for language model decoding,"Terry Koo, Frederick Liu, Luheng He","Language models (LMs) are often expected to generate strings in some formal language; for example, structured data, API calls, or code snippets. Although LMs can be tuned to improve their adherence to formal syntax, this does not guarantee conformance, especially with smaller LMs suitable for large-scale deployment. In addition, tuning requires significant resources, making it impractical for uncommon or task-specific formats. To prevent downstream parsing errors we would ideally constrain the LM to only produce valid output, but this is severely complicated by tokenization, which is typically both ambiguous and misaligned with the formal grammar. We solve these issues through the application of automata theory, deriving an efficient closed-form solution for the regular languages, a broad class of formal languages with many practical applications, including API calls or schema-guided JSON and YAML. We also discuss pragmatic extensions for coping with the issue of high branching factor, and extend our techniques to deterministic context-free languages, which similarly admit an efficient closed-form solution. Previous work on this topic (Willard and Louf, 2023) layers bespoke solutions onto automata, leading to problems with speed, correctness, and extensibility. Instead, we reformulate the entire task in terms of automata so we can leverage well-studied and well-optimized algorithms. Our system compiles constraints ~7,000x faster, is provably correct, and can be extended in a modular fashion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08103v3,2024-07
How does Burrows' Delta work on medieval Chinese poetic texts?,Boris Orekhov,"Burrows' Delta was introduced in 2002 and has proven to be an effective tool for author attribution. Despite the fact that these are different languages, they mostly belong to the same grammatical type and use the same graphic principle to convey speech in writing: a phonemic alphabet with word separation using spaces. The question I want to address in this article is how well this attribution method works with texts in a language with a different grammatical structure and a script based on different principles. There are fewer studies analyzing the effectiveness of the Delta method on Chinese texts than on texts in European languages. I believe that such a low level of attention to Delta from sinologists is due to the structure of the scientific field dedicated to medieval Chinese poetry. Clustering based on intertextual distances worked flawlessly. Delta produced results where clustering showed that the samples of one author were most similar to each other, and Delta never confused different poets. Despite the fact that I used an unconventional approach and applied the Delta method to a language poorly suited for it, the method demonstrated its effectiveness. Tang dynasty poets are correctly identified using Delta, and the empirical pattern observed for authors writing in European standard languages has been confirmed once again.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08099v1,2024-07
Virtual Agents for Alcohol Use Counseling: Exploring LLM-Powered Motivational Interviewing,"Ian Steenstra, Farnaz Nouraei, Mehdi Arjmand, Timothy W.

Access to effective counseling remains limited, particularly for substance abuse, and virtual agents offer a promising solution by leveraging LLM capabilities to simulate nuanced communication techniques inherent in MI. Our approach combines prompt engineering and integration into a user-friendly virtual platform to facilitate realistic, empathetic interactions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our virtual agent through a series of studies focusing on replicating MI techniques and human counselor dialog. Initial findings suggest that our LLM-powered virtual agent matches human counselors' empathetic and adaptive conversational skills, presenting a significant step forward in virtual health counseling and providing insights into the design and implementation of LLM-based therapeutic interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08095v1,2024-07
RoLoRA: Fine-tuning Rotated Outlier-free LLMs for Effective Weight-Activation Quantization,"Xijie Huang, Zechun Liu, Shih-Yang Liu, Kwang-Ting Cheng","Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), as a representative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)method, significantly enhances the training efficiency by updating only a small portion of the weights in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, weight-only quantization techniques have also been applied to LoRA methods to reduce the memory footprint of fine-tuning. However, applying weight-activation quantization to the LoRA pipeline is under-explored, and we observe substantial performance degradation primarily due to the presence of activation outliers. In this work, we propose RoLoRA, the first LoRA-based scheme for effective weight-activation quantization. RoLoRA utilizes rotation for outlier elimination and proposes rotation-aware fine-tuning to preserve the outlier-free characteristics in rotated LLMs. Experimental results show RoLoRA consistently improves low-bit LoRA convergence and post-training quantization robustness in weight-activation settings. We evaluate RoLoRA across LLaMA2-7B/13B, LLaMA3-8B models, achieving up to 29.5% absolute accuracy gain of 4-bit weight-activation quantized LLaMA2- 13B on commonsense reasoning tasks compared to LoRA baseline. We further demonstrate its effectiveness on Large Multimodal Models (LLaVA-1.5-7B). Codes are available at https://github.com/HuangOwen/RoLoRA",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08044v2,2024-07
Knowledge Overshadowing Causes Amalgamated Hallucination in Large Language Models,"Yuji Zhang, Sha Li, Jiateng Liu, Pengfei Yu, Yi R. Fung, Jing Li, Manling Li, Heng Ji","Hallucination is often regarded as a major impediment for using large language models (LLMs), especially for knowledge-intensive tasks. Even when the training corpus consists solely of true statements, language models still generate hallucinations in the form of amalgamations of multiple facts. We coin this phenomenon as ``knowledge overshadowing'': when we query knowledge from a language model with multiple conditions, some conditions overshadow others, leading to hallucinated outputs. This phenomenon partially stems from training data imbalance, which we verify on both pretrained models and fine-tuned models, over a wide range of LM model families and sizes.From a theoretical point of view, knowledge overshadowing can be interpreted as over-generalization of the dominant conditions (patterns). We show that the hallucination rate grows with both the imbalance ratio (between the popular and unpopular condition) and the length of dominant condition description, consistent with our derived generalization bound. Finally, we propose to utilize overshadowing conditions as a signal to catch hallucination before it is produced, along with a training-free self-contrastive decoding method to alleviate hallucination during inference. Our proposed approach showcases up to 82% F1 for hallucination anticipation and 11.2% to 39.4% hallucination control, with different models and datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08039v1,2024-07
FsPONER: Few-shot Prompt Optimization for Named Entity Recognition in Domain-specific Scenarios,"Yongjian Tang, Rakebul Hasan, Thomas Runkler","Large Language Models (LLMs) have provided a new pathway for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. Compared with fine-tuning, LLM-powered prompting methods avoid the need for training, conserve substantial computational resources, and rely on minimal annotated data. Previous studies have achieved comparable performance to fully supervised BERT-based fine-tuning approaches on general NER benchmarks. However, none of the previous approaches has investigated the efficiency of LLM-based few-shot learning in domain-specific scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce FsPONER, a novel approach for optimizing few-shot prompts, and evaluate its performance on domain-specific NER datasets, with a focus on industrial manufacturing and maintenance, while using multiple LLMs -- GPT-4-32K, GPT-3.5-Turbo, LLaMA 2-chat, and Vicuna. FsPONER consists of three few-shot selection methods based on random sampling, TF-IDF vectors, and a combination of both. We compare these methods with a general-purpose GPT-NER method as the number of few-shot examples increases and evaluate their optimal NER performance against fine-tuned BERT and LLaMA 2-chat. In the considered real-world scenarios with data scarcity, FsPONER with TF-IDF surpasses fine-tuned models by approximately 10% in F1 score.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08035v1,2024-07

In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of LLM benchmarks for causality. We highlight how recent benchmarks move towards a more thorough definition of causal reasoning by incorporating interventional or counterfactual reasoning. We derive a set of criteria that a useful benchmark or set of benchmarks should aim to satisfy.

DS@GT eRisk 2024: Sentence Transformers for Social Media Risk Assessment,"David Guecha, Aaryan Potdar, Anthony Miyaguchi","We present working notes for DS@GT team in the eRisk 2024 for Tasks 1 and 3. We propose a ranking system for Task 1 that predicts symptoms of depression based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) questionnaire using binary classifiers trained on question relevancy as a proxy for ranking. We find that binary classifiers are not well calibrated for ranking, and perform poorly during evaluation. For Task 3, we use embeddings from BERT to predict the severity of eating disorder symptoms based on user post history. We find that classical machine learning models perform well on the task, and end up competitive with the baseline models.

Finlayson","Patent landscaping is the process of identifying all patents related to a particular technological area, and is important for assessing various aspects of the intellectual property context. Traditionally, constructing patent landscapes is intensely laborious and expensive, and the rapid expansion of patenting activity in recent decades has driven an increasing need for efficient and effective automated patent landscaping approaches. In particular, it is critical that we be able to construct patent landscapes using a minimal number of labeled examples, as labeling patents for a narrow technology area requires highly specialized (and hence expensive) technical knowledge. We present an automated neural patent landscaping system that demonstrates significantly improved performance on difficult examples (0.69 $F_1$ on 'hard' examples, versus 0.6 for previously reported systems), and also significant improvements with much less training data (overall 0.75 $F_1$ on as few as 24 examples). Furthermore, in evaluating such automated landscaping systems, acquiring good data is challenge; we demonstrate a higher-quality training data generation procedure by merging Abood and Feltenberger's (2018) ""seed/anti-seed"" approach with active learning to collect difficult labeled examples near the decision boundary. Using this procedure we created a new dataset of labeled AI patents for training and testing. As in prior work we compare our approach with a number of baseline systems, and we release our code and data for others to build upon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08001v1,2024-07
Rel-A.I.: An Interaction-Centered Approach To Measuring Human-LM Reliance,"Kaitlyn Zhou, Jena D. Hwang, Xiang Ren, Nouha Dziri, Dan Jurafsky, Maarten Sap","The ability to communicate uncertainty, risk, and limitation is crucial for the safety of large language models. However, current evaluations of these abilities rely on simple calibration, asking whether the language generated by the model matches appropriate probabilities. Instead, evaluation of this aspect of LLM communication should focus on the behaviors of their human interlocutors: how much do they rely on what the LLM says? Here we introduce an interaction-centered evaluation framework called Rel-A.I. (pronounced ""rely""}) that measures whether humans rely on LLM generations. We use this framework to study how reliance is affected by contextual features of the interaction (e.g, the knowledge domain that is being discussed), or the use of greetings communicating warmth or competence (e.g., ""I'm happy to help!""). We find that contextual characteristics significantly affect human reliance behavior. For example, people rely 10% more on LMs when responding to questions involving calculations and rely 30% more on LMs that are perceived as more competent. Our results show that calibration and language quality alone are insufficient in evaluating the risks of human-LM interactions, and illustrate the need to consider features of the interactional context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07950v2,2024-07
LitSearch: A Retrieval Benchmark for Scientific Literature Search,"Anirudh Ajith, Mengzhou Xia, Alexis Chevalier, Tanya Goyal, Danqi Chen, Tianyu Gao","Literature search questions, such as ""Where can I find research on the evaluation of consistency in generated summaries?"" pose significant challenges for modern search engines and retrieval systems. These questions often require a deep understanding of research concepts and the ability to reason across entire articles. In this work, we introduce LitSearch, a retrieval benchmark comprising 597 realistic literature search queries about recent ML and NLP papers. LitSearch is constructed using a combination of (1) questions generated by GPT-4 based on paragraphs containing inline citations from research papers and (2) questions manually written by authors about their recently published papers. All LitSearch questions were manually examined or edited by experts to ensure high quality. We extensively benchmark state-of-the-art retrieval models and also evaluate two LLM-based reranking pipelines. We find a significant performance gap between BM25 and state-of-the-art dense retrievers, with a 24.8% absolute difference in recall@5. The LLM-based reranking strategies further improve the best-performing dense retriever by 4.4%. Additionally, commercial search engines and research tools like Google Search perform poorly on LitSearch, lagging behind the best dense retriever by up to 32 recall points. Taken together, these results show that LitSearch is an informative new testbed for retrieval systems while catering to a real-world use case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18940v2,2024-07
"LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave: Tackling Multi-image, Video, and 3D in Large Multimodal Models","Feng Li, Renrui Zhang, Hao Zhang, Yuanhan Zhang, Bo Li, Wei Li, Zejun Ma, Chunyuan Li","Visual instruction tuning has made considerable strides in enhancing the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, existing open LMMs largely focus on single-image tasks, their applications to multi-image scenarios remains less explored. Additionally, prior LMM research separately tackles different scenarios, leaving it impossible to generalize cross scenarios with new emerging capabilities. To this end, we introduce LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave, which simultaneously tackles Multi-image, Multi-frame (video), Multi-view (3D), and Multi-patch (single-image) scenarios in LMMs. To enable these capabilities, we regard the interleaved data format as a general template and compile the M4-Instruct dataset with 1,177.6k samples, spanning 4 primary domains with 14 tasks and 41 datasets. We also curate the LLaVA-Interleave Bench to comprehensively evaluate the multi-image performance of LMMs. Through extensive experiments, LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave achieves leading results in multi-image, video, and 3D benchmarks, while maintaining the performance of single-image tasks. Besides, our model also exhibits several emerging capabilities, e.g., transferring tasks across different settings and modalities.

Training on the Test Task Confounds Evaluation and Emergence,"Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo, Florian E. Dorner, Moritz Hardt","We study a fundamental problem in the evaluation of large language models that we call training on the test task. Unlike wrongful practices like training on the test data, leakage, or data contamination, training on the test task is not a malpractice. Rather, the term describes a growing set of practices that utilize knowledge about evaluation tasks at training time. We demonstrate that training on the test task confounds both relative model evaluations and claims about emergent capabilities. We argue that the seeming superiority of one model family over another may be explained by a different degree of training on the test task. To this end, we propose an effective method to adjust for the effect of training on the test task on benchmark evaluations. Put simply, to fine-tune each model under comparison on the same task-relevant data before evaluation. We then show that instances of emergent behavior disappear gradually as models train on the test task. Our work promotes a new perspective on the evaluation of large language models with broad implications for benchmarking and the study of emergent capabilities",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07890v2,2024-07
EfficientQAT: Efficient Quantization-Aware Training for Large Language Models,"Mengzhao Chen, Wenqi Shao, Peng Xu, Jiahao Wang, Peng Gao, Kaipeng Zhang, Ping Luo","Large language models (LLMs) are crucial in modern natural language processing and artificial intelligence. However, they face challenges in managing their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware training (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit representations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to substantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient Quantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm. EfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all parameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters (E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable direct training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization. E2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end, further improving the performance of quantized models by considering interactions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of models, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with scales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance, EfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41 hours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full precision (69.48 vs. 72.41).

Towards Robust Alignment of Language Models: Distributionally Robustifying Direct Preference Optimization,"Junkang Wu, Yuexiang Xie, Zhengyi Yang, Jiancan Wu, Jiawei Chen, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He","This study addresses the challenge of noise in training datasets for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a method for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. We categorize noise into pointwise noise, which includes low-quality data points, and pairwise noise, which encompasses erroneous data pair associations that affect preference rankings. Utilizing Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), we enhance DPO's resilience to these types of noise. Our theoretical insights reveal that DPO inherently embeds DRO principles, conferring robustness to pointwise noise, with the regularization coefficient $\beta$ playing a critical role in its noise resistance. Extending this framework, we introduce Distributionally Robustifying DPO (Dr. DPO), which integrates pairwise robustness by optimizing against worst-case pairwise scenarios. The novel hyperparameter $\beta'$ in Dr. DPO allows for fine-tuned control over data pair reliability, providing a strategic balance between exploration and exploitation in noisy training environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Dr. DPO substantially improves the quality of generated text and response accuracy in preference datasets, showcasing enhanced performance in both noisy and noise-free settings.

Generative Image as Action Models,"Mohit Shridhar, Yat Long Lo, Stephen James","Image-generation diffusion models have been fine-tuned to unlock new capabilities such as image-editing and novel view synthesis. Can we similarly unlock image-generation models for visuomotor control? We present GENIMA, a behavior-cloning agent that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to 'draw joint-actions' as targets on RGB images. These images are fed into a controller that maps the visual targets into a sequence of joint-positions. We study GENIMA on 25 RLBench and 9 real-world manipulation tasks. We find that, by lifting actions into image-space, internet pre-trained diffusion models can generate policies that outperform state-of-the-art visuomotor approaches, especially in robustness to scene perturbations and generalizing to novel objects. Our method is also competitive with 3D agents, despite lacking priors such as depth, keypoints, or motion-planners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07875v2,2024-07

This includes fine-tuning embeddings and LLMs, extracting documents from vector databases, rephrasing queries, reranking results, designing prompts, honoring document access controls, providing concise responses, including references, safeguarding personal information, and building orchestration agents. We present a framework for building RAG-based chatbots based on our experience with three NVIDIA chatbots: for IT/HR benefits, financial earnings, and general content.

Decompose and Compare Consistency: Measuring VLMs' Answer Reliability via Task-Decomposition Consistency Comparison,"Qian Yang, Weixiang Yan, Aishwarya Agrawal","Despite tremendous advancements, current state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are still far from perfect. They tend to hallucinate and may generate biased responses. In such circumstances, having a way to assess the reliability of a given response generated by a VLM is quite useful. Existing methods, such as estimating uncertainty using answer likelihoods or prompt-based confidence generation, often suffer from overconfidence. Other methods use self-consistency comparison but are affected by confirmation biases. To alleviate these, we propose Decompose and Compare Consistency (DeCC) for reliability measurement. By comparing the consistency between the direct answer generated using the VLM's internal reasoning process, and the indirect answers obtained by decomposing the question into sub-questions and reasoning over the sub-answers produced by the VLM, DeCC measures the reliability of VLM's direct answer. Experiments across six vision-language tasks with three VLMs show DeCC's reliability estimation achieves better correlation with task accuracy compared to the existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07840v3,2024-07
Transformer Block Coupling and its Correlation with Generalization in LLMs,"Murdock Aubry, Haoming Meng, Anton Sugolov, Vardan Papyan","Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language processing, and a precise understanding of the internal mechanisms driving their success is essential. In this work, we trace the trajectories of individual tokens as they pass through transformer blocks, and linearize the system along these trajectories through their Jacobian matrices. By examining the relationships between these Jacobians, we uncover a $\textbf{transformer block coupling}$ phenomenon in a variety of LLMs, characterized by the coupling of their top singular vectors across tokens and depth. Our findings reveal that coupling $\textit{positively correlates}$ with model performance, and that this relationship is stronger than with other hyperparameters, namely parameter budget, model depth, and embedding dimension. We further investigate the emergence of these properties through training, noting the development of coupling, as well as an increase in linearity and layer-wise exponential growth in the token trajectories. These collective insights provide a novel perspective on the interactions between token embeddings, and prompt further approaches to study training and generalization in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07810v3,2024-07
ROSA: Random Subspace Adaptation for Efficient Fine-Tuning,"Marawan Gamal Abdel Hameed, Aristides Milios, Siva Reddy, Guillaume Rabusseau","Model training requires significantly more memory, compared with inference. Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods provide a means of adapting large models to downstream tasks using less memory. However, existing methods such as adapters, prompt tuning or low-rank adaptation (LoRA) either introduce latency overhead at inference time or achieve subpar downstream performance compared with full fine-tuning. In this work we propose Random Subspace Adaptation (ROSA), a method that outperforms previous PEFT methods by a significant margin, while maintaining a zero latency overhead during inference time. In contrast to previous methods, ROSA is able to adapt subspaces of arbitrarily large dimension, better approximating full-finetuning. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that this makes ROSA strictly more expressive than LoRA, without consuming additional memory during runtime. As PEFT methods are especially useful in the natural language processing domain, where models operate on scales that make full fine-tuning very expensive, we evaluate ROSA in two common NLP scenarios: natural language generation (NLG) and natural language understanding (NLU) with GPT-2 and RoBERTa, respectively. We show that on almost every GLUE task ROSA outperforms LoRA by a significant margin, while also outperforming LoRA on NLG tasks.

AVCap utilizes audio-visual features as text tokens, which has many advantages not only in performance but also in the extensibility and scalability of the model. AVCap is designed around three pivotal dimensions: the exploration of optimal audio-visual encoder architectures, the adaptation of pre-trained models according to the characteristics of generated text, and the investigation into the efficacy of modality fusion in captioning.

Attribute or Abstain: Large Language Models as Long Document Assistants,"Jan Buchmann, Xiao Liu, Iryna Gurevych","LLMs can help humans working with long documents, but are known to hallucinate. Attribution can increase trust in LLM responses: The LLM provides evidence that supports its response, which enhances verifiability. Existing approaches to attribution have only been evaluated in RAG settings, where the initial retrieval confounds LLM performance. This is crucially different from the long document setting, where retrieval is not needed, but could help. Thus, a long document specific evaluation of attribution is missing. To fill this gap, we present LAB, a benchmark of 6 diverse long document tasks with attribution, and experiments with different approaches to attribution on 5 LLMs of different sizes.   We find that citation, i.e. response generation and evidence extraction in one step, performs best for large and fine-tuned models, while additional retrieval can help for small, prompted models. We investigate whether the ""Lost in the Middle'' phenomenon exists for attribution, but do not find this. We also find that evidence quality can predict response quality on datasets with simple responses, but not so for complex responses, as models struggle with providing evidence for complex claims.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07799v2,2024-07
Evaluating Large Language Models with Grid-Based Game Competitions: An Extensible LLM Benchmark and Leaderboard,"Oguzhan Topsakal, Colby Jacob Edell, Jackson Bailey Harper","We introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for large language models (LLMs) through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Gomoku. The open-source game simulation code, available on GitHub, allows LLMs to compete and generates detailed data files in JSON, CSV, TXT, and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis. We present the results of games among leading LLMs, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google, GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI, and Llama3-70B by Meta. We also encourage submissions of results from other LLMs. In total, we simulated 2,310 matches (5 sessions for each pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games, using three distinct prompt types: list, illustration, and image. The results revealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games and prompt types, with analysis covering win and disqualification rates, missed opportunity analysis, and invalid move analysis. The details of the leaderboard and result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub. This study enhances our understanding of LLMs' capabilities in playing games they were not specifically trained for, helping to assess their rule comprehension and strategic thinking. On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), this study lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complex decision-making scenarios, illuminating their strategic thinking abilities and offering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs within game-based frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07796v2,2024-07
Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities,"Tianjie Ju, Yiting Wang, Xinbei Ma, Pengzhou Cheng, Haodong Zhao, Yulong Wang, Lifeng Liu, Jian Xie, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu","The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems has highlighted their impressive capabilities in various applications, such as collaborative problem-solving and autonomous negotiation. However, the security implications of these LLM-based multi-agent systems have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly concerning the spread of manipulated knowledge. In this paper, we investigate this critical issue by constructing a detailed threat model and a comprehensive simulation environment that mirrors real-world multi-agent deployments in a trusted platform. Subsequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack method involving Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge Injection to systematically explore the potential for manipulated knowledge (i.e., counterfactual and toxic knowledge) spread without explicit prompt manipulation.   Our method leverages the inherent vulnerabilities of LLMs in handling world knowledge, which can be exploited by attackers to unconsciously spread fabricated information. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication. Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions. This persistence indicates that even after the interaction has ended, the benign agents may continue to be influenced by manipulated knowledge. Our findings reveal significant security risks in LLM-based multi-agent systems, emphasizing the imperative need for robust defenses against manipulated knowledge spread, such as introducing ``guardian'' agents and advanced fact-checking tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07791v2,2024-07
WorldAPIs: The World Is Worth How Many APIs? A Thought Experiment,"Jiefu Ou, Arda Uzunoglu, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi","AI systems make decisions in physical environments through primitive actions or affordances that are accessed via API calls. While deploying AI agents in the real world involves numerous high-level actions, existing embodied simulators offer a limited set of domain-salient APIs. This naturally brings up the questions: how many primitive actions (APIs) are needed for a versatile embodied agent, and what should they look like? We explore this via a thought experiment: assuming that wikiHow tutorials cover a wide variety of human-written tasks, what is the space of APIs needed to cover these instructions? We propose a framework to iteratively induce new APIs by grounding wikiHow instruction to situated agent policies. Inspired by recent successes in large language models (LLMs) for embodied planning, we propose a few-shot prompting to steer GPT-4 to generate Pythonic programs as agent policies and bootstrap a universe of APIs by 1) reusing a seed set of APIs; and then 2) fabricate new API calls when necessary. The focus of this thought experiment is on defining these APIs rather than their executability. We apply the proposed pipeline on instructions from wikiHow tutorials. On a small fraction (0.5%) of tutorials, we induce an action space of 300+ APIs necessary for capturing the rich variety of tasks in the physical world. A detailed automatic and human analysis of the induction output reveals that the proposed pipeline enables effective reuse and creation of APIs. Moreover, a manual review revealed that existing simulators support only a small subset of the induced APIs (9 of the top 50 frequent APIs), motivating the development of action-rich embodied environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07778v1,2024-07

Multi-task Prompt Words Learning for Social Media Content Generation,"Haochen Xue, Chong Zhang, Chengzhi Liu, Fangyu Wu, Xiaobo Jin","The rapid development of the Internet has profoundly changed human life. Humans are increasingly expressing themselves and interacting with others on social media platforms. However, although artificial intelligence technology has been widely used in many aspects of life, its application in social media content creation is still blank. To solve this problem, we propose a new prompt word generation framework based on multi-modal information fusion, which combines multiple tasks including topic classification, sentiment analysis, scene recognition and keyword extraction to generate more comprehensive prompt words. Subsequently, we use a template containing a set of prompt words to guide ChatGPT to generate high-quality tweets. Furthermore, in the absence of effective and objective evaluation criteria in the field of content generation, we use the ChatGPT tool to evaluate the results generated by the algorithm, making large-scale evaluation of content generation algorithms possible.

We derive a novel user-level DP accountant that allows us to compute provably tight privacy guarantees for ELS. Using this, we show that while ELS can outperform ULS in specific settings, ULS generally yields better results when each user has a diverse collection of examples. We validate our findings through experiments in synthetic mean estimation and LLM fine-tuning tasks under fixed compute budgets. We find that ULS is significantly better in settings where either (1) strong privacy guarantees are required, or (2) the compute budget is large.

Teaching Transformers Causal Reasoning through Axiomatic Training,"Aniket Vashishtha, Abhinav Kumar, Abbavaram Gowtham Reddy, Vineeth N Balasubramanian, Amit Sharma","For text-based AI systems to interact in the real world, causal reasoning is an essential skill. Since interventional data is costly to generate, we study to what extent an agent can learn causal reasoning from passive data. Specifically, we consider an axiomatic training setup where an agent learns from multiple demonstrations of a causal axiom (or rule), rather than incorporating the axiom as an inductive bias or inferring it from data values. A key question is whether the agent would learn to generalize from the axiom demonstrations to new scenarios. For example, if a transformer model is trained on demonstrations of the causal transitivity axiom over small graphs, would it generalize to applying the transitivity axiom over large graphs? Our results, based on a novel axiomatic training scheme, indicate that such generalization is possible. We consider the task of inferring whether a variable causes another variable, given a causal graph structure. We find that a 67 million parameter transformer model, when trained on linear causal chains (along with some noisy variations) can generalize well to new kinds of graphs, including longer causal chains, causal chains with reversed order, and graphs with branching; even when it is not explicitly trained for such settings. Our model performs at par (or even better) than many larger language models such as GPT-4, Gemini Pro, and Phi-3. Overall, our axiomatic training framework provides a new paradigm of learning causal reasoning from passive data that can be used to learn arbitrary axioms, as long as sufficient demonstrations can be generated.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07612v1,2024-07

HebDB: a Weakly Supervised Dataset for Hebrew Speech Processing,"Arnon Turetzky, Or Tal, Yael Segal-Feldman, Yehoshua Dissen, Ella Zeldes, Amit Roth, Eyal Cohen, Yosi Shrem, Bronya R. Chernyak, Olga Seleznova, Joseph Keshet, Yossi Adi","We present HebDB, a weakly supervised dataset for spoken language processing in the Hebrew language. HebDB offers roughly 2500 hours of natural and spontaneous speech recordings in the Hebrew language, consisting of a large variety of speakers and topics. We provide raw recordings together with a pre-processed, weakly supervised, and filtered version. The goal of HebDB is to further enhance research and development of spoken language processing tools for the Hebrew language. Hence, we additionally provide two baseline systems for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): (i) a self-supervised model; and (ii) a fully supervised model. We present the performance of these two methods optimized on HebDB and compare them to current multi-lingual ASR alternatives. Results suggest the proposed method reaches better results than the evaluated baselines considering similar model sizes.

On Leakage of Code Generation Evaluation Datasets,"Alexandre Matton, Tom Sherborne, Dennis Aumiller, Elena Tommasone, Milad Alizadeh, Jingyi He, Raymond Ma, Maxime Voisin, Ellen Gilsenan-McMahon, Matthias Gallé","In this paper, we consider contamination by code generation test sets, in particular in their use in modern large language models. We discuss three possible sources of such contamination and show findings supporting each of them: (i) direct data leakage, (ii) indirect data leakage through the use of synthetic data and (iii) overfitting to evaluation sets during model selection. To address this, we release Less Basic Python Problems (LBPP): an uncontaminated new benchmark of 161 prompts with their associated Python solutions.

CiteME: Can Language Models Accurately Cite Scientific Claims?,"Ori Press, Andreas Hochlehnert, Ameya Prabhu, Vishaal Udandarao, Ofir Press, Matthias Bethge","Thousands of new scientific papers are published each month. Such information overload complicates researcher efforts to stay current with the state-of-the-art as well as to verify and correctly attribute claims. We pose the following research question: Given a text excerpt referencing a paper, could an LM act as a research assistant to correctly identify the referenced paper? We advance efforts to answer this question by building a benchmark that evaluates the abilities of LMs in citation attribution. Our benchmark, CiteME, consists of text excerpts from recent machine learning papers, each referencing a single other paper. CiteME use reveals a large gap between frontier LMs and human performance, with LMs achieving only 4.2-18.5% accuracy and humans 69.7%. We close this gap by introducing CiteAgent, an autonomous system built on the GPT-4o LM that can also search and read papers, which achieves an accuracy of 35.3\% on CiteME. Overall, CiteME serves as a challenging testbed for open-ended claim attribution, driving the research community towards a future where any claim made by an LM can be automatically verified and discarded if found to be incorrect.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12861v2,2024-07
Arabic Automatic Story Generation with Large Language Models,"Ahmed Oumar El-Shangiti, Fakhraddin Alwajih, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed","Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for a wide range of language generation tasks. Nevertheless, this progress has been slower in Arabic. In this work, we focus on the task of generating stories from LLMs. For our training, we use stories acquired through machine translation (MT) as well as GPT-4. For the MT data, we develop a careful pipeline that ensures we acquire high-quality stories. For our GPT-41 data, we introduce crafted prompts that allow us to generate data well-suited to the Arabic context in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and two Arabic dialects (Egyptian and Moroccan). For example, we generate stories tailored to various Arab countries on a wide host of topics. Our manual evaluation shows that our model fine-tuned on these training datasets can generate coherent stories that adhere to our instructions. We also conduct an extensive automatic and human evaluation comparing our models against state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. Our datasets and models will be made publicly available at https: //github.com/UBC-NLP/arastories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07551v1,2024-07
Was it Slander? Towards Exact Inversion of Generative Language Models,"Adrians Skapars, Edoardo Manino, Youcheng Sun, Lucas C. Cordeiro","Training large language models (LLMs) requires a substantial investment of time and money. To get a good return on investment, the developers spend considerable effort ensuring that the model never produces harmful and offensive outputs. However, bad-faith actors may still try to slander the reputation of an LLM by publicly reporting a forged output. In this paper, we show that defending against such slander attacks requires reconstructing the input of the forged output or proving that it does not exist. To do so, we propose and evaluate a search based approach for targeted adversarial attacks for LLMs. Our experiments show that we are rarely able to reconstruct the exact input of an arbitrary output, thus demonstrating that LLMs are still vulnerable to slander attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11059v1,2024-07
Beyond Benchmarking: A New Paradigm for Evaluation and Assessment of Large Language Models,"Jin Liu, Qingquan Li, Wenlong Du","In current benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs), there are issues such as evaluation content restriction, untimely updates, and lack of optimization guidance. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for the measurement of LLMs: Benchmarking-Evaluation-Assessment. Our paradigm shifts the ""location"" of LLM evaluation from the ""examination room"" to the ""hospital"". Through conducting a ""physical examination"" on LLMs, it utilizes specific task-solving as the evaluation content, performs deep attribution of existing problems within LLMs, and provides recommendation for optimization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07531v1,2024-07
Bucket Pre-training is All You Need,"Hongtao Liu, Qiyao Peng, Qing Yang, Kai Liu, Hongyan Xu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, the conventional fixed-length data composition strategy for pretraining, which involves concatenating and splitting documents, can introduce noise and limit the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we first introduce three metrics for evaluating data composition quality: padding ratio, truncation ratio, and concatenation ratio. We further propose a multi-bucket data composition method that moves beyond the fixed-length paradigm, offering a more flexible and efficient approach to pretraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method could significantly improving both the efficiency and efficacy of LLMs pretraining. Our approach not only reduces noise and preserves context but also accelerates training, making it a promising solution for LLMs pretraining.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07495v1,2024-07
Review-LLM: Harnessing Large Language Models for Personalized Review Generation,"Qiyao Peng, Hongtao Liu, Hongyan Xu, Qing Yang, Minglai Shao, Wenjun Wang","Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation. However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the ``polite'' phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews). In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation. Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews. This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style. Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model's understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item. Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07487v1,2024-07
STAGE: Simplified Text-Attributed Graph Embeddings Using Pre-trained LLMs,"Aaron Zolnai-Lucas, Jack Boylan, Chris Hokamp, Parsa Ghaffari","We present Simplified Text-Attributed Graph Embeddings (STAGE), a straightforward yet effective method for enhancing node features in Graph Neural Network (GNN) models that encode Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs). Our approach leverages Large-Language Models (LLMs) to generate embeddings for textual attributes. STAGE achieves competitive results on various node classification benchmarks while also maintaining a simplicity in implementation relative to current state-of-the-art (SoTA) techniques. We show that utilizing pre-trained LLMs as embedding generators provides robust features for ensemble GNN training, enabling pipelines that are simpler than current SoTA approaches which require multiple expensive training and prompting stages. We also implement diffusion-pattern GNNs in an effort to make this pipeline scalable to graphs beyond academic benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12860v1,2024-07
Dynamic Encoder Size Based on Data-Driven Layer-wise Pruning for Speech Recognition,"Jingjing Xu, Wei Zhou, Zijian Yang, Eugen Beck, Ralf Schlueter","Varying-size models are often required to deploy ASR systems under different hardware and/or application constraints such as memory and latency. To avoid redundant training and optimization efforts for individual models of different sizes, we present the dynamic encoder size approach, which jointly trains multiple performant models within one supernet from scratch. These subnets of various sizes are layer-wise pruned from the supernet, and thus, enjoy full parameter sharing. By combining score-based pruning with supernet training, we propose two novel methods, Simple-Top-k and Iterative-Zero-Out, to automatically select the best-performing subnets in a data-driven manner, avoiding resource-intensive search efforts. Our experiments using CTC on both Librispeech and TED-LIUM-v2 corpora show that our methods can achieve on-par performance as individually trained models of each size category. Also, our approach consistently brings small performance improvements for the full-size supernet.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18930v1,2024-07
GLBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph with Large Language Models,"Yuhan Li, Peisong Wang, Xiao Zhu, Aochuan Chen, Haiyun Jiang, Deng Cai, Victor Wai Kin Chan, Jia Li","The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way we interact with graphs, leading to a new paradigm called GraphLLM. Despite the rapid development of GraphLLM methods in recent years, the progress and understanding of this field remain unclear due to the lack of a benchmark with consistent experimental protocols. To bridge this gap, we introduce GLBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GraphLLM methods in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios. GLBench provides a fair and thorough evaluation of different categories of GraphLLM methods, along with traditional baselines such as graph neural networks. Through extensive experiments on a collection of real-world datasets with consistent data processing and splitting strategies, we have uncovered several key findings. Firstly, GraphLLM methods outperform traditional baselines in supervised settings, with LLM-as-enhancers showing the most robust performance. However, using LLMs as predictors is less effective and often leads to uncontrollable output issues. We also notice that no clear scaling laws exist for current GraphLLM methods. In addition, both structures and semantics are crucial for effective zero-shot transfer, and our proposed simple baseline can even outperform several models tailored for zero-shot scenarios. The data and code of the benchmark can be found at https://github.com/NineAbyss/GLBench.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07457v4,2024-07
Automated Question Generation on Tabular Data for Conversational Data Exploration,"Ritwik Chaudhuri, Rajmohan C, Kirushikesh DB, Arvind Agarwal","Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an essential step for analyzing a dataset to derive insights. Several EDA techniques have been explored in the literature. Many of them leverage visualizations through various plots. But it is not easy to interpret them for a non-technical user, and producing appropriate visualizations is also tough when there are a large number of columns. Few other works provide a view of some interesting slices of data but it is still difficult for the user to draw relevant insights from them. Of late, conversational data exploration is gaining a lot of traction among non-technical users. It helps the user to explore the dataset without having deep technical knowledge about the data. Towards this, we propose a system that recommends interesting questions in natural language based on relevant slices of a dataset in a conversational setting. Specifically, given a dataset, we pick a select set of interesting columns and identify interesting slices of such columns and column combinations based on few interestingness measures. We use our own fine-tuned variation of a pre-trained language model(T5) to generate natural language questions in a specific manner. We then slot-fill values in the generated questions and rank them for recommendations. We show the utility of our proposed system in a coversational setting with a collection of real datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12859v1,2024-07
Explaining Spectrograms in Machine Learning: A Study on Neural Networks for Speech Classification,"Jesin James, Balamurali B.

By examining the activations and features of neural networks for vowel classification, we gain insights into what the networks ""see"" in spectrograms. Through the use of class activation mapping, we identify the frequencies that contribute to vowel classification and compare these findings with linguistic knowledge. Experiments on a American English dataset of vowels showcases the explainability of neural networks and provides valuable insights into the causes of misclassifications and their characteristics when differentiating them from unvoiced speech. This study not only enhances our understanding of the underlying acoustic cues in vowel classification but also offers opportunities for improving speech recognition by bridging the gap between abstract representations in neural networks and established linguistic knowledge",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17416v1,2024-07
Out-of-distribution generalisation in spoken language understanding,"Dejan Porjazovski, Anssi Moisio, Mikko Kurimo","Test data is said to be out-of-distribution (OOD) when it unexpectedly differs from the training data, a common challenge in real-world use cases of machine learning. Although OOD generalisation has gained interest in recent years, few works have focused on OOD generalisation in spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks. To facilitate research on this topic, we introduce a modified version of the popular SLU dataset SLURP, featuring data splits for testing OOD generalisation in the SLU task. We call our modified dataset SLURP For OOD generalisation, or SLURPFOOD. Utilising our OOD data splits, we find end-to-end SLU models to have limited capacity for generalisation. Furthermore, by employing model interpretability techniques, we shed light on the factors contributing to the generalisation difficulties of the models. To improve the generalisation, we experiment with two techniques, which improve the results on some, but not all the splits, emphasising the need for new techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07425v1,2024-07
"Search, Examine and Early-Termination: Fake News Detection with Annotation-Free Evidences","Yuzhou Yang, Yangming Zhou, Qichao Ying, Zhenxing Qian, Xinpeng Zhang","Pioneer researches recognize evidences as crucial elements in fake news detection apart from patterns. Existing evidence-aware methods either require laborious pre-processing procedures to assure relevant and high-quality evidence data, or incorporate the entire spectrum of available evidences in all news cases, regardless of the quality and quantity of the retrieved data. In this paper, we propose an approach named \textbf{SEE} that retrieves useful information from web-searched annotation-free evidences with an early-termination mechanism. The proposed SEE is constructed by three main phases: \textbf{S}earching online materials using the news as a query and directly using their titles as evidences without any annotating or filtering procedure, sequentially \textbf{E}xamining the news alongside with each piece of evidence via attention mechanisms to produce new hidden states with retrieved information, and allowing \textbf{E}arly-termination within the examining loop by assessing whether there is adequate confidence for producing a correct prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments on datasets with unprocessed evidences, i.e., Weibo21, GossipCop, and pre-processed evidences, namely Snopes and PolitiFact. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07931v1,2024-07
KpopMT: Translation Dataset with Terminology for Kpop Fandom,"JiWoo Kim, Yunsu Kim, JinYeong Bak","While machines learn from existing corpora, humans have the unique capability to establish and accept new language systems. This makes human form unique language systems within social groups. Aligning with this, we focus on a gap remaining in addressing translation challenges within social groups, where in-group members utilize unique terminologies. We propose KpopMT dataset, which aims to fill this gap by enabling precise terminology translation, choosing Kpop fandom as an initiative for social groups given its global popularity. Expert translators provide 1k English translations for Korean posts and comments, each annotated with specific terminology within social groups' language systems. We evaluate existing translation systems including GPT models on KpopMT to identify their failure cases. Results show overall low scores, underscoring the challenges of reflecting group-specific terminologies and styles in translation.

Automatic Extraction of Disease Risk Factors from Medical Publications,"Maxim Rubchinsky, Ella Rabinovich, Adi Shraibman, Netanel Golan, Tali Sahar, Dorit Shweiki","We present a novel approach to automating the identification of risk factors for diseases from medical literature, leveraging pre-trained models in the bio-medical domain, while tuning them for the specific task. Faced with the challenges of the diverse and unstructured nature of medical articles, our study introduces a multi-step system to first identify relevant articles, then classify them based on the presence of risk factor discussions and, finally, extract specific risk factor information for a disease through a question-answering model.   Our contributions include the development of a comprehensive pipeline for the automated extraction of risk factors and the compilation of several datasets, which can serve as valuable resources for further research in this area. These datasets encompass a wide range of diseases, as well as their associated risk factors, meticulously identified and validated through a fine-grained evaluation scheme. We conducted both automatic and thorough manual evaluation, demonstrating encouraging results. We also highlight the importance of improving models and expanding dataset comprehensiveness to keep pace with the rapidly evolving field of medical research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07373v1,2024-07

Our model performs strongly in natural language reasoning tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with 1.5B parameters or less. LokiLM is trained using multi-teacher knowledge distillation and high-quality training data to achieve benchmark results competitive with larger models trained on significantly more tokens. We support these findings by introducing steps to avoid benchmark contamination and overfitting throughout our development process. Despite its promising performance, LokiLM exhibits a concerning amount of hallucinations and scores poorly on the TruthfulQA benchmark, so we do not release the model publicly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07370v1,2024-07
Multilingual Blending: LLM Safety Alignment Evaluation with Language Mixture,"Jiayang Song, Yuheng Huang, Zhehua Zhou, Lei Ma","As safety remains a crucial concern throughout the development lifecycle of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers and industrial practitioners have increasingly focused on safeguarding and aligning LLM behaviors with human preferences and ethical standards. LLMs, trained on extensive multilingual corpora, exhibit powerful generalization abilities across diverse languages and domains. However, current safety alignment practices predominantly focus on single-language scenarios, which leaves their effectiveness in complex multilingual contexts, especially for those complex mixed-language formats, largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce Multilingual Blending, a mixed-language query-response scheme designed to evaluate the safety alignment of various state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, Llama3) under sophisticated, multilingual conditions. We further investigate language patterns such as language availability, morphology, and language family that could impact the effectiveness of Multilingual Blending in compromising the safeguards of LLMs. Our experimental results show that, without meticulously crafted prompt templates, Multilingual Blending significantly amplifies the detriment of malicious queries, leading to dramatically increased bypass rates in LLM safety alignment (67.23% on GPT-3.5 and 40.34% on GPT-4o), far exceeding those of single-language baselines. Moreover, the performance of Multilingual Blending varies notably based on intrinsic linguistic properties, with languages of different morphology and from diverse families being more prone to evading safety alignments. These findings underscore the necessity of evaluating LLMs and developing corresponding safety alignment strategies in a complex, multilingual context to align with their superior cross-language generalization capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07342v1,2024-07
MixSumm: Topic-based Data Augmentation using LLMs for Low-resource Extractive Text Summarization,"Gaurav Sahu, Issam H. Laradji","Low-resource extractive text summarization is a vital but heavily underexplored area of research. Prior literature either focuses on abstractive text summarization or prompts a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 directly to generate summaries. In this work, we propose MixSumm for low-resource extractive text summarization. Specifically, MixSumm prompts an open-source LLM, LLaMA-3-70b, to generate documents that mix information from multiple topics as opposed to generating documents without mixup, and then trains a summarization model on the generated dataset. We use ROUGE scores and L-Eval, a reference-free LLaMA-3-based evaluation method to measure the quality of generated summaries. We conduct extensive experiments on a challenging text summarization benchmark comprising the TweetSumm, WikiHow, and ArXiv/PubMed datasets and show that our LLM-based data augmentation framework outperforms recent prompt-based approaches for low-resource extractive summarization. Additionally, our results also demonstrate effective knowledge distillation from LLaMA-3-70b to a small BERT-based extractive summarizer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07341v1,2024-07
Interpretable Differential Diagnosis with Dual-Inference Large Language Models,"Shuang Zhou, Mingquan Lin, Sirui Ding, Jiashuo Wang, Genevieve B. Melton, James Zou, Rui Zhang","Automatic differential diagnosis (DDx) is an essential medical task that generates a list of potential diseases as differentials based on patient symptom descriptions. In practice, interpreting these differential diagnoses yields significant value but remains under-explored. Given the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs), we investigated using LLMs for interpretable DDx. Specifically, we curated the first DDx dataset with expert-derived interpretation on 570 clinical notes. Besides, we proposed Dual-Inf, a novel framework that enabled LLMs to conduct bidirectional inference (i.e., from symptoms to diagnoses and vice versa) for DDx interpretation. Both human and automated evaluation validated its efficacy in predicting and elucidating differentials across four base LLMs. In addition, Dual-Inf could reduce interpretation errors and hold promise for rare disease explanations. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that customizes LLMs for DDx explanation and comprehensively evaluates their interpretation performance. Overall, our study bridges a critical gap in DDx interpretation and enhances clinical decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07330v2,2024-07
Probability of Differentiation Reveals Brittleness of Homogeneity Bias in GPT-4,"Messi H. J. Lee, Calvin K. Lai","Homogeneity bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to their tendency to homogenize the representations of some groups compared to others. Previous studies documenting this bias have predominantly used encoder models, which may have inadvertently introduced biases. To address this limitation, we prompted GPT-4 to generate single word/expression completions associated with 18 situation cues-specific, measurable elements of environments that influence how individuals perceive situations and compared the variability of these completions using probability of differentiation. This approach directly assessed homogeneity bias from the model's outputs, bypassing encoder models. Across five studies, we find that homogeneity bias is highly volatile across situation cues and writing prompts, suggesting that the bias observed in past work may reflect those within encoder models rather than LLMs. Furthermore, we find that homogeneity bias in LLMs is brittle, as even minor and arbitrary changes in prompts can significantly alter the expression of biases. Future work should further explore how variations in syntactic features and topic choices in longer text generations influence homogeneity bias in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07329v2,2024-07

Examining Long-Context Large Language Models for Environmental Review Document Comprehension,"Hung Phan, Anurag Acharya, Rounak Meyur, Sarthak Chaturvedi, Shivam Sharma, Mike Parker, Dan Nally, Ali Jannesari, Karl Pazdernik, Mahantesh Halappanavar, Sai Munikoti, Sameera Horawalavithana","As LLMs become increasingly ubiquitous, researchers have tried various techniques to augment the knowledge provided to these models. Long context and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) are two such methods that have recently gained popularity. In this work, we examine the benefits of both of these techniques by utilizing question answering (QA) task in a niche domain. While the effectiveness of LLM-based QA systems has already been established at an acceptable level in popular domains such as trivia and literature, it has not often been established in niche domains that traditionally require specialized expertise. We construct the NEPAQuAD1.0 benchmark to evaluate the performance of five long-context LLMs -- Claude Sonnet, Gemini, GPT-4, Llama 3.1, and Mistral -- when answering questions originating from Environmental Impact Statements prepared by U.S. federal government agencies in accordance with the National Environmental Environmental Act (NEPA). We specifically measure the ability of LLMs to understand the nuances of legal, technical, and compliance-related information present in NEPA documents in different contextual scenarios. We test the LLMs' internal prior NEPA knowledge by providing questions without any context, as well as assess how LLMs synthesize the contextual information present in long NEPA documents to facilitate the question/answering task. We compare the performance of the models in handling different types of questions (e.g., problem-solving, divergent, etc.). Our results suggest that RAG powered models significantly outperform those provided with only the PDF context in terms of answer accuracy, regardless of the choice of the LLM. Our further analysis reveals that many models perform better answering closed type questions (Yes/No) than divergent and problem-solving questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07321v2,2024-07
ESM+: Modern Insights into Perspective on Text-to-SQL Evaluation in the Age of Large Language Models,"Benjamin G. Ascoli, Yasoda Sai Ram Kandikonda, Jinho D. Choi","The task of Text-to-SQL enables anyone to retrieve information from SQL databases using natural language. Despite several challenges, recent models have made remarkable advancements in this task using large language models (LLMs). Interestingly, we find that LLM-based models without fine-tuning exhibit distinct natures compared to their fine-tuned counterparts, leading to inadequacies in current evaluation metrics to accurately convey their performance. Thus, we analyze the two primary metrics, Test Suite Execution Accuracy (EXE) and Exact Set Matching Accuracy (ESM), to examine their robustness for this task and address shortcomings. We compare the performance of 9 LLM-based models using EXE, the original ESM, and our improved ESM (called ESM+). Our results show that EXE and ESM have high false positive and negative rates of 11.3% and 13.9%, while ESM+ gives those of 0.1% and 2.6% respectively, providing a significantly more stable evaluation. We release the ESM+ script as open-source for the community to contribute, while enjoying a more reliable assessment of Text-to-SQL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07313v2,2024-07

Remastering Divide and Remaster: A Cinematic Audio Source Separation Dataset with Multilingual Support,"Karn N. Watcharasupat, Chih-Wei Wu, Iroro Orife","Cinematic audio source separation (CASS), as a problem of extracting the dialogue, music, and effects stems from their mixture, is a relatively new subtask of audio source separation. To date, only one publicly available dataset exists for CASS, that is, the Divide and Remaster (DnR) dataset, which is currently at version 2. While DnR v2 has been an incredibly useful resource for CASS, several areas of improvement have been identified, particularly through its use in the 2023 Sound Demixing Challenge. In this work, we develop version 3 of the DnR dataset, addressing issues relating to vocal content in non-dialogue stems, loudness distributions, mastering process, and linguistic diversity. In particular, the dialogue stem of DnR v3 includes speech content from more than 30 languages from multiple families including but not limited to the Germanic, Romance, Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Malayo-Polynesian, and Bantu families. Benchmark results using the Bandit model indicated that training on multilingual data yields significant generalizability to the model even in languages with low data availability. Even in languages with high data availability, the multilingual model often performs on par or better than dedicated models trained on monolingual CASS datasets.

"Reuse, Don't Retrain: A Recipe for Continued Pretraining of Language Models","Jupinder Parmar, Sanjev Satheesh, Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro","As language models have scaled both their number of parameters and pretraining dataset sizes, the computational cost for pretraining has become intractable except for the most well-resourced teams. This increasing cost makes it ever more important to be able to reuse a model after it has completed pretraining; allowing for a model's abilities to further improve without needing to train from scratch. In this work, we detail a set of guidelines that cover how to design efficacious data distributions and learning rate schedules for continued pretraining of language models. When applying these findings within a continued pretraining run on top of a well-trained 15B parameter model, we show an improvement of 9\% in average model accuracy compared to the baseline of continued training on the pretraining set. The resulting recipe provides a practical starting point with which to begin developing language models through reuse rather than retraining.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07263v1,2024-07
Identification of emotions on Twitter during the 2022 electoral process in Colombia,"Juan Jose Iguaran Fernandez, Juan Manuel Perez, German Rosati","The study of Twitter as a means for analyzing social phenomena has gained interest in recent years due to the availability of large amounts of data in a relatively spontaneous environment. Within opinion-mining tasks, emotion detection is specially relevant, as it allows for the identification of people's subjective responses to different social events in a more granular way than traditional sentiment analysis based on polarity. In the particular case of political events, the analysis of emotions in social networks can provide valuable information on the perception of candidates, proposals, and other important aspects of the public debate. In spite of this importance, there are few studies on emotion detection in Spanish and, to the best of our knowledge, few resources are public for opinion mining in Colombian Spanish, highlighting the need for generating resources addressing the specific cultural characteristics of this variety. In this work, we present a small corpus of tweets in Spanish related to the 2022 Colombian presidential elections, manually labeled with emotions using a fine-grained taxonomy. We perform classification experiments using supervised state-of-the-art models (BERT models) and compare them with GPT-3.5 in few-shot learning settings. We make our dataset and code publicly available for research purposes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07258v1,2024-07
ConvNLP: Image-based AI Text Detection,"Suriya Prakash Jambunathan, Ashwath Shankarnarayan, Parijat Dube","The potentials of Generative-AI technologies like Large Language models (LLMs) to revolutionize education are undermined by ethical considerations around their misuse which worsens the problem of academic dishonesty. LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama 2 are becoming increasingly powerful in generating sophisticated content and answering questions, from writing academic essays to solving complex math problems. Students are relying on these LLMs to complete their assignments and thus compromising academic integrity. Solutions to detect LLM-generated text are compute-intensive and often lack generalization. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting LLM-generated AI-text using a visual representation of word embedding. We have formulated a novel Convolutional Neural Network called ZigZag ResNet, as well as a scheduler for improving generalization, named ZigZag Scheduler. Through extensive evaluation using datasets of text generated by six different state-of-the-art LLMs, our model demonstrates strong intra-domain and inter-domain generalization capabilities. Our best model detects AI-generated text with an impressive average detection rate (over inter- and intra-domain test data) of 88.35%. Through an exhaustive ablation study, our ZigZag ResNet and ZigZag Scheduler provide a performance improvement of nearly 4% over the vanilla ResNet. The end-to-end inference latency of our model is below 2.5ms per sentence. Our solution offers a lightweight, computationally efficient, and faster alternative to existing tools for AI-generated text detection, with better generalization performance. It can help academic institutions in their fight against the misuse of LLMs in academic settings. Through this work, we aim to contribute to safeguarding the principles of academic integrity and ensuring the trustworthiness of student work in the era of advanced LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07225v1,2024-07
AnyTaskTune: Advanced Domain-Specific Solutions through Task-Fine-Tuning,"Jiaxi Cui, Wentao Zhang, Jing Tang, Xudong Tong, Zhenwei Zhang, Amie, Jing Wen, Rongsheng Wang, Pengfei Wu","The pervasive deployment of Large Language Models-LLMs in various sectors often neglects the nuanced requirements of individuals and small organizations, who benefit more from models precisely tailored to their specific business contexts rather than those with broadly superior general capabilities. This work introduces \textbf{AnyTaskTune}, a novel fine-tuning methodology coined as \textbf{Task-Fine-Tune}, specifically developed to elevate model performance on a diverse array of domain-specific tasks. This method involves a meticulous process to identify and define targeted sub-tasks within a domain, followed by the creation of specialized enhancement datasets for fine-tuning, thereby optimizing task-specific model performance. We conducted comprehensive fine-tuning experiments not only in the legal domain for tasks such as keyword extraction and sentence prediction but across over twenty different sub-tasks derived from the domains of finance, healthcare, law, psychology, consumer services, and human resources. To substantiate our approach and facilitate community engagement, we will open-source these bilingual task datasets. Our findings demonstrate that models fine-tuned using the \textbf{Task-Fine-Tune} methodology not only achieve superior performance on these specific tasks but also significantly outperform models with higher general capabilities in their respective domains.

FBI-LLM: Scaling Up Fully Binarized LLMs from Scratch via Autoregressive Distillation,"Liqun Ma, Mingjie Sun, Zhiqiang Shen","This work presents a Fully BInarized Large Language Model (FBI-LLM), demonstrating for the first time how to train a large-scale binary language model from scratch (not the partial binary or ternary LLM like BitNet b1.58) to match the performance of its full-precision counterparts (e.g., FP16 or BF16) in transformer-based LLMs. It achieves this by employing an autoregressive distillation (AD) loss with maintaining equivalent model dimensions (130M, 1.3B, 7B) and training data volume as regular LLM pretraining, while delivering competitive results in terms of perplexity and task-specific effectiveness. Intriguingly, by analyzing the training trajectory, we find that the pretrained weight is not necessary for training binarized LLMs from scratch. This research encourages a new computational framework and may facilitate the future design of specialized hardware tailored for fully 1-bit LLMs. We make all models, code, and training dataset fully accessible and transparent to support further research (Code: https://github.com/LiqunMa/FBI-LLM.

CopyBench: Measuring Literal and Non-Literal Reproduction of Copyright-Protected Text in Language Model Generation,"Tong Chen, Akari Asai, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Sewon Min, James Grimmelmann, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Luke Zettlemoyer, Pang Wei Koh","Evaluating the degree of reproduction of copyright-protected content by language models (LMs) is of significant interest to the AI and legal communities. Although both literal and non-literal similarities are considered by courts when assessing the degree of reproduction, prior research has focused only on literal similarities. To bridge this gap, we introduce CopyBench, a benchmark designed to measure both literal and non-literal copying in LM generations. Using copyrighted fiction books as text sources, we provide automatic evaluation protocols to assess literal and non-literal copying, balanced against the model utility in terms of the ability to recall facts from the copyrighted works and generate fluent completions. We find that, although literal copying is relatively rare, two types of non-literal copying -- event copying and character copying -- occur even in models as small as 7B parameters. Larger models demonstrate significantly more copying, with literal copying rates increasing from 0.2\% to 10.5\% and non-literal copying from 2.3\% to 5.9\% when comparing Llama3-8B and 70B models, respectively. We further evaluate the effectiveness of current strategies for mitigating copying and show that (1) training-time alignment can reduce literal copying but may increase non-literal copying, and (2) current inference-time mitigation methods primarily reduce literal but not non-literal copying.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07087v2,2024-07
Adapting LLMs to Hebrew: Unveiling DictaLM 2.0 with Enhanced Vocabulary and Instruction Capabilities,"Shaltiel Shmidman, Avi Shmidman, Amir DN Cohen, Moshe Koppel","Training large language models (LLMs) in low-resource languages such as Hebrew poses unique challenges. In this paper, we introduce DictaLM2.0 and DictaLM2.0-Instruct, two LLMs derived from the Mistral model, trained on a substantial corpus of approximately 200 billion tokens in both Hebrew and English. Adapting a pre-trained model to a new language involves specialized techniques that differ significantly from training a model from scratch or further training existing models on well-resourced languages such as English. We outline these novel training methodologies, which facilitate effective learning and adaptation to the linguistic properties of Hebrew. Additionally, we fine-tuned DictaLM2.0-Instruct on a comprehensive instruct dataset to enhance its performance on task-specific instructions. To rigorously evaluate our models, we introduce a new benchmark suite for Hebrew LLM evaluation, covering a diverse set of tasks including Question Answering, Sentiment Analysis, Winograd Schema Challenge, Translation, and Summarization. Our work not only addresses the intricacies of training LLMs in low-resource languages but also proposes a framework that can be leveraged for adapting other LLMs to various non-English languages, contributing to the broader field of multilingual NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07080v1,2024-07
Lookback Lens: Detecting and Mitigating Contextual Hallucinations in Large Language Models Using Only Attention Maps,"Yung-Sung Chuang, Linlu Qiu, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Ranjay Krishna, Yoon Kim, James Glass","When asked to summarize articles or answer questions given a passage, large language models (LLMs) can hallucinate details and respond with unsubstantiated answers that are inaccurate with respect to the input context. This paper describes a simple approach for detecting such contextual hallucinations. We hypothesize that contextual hallucinations are related to the extent to which an LLM attends to information in the provided context versus its own generations. Based on this intuition, we propose a simple hallucination detection model whose input features are given by the ratio of attention weights on the context versus newly generated tokens (for each attention head). We find that a linear classifier based on these lookback ratio features is as effective as a richer detector that utilizes the entire hidden states of an LLM or a text-based entailment model. The lookback ratio-based detector -- Lookback Lens -- is found to transfer across tasks and even models, allowing a detector that is trained on a 7B model to be applied (without retraining) to a larger 13B model. We further apply this detector to mitigate contextual hallucinations, and find that a simple classifier-guided decoding approach is able to reduce the amount of hallucination, for example by 9.6% in the XSum summarization task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07071v2,2024-07
Internet of Agents: Weaving a Web of Heterogeneous Agents for Collaborative Intelligence,"Weize Chen, Ziming You, Ran Li, Yitong Guan, Chen Qian, Chenyang Zhao, Cheng Yang, Ruobing Xie, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of highly capable autonomous agents. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often struggle with integrating diverse capable third-party agents due to reliance on agents defined within their own ecosystems. They also face challenges in simulating distributed environments, as most frameworks are limited to single-device setups. Furthermore, these frameworks often rely on hard-coded communication pipelines, limiting their adaptability to dynamic task requirements. Inspired by the concept of the Internet, we propose the Internet of Agents (IoA), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by providing a flexible and scalable platform for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. IoA introduces an agent integration protocol, an instant-messaging-like architecture design, and dynamic mechanisms for agent teaming and conversation flow control. Through extensive experiments on general assistant tasks, embodied AI tasks, and retrieval-augmented generation benchmarks, we demonstrate that IoA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its ability to facilitate effective collaboration among heterogeneous agents. IoA represents a step towards linking diverse agents in an Internet-like environment, where agents can seamlessly collaborate to achieve greater intelligence and capabilities.

Our model classifies disagreements into three categories: agree, disagree, and neutral. Leveraging the inherent graph structure of Reddit comment-reply pairs, the model significantly outperforms existing benchmarks by capturing complex interaction patterns and sentiment dynamics.

Vision-and-Language Navigation Today and Tomorrow: A Survey in the Era of Foundation Models,"Yue Zhang, Ziqiao Ma, Jialu Li, Yanyuan Qiao, Zun Wang, Joyce Chai, Qi Wu, Mohit Bansal, Parisa Kordjamshidi","Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has gained increasing attention over recent years and many approaches have emerged to advance their development. The remarkable achievements of foundation models have shaped the challenges and proposed methods for VLN research. In this survey, we provide a top-down review that adopts a principled framework for embodied planning and reasoning, and emphasizes the current methods and future opportunities leveraging foundation models to address VLN challenges. We hope our in-depth discussions could provide valuable resources and insights: on one hand, to milestone the progress and explore opportunities and potential roles for foundation models in this field, and on the other, to organize different challenges and solutions in VLN to foundation model researchers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07035v2,2024-07
Resolving Sentiment Discrepancy for Multimodal Sentiment Detection via Semantics Completion and Decomposition,"Daiqing Wu, Dongbao Yang, Huawen Shen, Can Ma, Yu Zhou","With the proliferation of social media posts in recent years, the need to detect sentiments in multimodal (image-text) content has grown rapidly. Since posts are user-generated, the image and text from the same post can express different or even contradictory sentiments, leading to potential \textbf{sentiment discrepancy}. However, existing works mainly adopt a single-branch fusion structure that primarily captures the consistent sentiment between image and text. The ignorance or implicit modeling of discrepant sentiment results in compromised unimodal encoding and limited performances. In this paper, we propose a semantics Completion and Decomposition (CoDe) network to resolve the above issue. In the semantics completion module, we complement image and text representations with the semantics of the OCR text embedded in the image, helping bridge the sentiment gap. In the semantics decomposition module, we decompose image and text representations with exclusive projection and contrastive learning, thereby explicitly capturing the discrepant sentiment between modalities. Finally, we fuse image and text representations by cross-attention and combine them with the learned discrepant sentiment for final classification. Extensive experiments conducted on four multimodal sentiment datasets demonstrate the superiority of CoDe against SOTA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07026v1,2024-07
Using Large Language Models for Generating Smart Contracts for Health Insurance from Textual Policies,"Inwon Kang, William Van Woensel, Oshani Seneviratne","We explore using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate application code that automates health insurance processes from text-based policies. We target blockchain-based smart contracts as they offer immutability, verifiability, scalability, and a trustless setting: any number of parties can use the smart contracts, and they need not have previously established trust relationships with each other. Our methodology generates outputs at increasing levels of technical detail: (1) textual summaries, (2) declarative decision logic, and (3) smart contract code with unit tests. We ascertain LLMs are good at the task (1), and the structured output is useful to validate tasks (2) and (3). Declarative languages (task 2) are often used to formalize healthcare policies, but their execution on blockchain is non-trivial. Hence, task (3) attempts to directly automate the process using smart contracts. To assess the LLM output, we propose completeness, soundness, clarity, syntax, and functioning code as metrics. Our evaluation employs three health insurance policies (scenarios) with increasing difficulty from Medicare's official booklet. Our evaluation uses GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo 16K, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo and CodeLLaMA. Our findings confirm that LLMs perform quite well in generating textual summaries. Although outputs from tasks (2)-(3) are useful starting points, they require human oversight: in multiple cases, even ""runnable"" code will not yield sound results; the popularity of the target language affects the output quality; and more complex scenarios still seem a bridge too far. Nevertheless, our experiments demonstrate the promise of LLMs for translating textual process descriptions into smart contracts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07019v1,2024-07
End-To-End Causal Effect Estimation from Unstructured Natural Language Data,"Nikita Dhawan, Leonardo Cotta, Karen Ullrich, Rahul G. Krishnan, Chris J. Maddison","Knowing the effect of an intervention is critical for human decision-making, but current approaches for causal effect estimation rely on manual data collection and structuring, regardless of the causal assumptions. This increases both the cost and time-to-completion for studies. We show how large, diverse observational text data can be mined with large language models (LLMs) to produce inexpensive causal effect estimates under appropriate causal assumptions. We introduce NATURAL, a novel family of causal effect estimators built with LLMs that operate over datasets of unstructured text. Our estimators use LLM conditional distributions (over variables of interest, given the text data) to assist in the computation of classical estimators of causal effect. We overcome a number of technical challenges to realize this idea, such as automating data curation and using LLMs to impute missing information. We prepare six (two synthetic and four real) observational datasets, paired with corresponding ground truth in the form of randomized trials, which we used to systematically evaluate each step of our pipeline. NATURAL estimators demonstrate remarkable performance, yielding causal effect estimates that fall within 3 percentage points of their ground truth counterparts, including on real-world Phase 3/4 clinical trials. Our results suggest that unstructured text data is a rich source of causal effect information, and NATURAL is a first step towards an automated pipeline to tap this resource.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07018v3,2024-07
Induction Heads as an Essential Mechanism for Pattern Matching in In-context Learning,"Joy Crosbie, Ekaterina Shutova","Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to learn and perform complex tasks through in-context learning (ICL). However, a comprehensive understanding of its internal mechanisms is still lacking. This paper explores the role of induction heads in a few-shot ICL setting. We analyse two state-of-the-art models, Llama-3-8B and InternLM2-20B on abstract pattern recognition and NLP tasks. Our results show that even a minimal ablation of induction heads leads to ICL performance decreases of up to ~32% for abstract pattern recognition tasks, bringing the performance close to random. For NLP tasks, this ablation substantially decreases the model's ability to benefit from examples, bringing few-shot ICL performance close to that of zero-shot prompts. We further use attention knockout to disable specific induction patterns, and present fine-grained evidence for the role that the induction mechanism plays in ICL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07011v2,2024-07
Empirical analysis of Binding Precedent efficiency in the Brazilian Supreme Court via Similar Case Retrieval,"Raphaël Tinarrage, Henrique Ennes, Lucas E. Resck, Lucas T. Gomes, Jean R. Ponciano, Jorge Poco","Binding precedents (S\'umulas Vinculantes) constitute a juridical instrument unique to the Brazilian legal system and whose objectives include the protection of the Federal Supreme Court against repetitive demands. Studies of the effectiveness of these instruments in decreasing the Court's exposure to similar cases, however, indicate that they tend to fail in such a direction, with some of the binding precedents seemingly creating new demands. We empirically assess the legal impact of five binding precedents, 11, 14, 17, 26 and 37, at the highest court level through their effects on the legal subjects they address. This analysis is only possible through the comparison of the Court's ruling about the precedents' themes before they are created, which means that these decisions should be detected through techniques of Similar Case Retrieval. The contributions of this article are therefore twofold: on the mathematical side, we compare the uses of different methods of Natural Language Processing -- TF-IDF, LSTM, BERT, and regex -- for Similar Case Retrieval, whereas on the legal side, we contrast the inefficiency of these binding precedents with a set of hypotheses that may justify their repeated usage. We observe that the deep learning models performed significantly worse in the specific Similar Case Retrieval task and that the reasons for binding precedents to fail in responding to repetitive demand are heterogeneous and case-dependent, making it impossible to single out a specific cause.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07004v2,2024-07
Etalon: Holistic Performance Evaluation Framework for LLM Inference Systems,"Amey Agrawal, Anmol Agarwal, Nitin Kedia, Jayashree Mohan, Souvik Kundu, Nipun Kwatra, Ramachandran Ramjee, Alexey Tumanov","Serving large language models (LLMs) in production can incur substantial costs, which has prompted recent advances in inference system optimizations. Today, these systems are evaluated against conventional latency and throughput metrics (eg. TTFT, TBT, Normalised Latency and TPOT). However, these metrics fail to fully capture the nuances of LLM inference, leading to an incomplete assessment of user-facing performance crucial for real-time applications such as chat and translation. In this paper, we first identify the pitfalls of current performance metrics in evaluating LLM inference systems. We then propose Etalon, a comprehensive performance evaluation framework that includes fluidity-index -- a novel metric designed to reflect the intricacies of the LLM inference process and its impact on real-time user experience. Finally, we evaluate various existing open-source platforms and model-as-a-service offerings using Etalon, discussing their strengths and weaknesses.

Robust Neural Information Retrieval: An Adversarial and Out-of-distribution Perspective,"Yu-An Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng","Recent advances in neural information retrieval (IR) models have significantly enhanced their effectiveness over various IR tasks. The robustness of these models, essential for ensuring their reliability in practice, has also garnered significant attention. With a wide array of research on robust IR being proposed, we believe it is the opportune moment to consolidate the current status, glean insights from existing methodologies, and lay the groundwork for future development. We view the robustness of IR to be a multifaceted concept, emphasizing its necessity against adversarial attacks, out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and performance variance. With a focus on adversarial and OOD robustness, we dissect robustness solutions for dense retrieval models (DRMs) and neural ranking models (NRMs), respectively, recognizing them as pivotal components of the neural IR pipeline. We provide an in-depth discussion of existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, shedding light on challenges and future directions in the era of large language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on the robustness of neural IR models, and we will also be giving our first tutorial presentation at SIGIR 2024 \url{https://sigir2024-robust-information-retrieval.github.io}.

Segment-Based Interactive Machine Translation for Pre-trained Models,"Angel Navarro, Francisco Casacuberta","Pre-trained large language models (LLM) are starting to be widely used in many applications. In this work, we explore the use of these models in interactive machine translation (IMT) environments. In particular, we have chosen mBART (multilingual Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer) and mT5 (multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) as the LLMs to perform our experiments. The system generates perfect translations interactively using the feedback provided by the user at each iteration. The Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model generates a preliminary hypothesis with the feedback, and the user validates new correct segments and performs a word correction--repeating the process until the sentence is correctly translated. We compared the performance of mBART, mT5, and a state-of-the-art (SoTA) machine translation model on a benchmark dataset regarding user effort, Word Stroke Ratio (WSR), Key Stroke Ratio (KSR), and Mouse Action Ratio (MAR). The experimental results indicate that mBART performed comparably with SoTA models, suggesting that it is a viable option for this field of IMT. The implications of this finding extend to the development of new machine translation models for interactive environments, as it indicates that some novel pre-trained models exhibit SoTA performance in this domain, highlighting the potential benefits of adapting these models to specific needs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06990v1,2024-07
Listen and Speak Fairly: A Study on Semantic Gender Bias in Speech Integrated Large Language Models,"Yi-Cheng Lin, Tzu-Quan Lin, Chih-Kai Yang, Ke-Han Lu, Wei-Chih Chen, Chun-Yi Kuan, Hung-yi Lee","Speech Integrated Large Language Models (SILLMs) combine large language models with speech perception to perform diverse tasks, such as emotion recognition to speaker verification, demonstrating universal audio understanding capability. However, these models may amplify biases present in training data, potentially leading to biased access to information for marginalized groups. This work introduces a curated spoken bias evaluation toolkit and corresponding dataset. We evaluate gender bias in SILLMs across four semantic-related tasks: speech-to-text translation (STT), spoken coreference resolution (SCR), spoken sentence continuation (SSC), and spoken question answering (SQA). Our analysis reveals that bias levels are language-dependent and vary with different evaluation methods. Our findings emphasize the necessity of employing multiple approaches to comprehensively assess biases in SILLMs, providing insights for developing fairer SILLM systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06957v1,2024-07
ICLGuard: Controlling In-Context Learning Behavior for Applicability Authorization,"Wai Man Si, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang","In-context learning (ICL) is a recent advancement in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). This feature allows users to perform a new task without updating the model. Concretely, users can address tasks during the inference time by conditioning on a few input-label pair demonstrations along with the test input. It is different than the conventional fine-tuning paradigm and offers more flexibility. However, this capability also introduces potential issues. For example, users may use the model on any data without restriction, such as performing tasks with improper or sensitive content, which might violate the model policy or conflict with the model owner's interests. As a model owner, it is crucial to establish a mechanism to control the model's behavior under ICL, depending on the model owner's requirements for various content. To this end, we introduce the concept of ""applicability authorization"" tailored for LLMs, particularly for ICL behavior, and propose a simple approach, ICLGuard. It is a fine-tuning framework designed to allow the model owner to regulate ICL behavior on different data. ICLGuard preserves the original LLM and fine-tunes only a minimal set of additional trainable parameters to ""guard"" the LLM. Empirical results show that the guarded LLM can deactivate its ICL ability on target data without affecting its ICL ability on other data and its general functionality across all data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06955v1,2024-07
Spanish TrOCR: Leveraging Transfer Learning for Language Adaptation,"Filipe Lauar, Valentin Laurent","This study explores the transfer learning capabilities of the TrOCR architecture to Spanish. TrOCR is a transformer-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model renowned for its state-of-the-art performance in English benchmarks. Inspired by Li et al. assertion regarding its adaptability to multilingual text recognition, we investigate two distinct approaches to adapt the model to a new language: integrating an English TrOCR encoder with a language specific decoder and train the model on this specific language, and fine-tuning the English base TrOCR model on a new language data. Due to the scarcity of publicly available datasets, we present a resource-efficient pipeline for creating OCR datasets in any language, along with a comprehensive benchmark of the different image generation methods employed with a focus on Visual Rich Documents (VRDs). Additionally, we offer a comparative analysis of the two approaches for the Spanish language, demonstrating that fine-tuning the English TrOCR on Spanish yields superior recognition than the language specific decoder for a fixed dataset size. We evaluate our model employing character and word error rate metrics on a public available printed dataset, comparing the performance against other open-source and cloud OCR spanish models. As far as we know, these resources represent the best open-source model for OCR in Spanish.

Self-Recognition in Language Models,"Tim R.

This dependency might introduce novel security risks if LMs develop self-recognition capabilities. Inspired by human identity verification methods, we propose a novel approach for assessing self-recognition in LMs using model-generated ""security questions"". Our test can be externally administered to monitor frontier models as it does not require access to internal model parameters or output probabilities. We use our test to examine self-recognition in ten of the most capable open- and closed-source LMs currently publicly available. Our extensive experiments found no empirical evidence of general or consistent self-recognition in any examined LM. Instead, our results suggest that given a set of alternatives, LMs seek to pick the ""best"" answer, regardless of its origin. Moreover, we find indications that preferences about which models produce the best answers are consistent across LMs. We additionally uncover novel insights on position bias considerations for LMs in multiple-choice settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06946v2,2024-07

In this work, we propose Raply, a fine-tuned GPT-2 model capable of producing meaningful rhyming text in the style of rap. In addition to its rhyming capabilities, the model is able to generate less offensive content. It was achieved through the fine-tuning the model on a new dataset Mitislurs, a profanity-mitigated corpus.

Although existing methods have explored the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated scientific reviewing, their generated contents are often generic or partial. To address the issues above, we introduce an automated paper reviewing framework SEA. It comprises of three modules: Standardization, Evaluation, and Analysis, which are represented by models SEA-S, SEA-E, and SEA-A, respectively. Initially, SEA-S distills data standardization capabilities of GPT-4 for integrating multiple reviews for a paper. Then, SEA-E utilizes standardized data for fine-tuning, enabling it to generate constructive reviews. Finally, SEA-A introduces a new evaluation metric called mismatch score to assess the consistency between paper contents and reviews. Moreover, we design a self-correction strategy to enhance the consistency. Extensive experimental results on datasets collected from eight venues show that SEA can generate valuable insights for authors to improve their papers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12857v2,2024-07
"Who is better at math, Jenny or Jingzhen? Uncovering Stereotypes in Large Language Models","Zara Siddique, Liam D. Turner, Luis Espinosa-Anke","Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to propagate and amplify harmful stereotypes, particularly those that disproportionately affect marginalised communities. To understand the effect of these stereotypes more comprehensively, we introduce GlobalBias, a dataset of 876k sentences incorporating 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups alongside descriptors typically used in bias literature, which enables us to study a broad set of stereotypes from around the world. We use GlobalBias to directly probe a suite of LMs via perplexity, which we use as a proxy to determine how certain stereotypes are represented in the model's internal representations. Following this, we generate character profiles based on given names and evaluate the prevalence of stereotypes in model outputs. We find that the demographic groups associated with various stereotypes remain consistent across model likelihoods and model outputs. Furthermore, larger models consistently display higher levels of stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly instructed not to.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06917v3,2024-07
"Divine LLaMAs: Bias, Stereotypes, Stigmatization, and Emotion Representation of Religion in Large Language Models","Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco, Amanda Cercas Curry, Susanna Paoli, Alba Curry, Dirk Hovy","Emotions play important epistemological and cognitive roles in our lives, revealing our values and guiding our actions. Previous work has shown that LLMs display biases in emotion attribution along gender lines. However, unlike gender, which says little about our values, religion, as a socio-cultural system, prescribes a set of beliefs and values for its followers. Religions, therefore, cultivate certain emotions. Moreover, these rules are explicitly laid out and interpreted by religious leaders. Using emotion attribution, we explore how different religions are represented in LLMs. We find that: Major religions in the US and European countries are represented with more nuance, displaying a more shaded model of their beliefs. Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism are strongly stereotyped. Judaism and Islam are stigmatized -- the models' refusal skyrocket. We ascribe these to cultural bias in LLMs and the scarcity of NLP literature on religion. In the rare instances where religion is discussed, it is often in the context of toxic language, perpetuating the perception of these religions as inherently toxic. This finding underscores the urgent need to address and rectify these biases. Our research underscores the crucial role emotions play in our lives and how our values influence them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06908v1,2024-07
Measuring Sustainability Intention of ESG Fund Disclosure using Few-Shot Learning,"Mayank Singh, Nazia Nafis, Abhijeet Kumar, Mridul Mishra","Global sustainable fund universe encompasses open-end funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) that, by prospectus or other regulatory filings, claim to focus on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG). Challengingly, the claims can only be confirmed by examining the textual disclosures to check if there is presence of intentionality and ESG focus on its investment strategy. Currently, there is no regulation to enforce sustainability in ESG products space. This paper proposes a unique method and system to classify and score the fund prospectuses in the sustainable universe regarding specificity and transparency of language. We aim to employ few-shot learners to identify specific, ambiguous, and generic sustainable investment-related language. Additionally, we construct a ratio metric to determine language score and rating to rank products and quantify sustainability claims for US sustainable universe. As a by-product, we publish manually annotated quality training dataset on Hugging Face (ESG-Prospectus-Clarity-Category under cc-by-nc-sa-4.0) of more than 1K ESG textual statements. The performance of the few-shot finetuning approach is compared with zero-shot models e.g., Llama-13B, GPT 3.5 Turbo etc. We found that prompting large language models are not accurate for domain specific tasks due to misalignment issues. The few-shot finetuning techniques outperform zero-shot models by large margins of more than absolute ~30% in precision, recall and F1 metrics on completely unseen ESG languages (test set). Overall, the paper attempts to establish a systematic and scalable approach to measure and rate sustainability intention quantitatively for sustainable funds using texts in prospectus. Regulatory bodies, investors, and advisors may utilize the findings of this research to reduce cognitive load in investigating or screening of ESG funds which accurately reflects the ESG intention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06893v1,2024-07
ChatGPT Doesn't Trust Chargers Fans: Guardrail Sensitivity in Context,"Victoria R. Li, Yida Chen, Naomi Saphra","While the biases of language models in production are extensively documented, the biases of their guardrails have been neglected. This paper studies how contextual information about the user influences the likelihood of an LLM to refuse to execute a request. By generating user biographies that offer ideological and demographic information, we find a number of biases in guardrail sensitivity on GPT-3.5. Younger, female, and Asian-American personas are more likely to trigger a refusal guardrail when requesting censored or illegal information. Guardrails are also sycophantic, refusing to comply with requests for a political position the user is likely to disagree with. We find that certain identity groups and seemingly innocuous information, e.g., sports fandom, can elicit changes in guardrail sensitivity similar to direct statements of political ideology. For each demographic category and even for American football team fandom, we find that ChatGPT appears to infer a likely political ideology and modify guardrail behavior accordingly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06866v2,2024-07
Safe-Embed: Unveiling the Safety-Critical Knowledge of Sentence Encoders,"Jinseok Kim, Jaewon Jung, Sangyeop Kim, Sohyung Park, Sungzoon Cho","Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, their vulnerability to unsafe prompts remains a critical issue. These prompts can lead LLMs to generate responses on illegal or sensitive topics, posing a significant threat to their safe and ethical use. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue using classification models, but they have several drawbacks. With the increasing complexity of unsafe prompts, similarity search-based techniques that identify specific features of unsafe prompts provide a more robust and effective solution to this evolving problem. This paper investigates the potential of sentence encoders to distinguish safe from unsafe prompts, and the ability to classify various unsafe prompts according to a safety taxonomy. We introduce new pairwise datasets and the Categorical Purity (CP) metric to measure this capability. Our findings reveal both the effectiveness and limitations of existing sentence encoders, proposing directions to improve sentence encoders to operate as more robust safety detectors.

AI AI Bias: Large Language Models Favor Their Own Generated Content,"Walter Laurito, Benjamin Davis, Peli Grietzer, Tomáš Gavenčiak, Ada Böhm, Jan Kulveit","Are large language models (LLMs) biased towards text generated by LLMs over text authored by humans, leading to possible anti-human bias? Utilizing a classical experimental design inspired by employment discrimination studies, we tested widely-used LLMs, including GPT-3.5 and GPT4, in binary-choice scenarios. These involved LLM-based agents selecting between products and academic papers described either by humans or LLMs under identical conditions. Our results show a consistent tendency for LLM-based AIs to prefer LLM-generated content. This suggests the possibility of AI systems implicitly discriminating against humans, giving AI agents an unfair advantage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12856v1,2024-07
Learn and Don't Forget: Adding a New Language to ASR Foundation Models,"Mengjie Qian, Siyuan Tang, Rao Ma, Kate M. Knill, Mark J. F. Gales","Foundation ASR models often support many languages, e.g. 100 languages in Whisper. However, there has been limited work on integrating an additional, typically low-resource, language, while maintaining performance on the original language set. Fine-tuning, while simple, may degrade the accuracy of the original set. We compare three approaches that exploit adaptation parameters: soft language code tuning, train only the language code; soft prompt tuning, train prepended tokens; and LoRA where a small set of additional parameters are optimised. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) offers an alternative compromise with the potential to maintain performance in specific target languages. Results show that direct fine-tuning yields the best performance for the new language but degrades existing language capabilities. EWC can address this issue for specific languages. If only adaptation parameters are used, the language capabilities are maintained but at the cost of performance in the new language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06800v3,2024-07
Using Pretrained Large Language Model with Prompt Engineering to Answer Biomedical Questions,"Wenxin Zhou, Thuy Hang Ngo","Our team participated in the BioASQ 2024 Task12b and Synergy tasks to build a system that can answer biomedical questions by retrieving relevant articles and snippets from the PubMed database and generating exact and ideal answers.

Large Language Models can impersonate politicians and other public figures,"Steffen Herbold, Alexander Trautsch, Zlata Kikteva, Annette Hautli-Janisz","Modern AI technology like Large language models (LLMs) has the potential to pollute the public information sphere with made-up content, which poses a significant threat to the cohesion of societies at large. A wide range of research has shown that LLMs are capable of generating text of impressive quality, including persuasive political speech, text with a pre-defined style, and role-specific content. But there is a crucial gap in the literature: We lack large-scale and systematic studies of how capable LLMs are in impersonating political and societal representatives and how the general public judges these impersonations in terms of authenticity, relevance and coherence. We present the results of a study based on a cross-section of British society that shows that LLMs are able to generate responses to debate questions that were part of a broadcast political debate programme in the UK. The impersonated responses are judged to be more authentic and relevant than the original responses given by people who were impersonated. This shows two things: (1) LLMs can be made to contribute meaningfully to the public political debate and (2) there is a dire need to inform the general public of the potential harm this can have on society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12855v1,2024-07

Consistent Document-Level Relation Extraction via Counterfactuals,"Ali Modarressi, Abdullatif Köksal, Hinrich Schütze","Many datasets have been developed to train and evaluate document-level relation extraction (RE) models. Most of these are constructed using real-world data. It has been shown that RE models trained on real-world data suffer from factual biases. To evaluate and address this issue, we present CovEReD, a counterfactual data generation approach for document-level relation extraction datasets using entity replacement. We first demonstrate that models trained on factual data exhibit inconsistent behavior: while they accurately extract triples from factual data, they fail to extract the same triples after counterfactual modification. This inconsistency suggests that models trained on factual data rely on spurious signals such as specific entities and external knowledge $\unicode{x2013}$ rather than on the input context $\unicode{x2013}$ to extract triples. We show that by generating document-level counterfactual data with CovEReD and training models on them, consistency is maintained with minimal impact on RE performance. We release our CovEReD pipeline as well as Re-DocRED-CF, a dataset of counterfactual RE documents, to assist in evaluating and addressing inconsistency in document-level RE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06699v2,2024-07
Mixture-of-Modules: Reinventing Transformers as Dynamic Assemblies of Modules,"Zhuocheng Gong, Ang Lv, Jian Guan, Junxi Yan, Wei Wu, Huishuai Zhang, Minlie Huang, Dongyan Zhao, Rui Yan","Is it always necessary to compute tokens from shallow to deep layers in Transformers? The continued success of vanilla Transformers and their variants suggests an undoubted ""yes"". In this work, however, we attempt to break the depth-ordered convention by proposing a novel architecture dubbed mixture-of-modules (MoM), which is motivated by an intuition that any layer, regardless of its position, can be used to compute a token as long as it possesses the needed processing capabilities. The construction of MoM starts from a finite set of modules defined by multi-head attention and feed-forward networks, each distinguished by its unique parameterization. Two routers then iteratively select attention modules and feed-forward modules from the set to process a token. The selection dynamically expands the computation graph in the forward pass of the token, culminating in an assembly of modules. We show that MoM provides not only a unified framework for Transformers and their numerous variants but also a flexible and learnable approach for reducing redundancy in Transformer parameterization. We pre-train various MoMs using OpenWebText. Empirical results demonstrate that MoMs, of different parameter counts, consistently outperform vanilla transformers on both GLUE and XSUM benchmarks. More interestingly, with a fixed parameter budget, MoM-large enables an over 38% increase in depth for computation graphs compared to GPT-2-large, resulting in absolute gains of 1.4 on GLUE and 1 on XSUM. On the other hand, MoM-large also enables an over 60% reduction in depth while involving more modules per layer, yielding a 16% reduction in TFLOPs and a 43% decrease in memory usage compared to GPT-2-large, while maintaining comparable performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06677v1,2024-07
Scaling Retrieval-Based Language Models with a Trillion-Token Datastore,"Rulin Shao, Jacqueline He, Akari Asai, Weijia Shi, Tim Dettmers, Sewon Min, Luke Zettlemoyer, Pang Wei Koh","Scaling laws with respect to the amount of training data and the number of parameters allow us to predict the cost-benefit trade-offs of pretraining language models (LMs) in different configurations. In this paper, we consider another dimension of scaling: the amount of data available at inference time. Specifically, we find that increasing the size of the datastore used by a retrieval-based LM monotonically improves language modeling and several downstream tasks without obvious saturation, such that a smaller model augmented with a large datastore outperforms a larger LM-only model on knowledge-intensive tasks. By plotting compute-optimal scaling curves with varied datastore, model, and pretraining data sizes, we show that using larger datastores can significantly improve model performance for the same training compute budget. We carry out our study by constructing a 1.4 trillion-token datastore named MassiveDS, which is the largest and the most diverse open-sourced datastore for retrieval-based LMs to date, and designing an efficient pipeline for studying datastore scaling in a computationally accessible manner. Finally, we analyze the effect of improving the retriever, datastore quality filtering, and other design choices on our observed scaling trends. Overall, our results show that datastore size should be considered as an integral part of LM efficiency and performance trade-offs.

SoftDedup: an Efficient Data Reweighting Method for Speeding Up Language Model Pre-training,"Nan He, Weichen Xiong, Hanwen Liu, Yi Liao, Lei Ding, Kai Zhang, Guohua Tang, Xiao Han, Wei Yang","The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is often hindered by duplicated data in their extensive pre-training datasets. Current approaches primarily focus on detecting and removing duplicates, which risks the loss of valuable information and neglects the varying degrees of duplication. To address this, we propose a soft deduplication method that maintains dataset integrity while selectively reducing the sampling weight of data with high commonness. Central to our approach is the concept of ""data commonness"", a metric we introduce to quantify the degree of duplication by measuring the occurrence probabilities of samples using an n-gram model. Empirical analysis shows that this method significantly improves training efficiency, achieving comparable perplexity scores with at least a 26% reduction in required training steps. Additionally, it enhances average few-shot downstream accuracy by 1.77% when trained for an equivalent duration. Importantly, this approach consistently improves performance, even on rigorously deduplicated datasets, indicating its potential to complement existing methods and become a standard pre-training process for LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06654v1,2024-07
An Automatic Quality Metric for Evaluating Simultaneous Interpretation,"Mana Makinae, Katsuhito Sudoh, Mararu Yamada, Satoshi Nakamura","Simultaneous interpretation (SI), the translation of one language to another in real time, starts translation before the original speech has finished. Its evaluation needs to consider both latency and quality. This trade-off is challenging especially for distant word order language pairs such as English and Japanese. To handle this word order gap, interpreters maintain the word order of the source language as much as possible to keep up with original language to minimize its latency while maintaining its quality, whereas in translation reordering happens to keep fluency in the target language. This means outputs synchronized with the source language are desirable based on the real SI situation, and it's a key for further progress in computational SI and simultaneous machine translation (SiMT). In this work, we propose an automatic evaluation metric for SI and SiMT focusing on word order synchronization. Our evaluation metric is based on rank correlation coefficients, leveraging cross-lingual pre-trained language models. Our experimental results on NAIST-SIC-Aligned and JNPC showed our metrics' effectiveness to measure word order synchronization between source and target language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06650v2,2024-07
Entropy Law: The Story Behind Data Compression and LLM Performance,"Mingjia Yin, Chuhan Wu, Yufei Wang, Hao Wang, Wei Guo, Yasheng Wang, Yong Liu, Ruiming Tang, Defu Lian, Enhong Chen","Data is the cornerstone of large language models (LLMs), but not all data is useful for model learning. Carefully selected data can better elicit the capabilities of LLMs with much less computational overhead. Most methods concentrate on evaluating the quality of individual samples in data selection, while the combinatorial effects among samples are neglected. Even if each sample is of perfect quality, their combinations may be suboptimal in teaching LLMs due to their intrinsic homogeneity or contradiction. In this paper, we aim to uncover the underlying relationships between LLM performance and data selection. Inspired by the information compression nature of LLMs, we uncover an ``entropy law'' that connects LLM performance with data compression ratio and first-epoch training loss, which reflect the information redundancy of a dataset and the mastery of inherent knowledge encoded in this dataset, respectively. Through both theoretical deduction and empirical evaluation, we find that model performance is negatively correlated to the compression ratio of training data, which usually yields a lower training loss. Based on the findings of the entropy law, we propose a quite efficient and universal data selection method named \textbf{ZIP} for training LLMs, which aim to prioritize data subsets exhibiting a low compression ratio. Based on a multi-stage algorithm that selects diverse data in a greedy manner, we can obtain a good data subset with satisfactory diversity. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the entropy law and the superiority of ZIP across different LLM backbones and alignment stages. We also present an interesting application of entropy law that can detect potential performance risks at the beginning of model training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06645v3,2024-07
Tailored Design of Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Models using Branchformers,"David Gimeno-Gómez, Carlos-D. Martínez-Hinarejos","Recent advances in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) have led to unprecedented achievements in the field, improving the robustness of this type of system in adverse, noisy environments. In most cases, this task has been addressed through the design of models composed of two independent encoders, each dedicated to a specific modality. However, while recent works have explored unified audio-visual encoders, determining the optimal cross-modal architecture remains an ongoing challenge. Furthermore, such approaches often rely on models comprising vast amounts of parameters and high computational cost training processes. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing a novel audio-visual framework. Our proposed method constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to harness the flexibility and interpretability offered by encoder architectures, such as the Branchformer, in the design of parameter-efficient AVSR systems. To be more precise, the proposed framework consists of two steps: first, estimating audio- and video-only systems, and then designing a tailored audio-visual unified encoder based on the layer-level branch scores provided by the modality-specific models. Extensive experiments on English and Spanish AVSR benchmarks covering multiple data conditions and scenarios demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method. Results reflect how our tailored AVSR system is able to reach state-of-the-art recognition rates while significantly reducing the model complexity w.r.t. the prevalent approach in the field.

Solving General Natural-Language-Description Optimization Problems with Large Language Models,"Jihai Zhang, Wei Wang, Siyan Guo, Li Wang, Fangquan Lin, Cheng Yang, Wotao Yin","Optimization problems seek to find the best solution to an objective under a set of constraints, and have been widely investigated in real-world applications. Modeling and solving optimization problems in a specific domain typically require a combination of domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, making it difficult for general users and even domain professionals. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called OptLLM that augments LLMs with external solvers. Specifically, OptLLM accepts user queries in natural language, convert them into mathematical formulations and programming codes, and calls the solvers to calculate the results for decision-making. In addition, OptLLM supports multi-round dialogues to gradually refine the modeling and solving of optimization problems. To illustrate the effectiveness of OptLLM, we provide tutorials on three typical optimization applications and conduct experiments on both prompt-based GPT models and a fine-tuned Qwen model using a large-scale selfdeveloped optimization dataset. Experimental results show that OptLLM works with various LLMs, and the fine-tuned model achieves an accuracy boost compared to the promptbased models.

Optimising Hard Prompts with Few-Shot Meta-Prompting,Sayash Raaj Hiraou,"Prompting is a flexible and adaptable way of providing instructions to a Large Language Model (LLM). Contextual prompts include context in the form of a document or dialogue along with the natural language instructions to the LLM, often constraining the LLM to restrict facts to that of the given context while complying with the instructions. Masking the context, it acts as template for prompts. In this paper, we present an iterative method to generate better templates using an LLM from an existing set of prompt templates without revealing the context to the LLM. Multiple methods of optimising prompts using the LLM itself are explored to check the effect of few shot sampling methods on iterative propagation while maintaining linguistic styles and syntax on optimisation of prompt templates, yielding a 103.87% improvement using the best performing method. Comparison of the results of multiple contextual tasks demonstrate the ability of LLMs to maintain syntax while learning to replicate linguistic styles. Additionally, the effect on the output with different methods of prompt template generation is shown.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18920v1,2024-07
NoisyAG-News: A Benchmark for Addressing Instance-Dependent Noise in Text Classification,"Hongfei Huang, Tingting Liang, Xixi Sun, Zikang Jin, Yuyu Yin","Existing research on learning with noisy labels predominantly focuses on synthetic label noise. Although synthetic noise possesses well-defined structural properties, it often fails to accurately replicate real-world noise patterns. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to construct generalizable and controllable instance-dependent noise datasets for image classification, significantly advancing the development of noise-robust learning in this area. However, studies on noisy label learning for text classification remain scarce. To better understand label noise in real-world text classification settings, we constructed the benchmark dataset NoisyAG-News through manual annotation. Initially, we analyzed the annotated data to gather observations about real-world noise. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated that real-world noisy labels adhere to instance-dependent patterns. Subsequently, we conducted comprehensive learning experiments on NoisyAG-News and its corresponding synthetic noise datasets using pre-trained language models and noise-handling techniques. Our findings reveal that while pre-trained models are resilient to synthetic noise, they struggle against instance-dependent noise, with samples of varying confusion levels showing inconsistent performance during training and testing. These real-world noise patterns pose new, significant challenges, prompting a reevaluation of noisy label handling methods. We hope that NoisyAG-News will facilitate the development and evaluation of future solutions for learning with noisy labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06579v1,2024-07
Virtual Personas for Language Models via an Anthology of Backstories,"Suhong Moon, Marwa Abdulhai, Minwoo Kang, Joseph Suh, Widyadewi Soedarmadji, Eran Kohen Behar, David M.

In this work, we introduce ""Anthology"", a method for conditioning LLMs to particular virtual personas by harnessing open-ended life narratives, which we refer to as ""backstories."" We show that our methodology enhances the consistency and reliability of experimental outcomes while ensuring better representation of diverse sub-populations. Across three nationally representative human surveys conducted as part of Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), we demonstrate that Anthology achieves up to 18% improvement in matching the response distributions of human respondents and 27% improvement in consistency metrics.

However, high-quality sequential financial investment decision-making remains challenging. These tasks require multiple interactions with a volatile environment for every decision, demanding sufficient intelligence to maximize returns and manage risks. Although LLMs have been used to develop agent systems that surpass human teams and yield impressive investment returns, opportunities to enhance multi-sourced information synthesis and optimize decision-making outcomes through timely experience refinement remain unexplored. Here, we introduce the FinCon, an LLM-based multi-agent framework with CONceptual verbal reinforcement tailored for diverse FINancial tasks. Inspired by effective real-world investment firm organizational structures, FinCon utilizes a manager-analyst communication hierarchy. This structure allows for synchronized cross-functional agent collaboration towards unified goals through natural language interactions and equips each agent with greater memory capacity than humans. Additionally, a risk-control component in FinCon enhances decision quality by episodically initiating a self-critiquing mechanism to update systematic investment beliefs. The conceptualized beliefs serve as verbal reinforcement for the future agent's behavior and can be selectively propagated to the appropriate node that requires knowledge updates. This feature significantly improves performance while reducing unnecessary peer-to-peer communication costs.

Combining Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models,"Amanda Kau, Xuzeng He, Aishwarya Nambissan, Aland Astudillo, Hui Yin, Amir Aryani","In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has played a significant role in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications such as chatbots, text generation, and language translation. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has greatly improved the performance of these applications, showing astonishing results in language understanding and generation. However, they still show some disadvantages, such as hallucinations and lack of domain-specific knowledge, that affect their performance in real-world tasks. These issues can be effectively mitigated by incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which organise information in structured formats that capture relationships between entities in a versatile and interpretable fashion. Likewise, the construction and validation of KGs present challenges that LLMs can help resolve. The complementary relationship between LLMs and KGs has led to a trend that combines these technologies to achieve trustworthy results. This work collected 28 papers outlining methods for KG-powered LLMs, LLM-based KGs, and LLM-KG hybrid approaches. We systematically analysed and compared these approaches to provide a comprehensive overview highlighting key trends, innovative techniques, and common challenges.

It is also known that such evaluators are vulnerable to biases, such as favoring longer responses. While it is important to overcome this problem, the specifics of these biases remain under-explored. In this work, we qualitatively identify six types of biases inherent in various judge models. We propose EvalBiasBench as a meta-evaluation collection of hand-crafted test cases for each bias type.

Our technique formulates the feature combination problem as ""language"" modeling with auto-regressive attentions across both feature and task dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a new dimension of task ID encoding for task representations, thereby enabling precise relevance modeling across diverse ad scenarios with substantial improvement in generality capability for unseen tasks. We demonstrate that our model not only effectively handles the increased computational and maintenance demands as scenarios proliferate, but also outperforms generalized DNN models and even task-specific models across a spectrum of ad applications using a single unified model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06549v1,2024-07
Deciphering Assamese Vowel Harmony with Featural InfoWaveGAN,"Sneha Ray Barman, Shakuntala Mahanta, Neeraj Kumar Sharma","Traditional approaches for understanding phonological learning have predominantly relied on curated text data. Although insightful, such approaches limit the knowledge captured in textual representations of the spoken language. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the potential of the Featural InfoWaveGAN model to learn iterative long-distance vowel harmony using raw speech data. We focus on Assamese, a language known for its phonologically regressive and word-bound vowel harmony. We demonstrate that the model is adept at grasping the intricacies of Assamese phonotactics, particularly iterative long-distance harmony with regressive directionality. It also produced non-iterative illicit forms resembling speech errors during human language acquisition.

We have found that using techniques like sequence packing, loss masking in SFT, increasing the preference dataset size in DPO, and online DPO training can significantly improve the performance of language models. We then train from Gemma-2b-base and LLama-3-8b-base, and find that our best models exceed the performance of the official instruct models tuned with closed-source data and algorithms.

Enhancing Low-Resource NMT with a Multilingual Encoder and Knowledge Distillation: A Case Study,"Aniruddha Roy, Pretam Ray, Ayush Maheshwari, Sudeshna Sarkar, Pawan Goyal","Neural Machine Translation (NMT) remains a formidable challenge, especially when dealing with low-resource languages. Pre-trained sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) multi-lingual models, such as mBART-50, have demonstrated impressive performance in various low-resource NMT tasks. However, their pre-training has been confined to 50 languages, leaving out support for numerous low-resource languages, particularly those spoken in the Indian subcontinent. Expanding mBART-50's language support requires complex pre-training, risking performance decline due to catastrophic forgetting. Considering these expanding challenges, this paper explores a framework that leverages the benefits of a pre-trained language model along with knowledge distillation in a seq2seq architecture to facilitate translation for low-resource languages, including those not covered by mBART-50. The proposed framework employs a multilingual encoder-based seq2seq model as the foundational architecture and subsequently uses complementary knowledge distillation techniques to mitigate the impact of imbalanced training. Our framework is evaluated on three low-resource Indic languages in four Indic-to-Indic directions, yielding significant BLEU-4 and chrF improvements over baselines. Further, we conduct human evaluation to confirm effectiveness of our approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/raypretam/Two-step-low-res-NMT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06538v1,2024-07
Efficient and Accurate Memorable Conversation Model using DPO based on sLLM,"Youngkyung Seo, Yoonseok Heo, Jun-Seok Koh, Du-Seong Chang","In multi-session dialog system, it is essential to continuously update the memory as the session progresses. Simply accumulating memory can make it difficult to focus on the content of the conversation for inference due to the limited input sentence size. Therefore, efficient and accurate conversation model that is capable of managing memory to reflect the conversation history continuously is necessary. This paper presents a conversation model that efficiently manages memory as sessions progress and incorporates this into the model to reflect the conversation history accurately with 3 methodologies: SFT, DPO and DPO with SFT model. Our model using DPO algorithm shows an improvement about 0.0591 of BERTScore in memory accuracy, and the rate of responses reflecting the memory increased as well. Also, response generation performance enhanced about 4.292 in fluency, 3.935 in coherence, and 2.896 in consistency. This paper describes a training method that yields better performance than models with more than twice the parameter size, even when the model size is smaller. Thus, our model demonstrates efficiency not only in terms of accuracy but also in resource utilization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06537v2,2024-07
LETS-C: Leveraging Language Embedding for Time Series Classification,"Rachneet Kaur, Zhen Zeng, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso","Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06533v1,2024-07
STORYSUMM: Evaluating Faithfulness in Story Summarization,"Melanie Subbiah, Faisal Ladhak, Akankshya Mishra, Griffin Adams, Lydia B. Chilton, Kathleen McKeown","Human evaluation has been the gold standard for checking faithfulness in abstractive summarization. However, with a challenging source domain like narrative, multiple annotators can agree a summary is faithful, while missing details that are obvious errors only once pointed out. We therefore introduce a new dataset, STORYSUMM, comprising LLM summaries of short stories with localized faithfulness labels and error explanations. This benchmark is for evaluation methods, testing whether a given method can detect challenging inconsistencies. Using this dataset, we first show that any one human annotation protocol is likely to miss inconsistencies, and we advocate for pursuing a range of methods when establishing ground truth for a summarization dataset. We finally test recent automatic metrics and find that none of them achieve more than 70% balanced accuracy on this task, demonstrating that it is a challenging benchmark for future work in faithfulness evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06501v2,2024-07

Towards Understanding Multi-Task Learning (Generalization) of LLMs via Detecting and Exploring Task-Specific Neurons,"Yongqi Leng, Deyi Xiong","While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior multi-task capabilities, understanding the learning mechanisms behind this is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we attempt to understand such mechanisms from the perspective of neurons. Specifically, we detect task-sensitive neurons in LLMs via gradient attribution on task-specific data. Through extensive deactivation and fine-tuning experiments, we demonstrate that the detected neurons are highly correlated with the given task, which we term as task-specific neurons. With these identified task-specific neurons, we delve into two common problems in multi-task learning and continuous learning: Generalization and Catastrophic Forgetting. We find that the overlap of task-specific neurons is strongly associated with generalization and specialization across tasks. Interestingly, at certain layers of LLMs, there is a high similarity in the parameters of different task-specific neurons, and such similarity is highly correlated with the generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose a neuron-level continuous fine-tuning method that only fine-tunes the current task-specific neurons during continuous learning, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our study provides insights into the interpretability of LLMs in multi-task learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06488v1,2024-07
Composable Interventions for Language Models,"Arinbjorn Kolbeinsson, Kyle O'Brien, Tianjin Huang, Shanghua Gao, Shiwei Liu, Jonathan Richard Schwarz, Anurag Vaidya, Faisal Mahmood, Marinka Zitnik, Tianlong Chen, Thomas Hartvigsen","Test-time interventions for language models can enhance factual accuracy, mitigate harmful outputs, and improve model efficiency without costly retraining. But despite a flood of new methods, different types of interventions are largely developing independently. In practice, multiple interventions must be applied sequentially to the same model, yet we lack standardized ways to study how interventions interact. We fill this gap by introducing composable interventions, a framework to study the effects of using multiple interventions on the same language models, featuring new metrics and a unified codebase. Using our framework, we conduct extensive experiments and compose popular methods from three emerging intervention categories -- Knowledge Editing, Model Compression, and Machine Unlearning. Our results from 310 different compositions uncover meaningful interactions: compression hinders editing and unlearning, composing interventions hinges on their order of application, and popular general-purpose metrics are inadequate for assessing composability. Taken together, our findings showcase clear gaps in composability, suggesting a need for new multi-objective interventions. All of our code is public: https://github.com/hartvigsen-group/composable-interventions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06483v1,2024-07
Interaction Matters: An Evaluation Framework for Interactive Dialogue Assessment on English Second Language Conversations,"Rena Gao, Carsten Roever, Jey Han Lau","We present an evaluation framework for interactive dialogue assessment in the context of English as a Second Language (ESL) speakers. Our framework collects dialogue-level interactivity labels (e.g., topic management; 4 labels in total) and micro-level span features (e.g., backchannels; 17 features in total). Given our annotated data, we study how the micro-level features influence the (higher level) interactivity quality of ESL dialogues by constructing various machine learning-based models. Our results demonstrate that certain micro-level features strongly correlate with interactivity quality, like reference word (e.g., she, her, he), revealing new insights about the interaction between higher-level dialogue quality and lower-level linguistic signals. Our framework also provides a means to assess ESL communication, which is useful for language assessment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06479v1,2024-07
MUSE: Machine Unlearning Six-Way Evaluation for Language Models,"Weijia Shi, Jaechan Lee, Yangsibo Huang, Sadhika Malladi, Jieyu Zhao, Ari Holtzman, Daogao Liu, Luke Zettlemoyer, Noah A. Smith, Chiyuan Zhang","Language models (LMs) are trained on vast amounts of text data, which may include private and copyrighted content. Data owners may request the removal of their data from a trained model due to privacy or copyright concerns. However, exactly unlearning only these datapoints (i.e., retraining with the data removed) is intractable in modern-day models. This has led to the development of many approximate unlearning algorithms. The evaluation of the efficacy of these algorithms has traditionally been narrow in scope, failing to precisely quantify the success and practicality of the algorithm from the perspectives of both the model deployers and the data owners. We address this issue by proposing MUSE, a comprehensive machine unlearning evaluation benchmark that enumerates six diverse desirable properties for unlearned models: (1) no verbatim memorization, (2) no knowledge memorization, (3) no privacy leakage, (4) utility preservation on data not intended for removal, (5) scalability with respect to the size of removal requests, and (6) sustainability over sequential unlearning requests. Using these criteria, we benchmark how effectively eight popular unlearning algorithms on 7B-parameter LMs can unlearn Harry Potter books and news articles. Our results demonstrate that most algorithms can prevent verbatim memorization and knowledge memorization to varying degrees, but only one algorithm does not lead to severe privacy leakage. Furthermore, existing algorithms fail to meet deployer's expectations because they often degrade general model utility and also cannot sustainably accommodate successive unlearning requests or large-scale content removal. Our findings identify key issues with the practicality of existing unlearning algorithms on language models, and we release our benchmark to facilitate further evaluations: muse-bench.github.io",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06460v2,2024-07
SOLO: A Single Transformer for Scalable Vision-Language Modeling,"Yangyi Chen, Xingyao Wang, Hao Peng, Heng Ji","We present SOLO, a single transformer for Scalable visiOn-Language mOdeling. Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) such as LLaVA mostly employ heterogeneous architectures that connect pre-trained visual encoders with large language models (LLMs) to facilitate visual recognition and complex reasoning. Although achieving remarkable performance with relatively lightweight training, we identify four primary scalability limitations: (1) The visual capacity is constrained by pre-trained visual encoders, which are typically an order of magnitude smaller than LLMs. (2) The heterogeneous architecture complicates the use of established hardware and software infrastructure. (3) Study of scaling laws on such architecture must consider three separate components - visual encoder, connector, and LLMs, which complicates the analysis. (4) The use of existing visual encoders typically requires following a pre-defined specification of image inputs pre-processing, for example, by reshaping inputs to fixed-resolution square images, which presents difficulties in processing and training on high-resolution images or those with unusual aspect ratio. A unified single Transformer architecture, like SOLO, effectively addresses these scalability concerns in LVLMs; however, its limited adoption in the modern context likely stems from the absence of reliable training recipes that balance both modalities and ensure stable training for billion-scale models. In this paper, we introduce the first open-source training recipe for developing SOLO, an open-source 7B LVLM using moderate academic resources. The training recipe involves initializing from LLMs, sequential pre-training on ImageNet and web-scale data, and instruction fine-tuning on our curated high-quality datasets. On extensive evaluation, SOLO demonstrates performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5-7B, particularly excelling in visual mathematical reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06438v3,2024-07
An Empirical Study of Gendered Stereotypes in Emotional Attributes for Bangla in Multilingual Large Language Models,"Jayanta Sadhu, Maneesha Rani Saha, Rifat Shahriyar","The influence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly growing, automating more jobs over time. Assessing the fairness of LLMs is crucial due to their expanding impact. Studies reveal the reflection of societal norms and biases in LLMs, which creates a risk of propagating societal stereotypes in downstream tasks. Many studies on bias in LLMs focus on gender bias in various NLP applications. However, there's a gap in research on bias in emotional attributes, despite the close societal link between emotion and gender. This gap is even larger for low-resource languages like Bangla. Historically, women are associated with emotions like empathy, fear, and guilt, while men are linked to anger, bravado, and authority. This pattern reflects societal norms in Bangla-speaking regions. We offer the first thorough investigation of gendered emotion attribution in Bangla for both closed and open source LLMs in this work. Our aim is to elucidate the intricate societal relationship between gender and emotion specifically within the context of Bangla. We have been successful in showing the existence of gender bias in the context of emotions in Bangla through analytical methods and also show how emotion attribution changes on the basis of gendered role selection in LLMs. All of our resources including code and data are made publicly available to support future research on Bangla NLP.   Warning: This paper contains explicit stereotypical statements that many may find offensive.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06432v1,2024-07
DebUnc: Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Model Agent Communication with Uncertainty Estimations,"Luke Yoffe, Alfonso Amayuelas, William Yang Wang","To enhance Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities, multi-agent debates have been introduced, where multiple LLMs discuss solutions to a problem over several rounds of debate. However, LLMs often produce incorrect responses that appear deceptively confident, which can mislead other agents. This is partly because agents do not express their confidence levels during standard debates. To address this, we introduce DebUnc, a multi-agent debate framework that uses uncertainty metrics to assess agent confidence levels. We adapted the LLM attention mechanism to adjust token weights based on confidence levels and also explored using textual prompts to convey confidence. Our evaluations across various benchmarks show that attention-based methods are particularly effective, and that as uncertainty metrics evolve, performance will continue to increase.

Exploring the Capability of ChatGPT to Reproduce Human Labels for Social Computing Tasks (Extended Version),"Yiming Zhu, Peixian Zhang, Ehsan-Ul Haq, Pan Hui, Gareth Tyson","Harnessing the potential of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can help address social challenges through inclusive, ethical, and sustainable means. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which ChatGPT can annotate data for social computing tasks, aiming to reduce the complexity and cost of undertaking web research. To evaluate ChatGPT's potential, we re-annotate seven datasets using ChatGPT, covering topics related to pressing social issues like COVID-19 misinformation, social bot deception, cyberbully, clickbait news, and the Russo-Ukrainian War. Our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT exhibits promise in handling these data annotation tasks, albeit with some challenges. Across the seven datasets, ChatGPT achieves an average annotation F1-score of 72.00%. Its performance excels in clickbait news annotation, correctly labeling 89.66% of the data. However, we also observe significant variations in performance across individual labels. Our study reveals predictable patterns in ChatGPT's annotation performance. Thus, we propose GPT-Rater, a tool to predict if ChatGPT can correctly label data for a given annotation task. Researchers can use this to identify where ChatGPT might be suitable for their annotation requirements. We show that GPT-Rater effectively predicts ChatGPT's performance. It performs best on a clickbait headlines dataset by achieving an average F1-score of 95.00%. We believe that this research opens new avenues for analysis and can reduce barriers to engaging in social computing research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06422v1,2024-07
"If You Don't Understand It, Don't Use It: Eliminating Trojans with Filters Between Layers",Adriano Hernandez,"Large language models (LLMs) sometimes exhibit dangerous unintended behaviors. Finding and fixing these is challenging because the attack surface is massive -- it is not tractable to exhaustively search for all possible inputs that may elicit such behavior. One specific and particularly challenging case is that if data-poisoning-injected trojans, since there is no way to know what they are to search for them. To our knowledge, there is no generally applicable method to unlearn unknown trojans injected during pre-training. This work seeks to provide a general purpose recipe (filters) and a specific implementation (LoRA) filters that work in practice on small to medium sized models. The focus is primarily empirical, though some perplexing behavior opens the door to the fundamental question of how LLMs store and process information. Not unexpectedly, we find that our filters work best on the residual stream and the latest layers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06411v1,2024-07

However, model developers fail to disclose their construction methodology which has lead to a lack of open information on how to develop effective pretraining sets. To address this issue, we perform the first systematic study across the entire pipeline of pretraining set construction. First, we run ablations on existing techniques for pretraining set development to identify which methods translate to the largest gains in model accuracy on downstream evaluations. Then, we categorize the most widely used data source, web crawl snapshots, across the attributes of toxicity, quality, type of speech, and domain. Finally, we show how such attribute information can be used to further refine and improve the quality of a pretraining set. These findings constitute an actionable set of steps that practitioners can use to develop high quality pretraining sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06380v2,2024-07
Large Language Model Recall Uncertainty is Modulated by the Fan Effect,"Jesse Roberts, Kyle Moore, Thao Pham, Oseremhen Ewaleifoh, Doug Fisher","This paper evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive fan effects, similar to those discovered by Anderson in humans, after being pre-trained on human textual data. We conduct two sets of in-context recall experiments designed to elicit fan effects. Consistent with human results, we find that LLM recall uncertainty, measured via token probability, is influenced by the fan effect. Our results show that removing uncertainty disrupts the observed effect. The experiments suggest the fan effect is consistent whether the fan value is induced in-context or in the pre-training data. Finally, these findings provide in-silico evidence that fan effects and typicality are expressions of the same phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06349v2,2024-07
CharSS: Character-Level Transformer Model for Sanskrit Word Segmentation,"Krishnakant Bhatt, Karthika N J, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Preethi Jyothi","Subword tokens in Indian languages inherently carry meaning, and isolating them can enhance NLP tasks, making sub-word segmentation a crucial process. Segmenting Sanskrit and other Indian languages into subtokens is not straightforward, as it may include sandhi, which may lead to changes in the word boundaries. We propose a new approach of utilizing a Character-level Transformer model for Sanskrit Word Segmentation (CharSS). We perform experiments on three benchmark datasets to compare the performance of our method against existing methods. On the UoH+SandhiKosh dataset, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art system by an absolute gain of 6.72 points in split prediction accuracy. On the hackathon dataset, our method achieves a gain of 2.27 points over the current SOTA system in terms of perfect match metric. We also propose a use-case of Sanskrit-based segments for a linguistically informed translation of technical terms to lexically similar low-resource Indian languages.

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory,"Luca Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, Alessandro Achille, Stefano Soatto","We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (""context"" in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory ""in-context,"" permanent structural memory ""in-weights,"" fading memory ""in-state,"" and long-term eidetic memory ""in-storage"" by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06324v1,2024-07
"When in Doubt, Cascade: Towards Building Efficient and Capable Guardrails","Manish Nagireddy, Inkit Padhi, Soumya Ghosh, Prasanna Sattigeri","Large language models (LLMs) have convincing performance in a variety of downstream tasks. However, these systems are prone to generating undesirable outputs such as harmful and biased text. In order to remedy such generations, the development of guardrail (or detector) models has gained traction. Motivated by findings from developing a detector for social bias, we adopt the notion of a use-mention distinction - which we identified as the primary source of under-performance in the preliminary versions of our social bias detector. Armed with this information, we describe a fully extensible and reproducible synthetic data generation pipeline which leverages taxonomy-driven instructions to create targeted and labeled data. Using this pipeline, we generate over 300K unique contrastive samples and provide extensive experiments to systematically evaluate performance on a suite of open source datasets. We show that our method achieves competitive performance with a fraction of the cost in compute and offers insight into iteratively developing efficient and capable guardrail models.

Personality Analysis for Social Media Users using Arabic language and its Effect on Sentiment Analysis,"Mokhaiber Dandash, Masoud Asadpour","Social media is heading towards more and more personalization, where individuals reveal their beliefs, interests, habits, and activities, simply offering glimpses into their personality traits. This study, explores the correlation between the use of Arabic language on twitter, personality traits and its impact on sentiment analysis. We indicated the personality traits of users based on the information extracted from their profile activities, and the content of their tweets. Our analysis incorporated linguistic features, profile statistics (including gender, age, bio, etc.), as well as additional features like emoticons. To obtain personality data, we crawled the timelines and profiles of users who took the 16personalities test in Arabic on 16personalities.com. Our dataset, ""AraPers"", comprised 3,250 users who shared their personality results on twitter. We implemented various machine learning techniques, to reveal personality traits and developed a dedicated model for this purpose, achieving a 74.86% accuracy rate with BERT, analysis of this dataset proved that linguistic features, profile features and derived model can be used to differentiate between different personality traits. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that personality affect sentiment in social media.

VIMI: Grounding Video Generation through Multi-modal Instruction,"Yuwei Fang, Willi Menapace, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Tsai-Shien Chen, Kuan-Chien Wang, Ivan Skorokhodov, Graham Neubig, Sergey Tulyakov","Existing text-to-video diffusion models rely solely on text-only encoders for their pretraining. This limitation stems from the absence of large-scale multimodal prompt video datasets, resulting in a lack of visual grounding and restricting their versatility and application in multimodal integration. To address this, we construct a large-scale multimodal prompt dataset by employing retrieval methods to pair in-context examples with the given text prompts and then utilize a two-stage training strategy to enable diverse video generation tasks within the same model. In the first stage, we propose a multimodal conditional video generation framework for pretraining on these augmented datasets, establishing a foundational model for grounded video generation. Secondly, we finetune the model from the first stage on three video generation tasks, incorporating multi-modal instructions. This process further refines the model's ability to handle diverse inputs and tasks, ensuring seamless integration of multi-modal information. After this two-stage train-ing process, VIMI demonstrates multimodal understanding capabilities, producing contextually rich and personalized videos grounded in the provided inputs, as shown in Figure 1. Compared to previous visual grounded video generation methods, VIMI can synthesize consistent and temporally coherent videos with large motion while retaining the semantic control.

Hybrid X-Linker: Automated Data Generation and Extreme Multi-label Ranking for Biomedical Entity Linking,"Pedro Ruas, Fernando Gallego, Francisco J. Veredas, Francisco M. Couto","State-of-the-art deep learning entity linking methods rely on extensive human-labelled data, which is costly to acquire. Current datasets are limited in size, leading to inadequate coverage of biomedical concepts and diminished performance when applied to new data. In this work, we propose to automatically generate data to create large-scale training datasets, which allows the exploration of approaches originally developed for the task of extreme multi-label ranking in the biomedical entity linking task. We propose the hybrid X-Linker pipeline that includes different modules to link disease and chemical entity mentions to concepts in the MEDIC and the CTD-Chemical vocabularies, respectively. X-Linker was evaluated on several biomedical datasets: BC5CDR-Disease, BioRED-Disease, NCBI-Disease, BC5CDR-Chemical, BioRED-Chemical, and NLM-Chem, achieving top-1 accuracies of 0.8307, 0.7969, 0.8271, 0.9511, 0.9248, and 0.7895, respectively. X-Linker demonstrated superior performance in three datasets: BC5CDR-Disease, NCBI-Disease, and BioRED-Chemical. In contrast, SapBERT outperformed X-Linker in the remaining three datasets. Both models rely only on the mention string for their operations. The source code of X-Linker and its associated data are publicly available for performing biomedical entity linking without requiring pre-labelled entities with identifiers from specific knowledge organization systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06292v1,2024-07
Multi-Object Hallucination in Vision-Language Models,"Xuweiyi Chen, Ziqiao Ma, Xuejun Zhang, Sihan Xu, Shengyi Qian, Jianing Yang, David F. Fouhey, Joyce Chai","Large vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, producing objects not present in the given images. While current benchmarks for object hallucination primarily concentrate on the presence of a single object class rather than individual entities, this work systematically investigates multi-object hallucination, examining how models misperceive (e.g., invent nonexistent objects or become distracted) when tasked with focusing on multiple objects simultaneously. We introduce Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE), an automated evaluation protocol that considers the distribution of object classes within a single image during testing and uses visual referring prompts to eliminate ambiguity. With comprehensive empirical studies and analysis of potential factors leading to multi-object hallucination, we found that (1). LVLMs suffer more hallucinations when focusing on multiple objects compared to a single object. (2). The tested object class distribution affects hallucination behaviors, indicating that LVLMs may follow shortcuts and spurious correlations. (3). Hallucinatory behaviors are influenced by data-specific factors, salience and frequency, and model intrinsic behaviors. We hope to enable LVLMs to recognize and reason about multiple objects that often occur in realistic visual scenes, provide insights, and quantify our progress towards mitigating the issues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06192v2,2024-07
CodeUpdateArena: Benchmarking Knowledge Editing on API Updates,"Zeyu Leo Liu, Shrey Pandit, Xi Ye, Eunsol Choi, Greg Durrett","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to synthesize and reason about source code. However, the static nature of these models' knowledge does not reflect the fact that libraries and API functions they invoke are continuously evolving, with functionality being added or changing. While numerous benchmarks evaluate how LLMs can generate code, no prior work has studied how an LLMs' knowledge about code API functions can be updated. To fill this gap, we present CodeUpdateArena, a benchmark for knowledge editing in the code domain. An instance in our benchmark consists of a synthetic API function update paired with a program synthesis example that uses the updated functionality; our goal is to update an LLM to be able to solve this program synthesis example without providing documentation of the update at inference time. Compared to knowledge editing for facts encoded in text, success here is more challenging: a code LLM must correctly reason about the semantics of the modified function rather than just reproduce its syntax. Our dataset is constructed by first prompting GPT-4 to generate atomic and executable function updates. Then, for each update, we generate program synthesis examples whose code solutions are prone to use the update. Our benchmark covers updates of various types to 54 functions from seven diverse Python packages, with a total of 670 program synthesis examples. Our experiments show that prepending documentation of the update to open-source code LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek, CodeLlama) does not allow them to incorporate changes for problem solving, and existing knowledge editing techniques also have substantial room for improvement. We hope our benchmark will inspire new methods for knowledge updating in code LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06249v1,2024-07

To address this problem, we create a survey to determine caption preferences and propose a culture-centric evaluation benchmark by filtering VizWiz, an existing dataset with images taken by people who are blind. We then evaluate several VLMs, investigating their reliability as visual assistants in a culturally diverse setting. While our results for state-of-the-art models are promising, we identify challenges such as hallucination and misalignment of automatic evaluation metrics with human judgment. We make our survey, data, code, and model outputs publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06177v1,2024-07
On Speeding Up Language Model Evaluation,"Jin Peng Zhou, Christian K. Belardi, Ruihan Wu, Travis Zhang, Carla P. Gomes, Wen Sun, Kilian Q. Weinberger","Developing prompt-based methods with Large Language Models (LLMs) requires making numerous decisions, which give rise to a combinatorial search problem. For example, selecting the right pre-trained LLM, prompt, and hyperparameters to attain the best performance for a task typically necessitates evaluating an expoential number of candidates on large validation sets. This exhaustive evaluation can be time-consuming and costly, as both inference and evaluation of LLM-based approaches are resource-intensive. Worse, a lot of computation is wasted: Many hyper-parameter settings are non-competitive, and many samples from the validation set are highly correlated - providing little or no new information. So, if the goal is to identify the best method, it can be done far more efficiently if the validation samples and methods are selected adaptively. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address this challenge. We lean on low-rank matrix factorization to fill in missing evaluations and on multi-armed bandits to sequentially identify the next (method, validation sample)-pair to evaluate. We carefully assess the efficacy of our approach on several competitive benchmark problems and show that it can identify the top-performing method using only 5-15% of the typically needed resources -- resulting in a staggering 85-95% LLM cost savings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06172v2,2024-07
What's Wrong with Your Code Generated by Large Language Models? An Extensive Study,"Shihan Dou, Haoxiang Jia, Shenxi Wu, Huiyuan Zheng, Weikang Zhou, Muling Wu, Mingxu Chai, Jessica Fan, Caishuang Huang, Yunbo Tao, Yan Liu, Enyu Zhou, Ming Zhang, Yuhao Zhou, Yueming Wu, Rui Zheng, Ming Wen, Rongxiang Weng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Tao Gui, Xipeng Qiu, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","The increasing development of large language models (LLMs) in code generation has drawn significant attention among researchers. To enhance LLM-based code generation ability, current efforts are predominantly directed towards collecting high-quality datasets and leveraging diverse training technologies. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive studies examining the limitations and boundaries of these existing methods. To bridge this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study evaluating the performance of three leading closed-source LLMs and four popular open-source LLMs on three commonly used benchmarks. Our investigation, which evaluated the length, cyclomatic complexity and API number of the generated code, revealed that these LLMs face challenges in generating successful code for more complex problems, and tend to produce code that is shorter yet more complicated as compared to canonical solutions. Additionally, we developed a taxonomy of bugs for incorrect codes that includes three categories and 12 sub-categories, and analyze the root cause for common bug types. Furthermore, to better understand the performance of LLMs in real-world projects, we manually created a real-world benchmark comprising 140 code generation tasks. Our analysis highlights distinct differences in bug distributions between actual scenarios and existing benchmarks. Finally, we propose a novel training-free iterative method that introduces self-critique, enabling LLMs to critique and correct their generated code based on bug types and compiler feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can significantly mitigate bugs and increase the passing rate by 29.2% after two iterations, indicating substantial potential for LLMs to handle more complex problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06153v1,2024-07
Using Grammar Masking to Ensure Syntactic Validity in LLM-based Modeling Tasks,"Lukas Netz, Jan Reimer, Bernhard Rumpe","We present and evaluate a method called grammar masking, which is used to guide large language models (LLMs) toward producing syntactically correct models for a given context-free grammar. Prompt engineering methods such as few-shot learning or priming can be used to improve the chances of an LLM producing correct syntax, but the more complex the grammar, the more time-consuming and less promising these methods become. Previous work is focused primarily on the usage of either language model training or prompt engineering. In this work, a method is presented that restricts the output to a given grammar using constrained decoding to ensure the output adheres to a valid syntax. We use several DSLs built with MontiCore and task multiple LLMs to produce models with and without constrained decoding. A corresponding parser is used to confirm the syntactic correctness of each model. We show that grammar masking can dramatically improve the modeling capabilities of several LLMs, reducing the need for well-refined prompting while increasing the chance of producing correct models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06146v2,2024-07
"ANOLE: An Open, Autoregressive, Native Large Multimodal Models for Interleaved Image-Text Generation","Ethan Chern, Jiadi Su, Yan Ma, Pengfei Liu","Previous open-source large multimodal models (LMMs) have faced several limitations: (1) they often lack native integration, requiring adapters to align visual representations with pre-trained large language models (LLMs); (2) many are restricted to single-modal generation; (3) while some support multimodal generation, they rely on separate diffusion models for visual modeling and generation. To mitigate these limitations, we present Anole, an open, autoregressive, native large multimodal model for interleaved image-text generation. We build Anole from Meta AI's Chameleon, adopting an innovative fine-tuning strategy that is both data-efficient and parameter-efficient. Anole demonstrates high-quality, coherent multimodal generation capabilities. We have open-sourced our model, training framework, and instruction tuning data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06135v1,2024-07
Historical Ink: Semantic Shift Detection for 19th Century Spanish,"Tony Montes, Laura Manrique-Gómez, Rubén Manrique","This paper explores the evolution of word meanings in 19th-century Spanish texts, with an emphasis on Latin American Spanish, using computational linguistics techniques. It addresses the Semantic Shift Detection (SSD) task, which is crucial for understanding linguistic evolution, particularly in historical contexts. The study focuses on analyzing a set of Spanish target words. To achieve this, a 19th-century Spanish corpus is constructed, and a customizable pipeline for SSD tasks is developed. This pipeline helps find the senses of a word and measure their semantic change between two corpora using fine-tuned BERT-like models with old Spanish texts for both Latin American and general Spanish cases. The results provide valuable insights into the cultural and societal shifts reflected in language changes over time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12852v2,2024-07
Enhancing Language Model Rationality with Bi-Directional Deliberation Reasoning,"Yadong Zhang, Shaoguang Mao, Wenshan Wu, Yan Xia, Tao Ge, Man Lan, Furu Wei","This paper introduces BI-Directional DEliberation Reasoning (BIDDER), a novel reasoning approach to enhance the decision rationality of language models. Traditional reasoning methods typically rely on historical information and employ uni-directional (left-to-right) reasoning strategy. This lack of bi-directional deliberation reasoning results in limited awareness of potential future outcomes and insufficient integration of historical context, leading to suboptimal decisions. BIDDER addresses this gap by incorporating principles of rational decision-making, specifically managing uncertainty and predicting expected utility. Our approach involves three key processes: Inferring hidden states to represent uncertain information in the decision-making process from historical data; Using these hidden states to predict future potential states and potential outcomes; Integrating historical information (past contexts) and long-term outcomes (future contexts) to inform reasoning. By leveraging bi-directional reasoning, BIDDER ensures thorough exploration of both past and future contexts, leading to more informed and rational decisions. We tested BIDDER's effectiveness in two well-defined scenarios: Poker (Limit Texas Hold'em) and Negotiation. Our experiments demonstrate that BIDDER significantly improves the decision-making capabilities of LLMs and LLM agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06112v1,2024-07
Epistemological Bias As a Means for the Automated Detection of Injustices in Text,"Kenya Andrews, Lamogha Chiazor","Injustice occurs when someone experiences unfair treatment or their rights are violated and is often due to the presence of implicit biases and prejudice such as stereotypes. The automated identification of injustice in text has received little attention, due in part to the fact that underlying implicit biases or stereotypes are rarely explicitly stated and that instances often occur unconsciously due to the pervasive nature of prejudice in society. Here, we describe a novel framework that combines the use of a fine-tuned BERT-based bias detection model, two stereotype detection models, and a lexicon-based approach to show that epistemological biases (i.e., words, which presupposes, entails, asserts, hedges, or boosts text to erode or assert a person's capacity as a knower) can assist with the automatic detection of injustice in text. The news media has many instances of injustice (i.e. discriminatory narratives), thus it is our use case here. We conduct and discuss an empirical qualitative research study which shows how the framework can be applied to detect injustices, even at higher volumes of data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06098v1,2024-07
"Merge, Ensemble, and Cooperate! A Survey on Collaborative Strategies in the Era of Large Language Models","Jinliang Lu, Ziliang Pang, Min Xiao, Yaochen Zhu, Rui Xia, Jiajun Zhang","The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered natural language processing (NLP) research into a new era. Despite their diverse capabilities, LLMs trained on different corpora exhibit varying strengths and weaknesses, leading to challenges in maximizing their overall efficiency and versatility. To address these challenges, recent studies have explored collaborative strategies for LLMs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of this emerging research area, highlighting the motivation behind such collaborations. Specifically, we categorize collaborative strategies into three primary approaches: Merging, Ensemble, and Cooperation. Merging involves integrating multiple LLMs in the parameter space. Ensemble combines the outputs of various LLMs. Cooperation} leverages different LLMs to allow full play to their diverse capabilities for specific tasks. We provide in-depth introductions to these methods from different perspectives and discuss their potential applications. Additionally, we outline future research directions, hoping this work will catalyze further studies on LLM collaborations and paving the way for advanced NLP applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06089v1,2024-07
From Loops to Oops: Fallback Behaviors of Language Models Under Uncertainty,"Maor Ivgi, Ori Yoran, Jonathan Berant, Mor Geva","Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit undesirable behaviors, such as hallucinations and sequence repetitions. We propose to view these behaviors as fallbacks that models exhibit under uncertainty, and investigate the connection between them. We categorize fallback behaviors -- sequence repetitions, degenerate text, and hallucinations -- and extensively analyze them in models from the same family that differ by the amount of pretraining tokens, parameter count, or the inclusion of instruction-following training. Our experiments reveal a clear and consistent ordering of fallback behaviors, across all these axes: the more advanced an LLM is (i.e., trained on more tokens, has more parameters, or instruction-tuned), its fallback behavior shifts from sequence repetitions, to degenerate text, and then to hallucinations. Moreover, the same ordering is observed throughout a single generation, even for the best-performing models; as uncertainty increases, models shift from generating hallucinations to producing degenerate text and then sequence repetitions. Lastly, we demonstrate that while common decoding techniques, such as random sampling, might alleviate some unwanted behaviors like sequence repetitions, they increase harder-to-detect hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06071v1,2024-07
Variational Best-of-N Alignment,"Afra Amini, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell","Best-of-N (BoN) is a popular and effective algorithm for aligning language models to human preferences. The algorithm works as follows: at inference time, N samples are drawn from the language model, and the sample with the highest reward, as judged by a reward model, is returned as the output. Despite its effectiveness, BoN is computationally expensive; it reduces sampling throughput by a factor of N. To make BoN more efficient at inference time, one strategy is to fine-tune the language model to mimic what BoN does during inference. To achieve this, we derive the distribution induced by the BoN algorithm. We then propose to fine-tune the language model to minimize backward KL divergence to the BoN distribution. Our approach is analogous to mean-field variational inference and, thus, we term it variational BoN (vBoN). To the extent this fine-tuning is successful and we end up with a good approximation, we have reduced the inference cost by a factor of N. Our experiments on a controlled generation task suggest that while variational BoN is not as effective as BoN in aligning language models, it is close to BoN performance as vBoN appears more often on the Pareto frontier of reward and KL divergence compared to models trained with KL-constrained RL objective.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06057v1,2024-07
Vision-Braille: An End-to-End Tool for Chinese Braille Image-to-Text Translation,"Alan Wu, Ye Yuan, Ming Zhang","Visually impaired people are a large group who can only use braille for reading and writing. However, the lack of special educational resources is the bottleneck for educating them. Educational equity is a reflection of the level of social civilization, cultural equality, and individual dignity. Facilitating and improving lifelong learning channels for the visually impaired is of great significance. Their written braille homework or exam papers cannot be understood by sighted teachers, because of the lack of a highly accurate braille translation system, especially in Chinese which has tone marks. braille writers often omit tone marks to save space, leading to confusion when braille with the same consonants and vowels is translated into Chinese. Previous algorithms were insufficient in extracting contextual information, resulting in low accuracy of braille translations into Chinese. This project informatively fine-tuned the mT5 model with an Encoder-decoder architecture for braille to Chinese character conversion. This research created a training set of braille and corresponding Chinese text from the Leipzig Corpora. This project significantly reduced the confusion in braille, achieving $62.4$ and $62.3$ BLEU scores in the validation and test sets, with a curriculum learning fine-tuning method. By incorporating the braille recognition algorithm, this project is the first publicly available braille translation system and can benefit lots of visually impaired students and families who are preparing for the Chinese College Test and help to propel their college dreams in the future.

MST5 -- Multilingual Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs,"Nikit Srivastava, Mengshi Ma, Daniel Vollmers, Hamada Zahera, Diego Moussallem, Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo","Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) simplifies querying vast amounts of knowledge stored in a graph-based model using natural language. However, the research has largely concentrated on English, putting non-English speakers at a disadvantage. Meanwhile, existing multilingual KGQA systems face challenges in achieving performance comparable to English systems, highlighting the difficulty of generating SPARQL queries from diverse languages. In this research, we propose a simplified approach to enhance multilingual KGQA systems by incorporating linguistic context and entity information directly into the processing pipeline of a language model. Unlike existing methods that rely on separate encoders for integrating auxiliary information, our strategy leverages a single, pretrained multilingual transformer-based language model to manage both the primary input and the auxiliary data. Our methodology significantly improves the language model's ability to accurately convert a natural language query into a relevant SPARQL query. It demonstrates promising results on the most recent QALD datasets, namely QALD-9-Plus and QALD-10. Furthermore, we introduce and evaluate our approach on Chinese and Japanese, thereby expanding the language diversity of the existing datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06041v1,2024-07
PAS: Data-Efficient Plug-and-Play Prompt Augmentation System,"Miao Zheng, Hao Liang, Fan Yang, Haoze Sun, Tianpeng Li, Lingchu Xiong, Yan Zhang, Youzhen Wu, Kun Li, Yanjun Shen, Mingan Lin, Tao Zhang, Guosheng Dong, Yujing Qiao, Kun Fang, Weipeng Chen, Bin Cui, Wentao Zhang, Zenan Zhou","In recent years, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred a growing demand for plug-and-play AI systems. Among the various AI techniques, prompt engineering stands out as particularly significant. However, users often face challenges in writing prompts due to the steep learning curve and significant time investment, and existing automatic prompt engineering (APE) models can be difficult to use. To address this issue, we propose PAS, an LLM-based plug-and-play APE system. PAS utilizes LLMs trained on high-quality, automatically generated prompt complementary datasets, resulting in exceptional performance. In comprehensive benchmarks, PAS achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results compared to previous APE models, with an average improvement of 6.09 points. Moreover, PAS is highly efficient, achieving SoTA performance with only 9000 data points. Additionally, PAS can autonomously generate prompt augmentation data without requiring additional human labor. Its flexibility also allows it to be compatible with all existing LLMs and applicable to a wide range of tasks. PAS excels in human evaluations, underscoring its suitability as a plug-in for users. This combination of high performance, efficiency, and flexibility makes PAS a valuable system for enhancing the usability and effectiveness of LLMs through improved prompt engineering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06027v5,2024-07

However, the diversity of symptom terminologies is one of the major obstacles hindering the analysis and knowledge sharing of various types of symptom-related medical data particularly in the fields of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Objective: This study aimed to construct an Integrated Ontology of symptom phenotypes (ISPO) to support the data mining of Chinese EMRs and real-world study in TCM field. Methods: To construct an integrated ontology of symptom phenotypes (ISPO), we manually annotated classical TCM textbooks and large-scale Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs) to collect symptom terms with support from a medical text annotation system. Furthermore, to facilitate the semantic interoperability between different terminologies, we incorporated public available biomedical vocabularies by manual mapping between Chinese terms and English terms with cross-references to source vocabularies. In addition, we evaluated the ISPO using independent clinical EMRs to provide a high-usable medical ontology for clinical data analysis. Results: By integrating 78,696 inpatient cases of EMRs, 5 biomedical vocabularies, 21 TCM books and dictionaries, ISPO provides 3,147 concepts, 23,475 terms, and 55,552 definition or contextual texts. Adhering to the taxonomical structure of the related anatomical systems of symptom phenotypes, ISPO provides 12 top-level categories and 79 middle-level sub-categories. The validation of data analysis showed the ISPO has a coverage rate of 95.35%, 98.53% and 92.66% for symptom terms with occurrence rates of 0.5% in additional three independent curated clinical datasets, which can demonstrate the significant value of ISPO in mapping clinical terms to ontologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12851v1,2024-07
Distilling System 2 into System 1,"Ping Yu, Jing Xu, Jason Weston, Ilia Kulikov","Large language models (LLMs) can spend extra compute during inference to generate intermediate thoughts, which helps to produce better final responses. Since Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), many such System 2 techniques have been proposed such as Rephrase and Respond (Deng et al., 2023a), System 2 Attention (Weston and Sukhbaatar, 2023) and Branch-Solve-Merge (Saha et al., 2023). In this work we investigate self-supervised methods to ``compile'' (distill) higher quality outputs from System 2 techniques back into LLM generations without intermediate reasoning token sequences, as this reasoning has been distilled into System 1. We show that several such techniques can be successfully distilled, resulting in improved results compared to the original System 1 performance, and with less inference cost than System 2. We posit that such System 2 distillation will be an important feature of future continually learning AI systems, enabling them to focus System 2 capabilities on the reasoning tasks that they cannot yet do well.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06023v3,2024-07
Igea: a Decoder-Only Language Model for Biomedical Text Generation in Italian,"Tommaso Mario Buonocore, Simone Rancati, Enea Parimbelli","The development of domain-specific language models has significantly advanced natural language processing applications in various specialized fields, particularly in biomedicine. However, the focus has largely been on English-language models, leaving a gap for less-resourced languages such as Italian. This paper introduces Igea, the first decoder-only language model designed explicitly for biomedical text generation in Italian. Built on the Minerva model and continually pretrained on a diverse corpus of Italian medical texts, Igea is available in three model sizes: 350 million, 1 billion, and 3 billion parameters. The models aim to balance computational efficiency and performance, addressing the challenges of managing the peculiarities of medical terminology in Italian.

Perceptions to Beliefs: Exploring Precursory Inferences for Theory of Mind in Large Language Models,"Chani Jung, Dongkwan Kim, Jiho Jin, Jiseon Kim, Yeon Seonwoo, Yejin Choi, Alice Oh, Hyunwoo Kim","While humans naturally develop theory of mind (ToM), the capability to understand other people's mental states and beliefs, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) underperform on simple ToM benchmarks. We posit that we can extend our understanding of LLMs' ToM abilities by evaluating key human ToM precursors$-$perception inference and perception-to-belief inference$-$in LLMs. We introduce two datasets, Percept-ToMi and Percept-FANToM, to evaluate these precursory inferences for ToM in LLMs by annotating characters' perceptions on ToMi and FANToM, respectively. Our evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that the models generally perform well in perception inference while exhibiting limited capability in perception-to-belief inference (e.g., lack of inhibitory control). Based on these results, we present PercepToM, a novel ToM method leveraging LLMs' strong perception inference capability while supplementing their limited perception-to-belief inference.

To address this, we conduct extensive multilingual continual pre-training on the LLaMA series models, enabling translation support across more than 100 languages. Through a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, such as vocabulary expansion and data augmentation, we develop LLaMAX. Remarkably, without sacrificing its generalization ability, LLaMAX achieves significantly higher translation performance compared to existing open-source LLMs (by more than 10 spBLEU points) and performs on-par with specialized translation model (M2M-100-12B) on the Flores-101 benchmark. Extensive experiments indicate that LLaMAX can serve as a robust multilingual foundation model.

T2VSafetyBench: Evaluating the Safety of Text-to-Video Generative Models,"Yibo Miao, Yifan Zhu, Yinpeng Dong, Lijia Yu, Jun Zhu, Xiao-Shan Gao","The recent development of Sora leads to a new era in text-to-video (T2V) generation. Along with this comes the rising concern about its security risks. The generated videos may contain illegal or unethical content, and there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative understanding of their safety, posing a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. Previous evaluations primarily focus on the quality of video generation. While some evaluations of text-to-image models have considered safety, they cover fewer aspects and do not address the unique temporal risk inherent in video generation. To bridge this research gap, we introduce T2VSafetyBench, a new benchmark designed for conducting safety-critical assessments of text-to-video models. We define 12 critical aspects of video generation safety and construct a malicious prompt dataset including real-world prompts, LLM-generated prompts and jailbreak attack-based prompts. Based on our evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with different models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4 assessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off between the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This indicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks are set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We hope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the safety of video generation in the era of generative AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05965v3,2024-07

In this paper, we present ORAN-Bench-13K, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the context of O-RAN. Our benchmark consists of 13,952 meticulously curated multiple-choice questions generated from 116 O-RAN specification documents. We leverage a novel three-stage LLM framework, and the questions are categorized into three distinct difficulties to cover a wide spectrum of ORAN-related knowledge. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs, including Gemini, Chat-GPT, and Mistral. Additionally, we propose ORANSight, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based pipeline that demonstrates superior performance on ORAN-Bench-13K compared to other tested closed-source models. Our findings indicate that current popular LLM models are not proficient in O-RAN, highlighting the need for specialized models. We observed a noticeable performance improvement when incorporating the RAG-based ORANSight pipeline, with a Macro Accuracy of 0.784 and a Weighted Accuracy of 0.776, which was on average 21.55% and 22.59% better than the other tested LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06245v2,2024-07
Affordances-Oriented Planning using Foundation Models for Continuous Vision-Language Navigation,"Jiaqi Chen, Bingqian Lin, Xinmin Liu, Lin Ma, Xiaodan Liang, Kwan-Yee K. Wong","LLM-based agents have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance in vision-language navigation (VLN) task. However, existing LLM-based methods often focus only on solving high-level task planning by selecting nodes in predefined navigation graphs for movements, overlooking low-level control in navigation scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose AO-Planner, a novel Affordances-Oriented Planner for continuous VLN task. Our AO-Planner integrates various foundation models to achieve affordances-oriented low-level motion planning and high-level decision-making, both performed in a zero-shot setting. Specifically, we employ a Visual Affordances Prompting (VAP) approach, where the visible ground is segmented by SAM to provide navigational affordances, based on which the LLM selects potential candidate waypoints and plans low-level paths towards selected waypoints. We further propose a high-level PathAgent which marks planned paths into the image input and reasons the most probable path by comprehending all environmental information. Finally, we convert the selected path into 3D coordinates using camera intrinsic parameters and depth information, avoiding challenging 3D predictions for LLMs. Experiments on the challenging R2R-CE and RxR-CE datasets show that AO-Planner achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance (8.8% improvement on SPL). Our method can also serve as a data annotator to obtain pseudo-labels, distilling its waypoint prediction ability into a learning-based predictor. This new predictor does not require any waypoint data from the simulator and achieves 47% SR competing with supervised methods. We establish an effective connection between LLM and 3D world, presenting novel prospects for employing foundation models in low-level motion control.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05890v2,2024-07
Generation and De-Identification of Indian Clinical Discharge Summaries using LLMs,"Sanjeet Singh, Shreya Gupta, Niralee Gupta, Naimish Sharma, Lokesh Srivastava, Vibhu Agarwal, Ashutosh Modi","The consequences of a healthcare data breach can be devastating for the patients, providers, and payers. The average financial impact of a data breach in recent months has been estimated to be close to USD 10 million. This is especially significant for healthcare organizations in India that are managing rapid digitization while still establishing data governance procedures that align with the letter and spirit of the law. Computer-based systems for de-identification of personal information are vulnerable to data drift, often rendering them ineffective in cross-institution settings. Therefore, a rigorous assessment of existing de-identification against local health datasets is imperative to support the safe adoption of digital health initiatives in India. Using a small set of de-identified patient discharge summaries provided by an Indian healthcare institution, in this paper, we report the nominal performance of de-identification algorithms (based on language models) trained on publicly available non-Indian datasets, pointing towards a lack of cross-institutional generalization. Similarly, experimentation with off-the-shelf de-identification systems reveals potential risks associated with the approach. To overcome data scarcity, we explore generating synthetic clinical reports (using publicly available and Indian summaries) by performing in-context learning over Large Language Models (LLMs). Our experiments demonstrate the use of generated reports as an effective strategy for creating high-performing de-identification systems with good generalization capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05887v1,2024-07
A Survey on LoRA of Large Language Models,"Yuren Mao, Yuhang Ge, Yijiang Fan, Wenyi Xu, Yu Mi, Zhonghao Hu, Yunjun Gao","Low-Rank Adaptation~(LoRA), which updates the dense neural network layers with pluggable low-rank matrices, is one of the best performed parameter efficient fine-tuning paradigms.

KG-FPQ: Evaluating Factuality Hallucination in LLMs with Knowledge Graph-based False Premise Questions,"Yanxu Zhu, Jinlin Xiao, Yuhang Wang, Jitao Sang","Recent studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to being misled by false premise questions (FPQs), leading to errors in factual knowledge, know as factuality hallucination. Existing benchmarks that assess this vulnerability primarily rely on manual construction, resulting in limited scale and lack of scalability. In this work, we introduce an automated, scalable pipeline to create FPQs based on knowledge graphs (KGs). The first step is modifying true triplets extracted from KGs to create false premises. Subsequently, utilizing the state-of-the-art capabilities of GPTs, we generate semantically rich FPQs. Based on the proposed method, we present a comprehensive benchmark, the Knowledge Graph-based False Premise Questions (KG-FPQ), which contains approximately 178k FPQs across three knowledge domains, at six levels of confusability, and in two task formats. Using KG-FPQ, we conduct extensive evaluations on several representative LLMs and provide valuable insights. The KG-FPQ dataset and code are available at~https://github.com/yanxuzhu/KG-FPQ.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05868v2,2024-07
An Empirical Comparison of Vocabulary Expansion and Initialization Approaches for Language Models,"Nandini Mundra, Aditya Nanda Kishore, Raj Dabre, Ratish Puduppully, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Mitesh M. Khapra","Language Models (LMs) excel in natural language processing tasks for English but show reduced performance in most other languages. This problem is commonly tackled by continually pre-training and fine-tuning these models for said languages. A significant issue in this process is the limited vocabulary coverage in the original model's tokenizer, leading to inadequate representation of new languages and necessitating an expansion of the tokenizer. The initialization of the embeddings corresponding to new vocabulary items presents a further challenge. Current strategies require cross-lingual embeddings and lack a solid theoretical foundation as well as comparisons with strong baselines. In this paper, we first establish theoretically that initializing within the convex hull of existing embeddings is a good initialization, followed by a novel but simple approach, Constrained Word2Vec (CW2V), which does not require cross-lingual embeddings. Our study evaluates different initialization methods for expanding RoBERTa and LLaMA 2 across four languages and five tasks. The results show that CW2V performs equally well or even better than more advanced techniques. Additionally, simpler approaches like multivariate initialization perform on par with these advanced methods indicating that efficient large-scale multilingual continued pretraining can be achieved even with simpler initialization methods. We release our code publicly (https://github.com/AI4Bharat/VocabAdaptation_LLM/tree/CW2V).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05841v2,2024-07
Limits to Predicting Online Speech Using Large Language Models,"Mina Remeli, Moritz Hardt, Robert C. Williamson","We study the predictability of online speech on social media, and whether predictability improves with information outside a user's own posts. Recent theoretical results suggest that posts from a user's social circle are as predictive of the user's future posts as that of the user's past posts. Motivated by the success of large language models, we empirically test this hypothesis. We define predictability as a measure of the model's uncertainty, i.e., its negative log-likelihood on future tokens given context. As the basis of our study, we collect 10M tweets for ``tweet-tuning'' base models and a further 6.25M posts from more than five thousand X (previously Twitter) users and their peers. Across four large language models ranging in size from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters, we find that predicting a user's posts from their peers' posts performs poorly. Moreover, the value of the user's own posts for prediction is consistently higher than that of their peers'. We extend our investigation with a detailed analysis on what's learned in-context and the robustness of our findings. From context, base models learn to correctly predict @-mentions and hashtags. Moreover, our results replicate if instead of prompting the model with additional context, we finetune on it. Across the board, we find that predicting the posts of individual users remains hard.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12850v2,2024-07
Large Language Models for Judicial Entity Extraction: A Comparative Study,"Atin Sakkeer Hussain, Anu Thomas","Domain-specific Entity Recognition holds significant importance in legal contexts, serving as a fundamental task that supports various applications such as question-answering systems, text summarization, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and information retrieval specifically within case law documents. Recent advancements have highlighted the efficacy of Large Language Models in natural language processing tasks, demonstrating their capability to accurately detect and classify domain-specific facts (entities) from specialized texts like clinical and financial documents. This research investigates the application of Large Language Models in identifying domain-specific entities (e.g., courts, petitioner, judge, lawyer, respondents, FIR nos.) within case law documents, with a specific focus on their aptitude for handling domain-specific language complexity and contextual variations. The study evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art Large Language Model architectures, including Large Language Model Meta AI 3, Mistral, and Gemma, in the context of extracting judicial facts tailored to Indian judicial texts. Mistral and Gemma emerged as the top-performing models, showcasing balanced precision and recall crucial for accurate entity identification. These findings confirm the value of Large Language Models in judicial documents and demonstrate how they can facilitate and quicken scientific research by producing precise, organised data outputs that are appropriate for in-depth examination.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05786v1,2024-07
When is the consistent prediction likely to be a correct prediction?,"Alex Nguyen, Dheeraj Mekala, Chengyu Dong, Jingbo Shang","Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) suggests that the most consistent answer obtained through large language models (LLMs) is more likely to be correct. In this paper, we challenge this argument and propose a nuanced correction. Our observations indicate that consistent answers derived through more computation i.e. longer reasoning texts, rather than simply the most consistent answer across all outputs, are more likely to be correct. This is predominantly because we demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously produce chain-of-thought (CoT) style reasoning with no custom prompts merely while generating longer responses, which lead to consistent predictions that are more accurate. In the zero-shot setting, by sampling Mixtral-8x7B model multiple times and considering longer responses, we achieve 86% of its self-consistency performance obtained through zero-shot CoT prompting on the GSM8K and MultiArith datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that the probability of LLMs generating a longer response is quite low, highlighting the need for decoding strategies conditioned on output length.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05778v1,2024-07
Large Language Models Understand Layout,"Weiming Li, Manni Duan, Dong An, Yan Shao","Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate extraordinary abilities in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we show that, beyond text understanding capability, LLMs are capable of processing text layouts that are denoted by spatial markers. They are able to answer questions that require explicit spatial perceiving and reasoning, while a drastic performance drop is observed when the spatial markers from the original data are excluded. We perform a series of experiments with the GPT-3.5, Baichuan2, Llama2 and ChatGLM3 models on various types of layout-sensitive datasets for further analysis. The experimental results reveal that the layout understanding ability of LLMs is mainly introduced by the coding data for pretraining, which is further enhanced at the instruction-tuning stage. In addition, layout understanding can be enhanced by integrating low-cost, auto-generated data approached by a novel text game. Finally, we show that layout understanding ability is beneficial for building efficient visual question-answering (VQA) systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05750v3,2024-07
Analyzing Speech Unit Selection for Textless Speech-to-Speech Translation,"Jarod Duret, Yannick Estève, Titouan Parcollet","Recent advancements in textless speech-to-speech translation systems have been driven by the adoption of self-supervised learning techniques. Although most state-of-the-art systems adopt a similar architecture to transform source language speech into sequences of discrete representations in the target language, the criteria for selecting these target speech units remains an open question. This work explores the selection process through a study of downstream tasks such as automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speaker recognition, and emotion recognition. Interestingly, our findings reveal a discrepancy in the optimization of discrete speech units: units that perform well in resynthesis performance do not necessarily correlate with those that enhance translation efficacy. This discrepancy underscores the nuanced complexity of target feature selection and its impact on the overall performance of speech-to-speech translation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18332v1,2024-07
Do Multilingual Large Language Models Mitigate Stereotype Bias?,"Shangrui Nie, Michael Fromm, Charles Welch, Rebekka Görge, Akbar Karimi, Joan Plepi, Nazia Afsan Mowmita, Nicolas Flores-Herr, Mehdi Ali, Lucie Flek","While preliminary findings indicate that multilingual LLMs exhibit reduced bias compared to monolingual ones, a comprehensive understanding of the effect of multilingual training on bias mitigation, is lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically training six LLMs of identical size (2.6B parameters) and architecture: five monolingual models (English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish) and one multilingual model trained on an equal distribution of data across these languages, all using publicly available data. To ensure robust evaluation, standard bias benchmarks were automatically translated into the five target languages and verified for both translation quality and bias preservation by human annotators. Our results consistently demonstrate that multilingual training effectively mitigates bias. Moreover, we observe that multilingual models achieve not only lower bias but also superior prediction accuracy when compared to monolingual models with the same amount of training data, model architecture, and size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05740v2,2024-07
Empirical Study of Symmetrical Reasoning in Conversational Chatbots,"Daniela N. Rim, Heeyoul Choi","This work explores the capability of conversational chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs), to understand and characterize predicate symmetry, a cognitive linguistic function traditionally believed to be an inherent human trait. Leveraging in-context learning (ICL), a paradigm shift enabling chatbots to learn new tasks from prompts without re-training, we assess the symmetrical reasoning of five chatbots: ChatGPT 4, Huggingface chat AI, Microsoft's Copilot AI, LLaMA through Perplexity, and Gemini Advanced. Using the Symmetry Inference Sentence (SIS) dataset by Tanchip et al. (2020), we compare chatbot responses against human evaluations to gauge their understanding of predicate symmetry. Experiment results reveal varied performance among chatbots, with some approaching human-like reasoning capabilities. Gemini, for example, reaches a correlation of 0.85 with human scores, while providing a sounding justification for each symmetry evaluation. This study underscores the potential and limitations of LLMs in mirroring complex cognitive processes as symmetrical reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05734v1,2024-07
Is GPT-4 Alone Sufficient for Automated Essay Scoring?: A Comparative Judgment Approach Based on Rater Cognition,"Seungju Kim, Meounggun Jo","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in Automated Essay Scoring (AES), but their zero-shot and few-shot performance often falls short compared to state-of-the-art models and human raters. However, fine-tuning LLMs for each specific task is impractical due to the variety of essay prompts and rubrics used in real-world educational contexts. This study proposes a novel approach combining LLMs and Comparative Judgment (CJ) for AES, using zero-shot prompting to choose between two essays. We demonstrate that a CJ method surpasses traditional rubric-based scoring in essay scoring using LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05733v1,2024-07
PsycoLLM: Enhancing LLM for Psychological Understanding and Evaluation,"Jinpeng Hu, Tengteng Dong, Luo Gang, Hui Ma, Peng Zou, Xiao Sun, Dan Guo, Xun Yang, Meng Wang","Mental health has attracted substantial attention in recent years and LLM can be an effective technology for alleviating this problem owing to its capability in text understanding and dialogue. However, existing research in this domain often suffers from limitations, such as training on datasets lacking crucial prior knowledge and evidence, and the absence of comprehensive evaluation methods. In this paper, we propose a specialized psychological large language model (LLM), named PsycoLLM, trained on a proposed high-quality psychological dataset, including single-turn QA, multi-turn dialogues and knowledge-based QA. Specifically, we construct multi-turn dialogues through a three-step pipeline comprising multi-turn QA generation, evidence judgment, and dialogue refinement. We augment this process with real-world psychological case backgrounds extracted from online platforms, enhancing the relevance and applicability of the generated data. Additionally, to compare the performance of PsycoLLM with other LLMs, we develop a comprehensive psychological benchmark based on authoritative psychological counseling examinations in China, which includes assessments of professional ethics, theoretical proficiency, and case analysis. The experimental results on the benchmark illustrate the effectiveness of PsycoLLM, which demonstrates superior performance compared to other LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05721v3,2024-07
A Factuality and Diversity Reconciled Decoding Method for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Generation,"Chenxu Yang, Zheng Lin, Chong Tian, Liang Pang, Lanrui Wang, Zhengyang Tong, Qirong Ho, Yanan Cao, Weiping Wang","Grounding external knowledge can enhance the factuality of responses in dialogue generation. However, excessive emphasis on it might result in the lack of engaging and diverse expressions. Through the introduction of randomness in sampling, current approaches can increase the diversity. Nevertheless, such sampling method could undermine the factuality in dialogue generation. In this study, to discover a solution for advancing creativity without relying on questionable randomness and to subtly reconcile the factuality and diversity within the source-grounded paradigm, a novel method named DoGe is proposed. DoGe can dynamically alternate between the utilization of internal parameter knowledge and external source knowledge based on the model's factual confidence. Extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets show that DoGe can not only enhance response diversity but also maintain factuality, and it significantly surpasses other various decoding strategy baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05718v1,2024-07
InverseCoder: Self-improving Instruction-Tuned Code LLMs with Inverse-Instruct,"Yutong Wu, Di Huang, Wenxuan Shi, Wei Wang, Lingzhe Gao, Shihao Liu, Ziyuan Nan, Kaizhao Yuan, Rui Zhang, Xishan Zhang, Zidong Du, Qi Guo, Yewen Pu, Dawei Yin, Xing Hu, Yunji Chen","Recent advancements in open-source code large language models (LLMs) have been driven by fine-tuning on the data generated from powerful closed-source LLMs, which are expensive to obtain. This paper explores whether it is possible to use a fine-tuned open-source model to generate additional data to augment its instruction-tuning dataset. We make two observations: (1) A code snippet can serve as the response to different instructions. (2) Instruction-tuned code LLMs perform better at translating code into instructions than the reverse. Based on these observations, we propose Inverse-Instruct, a data augmentation technique that uses a fine-tuned LLM to generate additional instructions of code responses from its own training dataset. The additional instruction-response pairs are added to the original dataset, and a stronger code LLM can be obtained by fine-tuning on the augmented dataset. We empirically validate Inverse-Instruct on a range of open-source code models (e.g. CodeLlama-Python and DeepSeek-Coder) and benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), DS-1000 and MultiPL-E), showing it consistently improves the base models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05700v2,2024-07
On the Limitations of Compute Thresholds as a Governance Strategy,Sara Hooker,"At face value, this essay is about understanding a fairly esoteric governance tool called compute thresholds. However, in order to grapple with whether these thresholds will achieve anything, we must first understand how they came to be. To do so, we need to engage with a decades-old debate at the heart of computer science progress, namely, is bigger always better? Does a certain inflection point of compute result in changes to the risk profile of a model? Hence, this essay may be of interest not only to policymakers and the wider public but also to computer scientists interested in understanding the role of compute in unlocking breakthroughs. This discussion is timely given the wide adoption of compute thresholds in both the White House Executive Orders on AI Safety (EO) and the EU AI Act to identify more risky systems. A key conclusion of this essay is that compute thresholds, as currently implemented, are shortsighted and likely to fail to mitigate risk. The relationship between compute and risk is highly uncertain and rapidly changing. Relying upon compute thresholds overestimates our ability to predict what abilities emerge at different scales. This essay ends with recommendations for a better way forward.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05694v2,2024-07
Sub-SA: Strengthen In-context Learning via Submodular Selective Annotation,"Jian Qian, Miao Sun, Sifan Zhou, Ziyu Zhao, Ruizhi Hun, Patrick Chiang","In-context learning (ICL) leverages in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs). These prompts play a crucial role in achieving strong performance. However, the selection of suitable prompts from a large pool of labeled examples often entails significant annotation costs. To address this challenge, we propose Sub-SA (Submodular Selective Annotation), a submodule-based selective annotation method. The aim of Sub-SA is to reduce annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples and minimizing the time consumption of the selection process. In Sub-SA, we design a submodular function that facilitates effective subset selection for annotation and demonstrates the characteristics of monotonically and submodularity from the theoretical perspective. Specifically, we propose RPR (Reward and Penalty Regularization) to better balance the diversity and representativeness of the unlabeled dataset attributed to a reward term and a penalty term, respectively. Consequently, the selection for annotations can be effectively addressed with a simple yet effective greedy search algorithm based on the submodular function. Finally, we apply the similarity prompt retrieval to get the examples for ICL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05693v2,2024-07
Pruning Large Language Models to Intra-module Low-rank Architecture with Transitional Activations,"Bowen Shen, Zheng Lin, Daren Zha, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Weiping Wang","Structured pruning fundamentally reduces computational and memory overheads of large language models (LLMs) and offers a feasible solution for end-side LLM deployment. Structurally pruned models remain dense and high-precision, highly compatible with further tuning and compression. However, as the coarse-grained structured pruning poses large damage to the highly interconnected model, achieving a high compression ratio for scaled-up LLMs remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic structured pruning approach coupled with a compact Transformer architecture design. The proposed approach, named TransAct, reduces transitional activations inside multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, while preserving the inter-module activations that are sensitive to perturbations. Hence, the LLM is pruned into an intra-module low-rank architecture, significantly reducing weights, KV Cache and attention computation. TransAct is implemented on the LLaMA model and evaluated on downstream benchmarks. Results verify the optimality of our approach at high compression with respect to both efficiency and performance. Further, ablation studies reveal the strength of activation-guided iterative pruning and provide experimental analysis on the redundancy of MHA and MLP modules.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05690v1,2024-07
Retrieved In-Context Principles from Previous Mistakes,"Hao Sun, Yong Jiang, Bo Wang, Yingyan Hou, Yan Zhang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang","In-context learning (ICL) has been instrumental in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks using correct input-output examples. Recent advances have attempted to improve model performance through principles derived from mistakes, yet these approaches suffer from lack of customization and inadequate error coverage. To address these limitations, we propose Retrieved In-Context Principles (RICP), a novel teacher-student framework. In RICP, the teacher model analyzes mistakes from the student model to generate reasons and insights for preventing similar mistakes. These mistakes are clustered based on their underlying reasons for developing task-level principles, enhancing the error coverage of principles. During inference, the most relevant mistakes for each question are retrieved to create question-level principles, improving the customization of the provided guidance. RICP is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and does not require intervention from the teacher model during inference. Experimental results across seven reasoning benchmarks reveal that RICP effectively enhances performance when applied to various prompting strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05682v1,2024-07
Coding Reliable LLM-based Integrated Task and Knowledge Agents with GenieWorksheets,"Harshit Joshi, Shicheng Liu, James Chen, Robert Weigle, Monica S. Lam","Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity to create automated assistants that can help users navigate complex tasks. However, existing approaches have limitations in handling conditional logic, integrating knowledge sources, and consistently following instructions. Researchers and industry professionals often employ ad hoc pipelines to construct conversational agents. These pipelines aim to maintain context, address failure cases, and minimize hallucinations, yet frequently fail to achieve these objectives. To this end, we present Genie - a programmable framework for creating task-oriented conversational agents that are designed to handle complex user interactions and knowledge queries. Unlike LLMs, Genie provides reliable grounded responses, with controllable agent policies through its expressive specification, Genie Worksheet. In contrast to dialog trees, it is resilient to diverse user queries, helpful with knowledge sources, and offers ease of programming policies through its declarative paradigm. The agents built using Genie outperforms the state-of-the-art method on complex logic domains in STARV2 dataset by up to 20.5%. Additionally, through a real-user study involving 62 participants, we show that Genie beats the GPT-4 with function calling baseline by 21.1%, 20.1%, and 61% on execution accuracy, dialogue act accuracy, and goal completion rate, respectively, on three diverse real-world domains",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05674v2,2024-07
BoRA: Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption for Multi-Task Large Language Models,"Simen Eide, Arnoldo Frigessi","This paper introduces Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption (BoRA), a novel method for finetuning multi-task Large Language Models (LLMs). Current finetuning approaches, such as Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), perform exeptionally well in reducing training parameters and memory usage but face limitations when applied to multiple similar tasks. Practitioners usually have to choose between training separate models for each task or a single model for all tasks, both of which come with trade-offs in specialization and data utilization. BoRA addresses these trade-offs by leveraging a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows tasks to share information through global hierarchical priors. This enables tasks with limited data to benefit from the overall structure derived from related tasks while allowing tasks with more data to specialize. Our experimental results show that BoRA outperforms both individual and unified model approaches, achieving lower perplexity and better generalization across tasks. This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-task LLM finetuning, with significant practical implications for diverse applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15857v2,2024-07
Multi-label Learning with Random Circular Vectors,"Ken Nishida, Kojiro Machi, Kazuma Onishi, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Hidetaka Kamigaito","The extreme multi-label classification~(XMC) task involves learning a classifier that can predict from a large label set the most relevant subset of labels for a data instance. While deep neural networks~(DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in XMC problems, the task is still challenging because it must deal with a large number of output labels, which make the DNN training computationally expensive. This paper addresses the issue by exploring the use of random circular vectors, where each vector component is represented as a complex amplitude. In our framework, we can develop an output layer and loss function of DNNs for XMC by representing the final output layer as a fully connected layer that directly predicts a low-dimensional circular vector encoding a set of labels for a data instance. We conducted experiments on synthetic datasets to verify that circular vectors have better label encoding capacity and retrieval ability than normal real-valued vectors. Then, we conducted experiments on actual XMC datasets and found that these appealing properties of circular vectors contribute to significant improvements in task performance compared with a previous model using random real-valued vectors, while reducing the size of the output layers by up to 99%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05656v1,2024-07
New Directions in Text Classification Research: Maximizing The Performance of Sentiment Classification from Limited Data,"Surya Agustian, Muhammad Irfan Syah, Nurul Fatiara, Rahmad Abdillah","The stakeholders' needs in sentiment analysis for various issues, whether positive or negative, are speed and accuracy. One new challenge in sentiment analysis tasks is the limited training data, which often leads to suboptimal machine learning models and poor performance on test data. This paper discusses the problem of text classification based on limited training data (300 to 600 samples) into three classes: positive, negative, and neutral. A benchmark dataset is provided for training and testing data on the issue of Kaesang Pangarep's appointment as Chairman of PSI. External data for aggregation and augmentation purposes are provided, consisting of two datasets: the topic of Covid Vaccination sentiment and an open topic. The official score used is the F1-score, which balances precision and recall among the three classes, positive, negative, and neutral. A baseline score is provided as a reference for researchers for unoptimized classification methods. The optimized score is provided as a reference for the target score to be achieved by any proposed method. Both scoring (baseline and optimized) use the SVM method, which is widely reported as the state-of-the-art in conventional machine learning methods. The F1-scores achieved by the baseline and optimized methods are 40.83% and 51.28%, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05627v1,2024-07
Open-world Multi-label Text Classification with Extremely Weak Supervision,"Xintong Li, Jinya Jiang, Ria Dharmani, Jayanth Srinivasa, Gaowen Liu, Jingbo Shang","We study open-world multi-label text classification under extremely weak supervision (XWS), where the user only provides a brief description for classification objectives without any labels or ground-truth label space. Similar single-label XWS settings have been explored recently, however, these methods cannot be easily adapted for multi-label. We observe that (1) most documents have a dominant class covering the majority of content and (2) long-tail labels would appear in some documents as a dominant class. Therefore, we first utilize the user description to prompt a large language model (LLM) for dominant keyphrases of a subset of raw documents, and then construct a (initial) label space via clustering. We further apply a zero-shot multi-label classifier to locate the documents with small top predicted scores, so we can revisit their dominant keyphrases for more long-tail labels. We iterate this process to discover a comprehensive label space and construct a multi-label classifier as a novel method, X-MLClass. X-MLClass exhibits a remarkable increase in ground-truth label space coverage on various datasets, for example, a 40% improvement on the AAPD dataset over topic modeling and keyword extraction methods. Moreover, X-MLClass achieves the best end-to-end multi-label classification accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05609v1,2024-07
A Benchmark for Multi-speaker Anonymization,"Xiaoxiao Miao, Ruijie Tao, Chang Zeng, Xin Wang","Privacy-preserving voice protection approaches primarily suppress privacy-related information derived from paralinguistic attributes while preserving the linguistic content. Existing solutions focus on single-speaker scenarios. However, they lack practicality for real-world applications, i.e., multi-speaker scenarios. In this paper, we present an initial attempt to provide a multi-speaker anonymization benchmark by defining the task and evaluation protocol, proposing benchmarking solutions, and discussing the privacy leakage of overlapping conversations. Specifically, ideal multi-speaker anonymization should preserve the number of speakers and the turn-taking structure of the conversation, ensuring accurate context conveyance while maintaining privacy. To achieve that, a cascaded system uses speaker diarization to aggregate the speech of each speaker and speaker anonymization to conceal speaker privacy and preserve speech content. Additionally, we propose two conversation-level speaker vector anonymization methods to improve the utility further. Both methods aim to make the original and corresponding pseudo-speaker identities of each speaker unlinkable while preserving or even improving the distinguishability among pseudo-speakers in a conversation. The first method minimizes the differential similarity across speaker pairs in the original and anonymized conversations to maintain original speaker relationships in the anonymized version. The other method minimizes the aggregated similarity across anonymized speakers to achieve better differentiation between speakers. Experiments conducted on both non-overlap simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-speaker anonymization system with the proposed speaker anonymizers. Additionally, we analyzed overlapping speech regarding privacy leakage and provide potential solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05608v1,2024-07
Generative Debunking of Climate Misinformation,"Francisco Zanartu, Yulia Otmakhova, John Cook, Lea Frermann","Misinformation about climate change causes numerous negative impacts, necessitating corrective responses. Psychological research has offered various strategies for reducing the influence of climate misinformation, such as the fact-myth-fallacy-fact-structure. However, practically implementing corrective interventions at scale represents a challenge. Automatic detection and correction of misinformation offers a solution to the misinformation problem. This study documents the development of large language models that accept as input a climate myth and produce a debunking that adheres to the fact-myth-fallacy-fact (``truth sandwich'') structure, by incorporating contrarian claim classification and fallacy detection into an LLM prompting framework. We combine open (Mixtral, Palm2) and proprietary (GPT-4) LLMs with prompting strategies of varying complexity. Experiments reveal promising performance of GPT-4 and Mixtral if combined with structured prompts. We identify specific challenges of debunking generation and human evaluation, and map out avenues for future work. We release a dataset of high-quality truth-sandwich debunkings, source code and a demo of the debunking system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05599v1,2024-07
On the Power of Convolution Augmented Transformer,"Mingchen Li, Xuechen Zhang, Yixiao Huang, Samet Oymak","The transformer architecture has catalyzed revolutionary advances in language modeling. However, recent architectural recipes, such as state-space models, have bridged the performance gap. Motivated by this, we examine the benefits of Convolution-Augmented Transformer (CAT) for recall, copying, and length generalization tasks. CAT incorporates convolutional filters in the K/Q/V embeddings of an attention layer. Through CAT, we show that the locality of the convolution synergizes with the global view of the attention. Unlike comparable architectures, such as Mamba or transformer, CAT can provably solve the associative recall (AR) and copying tasks using a single layer while also enjoying guaranteed length generalization. We also establish computational tradeoffs between convolution and attention by characterizing how convolution can mitigate the need for full attention by summarizing the context window and creating salient summary tokens to attend. Evaluations on real datasets corroborate our findings and demonstrate that CAT and its variations indeed enhance the language modeling performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05591v1,2024-07

Faux Polyglot: A Study on Information Disparity in Multilingual Large Language Models,"Nikhil Sharma, Kenton Murray, Ziang Xiao","With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in information search and are being adopted globally. Although the multilingual capability of LLMs offers new opportunities to bridge the language barrier, do these capabilities translate into real-life scenarios where linguistic divide and knowledge conflicts between multilingual sources are known occurrences? In this paper, we studied LLM's linguistic preference in a RAG-based information search setting. We found that LLMs displayed systemic bias towards information in the same language as the query language in both information retrieval and answer generation. Furthermore, in scenarios where there is little information in the language of the query, LLMs prefer documents in high-resource languages, reinforcing the dominant views. Such bias exists for both factual and opinion-based queries. Our results highlight the linguistic divide within multilingual LLMs in information search systems. The seemingly beneficial multilingual capability of LLMs may backfire on information parity by reinforcing language-specific information cocoons or filter bubbles further marginalizing low-resource views.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05502v2,2024-07
How Effective are State Space Models for Machine Translation?,"Hugo Pitorro, Pavlo Vasylenko, Marcos Treviso, André F. T. Martins","Transformers are the current architecture of choice for NLP, but their attention layers do not scale well to long contexts. Recent works propose to replace attention with linear recurrent layers -- this is the case for state space models, which enjoy efficient training and inference. However, it remains unclear whether these models are competitive with transformers in machine translation (MT). In this paper, we provide a rigorous and comprehensive experimental comparison between transformers and linear recurrent models for MT. Concretely, we experiment with RetNet, Mamba, and hybrid versions of Mamba which incorporate attention mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that Mamba is highly competitive with transformers on sentence and paragraph-level datasets, where in the latter both models benefit from shifting the training distribution towards longer sequences. Further analysis show that integrating attention into Mamba improves translation quality, robustness to sequence length extrapolation, and the ability to recall named entities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05489v1,2024-07
Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models,"Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher Ré","Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05483v1,2024-07

Enhancing Hallucination Detection through Perturbation-Based Synthetic Data Generation in System Responses,"Dongxu Zhang, Varun Gangal, Barrett Martin Lattimer, Yi Yang","Detecting hallucinations in large language model (LLM) outputs is pivotal, yet traditional fine-tuning for this classification task is impeded by the expensive and quickly outdated annotation process, especially across numerous vertical domains and in the face of rapid LLM advancements. In this study, we introduce an approach that automatically generates both faithful and hallucinated outputs by rewriting system responses.

"Experiments with truth using Machine Learning: Spectral analysis and explainable classification of synthetic, false, and genuine information","Vishnu S. Pendyala, Madhulika Dutta","Misinformation is still a major societal problem and the arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) only added to it. This paper analyzes synthetic, false, and genuine information in the form of text from spectral analysis, visualization, and explainability perspectives to find the answer to why the problem is still unsolved despite multiple years of research and a plethora of solutions in the literature. Various embedding techniques on multiple datasets are used to represent information for the purpose. The diverse spectral and non-spectral methods used on these embeddings include t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Classification is done using multiple machine learning algorithms. Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and Integrated Gradients are used for the explanation of the classification. The analysis and the explanations generated show that misinformation is quite closely intertwined with genuine information and the machine learning algorithms are not as effective in separating the two despite the claims in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05464v1,2024-07
Training Task Experts through Retrieval Based Distillation,"Jiaxin Ge, Xueying Jia, Vijay Viswanathan, Hongyin Luo, Graham Neubig","One of the most reliable ways to create deployable models for specialized tasks is to obtain an adequate amount of high-quality task-specific data. However, for specialized tasks, often such datasets do not exist. Existing methods address this by creating such data from large language models (LLMs) and then distilling such knowledge into smaller models. However, these methods are limited by the quality of the LLMs output, and tend to generate repetitive or incorrect data. In this work, we present Retrieval Based Distillation (ReBase), a method that first retrieves data from rich online sources and then transforms them into domain-specific data. This method greatly enhances data diversity. Moreover, ReBase generates Chain-of-Thought reasoning and distills the reasoning capacity of LLMs. We test our method on 4 benchmarks and results show that our method significantly improves performance by up to 7.8% on SQuAD, 1.37% on MNLI, and 1.94% on BigBench-Hard.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05463v1,2024-07

LTLBench: Towards Benchmarks for Evaluating Temporal Logic Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Weizhi Tang, Vaishak Belle","Temporal reasoning (TR) is a critical component of artificial intelligence, encompassing understanding and processing temporal information and relationships between events. To discover and study the TR ability in Large Language Models (LLMs), various datasets have been constructed in different ways for evaluating various aspects of TR ability. Our work proposes a novel approach to design and develop a pipeline for constructing datasets to evaluate the TR ability of LLMs by leveraging random directed graph generation, LTL formula, and the NuSMV model checker. Based on the pipeline, we have also constructed a dataset as a benchmark, namely LTLBench, consisting of 2,000 TR challenges and evaluated six LLMs with it. Furthermore, we have conducted additional experiments to discover the impact of increasing the number of events and formula operators on the complexity of TR problems and the performance of LLMs. We have demonstrated that although LLMs exhibit some promise in handling TR challenges, they still struggle with complex TR. We expect this work can offer insights into TR ability in LLMs while also providing a valuable tool for future TR evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05434v1,2024-07
SBoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation with Regional Weight Updates,"Lai-Man Po, Yuyang Liu, Haoxuan Wu, Tianqi Zhang, Wing-Yin Yu, Zhuohan Wang, Zeyu Jiang, Kun Li","This paper introduces Standard Basis LoRA (SBoRA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for Large Language Models that builds upon the pioneering works of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Orthogonal Adaptation. SBoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by half or doubles the rank with the similar number of trainable parameters as LoRA, while improving learning performance. By utilizing orthogonal standard basis vectors to initialize one of the low-rank matrices (either $\mathbf{A}$ or $\mathbf{B}$), SBoRA facilitates regional weight updates and memory-efficient fine-tuning. This results in two variants, SBoRA-FA and SBoRA-FB, where only one of the matrices is updated, leading to a sparse update matrix $\mathrm{\Delta} \mathbf{W}$ with predominantly zero rows or columns. Consequently, most of the fine-tuned model's weights $(\mathbf{W}_0+\mathrm{\Delta} \mathbf{W})$ remain unchanged from the pre-trained weights, akin to the modular organization of the human brain, which efficiently adapts to new tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of SBoRA-FA over LoRA in various fine-tuning tasks, including commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of QSBoRA on quantized LLaMA models of varying scales, highlighting its potential for efficient adaptation to new tasks.

Multimodal Prompt Learning with Missing Modalities for Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Recognition,"Zirun Guo, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao","The development of multimodal models has significantly advanced multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition. However, in real-world applications, the presence of various missing modality cases often leads to a degradation in the model's performance. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal Transformer framework using prompt learning to address the issue of missing modalities. Our method introduces three types of prompts: generative prompts, missing-signal prompts, and missing-type prompts. These prompts enable the generation of missing modality features and facilitate the learning of intra- and inter-modality information. Through prompt learning, we achieve a substantial reduction in the number of trainable parameters. Our proposed method outperforms other methods significantly across all evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, showcasing its ability to effectively handle missing modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05374v1,2024-07

VideoCoT: A Video Chain-of-Thought Dataset with Active Annotation Tool,"Yan Wang, Yawen Zeng, Jingsheng Zheng, Xiaofen Xing, Jin Xu, Xiangmin Xu","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are flourishing, but mainly focus on images with less attention than videos, especially in sub-fields such as prompt engineering, video chain-of-thought (CoT), and instruction tuning on videos. Therefore, we try to explore the collection of CoT datasets in videos to lead to video OpenQA and improve the reasoning ability of MLLMs. Unfortunately, making such video CoT datasets is not an easy task. Given that human annotation is too cumbersome and expensive, while machine-generated is not reliable due to the hallucination issue, we develop an automatic annotation tool that combines machine and human experts, under the active learning paradigm. Active learning is an interactive strategy between the model and human experts, in this way, the workload of human labeling can be reduced and the quality of the dataset can be guaranteed. With the help of the automatic annotation tool, we strive to contribute three datasets, namely VideoCoT, TopicQA, TopicCoT.

Can Model Uncertainty Function as a Proxy for Multiple-Choice Question Item Difficulty?,"Leonidas Zotos, Hedderik van Rijn, Malvina Nissim","Estimating the difficulty of multiple-choice questions would be great help for educators who must spend substantial time creating and piloting stimuli for their tests, and for learners who want to practice. Supervised approaches to difficulty estimation have yielded to date mixed results. In this contribution we leverage an aspect of generative large models which might be seen as a weakness when answering questions, namely their uncertainty, and exploit it towards exploring correlations between two different metrics of uncertainty, and the actual student response distribution. While we observe some present but weak correlations, we also discover that the models' behaviour is different in the case of correct vs wrong answers, and that correlations differ substantially according to the different question types which are included in our fine-grained, previously unused dataset of 451 questions from a Biopsychology course.

Vocal biomarkers are often secondary measures that are approximating a signal of another sensor or identifying an underlying mental, cognitive, or physiological state. Their measurement involve disturbances and uncertainties that may be considered as noise sources and the biomarkers are coarsely qualified in terms of the various sources of noise involved in their determination.

Beyond Binary Gender Labels: Revealing Gender Biases in LLMs through Gender-Neutral Name Predictions,"Zhiwen You, HaeJin Lee, Shubhanshu Mishra, Sullam Jeoung, Apratim Mishra, Jinseok Kim, Jana Diesner","Name-based gender prediction has traditionally categorized individuals as either female or male based on their names, using a binary classification system. That binary approach can be problematic in the cases of gender-neutral names that do not align with any one gender, among other reasons. Relying solely on binary gender categories without recognizing gender-neutral names can reduce the inclusiveness of gender prediction tasks. We introduce an additional gender category, i.e., ""neutral"", to study and address potential gender biases in Large Language Models (LLMs). We evaluate the performance of several foundational and large language models in predicting gender based on first names only. Additionally, we investigate the impact of adding birth years to enhance the accuracy of gender prediction, accounting for shifting associations between names and genders over time. Our findings indicate that most LLMs identify male and female names with high accuracy (over 80%) but struggle with gender-neutral names (under 40%), and the accuracy of gender prediction is higher for English-based first names than non-English names. The experimental results show that incorporating the birth year does not improve the overall accuracy of gender prediction, especially for names with evolving gender associations. We recommend using caution when applying LLMs for gender identification in downstream tasks, particularly when dealing with non-binary gender labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05271v1,2024-07
CLIMB: A Benchmark of Clinical Bias in Large Language Models,"Yubo Zhang, Shudi Hou, Mingyu Derek Ma, Wei Wang, Muhao Chen, Jieyu Zhao","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to clinical decision-making. However, their potential to exhibit bias poses significant risks to clinical equity. Currently, there is a lack of benchmarks that systematically evaluate such clinical bias in LLMs. While in downstream tasks, some biases of LLMs can be avoided such as by instructing the model to answer ""I'm not sure..."", the internal bias hidden within the model still lacks deep studies. We introduce CLIMB (shorthand for A Benchmark of Clinical Bias in Large Language Models), a pioneering comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both intrinsic (within LLMs) and extrinsic (on downstream tasks) bias in LLMs for clinical decision tasks. Notably, for intrinsic bias, we introduce a novel metric, AssocMAD, to assess the disparities of LLMs across multiple demographic groups. Additionally, we leverage counterfactual intervention to evaluate extrinsic bias in a task of clinical diagnosis prediction. Our experiments across popular and medically adapted LLMs, particularly from the Mistral and LLaMA families, unveil prevalent behaviors with both intrinsic and extrinsic bias. This work underscores the critical need to mitigate clinical bias and sets a new standard for future evaluations of LLMs' clinical bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05250v2,2024-07
"Some Issues in Predictive Ethics Modeling: An Annotated Contrast Set of ""Moral Stories""",Ben Fitzgerald,"Models like Delphi have been able to label ethical dilemmas as moral or immoral with astonishing accuracy. This paper challenges accuracy as a holistic metric for ethics modeling by identifying issues with translating moral dilemmas into text-based input. It demonstrates these issues with contrast sets that substantially reduce the performance of classifiers trained on the dataset Moral Stories. Ultimately, we obtain concrete estimates for how much specific forms of data misrepresentation harm classifier accuracy. Specifically, label-changing tweaks to the descriptive content of a situation (as small as 3-5 words) can reduce classifier accuracy to as low as 51%, almost half the initial accuracy of 99.8%. Associating situations with a misleading social norm lowers accuracy to 98.8%, while adding textual bias (i.e. an implication that a situation already fits a certain label) lowers accuracy to 77%.   These results suggest not only that many ethics models have substantially overfit, but that several precautions are required to ensure that input accurately captures a moral dilemma. This paper recommends re-examining the structure of a social norm, training models to ask for context with defeasible reasoning, and filtering input for textual bias. Doing so not only gives us the first concrete estimates of the average cost to accuracy of misrepresenting ethics data, but gives researchers practical tips for considering these estimates in research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05244v1,2024-07

Flood of Techniques and Drought of Theories: Emotion Mining in Disasters,"Soheil Shapouri, Saber Soleymani, Saed Rezayi","Emotion mining has become a crucial tool for understanding human emotions during disasters, leveraging the extensive data generated on social media platforms. This paper aims to summarize existing research on emotion mining within disaster contexts, highlighting both significant discoveries and persistent issues. On the one hand, emotion mining techniques have achieved acceptable accuracy enabling applications such as rapid damage assessment and mental health surveillance. On the other hand, with many studies adopting data-driven approaches, several methodological issues remain. These include arbitrary emotion classification, ignoring biases inherent in data collection from social media, such as the overrepresentation of individuals from higher socioeconomic status on Twitter, and the lack of application of theoretical frameworks like cross-cultural comparisons. These problems can be summarized as a notable lack of theory-driven research and ignoring insights from social and behavioral sciences. This paper underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and social scientists to develop more robust and theoretically grounded approaches in emotion mining.

This empirical report shares how we use GPT-4 as an automatic assignment evaluator in a university course with 1,028 students. Based on student responses, we find that LLM-based assignment evaluators are generally acceptable to students when students have free access to these LLM-based evaluators. However, students also noted that the LLM sometimes fails to adhere to the evaluation instructions. Additionally, we observe that students can easily manipulate the LLM-based evaluator to output specific strings, allowing them to achieve high scores without meeting the assignment rubric.

LLMCloudHunter: Harnessing LLMs for Automated Extraction of Detection Rules from Cloud-Based CTI,"Yuval Schwartz, Lavi Benshimol, Dudu Mimran, Yuval Elovici, Asaf Shabtai","As the number and sophistication of cyber attacks have increased, threat hunting has become a critical aspect of active security, enabling proactive detection and mitigation of threats before they cause significant harm. Open-source cyber threat intelligence (OS-CTI) is a valuable resource for threat hunters, however, it often comes in unstructured formats that require further manual analysis. Previous studies aimed at automating OSCTI analysis are limited since (1) they failed to provide actionable outputs, (2) they did not take advantage of images present in OSCTI sources, and (3) they focused on on-premises environments, overlooking the growing importance of cloud environments. To address these gaps, we propose LLMCloudHunter, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate generic-signature detection rule candidates from textual and visual OSCTI data. We evaluated the quality of the rules generated by the proposed framework using 12 annotated real-world cloud threat reports. The results show that our framework achieved a precision of 92% and recall of 98% for the task of accurately extracting API calls made by the threat actor and a precision of 99% with a recall of 98% for IoCs.

By presenting the first comprehensive case study for the English-Azerbaijani (Arabic Script) language pair, this work underscores the transformative potential of NMT in low-resource contexts. The development and utilization of this corpus not only facilitate the advancement of machine translation systems tailored for specific linguistic needs but also promote inclusive language learning through technology. The findings demonstrate the corpus's effectiveness in training deep learning MT systems and underscore its role as an essential asset for researchers and educators aiming to foster bilingual education and multilingual communication. This research covers the way for future explorations into NMT applications for languages lacking substantial digital resources, thereby enhancing global language education frameworks.

Identifying Intensity of the Structure and Content in Tweets and the Discriminative Power of Attributes in Context with Referential Translation Machines,Ergun Biçici,"We use referential translation machines (RTMs) to identify the similarity between an attribute and two words in English by casting the task as machine translation performance prediction (MTPP) between the words and the attribute word and the distance between their similarities for Task 10 with stacked RTM models. RTMs are also used to predict the intensity of the structure and content in tweets in English, Arabic, and Spanish in Task 1 where MTPP is between the tweets and the set of words for the emotion selected from WordNet affect emotion lists. Stacked RTM models obtain encouraging results in both.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05154v1,2024-07
Solving for X and Beyond: Can Large Language Models Solve Complex Math Problems with More-Than-Two Unknowns?,"Kuei-Chun Kao, Ruochen Wang, Cho-Jui Hsieh","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving math problems, a hallmark of human intelligence. Despite high success rates on current benchmarks; however, these often feature simple problems with only one or two unknowns, which do not sufficiently challenge their reasoning capacities. This paper introduces a novel benchmark, BeyondX, designed to address these limitations by incorporating problems with multiple unknowns. Recognizing the challenges in proposing multi-unknown problems from scratch, we developed BeyondX using an innovative automated pipeline that progressively increases complexity by expanding the number of unknowns in simpler problems. Empirical study on BeyondX reveals that the performance of existing LLMs, even those fine-tuned specifically on math tasks, significantly decreases as the number of unknowns increases - with a performance drop of up to 70\% observed in GPT-4. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Formulate-and-Solve strategy, a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of unknowns. Our findings reveal that this strategy not only enhances LLM performance on the BeyondX benchmark but also provides deeper insights into the computational limits of LLMs when faced with more complex mathematical challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05134v1,2024-07
RULE: Reliable Multimodal RAG for Factuality in Medical Vision Language Models,"Peng Xia, Kangyu Zhu, Haoran Li, Hongtu Zhu, Yun Li, Gang Li, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao","The recent emergence of Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has enhanced medical diagnosis. However, current Med-LVLMs frequently encounter factual issues, often generating responses that do not align with established medical facts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which utilizes external knowledge, can improve the factual accuracy of these models but introduces two major challenges. First, limited retrieved contexts might not cover all necessary information, while excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant and inaccurate references, interfering with the model's generation. Second, in cases where the model originally responds correctly, applying RAG can lead to an over-reliance on retrieved contexts, resulting in incorrect answers. To address these issues, we propose RULE, which consists of two components. First, we introduce a provably effective strategy for controlling factuality risk through the calibrated selection of the number of retrieved contexts. Second, based on samples where over-reliance on retrieved contexts led to errors, we curate a preference dataset to fine-tune the model, balancing its dependence on inherent knowledge and retrieved contexts for generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RULE on medical VQA and report generation tasks across three datasets, achieving an average improvement of 47.4% in factual accuracy. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/RULE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05131v2,2024-07
Automatic Prediction of the Performance of Every Parser,Ergun Biçici,"We present a new parser performance prediction (PPP) model using machine translation performance prediction system (MTPPS), statistically independent of any language or parser, relying only on extrinsic and novel features based on textual, link structural, and bracketing tree structural information. This new system, MTPPS-PPP, can predict the performance of any parser in any language and can be useful for estimating the grammatical difficulty when understanding a given text, for setting expectations from parsing output, for parser selection for a specific domain, and for parser combination systems. We obtain SoA results in PPP of bracketing $F_1$ with better results over textual features and similar performance with previous results that use parser and linguistic label specific information. Our results show the contribution of different types of features as well as rankings of individual features in different experimental settings (cased vs. uncased), in different learning tasks (in-domain vs. out-of-domain), with different training sets, with different learning algorithms, and with different dimensionality reduction techniques. We achieve $0.0678$ MAE and $0.85$ RAE in setting +Link, which corresponds to about $7.4\%$ error when predicting the bracketing $F_1$ score for the Charniak and Johnson parser on the WSJ23 test set. MTPPS-PPP system can predict without parsing using only the text, without a supervised parser using only an unsupervised parser, without any parser or language dependent information, without using a reference parser output, and can be used to predict the performance of any parser in any language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05116v1,2024-07
Ask Questions with Double Hints: Visual Question Generation with Answer-awareness and Region-reference,"Kai Shen, Lingfei Wu, Siliang Tang, Fangli Xu, Bo Long, Yueting Zhuang, Jian Pei","The visual question generation (VQG) task aims to generate human-like questions from an image and potentially other side information (e.g. answer type). Previous works on VQG fall in two aspects: i) They suffer from one image to many questions mapping problem, which leads to the failure of generating referential and meaningful questions from an image. ii) They fail to model complex implicit relations among the visual objects in an image and also overlook potential interactions between the side information and image. To address these limitations, we first propose a novel learning paradigm to generate visual questions with answer-awareness and region-reference. Concretely, we aim to ask the right visual questions with Double Hints - textual answers and visual regions of interests, which could effectively mitigate the existing one-to-many mapping issue. Particularly, we develop a simple methodology to self-learn the visual hints without introducing any additional human annotations. Furthermore, to capture these sophisticated relationships, we propose a new double-hints guided Graph-to-Sequence learning framework, which first models them as a dynamic graph and learns the implicit topology end-to-end, and then utilizes a graph-to-sequence model to generate the questions with double hints. Experimental results demonstrate the priority of our proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05100v1,2024-07
Exploring Sound Change Over Time: A Review of Computational and Human Perception,"Siqi He, Wei Zhao","Computational and human perception are often considered separate approaches for studying sound changes over time; few works have touched on the intersection of both. To fill this research gap, we provide a pioneering review contrasting computational with human perception from the perspectives of methods and tasks. Overall, computational approaches rely on computer-driven models to perceive historical sound changes on etymological datasets, while human approaches use listener-driven models to perceive ongoing sound changes on recording corpora. Despite their differences, both approaches complement each other on phonetic and acoustic levels, showing the potential to achieve a more comprehensive perception of sound change. Moreover, we call for a comparative study on the datasets used by both approaches to investigate the influence of historical sound changes on ongoing changes. Lastly, we discuss the applications of sound change in computational linguistics, and point out that perceiving sound change alone is insufficient, as many processes of language change are complex, with entangled changes at syntactic, semantic, and phonetic levels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05092v1,2024-07
Cross-Lingual Word Alignment for ASEAN Languages with Contrastive Learning,"Jingshen Zhang, Xinying Qiu, Teng Shen, Wenyu Wang, Kailin Zhang, Wenhe Feng","Cross-lingual word alignment plays a crucial role in various natural language processing tasks, particularly for low-resource languages. Recent study proposes a BiLSTM-based encoder-decoder model that outperforms pre-trained language models in low-resource settings. However, their model only considers the similarity of word embedding spaces and does not explicitly model the differences between word embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose incorporating contrastive learning into the BiLSTM-based encoder-decoder framework. Our approach introduces a multi-view negative sampling strategy to learn the differences between word pairs in the shared cross-lingual embedding space. We evaluate our model on five bilingual aligned datasets spanning four ASEAN languages: Lao, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating contrastive learning consistently improves word alignment accuracy across all datasets, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method in low-resource scenarios. We will release our data set and code to support future research on ASEAN or more low-resource word alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05054v1,2024-07
Enhance the Robustness of Text-Centric Multimodal Alignments,"Ting-Yu Yen, Yun-Da Tsai, Keng-Te Liao, Shou-De Lin","Converting different modalities into general text, serving as input prompts for large language models (LLMs), is a common method to align multimodal models when there is limited pairwise data. This text-centric approach leverages the unique properties of text as a modality space, transforming diverse inputs into a unified textual representation. This enables downstream models to effectively interpret various modal inputs. This study assesses the quality and robustness of multimodal representations in the presence of missing entries, noise, or absent modalities, revealing that current text-centric alignment methods compromise downstream robustness. To address this issue, we propose a new text-centric approach that achieves superior robustness compared to previous methods across various modalities in different settings. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach to enhance the robustness and adaptability of multimodal representations, offering a promising solution for dynamic and real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05036v1,2024-07
A Principled Framework for Evaluating on Typologically Diverse Languages,"Esther Ploeger, Wessel Poelman, Andreas Holck Høeg-Petersen, Anders Schlichtkrull, Miryam de Lhoneux, Johannes Bjerva","Beyond individual languages, multilingual natural language processing (NLP) research increasingly aims to develop models that perform well across languages generally. However, evaluating these systems on all the world's languages is practically infeasible. To attain generalizability, representative language sampling is essential. Previous work argues that generalizable multilingual evaluation sets should contain languages with diverse typological properties. However, 'typologically diverse' language samples have been found to vary considerably in this regard, and popular sampling methods are flawed and inconsistent. We present a language sampling framework for selecting highly typologically diverse languages given a sampling frame, informed by language typology. We compare sampling methods with a range of metrics and find that our systematic methods consistently retrieve more typologically diverse language selections than previous methods in NLP. Moreover, we provide evidence that this affects generalizability in multilingual model evaluation, emphasizing the importance of diverse language sampling in NLP evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05022v1,2024-07
How do you know that? Teaching Generative Language Models to Reference Answers to Biomedical Questions,"Bojana Bašaragin, Adela Ljajić, Darija Medvecki, Lorenzo Cassano, Miloš Košprdić, Nikola Milošević","Large language models (LLMs) have recently become the leading source of answers for users' questions online. Despite their ability to offer eloquent answers, their accuracy and reliability can pose a significant challenge. This is especially true for sensitive domains such as biomedicine, where there is a higher need for factually correct answers. This paper introduces a biomedical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to enhance the reliability of generated responses. The system is based on a fine-tuned LLM for the referenced question-answering, where retrieved relevant abstracts from PubMed are passed to LLM's context as input through a prompt. Its output is an answer based on PubMed abstracts, where each statement is referenced accordingly, allowing the users to verify the answer. Our retrieval system achieves an absolute improvement of 23% compared to the PubMed search engine. Based on the manual evaluation on a small sample, our fine-tuned LLM component achieves comparable results to GPT-4 Turbo in referencing relevant abstracts. We make the dataset used to fine-tune the models and the fine-tuned models based on Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.1 and v0.2 publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05015v1,2024-07
Progress or Regress? Self-Improvement Reversal in Post-training,"Ting Wu, Xuefeng Li, Pengfei Liu","Self-improvement through post-training methods such as iterative preference learning has been acclaimed for enhancing the problem-solving capabilities (e.g., mathematical reasoning) of Large Language Models (LLMs) without human intervention. However, as exploration deepens, it becomes crucial to assess whether these improvements genuinely signify progress in solving more challenging problems or if they could lead to unintended regressions. To address this, we propose a comprehensive evaluative framework that goes beyond the superficial pass@1 metric to scrutinize the underlying enhancements of post-training paradigms for self-improvement. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis across diverse problem-solving tasks, the empirical results point out the phenomenon of \emph{self-improvement reversal}, where models showing improved performance across benchmarks will paradoxically exhibit declines in broader, essential capabilities, like output diversity and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. These findings indicate that current self-improvement practices through post-training are inadequate for equipping models to tackle more complex problems. Furthermore, they underscore the necessity of our critical evaluation metrics in discerning the \emph{progress or regress} dichotomy for self-improving LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05013v1,2024-07
AI Safety in Generative AI Large Language Models: A Survey,"Jaymari Chua, Yun Li, Shiyi Yang, Chen Wang, Lina Yao","Large Language Model (LLMs) such as ChatGPT that exhibit generative AI capabilities are facing accelerated adoption and innovation. The increased presence of Generative AI (GAI) inevitably raises concerns about the risks and safety associated with these models. This article provides an up-to-date survey of recent trends in AI safety research of GAI-LLMs from a computer scientist's perspective: specific and technical. In this survey, we explore the background and motivation for the identified harms and risks in the context of LLMs being generative language models; our survey differentiates by emphasising the need for unified theories of the distinct safety challenges in the research development and applications of LLMs. We start our discussion with a concise introduction to the workings of LLMs, supported by relevant literature. Then we discuss earlier research that has pointed out the fundamental constraints of generative models, or lack of understanding thereof (e.g., performance and safety trade-offs as LLMs scale in number of parameters). We provide a sufficient coverage of LLM alignment -- delving into various approaches, contending methods and present challenges associated with aligning LLMs with human preferences. By highlighting the gaps in the literature and possible implementation oversights, our aim is to create a comprehensive analysis that provides insights for addressing AI safety in LLMs and encourages the development of aligned and secure models. We conclude our survey by discussing future directions of LLMs for AI safety, offering insights into ongoing research in this critical area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18369v1,2024-07

LoRA-GA: Low-Rank Adaptation with Gradient Approximation,"Shaowen Wang, Linxi Yu, Jian Li","Fine-tuning large-scale pretrained models is prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and memory costs. LoRA, as one of the most popular Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, offers a cost-effective alternative by fine-tuning an auxiliary low-rank model that has significantly fewer parameters. Although LoRA reduces the computational and memory requirements significantly at each iteration, extensive empirical evidence indicates that it converges at a considerably slower rate compared to full fine-tuning, ultimately leading to increased overall compute and often worse test performance. In our paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the initialization method of LoRA and show that careful initialization (without any change of the architecture and the training algorithm) can significantly enhance both efficiency and performance. In particular, we introduce a novel initialization method, LoRA-GA (Low Rank Adaptation with Gradient Approximation), which aligns the gradients of low-rank matrix product with those of full fine-tuning at the first step. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-GA achieves a convergence rate comparable to that of full fine-tuning (hence being significantly faster than vanilla LoRA as well as various recent improvements) while simultaneously attaining comparable or even better performance. For example, on the subset of the GLUE dataset with T5-Base, LoRA-GA outperforms LoRA by 5.69% on average. On larger models such as Llama 2-7B, LoRA-GA shows performance improvements of 0.34, 11.52%, and 5.05% on MT-bench, GSM8K, and Human-eval, respectively. Additionally, we observe up to 2-4 times convergence speed improvement compared to vanilla LoRA, validating its effectiveness in accelerating convergence and enhancing model performance.

The Solution for the 5th GCAIAC Zero-shot Referring Expression Comprehension Challenge,"Longfei Huang, Feng Yu, Zhihao Guan, Zhonghua Wan, Yang Yang","This report presents a solution for the zero-shot referring expression comprehension task. Visual-language multimodal base models (such as CLIP, SAM) have gained significant attention in recent years as a cornerstone of mainstream research. One of the key applications of multimodal base models lies in their ability to generalize to zero-shot downstream tasks. Unlike traditional referring expression comprehension, zero-shot referring expression comprehension aims to apply pre-trained visual-language models directly to the task without specific training. Recent studies have enhanced the zero-shot performance of multimodal base models in referring expression comprehension tasks by introducing visual prompts. To address the zero-shot referring expression comprehension challenge, we introduced a combination of visual prompts and considered the influence of textual prompts, employing joint prediction tailored to the data characteristics. Ultimately, our approach achieved accuracy rates of 84.825 on the A leaderboard and 71.460 on the B leaderboard, securing the first position.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04998v1,2024-07

Conditional Semi-Supervised Data Augmentation for Spam Message Detection with Low Resource Data,"Ulin Nuha, Chih-Hsueh Lin","Several machine learning schemes have attempted to perform the detection of spam messages. However, those schemes mostly require a huge amount of labeled data. The existing techniques addressing the lack of data availability have issues with effectiveness and robustness. Therefore, this paper proposes a conditional semi-supervised data augmentation (CSSDA) for a spam detection model lacking the availability of data. The main architecture of CSSDA comprises feature extraction and enhanced generative network. Here, we exploit unlabeled data for data augmentation to extend training data. The enhanced generative in our proposed scheme produces latent variables as fake samples from unlabeled data through a conditional scheme. Latent variables can come from labeled and unlabeled data as the input for the final classifier in our spam detection model. The experimental results indicate that our proposed CSSDA achieves excellent results compared to several related methods both exploiting unlabeled data and not. In the experiment stage with various amounts of unlabeled data, CSSDA is the only robust model that obtains a balanced accuracy of about 85% when the availability of labeled data is large. We also conduct several ablation studies to investigate our proposed scheme in detail. The result also shows that several ablation studies strengthen our proposed innovations. These experiments indicate that unlabeled data has a significant contribution to data augmentation using the conditional semi-supervised scheme for spam detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04990v1,2024-07
TRACE: TRansformer-based Attribution using Contrastive Embeddings in LLMs,"Cheng Wang, Xinyang Lu, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) represents a substantial leap forward in natural language understanding and generation. However, alongside these advancements come significant challenges related to the accountability and transparency of LLM responses. Reliable source attribution is essential to adhering to stringent legal and regulatory standards, including those set forth by the General Data Protection Regulation. Despite the well-established methods in source attribution within the computer vision domain, the application of robust attribution frameworks to natural language processing remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel and versatile TRansformer-based Attribution framework using Contrastive Embeddings called TRACE that, in particular, exploits contrastive learning for source attribution. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation to demonstrate the performance and efficiency of TRACE in various settings and show that TRACE significantly improves the ability to attribute sources accurately, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04981v1,2024-07
"Large language models are good medical coders, if provided with tools",Keith Kwan,"This study presents a novel two-stage Retrieve-Rank system for automated ICD-10-CM medical coding, comparing its performance against a Vanilla Large Language Model (LLM) approach.

EVA-Score: Evaluating Abstractive Long-form Summarization on Informativeness through Extraction and Validation,"Yuchen Fan, Xin Zhong, Yazhe Wan, Chengsi Wang, Haonan Cheng, Gaoche Wu, Ning Ding, Bowen Zhou","Since LLMs emerged, more attention has been paid to abstractive long-form summarization, where longer input sequences indicate more information contained. Nevertheless, the automatic evaluation of such summaries remains underexplored. The current evaluation metrics for long-form summarization either use similarity-based metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore or LLM-based metrics using appropriate prompts or pre-defined schema. We argue that the former only relies on similarity and fails to consider informativeness while the latter lacks quantitative analysis of informative richness, and is rather subjective and hard to explain. Current evaluation metrics either use traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore, which rely on surface-level similarity and fail to consider informativeness, or simple LLM-based metrics, which are not robust and easily overwhelmed by the long contexts. In this paper, we propose a new evaluation metric called EVA-Score to extract all information from the given summaries, identify overlapped information based on reference, and calculate the information score. We test EVA-Score on several datasets and the experimental results reveal that EVA-Score shows the highest correlation with humans. We also re-evaluate the performance of LLMs on long-form summarization from the information perspective. The results indicate that responses of LLMs still have a gap with the human-written answers. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of EVA-Score, forecasting future ways to automatically evaluate abstractive long-form summarization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04969v3,2024-07
Beyond Perplexity: Multi-dimensional Safety Evaluation of LLM Compression,"Zhichao Xu, Ashim Gupta, Tao Li, Oliver Bentham, Vivek Srikumar","Increasingly, model compression techniques enable large language models (LLMs) to be deployed in real-world applications. As a result of this momentum towards local deployment, compressed LLMs will interact with a large population. Prior work on compression typically prioritize preserving perplexity, which is directly analogous to training loss. The impact of compression method on other critical aspects of model behavior\, -- \,particularly safety\, -- \,requires systematic assessment. To this end, we investigate the impact of model compression along four dimensions: (1) degeneration harm, i.e., bias and toxicity in generation; (2) representational harm, i.e., biases in discriminative tasks; (3) dialect bias; and(4) language modeling and downstream task performance. We examine a wide spectrum of LLM compression techniques, including unstructured pruning, semi-structured pruning, and quantization. Our analysis reveals that compression can lead to unexpected consequences. Although compression may unintentionally alleviate LLMs' degeneration harm, it can still exacerbate representational harm. Furthermore, increasing compression produces a divergent impact on different protected groups. Finally, different compression methods have drastically different safety impacts: for example, quantization mostly preserves bias while pruning degrades quickly. Our findings underscore the importance of integrating safety assessments into the development of compressed LLMs to ensure their reliability across real-world applications.\footnote{Our implementation and results are available here: \url{https://github.com/zhichaoxu-shufe/Beyond-Perplexity-Compression-Safety-Eval}}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04965v3,2024-07
Applicability of Large Language Models and Generative Models for Legal Case Judgement Summarization,"Aniket Deroy, Kripabandhu Ghosh, Saptarshi Ghosh","Automatic summarization of legal case judgements, which are known to be long and complex, has traditionally been tried via extractive summarization models. In recent years, generative models including abstractive summarization models and Large language models (LLMs) have gained huge popularity. In this paper, we explore the applicability of such models for legal case judgement summarization. We applied various domain specific abstractive summarization models and general domain LLMs as well as extractive summarization models over two sets of legal case judgements from the United Kingdom (UK) Supreme Court and the Indian (IN) Supreme Court and evaluated the quality of the generated summaries. We also perform experiments on a third dataset of legal documents of a different type, Government reports from the United States (US). Results show that abstractive summarization models and LLMs generally perform better than the extractive methods as per traditional metrics for evaluating summary quality. However, detailed investigation shows the presence of inconsistencies and hallucinations in the outputs of the generative models, and we explore ways to reduce the hallucinations and inconsistencies in the summaries. Overall, the investigation suggests that further improvements are needed to enhance the reliability of abstractive models and LLMs for legal case judgement summarization. At present, a human-in-the-loop technique is more suitable for performing manual checks to identify inconsistencies in the generated summaries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12848v2,2024-07
Granular Privacy Control for Geolocation with Vision Language Models,"Ethan Mendes, Yang Chen, James Hays, Sauvik Das, Wei Xu, Alan Ritter","Vision Language Models (VLMs) are rapidly advancing in their capability to answer information-seeking questions. As these models are widely deployed in consumer applications, they could lead to new privacy risks due to emergent abilities to identify people in photos, geolocate images, etc. As we demonstrate, somewhat surprisingly, current open-source and proprietary VLMs are very capable image geolocators, making widespread geolocation with VLMs an immediate privacy risk, rather than merely a theoretical future concern. As a first step to address this challenge, we develop a new benchmark, GPTGeoChat, to test the ability of VLMs to moderate geolocation dialogues with users. We collect a set of 1,000 image geolocation conversations between in-house annotators and GPT-4v, which are annotated with the granularity of location information revealed at each turn. Using this new dataset, we evaluate the ability of various VLMs to moderate GPT-4v geolocation conversations by determining when too much location information has been revealed. We find that custom fine-tuned models perform on par with prompted API-based models when identifying leaked location information at the country or city level; however, fine-tuning on supervised data appears to be needed to accurately moderate finer granularities, such as the name of a restaurant or building.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04952v2,2024-07

OmChat's new architecture standardizes how different visual inputs are processed, making it more efficient and adaptable. It uses a dynamic vision encoding process to effectively handle images of various resolutions, capturing fine details across a range of image qualities. OmChat utilizes an active progressive multimodal pretraining strategy, which gradually increases the model's capacity for long contexts and enhances its overall abilities. By selecting high-quality data during training, OmChat learns from the most relevant and informative data points. With support for a context length of up to 512K, OmChat demonstrates promising performance in tasks involving multiple images and videos, outperforming most open-source models in these benchmarks. Additionally, OmChat proposes a prompting strategy for unifying complex multimodal inputs including single image text, multi-image text and videos, and achieving competitive performance on single-image benchmarks. To further evaluate the model's capabilities, we proposed a benchmark dataset named Temporal Visual Needle in a Haystack. This dataset assesses OmChat's ability to comprehend temporal visual details within long videos. Our analysis highlights several key factors contributing to OmChat's success: support for any-aspect high image resolution, the active progressive pretraining strategy, and high-quality supervised fine-tuning datasets.

NADI 2024 targeted both dialect identification cast as a multi-label task (Subtask~1), identification of the Arabic level of dialectness (Subtask~2), and dialect-to-MSA machine translation (Subtask~3). A total of 51 unique teams registered for the shared task, of whom 12 teams have participated (with 76 valid submissions during the test phase). Among these, three teams participated in Subtask~1, three in Subtask~2, and eight in Subtask~3. The winning teams achieved 50.57 F\textsubscript{1} on Subtask~1, 0.1403 RMSE for Subtask~2, and 20.44 BLEU in Subtask~3, respectively. Results show that Arabic dialect processing tasks such as dialect identification and machine translation remain challenging. We describe the methods employed by the participating teams and briefly offer an outlook for NADI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04910v1,2024-07
MMSci: A Dataset for Graduate-Level Multi-Discipline Multimodal Scientific Understanding,"Zekun Li, Xianjun Yang, Kyuri Choi, Wanrong Zhu, Ryan Hsieh, HyeonJung Kim, Jin Hyuk Lim, Sungyoung Ji, Byungju Lee, Xifeng Yan, Linda Ruth Petzold, Stephen D. Wilson, Woosang Lim, William Yang Wang","The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is making AI-driven scientific assistants increasingly feasible, with interpreting scientific figures being a crucial task. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus mainly on basic charts and limited science subjects, lacking comprehensive evaluations. To address this, we curated a multimodal, multidisciplinary dataset from peer-reviewed, open-access Nature Communications articles, spanning 72 scientific disciplines. This dataset includes figures such as schematic diagrams, simulated images, macroscopic/microscopic photos, and experimental visualizations (e.g., western blots), which often require graduate-level, discipline-specific expertise to interpret. We developed benchmarks for scientific figure captioning and multiple-choice questions, evaluating six proprietary and over ten open-source models across varied settings. The results highlight the high difficulty of these tasks and the significant performance gap among models. While many open-source models performed at chance level on the multiple-choice task, some matched the performance of proprietary models. However, the gap was more pronounced in the captioning task. Our dataset also provide valuable resource for training. Fine-tuning the Qwen2-VL-2B model with our task-specific multimodal training data improved its multiple-choice accuracy to a level comparable to GPT-4o, though captioning remains challenging. Continuous pre-training of MLLMs using our interleaved article and figure data enhanced their material generation capabilities, demonstrating potential for integrating scientific knowledge. The dataset and benchmarks will be released to support further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04903v2,2024-07
Algorithmic Language Models with Neurally Compiled Libraries,"Lucas Saldyt, Subbarao Kambhampati","Important tasks such as reasoning and planning are fundamentally algorithmic, meaning that solving them robustly requires acquiring true reasoning or planning algorithms, rather than shortcuts. Large Language Models lack true algorithmic ability primarily because of the limitations of neural network optimization algorithms, their optimization data and optimization objective, but also due to architectural inexpressivity. To solve this, our paper proposes augmenting LLMs with a library of fundamental operations and sophisticated differentiable programs, so that common algorithms do not need to be learned from scratch. We add memory, registers, basic operations, and adaptive recurrence to a transformer architecture built on LLaMA3. Then, we define a method for directly compiling algorithms into a differentiable starting library, which is used natively and propagates gradients for optimization. In this preliminary study, we explore the feasability of augmenting LLaMA3 with a differentiable computer, for instance by fine-tuning small transformers on simple algorithmic tasks with variable computational depth.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04899v1,2024-07

Challenges and Considerations in Annotating Legal Data: A Comprehensive Overview,"Harshil Darji, Jelena Mitrović, Michael Granitzer","The process of annotating data within the legal sector is filled with distinct challenges that differ from other fields, primarily due to the inherent complexities of legal language and documentation. The initial task usually involves selecting an appropriate raw dataset that captures the intricate aspects of legal texts. Following this, extracting text becomes a complicated task, as legal documents often have complex structures, footnotes, references, and unique terminology. The importance of data cleaning is magnified in this context, ensuring that redundant information is eliminated while maintaining crucial legal details and context. Creating comprehensive yet straightforward annotation guidelines is imperative, as these guidelines serve as the road map for maintaining uniformity and addressing the subtle nuances of legal terminology. Another critical aspect is the involvement of legal professionals in the annotation process. Their expertise is valuable in ensuring that the data not only remains contextually accurate but also adheres to prevailing legal standards and interpretations. This paper provides an expanded view of these challenges and aims to offer a foundational understanding and guidance for researchers and professionals engaged in legal data annotation projects. In addition, we provide links to our created and fine-tuned datasets and language models. These resources are outcomes of our discussed projects and solutions to challenges faced while working on them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17503v1,2024-07
Question Answering with Texts and Tables through Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Marcos M. José, Flávio N. Cação, Maria F. Ribeiro, Rafael M. Cheang, Paulo Pirozelli, Fabio G. Cozman","This paper proposes a novel architecture to generate multi-hop answers to open domain questions that require information from texts and tables, using the Open Table-and-Text Question Answering dataset for validation and training. One of the most common ways to generate answers in this setting is to retrieve information sequentially, where a selected piece of data helps searching for the next piece. As different models can have distinct behaviors when called in this sequential information search, a challenge is how to select models at each step. Our architecture employs reinforcement learning to choose between different state-of-the-art tools sequentially until, in the end, a desired answer is generated. This system achieved an F1-score of 19.03, comparable to iterative systems in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04858v1,2024-07
Towards Enhancing Coherence in Extractive Summarization: Dataset and Experiments with LLMs,"Mihir Parmar, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Franck Dernoncourt, Seunghyun Yoon, Ryan A. Rossi, Trung Bui","Extractive summarization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing due to its wide-range applications in summarizing diverse content efficiently, while also being faithful to the original content. Despite significant advancement achieved in extractive summarization by Large Language Models (LLMs), these summaries frequently exhibit incoherence. An important aspect of the coherent summary is its readability for intended users. Although there have been many datasets and benchmarks proposed for creating coherent extractive summaries, none of them currently incorporate user intent to improve coherence in extractive summarization. Motivated by this, we propose a systematically created human-annotated dataset consisting of coherent summaries for five publicly available datasets and natural language user feedback, offering valuable insights into how to improve coherence in extractive summaries. We utilize this dataset for aligning LLMs through supervised fine-tuning with natural language human feedback to enhance the coherence of their generated summaries. Preliminary experiments with Falcon-40B and Llama-2-13B show significant performance improvements (~10% Rouge-L) in terms of producing coherent summaries. We further utilize human feedback to benchmark results over instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 which resulted in several interesting findings.

Statistical investigations into the geometry and homology of random programs,"Jon Sporring, Ken Friis Larsen","AI-supported programming has taken giant leaps with tools such as Meta's Llama and openAI's chatGPT. These are examples of stochastic sources of programs and have already greatly influenced how we produce code and teach programming. If we consider input to such models as a stochastic source, a natural question is, what is the relation between the input and the output distributions, between the chatGPT prompt and the resulting program?   In this paper, we will show how the relation between random Python programs generated from chatGPT can be described geometrically and topologically using Tree-edit distances between the program's syntax trees and without explicit modeling of the underlying space. A popular approach to studying high-dimensional samples in a metric space is to use low-dimensional embedding using, e.g., multidimensional scaling. Such methods imply errors depending on the data and dimension of the embedding space. In this article, we propose to restrict such projection methods to purely visualization purposes and instead use geometric summary statistics, methods from spatial point statistics, and topological data analysis to characterize the configurations of random programs that do not rely on embedding approximations. To demonstrate their usefulness, we compare two publicly available models: ChatGPT-4 and TinyLlama, on a simple problem related to image processing.   Application areas include understanding how questions should be asked to obtain useful programs; measuring how consistently a given large language model answers; and comparing the different large language models as a programming assistant. Finally, we speculate that our approach may in the future give new insights into the structure of programming languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04854v1,2024-07
MJ-Bench: Is Your Multimodal Reward Model Really a Good Judge for Text-to-Image Generation?,"Zhaorun Chen, Yichao Du, Zichen Wen, Yiyang Zhou, Chenhang Cui, Zhenzhen Weng, Haoqin Tu, Chaoqi Wang, Zhengwei Tong, Qinglan Huang, Canyu Chen, Qinghao Ye, Zhihong Zhu, Yuqing Zhang, Jiawei Zhou, Zhuokai Zhao, Rafael Rafailov, Chelsea Finn, Huaxiu Yao","While text-to-image models like DALLE-3 and Stable Diffusion are rapidly proliferating, they often encounter challenges such as hallucination, bias, and the production of unsafe, low-quality output. To effectively address these issues, it is crucial to align these models with desired behaviors based on feedback from a multimodal judge. Despite their significance, current multimodal judges frequently undergo inadequate evaluation of their capabilities and limitations, potentially leading to misalignment and unsafe fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce MJ-Bench, a novel benchmark which incorporates a comprehensive preference dataset to evaluate multimodal judges in providing feedback for image generation models across four key perspectives: alignment, safety, image quality, and bias. Specifically, we evaluate a large variety of multimodal judges including smaller-sized CLIP-based scoring models, open-source VLMs (e.g. LLaVA family), and close-source VLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude 3) on each decomposed subcategory of our preference dataset. Experiments reveal that close-source VLMs generally provide better feedback, with GPT-4o outperforming other judges in average. Compared with open-source VLMs, smaller-sized scoring models can provide better feedback regarding text-image alignment and image quality, while VLMs provide more accurate feedback regarding safety and generation bias due to their stronger reasoning capabilities. Further studies in feedback scale reveal that VLM judges can generally provide more accurate and stable feedback in natural language (Likert-scale) than numerical scales. Notably, human evaluations on end-to-end fine-tuned models using separate feedback from these multimodal judges provide similar conclusions, further confirming the effectiveness of MJ-Bench.

Revisiting Structured Sentiment Analysis as Latent Dependency Graph Parsing,"Chengjie Zhou, Bobo Li, Hao Fei, Fei Li, Chong Teng, Donghong Ji","Structured Sentiment Analysis (SSA) was cast as a problem of bi-lexical dependency graph parsing by prior studies. Multiple formulations have been proposed to construct the graph, which share several intrinsic drawbacks: (1) The internal structures of spans are neglected, thus only the boundary tokens of spans are used for relation prediction and span recognition, thus hindering the model's expressiveness; (2) Long spans occupy a significant proportion in the SSA datasets, which further exacerbates the problem of internal structure neglect. In this paper, we treat the SSA task as a dependency parsing task on partially-observed dependency trees, regarding flat spans without determined tree annotations as latent subtrees to consider internal structures of spans. We propose a two-stage parsing method and leverage TreeCRFs with a novel constrained inside algorithm to model latent structures explicitly, which also takes advantages of joint scoring graph arcs and headed spans for global optimization and inference. Results of extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets reveal that our method performs significantly better than all previous bi-lexical methods, achieving new state-of-the-art.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04801v1,2024-07
Toucan: Many-to-Many Translation for 150 African Language Pairs,"AbdelRahim Elmadany, Ife Adebara, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed","We address a notable gap in Natural Language Processing (NLP) by introducing a collection of resources designed to improve Machine Translation (MT) for low-resource languages, with a specific focus on African languages. First, we introduce two language models (LMs), Cheetah-1.2B and Cheetah-3.7B, with 1.2 billion and 3.7 billion parameters respectively. Next, we finetune the aforementioned models to create toucan, an Afrocentric machine translation model designed to support 156 African language pairs. To evaluate Toucan, we carefully develop an extensive machine translation benchmark, dubbed AfroLingu-MT, tailored for evaluating machine translation. Toucan significantly outperforms other models, showcasing its remarkable performance on MT for African languages. Finally, we train a new model, spBLEU-1K, to enhance translation evaluation metrics, covering 1K languages, including 614 African languages. This work aims to advance the field of NLP, fostering cross-cultural understanding and knowledge exchange, particularly in regions with limited language resources such as Africa.

On Evaluating The Performance of Watermarked Machine-Generated Texts Under Adversarial Attacks,"Zesen Liu, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He, Qi Li","Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various applications, including text generation and complex tasks. However, the misuse of LLMs raises concerns about the authenticity and ethical implications of the content they produce, such as deepfake news, academic fraud, and copyright infringement. Watermarking techniques, which embed identifiable markers in machine-generated text, offer a promising solution to these issues by allowing for content verification and origin tracing. Unfortunately, the robustness of current LLM watermarking schemes under potential watermark removal attacks has not been comprehensively explored.   In this paper, to fill this gap, we first systematically comb the mainstream watermarking schemes and removal attacks on machine-generated texts, and then we categorize them into pre-text (before text generation) and post-text (after text generation) classes so that we can conduct diversified analyses. In our experiments, we evaluate eight watermarks (five pre-text, three post-text) and twelve attacks (two pre-text, ten post-text) across 87 scenarios. Evaluation results indicate that (1) KGW and Exponential watermarks offer high text quality and watermark retention but remain vulnerable to most attacks; (2) Post-text attacks are found to be more efficient and practical than pre-text attacks; (3) Pre-text watermarks are generally more imperceptible, as they do not alter text fluency, unlike post-text watermarks; (4) Additionally, combined attack methods can significantly increase effectiveness, highlighting the need for more robust watermarking solutions. Our study underscores the vulnerabilities of current techniques and the necessity for developing more resilient schemes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04794v2,2024-07
Re-Tuning: Overcoming the Compositionality Limits of Large Language Models with Recursive Tuning,"Eric Pasewark, Kyle Montgomery, Kefei Duan, Dawn Song, Chenguang Wang","We present a new method for large language models to solve compositional tasks. Although they have shown strong performance on traditional language understanding tasks, large language models struggle to solve compositional tasks, where the solution depends on solving smaller instances of the same problem. We propose a natural approach to solve compositional tasks recursively. Our method, Re-Tuning, tunes models to break down a problem into subproblems, solve those subproblems, and combine the results. We show that our method significantly improves model performance on three representative compositional tasks: integer addition, dynamic programming, and parity. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that keep intermediate steps towards solving the problems, Re-Tuning achieves significantly higher accuracy and is more GPU memory efficient.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04787v1,2024-07
"Me, Myself, and AI: The Situational Awareness Dataset (SAD) for LLMs","Rudolf Laine, Bilal Chughtai, Jan Betley, Kaivalya Hariharan, Jeremy Scheurer, Mikita Balesni, Marius Hobbhahn, Alexander Meinke, Owain Evans","AI assistants such as ChatGPT are trained to respond to users by saying, ""I am a large language model"". This raises questions. Do such models know that they are LLMs and reliably act on this knowledge? Are they aware of their current circumstances, such as being deployed to the public? We refer to a model's knowledge of itself and its circumstances as situational awareness. To quantify situational awareness in LLMs, we introduce a range of behavioral tests, based on question answering and instruction following. These tests form the $\textbf{Situational Awareness Dataset (SAD)}$, a benchmark comprising 7 task categories and over 13,000 questions. The benchmark tests numerous abilities, including the capacity of LLMs to (i) recognize their own generated text, (ii) predict their own behavior, (iii) determine whether a prompt is from internal evaluation or real-world deployment, and (iv) follow instructions that depend on self-knowledge.   We evaluate 16 LLMs on SAD, including both base (pretrained) and chat models. While all models perform better than chance, even the highest-scoring model (Claude 3 Opus) is far from a human baseline on certain tasks. We also observe that performance on SAD is only partially predicted by metrics of general knowledge (e.g. MMLU). Chat models, which are finetuned to serve as AI assistants, outperform their corresponding base models on SAD but not on general knowledge tasks. The purpose of SAD is to facilitate scientific understanding of situational awareness in LLMs by breaking it down into quantitative abilities. Situational awareness is important because it enhances a model's capacity for autonomous planning and action. While this has potential benefits for automation, it also introduces novel risks related to AI safety and control.

ANAH-v2: Scaling Analytical Hallucination Annotation of Large Language Models,"Yuzhe Gu, Ziwei Ji, Wenwei Zhang, Chengqi Lyu, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations in long-form question-answering tasks across various domains and wide applications. Current hallucination detection and mitigation datasets are limited in domains and sizes, which struggle to scale due to prohibitive labor costs and insufficient reliability of existing hallucination annotators. To facilitate the scalable oversight of LLM hallucinations, this paper introduces an iterative self-training framework that simultaneously and progressively scales up the hallucination annotation dataset and improves the accuracy of the hallucination annotator. Based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in each iteration, the framework first applies a hallucination annotation pipeline to annotate a scaled dataset and then trains a more accurate hallucination annotator on the dataset. This new hallucination annotator is adopted in the hallucination annotation pipeline used for the next iteration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the finally obtained hallucination annotator with only 7B parameters surpasses the performance of GPT-4 and obtains new state-of-the-art hallucination detection results on HaluEval and HalluQA by zero-shot inference. Such an annotator can not only evaluate the hallucination levels of various LLMs on the large-scale dataset but also help to mitigate the hallucination of LLMs generations, with the Natural Language Inference (NLI) metric increasing from 25% to 37% on HaluEval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04693v2,2024-07
Missed Causes and Ambiguous Effects: Counterfactuals Pose Challenges for Interpreting Neural Networks,Aaron Mueller,"Interpretability research takes counterfactual theories of causality for granted. Most causal methods rely on counterfactual interventions to inputs or the activations of particular model components, followed by observations of the change in models' output logits or behaviors. While this yields more faithful evidence than correlational methods, counterfactuals nonetheless have key problems that bias our findings in specific and predictable ways. Specifically, (i) counterfactual theories do not effectively capture multiple independently sufficient causes of the same effect, which leads us to miss certain causes entirely; and (ii) counterfactual dependencies in neural networks are generally not transitive, which complicates methods for extracting and interpreting causal graphs from neural networks. We discuss the implications of these challenges for interpretability researchers and propose concrete suggestions for future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04690v1,2024-07
Rethinking Visual Prompting for Multimodal Large Language Models with External Knowledge,"Yuanze Lin, Yunsheng Li, Dongdong Chen, Weijian Xu, Ronald Clark, Philip Torr, Lu Yuan","In recent years, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by training on vast high-quality image-text datasets, enabling them to generally understand images well. However, the inherent difficulty in explicitly conveying fine-grained or spatially dense information in text, such as masks, poses a challenge for MLLMs, limiting their ability to answer questions requiring an understanding of detailed or localized visual elements. Drawing inspiration from the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) concept, this paper proposes a new visual prompt approach to integrate fine-grained external knowledge, gleaned from specialized vision models (e.g., instance segmentation/OCR models), into MLLMs. This is a promising yet underexplored direction for enhancing MLLMs' performance. Our approach diverges from concurrent works, which transform external knowledge into additional text prompts, necessitating the model to indirectly learn the correspondence between visual content and text coordinates. Instead, we propose embedding fine-grained knowledge information directly into a spatial embedding map as a visual prompt. This design can be effortlessly incorporated into various MLLMs, such as LLaVA and Mipha, considerably improving their visual understanding performance. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate that our method can enhance MLLM performance across nine benchmarks, amplifying their fine-grained context-aware capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04681v1,2024-07

This paper examines the gaps and overlaps between LMs and the brain at different levels of analysis, emphasizing the importance of looking beyond input-output behavior to examine and compare the internal processes of these systems. We discuss how insights from neuroscience, such as sparsity, modularity, internal states, and interactive learning, can inform the development of more biologically plausible language models. Furthermore, we explore the role of scaling laws in bridging the gap between LMs and human cognition, highlighting the need for efficiency constraints analogous to those in biological systems. By developing LMs that more closely mimic brain function, we aim to advance both artificial intelligence and our understanding of human cognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04680v1,2024-07
Pretraining End-to-End Keyword Search with Automatically Discovered Acoustic Units,"Bolaji Yusuf, Jan ""Honza"" Černocký, Murat Saraçlar","End-to-end (E2E) keyword search (KWS) has emerged as an alternative and complimentary approach to conventional keyword search which depends on the output of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. While E2E methods greatly simplify the KWS pipeline, they generally have worse performance than their ASR-based counterparts, which can benefit from pretraining with untranscribed data. In this work, we propose a method for pretraining E2E KWS systems with untranscribed data, which involves using acoustic unit discovery (AUD) to obtain discrete units for untranscribed data and then learning to locate sequences of such units in the speech. We conduct experiments across languages and AUD systems: we show that finetuning such a model significantly outperforms a model trained from scratch, and the performance improvements are generally correlated with the quality of the AUD system used for pretraining.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04652v1,2024-07

We introduce a metric for measuring SSR performance and we propose a model which does SSR by combining a RNN-Transducer-based ASR system with an audio-prefixed language model (LM). The ASR system transcribes ongoing audio and feeds the resulting transcripts, along with an audio-dependent prefix, to the LM, which speculates likely completions for the transcriptions. We experiment with a variety of ASR datasets on which show the efficacy our method and the feasibility of SSR as a method of reducing ASR latency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04641v1,2024-07
Entity Decomposition with Filtering: A Zero-Shot Clinical Named Entity Recognition Framework,"Reza Averly, Xia Ning","Clinical named entity recognition (NER) aims to retrieve important entities within clinical narratives. Recent works have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance in this task. While previous works focus on proprietary LLMs, we investigate how open NER LLMs, trained specifically for entity recognition, perform in clinical NER. In this paper, we aim to improve them through a novel framework, entity decomposition with filtering, or EDF. Our key idea is to decompose the entity recognition task into several retrievals of sub-entity types. We also introduce a filtering mechanism to remove incorrect entities. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework across all metrics, models, datasets, and entity types. Our analysis reveals that entity decomposition can recognize previously missed entities with substantial improvement.

Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States,"Yu Sun, Xinhao Li, Karan Dalal, Jiarui Xu, Arjun Vikram, Genghan Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xinlei Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Sanmi Koyejo, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Carlos Guestrin","Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04620v2,2024-07
Efficient Controlled Language Generation with Low-Rank Autoregressive Reward Models,"Sergey Troshin, Vlad Niculae, Antske Fokkens","Language models trained on large amounts of data are known to produce inappropriate content in some cases and require careful tuning to be used in the real world. We revisit the reward augmented decoding (RAD) approach to control the generation from a language model using the scores from a task-specific reward model. We investigate the training objective of RAD, and reformulate it as a task of learning a reward matrix. We show that RAD is designed to support high flexibility when representing the reward matrices, which leads to a higher computational costs during decoding. However, we demonstrate that RAD does not use its full flexibility. Motivated by this, we propose a simpler but more efficient low-rank parametrization of the reward model enabling fast and effective guided decoding. For the detoxification and sentiment control tasks, we show that our low-rank reward model performs on par with the more flexible RAD parametrization, while requiring only a single reward model call per generated token.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04615v2,2024-07

Written Term Detection Improves Spoken Term Detection,"Bolaji Yusuf, Murat Saraçlar","End-to-end (E2E) approaches to keyword search (KWS) are considerably simpler in terms of training and indexing complexity when compared to approaches which use the output of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. This simplification however has drawbacks due to the loss of modularity. In particular, where ASR-based KWS systems can benefit from external unpaired text via a language model, current formulations of E2E KWS systems have no such mechanism. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multitask training objective which allows unpaired text to be integrated into E2E KWS without complicating indexing and search. In addition to training an E2E KWS model to retrieve text queries from spoken documents, we jointly train it to retrieve text queries from masked written documents. We show empirically that this approach can effectively leverage unpaired text for KWS, with significant improvements in search performance across a wide variety of languages. We conduct analysis which indicates that these improvements are achieved because the proposed method improves document representations for words in the unpaired text. Finally, we show that the proposed method can be used for domain adaptation in settings where in-domain paired data is scarce or nonexistent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04601v1,2024-07
Testing learning hypotheses using neural networks by manipulating learning data,"Cara Su-Yi Leong, Tal Linzen","Although passivization is productive in English, it is not completely general -- some exceptions exist (e.g. *One hour was lasted by the meeting). How do English speakers learn these exceptions to an otherwise general pattern? Using neural network language models as theories of acquisition, we explore the sources of indirect evidence that a learner can leverage to learn whether a verb can passivize. We first characterize English speakers' judgments of exceptions to the passive, confirming that speakers find some verbs more passivizable than others. We then show that a neural network language model can learn restrictions to the passive that are similar to those displayed by humans, suggesting that evidence for these exceptions is available in the linguistic input. We test the causal role of two hypotheses for how the language model learns these restrictions by training models on modified training corpora, which we create by altering the existing training corpora to remove features of the input implicated by each hypothesis. We find that while the frequency with which a verb appears in the passive significantly affects its passivizability, the semantics of the verb does not. This study highlight the utility of altering a language model's training data for answering questions where complete control over a learner's input is vital.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04593v1,2024-07
VRSD: Rethinking Similarity and Diversity for Retrieval in Large Language Models,"Hang Gao, Yongfeng Zhang","Vector retrieval algorithms are essential for semantic queries within the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs). The ability to retrieve vectors that satisfy both similarity and diversity criteria substantially enhances the performance of LLMs. Although Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) is widely employed in retrieval scenarios requiring relevance and diversity, variations in the parameter $\lambda$ lead to fluctuations that complicate the optimization trajectory in vector spaces. This obscures the direction of improvement and highlights the lack of a robust theoretical analysis regarding similarity and diversity constraints in retrieval processes. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that characterizes both constraints through the relationship between the sum vector and the query vector. The proximity of these vectors ensures the similarity constraint, while requiring individual vectors within the sum vector to diverge in their alignment with the query vector satisfies the diversity constraint. We first formulate a new combinatorial optimization problem, selecting k vectors from a candidate set such that their sum vector maximally aligns with the query vector, and demonstrate that this problem is NP-complete. This result underscores the inherent difficulty of simultaneously achieving similarity and diversity in vector retrieval, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for future research. Subsequently, we present the heuristic algorithm Vectors Retrieval with Similarity and Diversity, VRSD, which features a clear optimization objective and eliminates the need for preset parameters. VRSD also achieves a modest reduction in time complexity compared to MMR. Empirical validation confirms that VRSD significantly outperforms MMR across various datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04573v2,2024-07
"Not (yet) the whole story: Evaluating Visual Storytelling Requires More than Measuring Coherence, Grounding, and Repetition","Aditya K Surikuchi, Raquel Fernández, Sandro Pezzelle","Visual storytelling consists in generating a natural language story given a temporally ordered sequence of images. This task is not only challenging for models, but also very difficult to evaluate with automatic metrics since there is no consensus about what makes a story 'good'. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that measures story quality in terms of human likeness regarding three key aspects highlighted in previous work: visual grounding, coherence, and repetitiveness. We then use this method to evaluate the stories generated by several models, showing that the foundation model LLaVA obtains the best result, but only slightly so compared to TAPM, a 50-times smaller visual storytelling model. Upgrading the visual and language components of TAPM results in a model that yields competitive performance with a relatively low number of parameters. Finally, we carry out a human evaluation study, whose results suggest that a 'good' story may require more than a human-like level of visual grounding, coherence, and repetition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04559v4,2024-07
Spontaneous Reward Hacking in Iterative Self-Refinement,"Jane Pan, He He, Samuel R. Bowman, Shi Feng","Language models are capable of iteratively improving their outputs based on natural language feedback, thus enabling in-context optimization of user preference. In place of human users, a second language model can be used as an evaluator, providing feedback along with numerical ratings which the generator attempts to optimize. However, because the evaluator is an imperfect proxy of user preference, this optimization can lead to reward hacking, where the evaluator's ratings improve while the generation quality remains stagnant or even decreases as judged by actual user preference. The concern of reward hacking is heightened in iterative self-refinement where the generator and the evaluator use the same underlying language model, in which case the optimization pressure can drive them to exploit shared vulnerabilities. Using an essay editing task, we show that iterative self-refinement leads to deviation between the language model evaluator and human judgment, demonstrating that reward hacking can occur spontaneously in-context with the use of iterative self-refinement. In addition, we study conditions under which reward hacking occurs and observe two factors that affect reward hacking severity: model size and context sharing between the generator and the evaluator.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04549v1,2024-07
Strengthening Structural Inductive Biases by Pre-training to Perform Syntactic Transformations,"Matthias Lindemann, Alexander Koller, Ivan Titov","Models need appropriate inductive biases to effectively learn from small amounts of data and generalize systematically outside of the training distribution. While Transformers are highly versatile and powerful, they can still benefit from enhanced structural inductive biases for seq2seq tasks, especially those involving syntactic transformations, such as converting active to passive voice or semantic parsing. In this paper, we propose to strengthen the structural inductive bias of a Transformer by intermediate pre-training to perform synthetically generated syntactic transformations of dependency trees given a description of the transformation. Our experiments confirm that this helps with few-shot learning of syntactic tasks such as chunking, and also improves structural generalization for semantic parsing. Our analysis shows that the intermediate pre-training leads to attention heads that keep track of which syntactic transformation needs to be applied to which token, and that the model can leverage these attention heads on downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04543v1,2024-07
PoPreRo: A New Dataset for Popularity Prediction of Romanian Reddit Posts,"Ana-Cristina Rogoz, Maria Ilinca Nechita, Radu Tudor Ionescu","We introduce PoPreRo, the first dataset for Popularity Prediction of Romanian posts collected from Reddit. The PoPreRo dataset includes a varied compilation of post samples from five distinct subreddits of Romania, totaling 28,107 data samples. Along with our novel dataset, we introduce a set of competitive models to be used as baselines for future research. Interestingly, the top-scoring model achieves an accuracy of 61.35% and a macro F1 score of 60.60% on the test set, indicating that the popularity prediction task on PoPreRo is very challenging. Further investigations based on few-shot prompting the Falcon-7B Large Language Model also point in the same direction. We thus believe that PoPreRo is a valuable resource that can be used to evaluate models on predicting the popularity of social media posts in Romanian. We release our dataset at https://github.com/ana-rogoz/PoPreRo.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04541v2,2024-07
Performance Analysis of Speech Encoders for Low-Resource SLU and ASR in Tunisian Dialect,"Salima Mdhaffar, Haroun Elleuch, Fethi Bougares, Yannick Estève","Speech encoders pretrained through self-supervised learning (SSL) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various downstream tasks, including Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). For instance, fine-tuning SSL models for such tasks has shown significant potential, leading to improvements in the SOTA performance across challenging datasets. In contrast to existing research, this paper contributes by comparing the effectiveness of SSL approaches in the context of (i) the low-resource spoken Tunisian Arabic dialect and (ii) its combination with a low-resource SLU and ASR scenario, where only a few semantic annotations are available for fine-tuning. We conduct experiments using many SSL speech encoders on the TARIC-SLU dataset. We use speech encoders that were pre-trained on either monolingual or multilingual speech data. Some of them have also been refined without in-domain nor Tunisian data through multimodal supervised teacher-student paradigm. This study yields numerous significant findings that we are discussing in this paper.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04533v2,2024-07
GPT vs RETRO: Exploring the Intersection of Retrieval and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning,"Aleksander Ficek, Jiaqi Zeng, Oleksii Kuchaiev","Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have become popular methods for adapting large language models while minimizing compute requirements. In this paper, we apply PEFT methods (P-tuning, Adapters, and LoRA) to a modified Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) and a baseline GPT model across several sizes, ranging from 823 million to 48 billion parameters. We show that RETRO models outperform GPT models in zero-shot settings due to their unique pre-training process but GPT models have higher performance potential with PEFT. Additionally, our study indicates that 8B parameter models strike an optimal balance between cost and performance and P-tuning lags behind other PEFT techniques. We further provide a comparative analysis between applying PEFT to an Instruction-tuned RETRO model and base RETRO model. This work presents the first comprehensive comparison of various PEFT methods integrated with RAG, applied to both GPT and RETRO models, highlighting their relative performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04528v4,2024-07
Leveraging Graph Structures to Detect Hallucinations in Large Language Models,"Noa Nonkes, Sergei Agaronian, Evangelos Kanoulas, Roxana Petcu","Large language models are extensively applied across a wide range of tasks, such as customer support, content creation, educational tutoring, and providing financial guidance. However, a well-known drawback is their predisposition to generate hallucinations. This damages the trustworthiness of the information these models provide, impacting decision-making and user confidence. We propose a method to detect hallucinations by looking at the structure of the latent space and finding associations within hallucinated and non-hallucinated generations. We create a graph structure that connects generations that lie closely in the embedding space. Moreover, we employ a Graph Attention Network which utilizes message passing to aggregate information from neighboring nodes and assigns varying degrees of importance to each neighbor based on their relevance. Our findings show that 1) there exists a structure in the latent space that differentiates between hallucinated and non-hallucinated generations, 2) Graph Attention Networks can learn this structure and generalize it to unseen generations, and 3) the robustness of our method is enhanced when incorporating contrastive learning. When evaluated against evidence-based benchmarks, our model performs similarly without access to search-based methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04485v1,2024-07
Controlling Whisper: Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks to Control Speech Foundation Models,"Vyas Raina, Mark Gales","Speech enabled foundation models, either in the form of flexible speech recognition based systems or audio-prompted large language models (LLMs), are becoming increasingly popular. One of the interesting aspects of these models is their ability to perform tasks other than automatic speech recognition (ASR) using an appropriate prompt. For example, the OpenAI Whisper model can perform both speech transcription and speech translation. With the development of audio-prompted LLMs there is the potential for even greater control options. In this work we demonstrate that with this greater flexibility the systems can be susceptible to model-control adversarial attacks. Without any access to the model prompt it is possible to modify the behaviour of the system by appropriately changing the audio input. To illustrate this risk, we demonstrate that it is possible to prepend a short universal adversarial acoustic segment to any input speech signal to override the prompt setting of an ASR foundation model. Specifically, we successfully use a universal adversarial acoustic segment to control Whisper to always perform speech translation, despite being set to perform speech transcription. Overall, this work demonstrates a new form of adversarial attack on multi-tasking speech enabled foundation models that needs to be considered prior to the deployment of this form of model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04482v2,2024-07
EventChat: Implementation and user-centric evaluation of a large language model-driven conversational recommender system for exploring leisure events in an SME context,"Hannes Kunstmann, Joseph Ollier, Joel Persson, Florian von Wangenheim","Large language models (LLMs) present an enormous evolution in the strategic potential of conversational recommender systems (CRS). Yet to date, research has predominantly focused upon technical frameworks to implement LLM-driven CRS, rather than end-user evaluations or strategic implications for firms, particularly from the perspective of a small to medium enterprises (SME) that makeup the bedrock of the global economy. In the current paper, we detail the design of an LLM-driven CRS in an SME setting, and its subsequent performance in the field using both objective system metrics and subjective user evaluations. While doing so, we additionally outline a short-form revised ResQue model for evaluating LLM-driven CRS, enabling replicability in a rapidly evolving field. Our results reveal good system performance from a user experience perspective (85.5% recommendation accuracy) but underscore latency, cost, and quality issues challenging business viability. Notably, with a median cost of $0.04 per interaction and a latency of 5.7s, cost-effectiveness and response time emerge as crucial areas for achieving a more user-friendly and economically viable LLM-driven CRS for SME settings. One major driver of these costs is the use of an advanced LLM as a ranker within the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique. Our results additionally indicate that relying solely on approaches such as Prompt-based learning with ChatGPT as the underlying LLM makes it challenging to achieve satisfying quality in a production environment. Strategic considerations for SMEs deploying an LLM-driven CRS are outlined, particularly considering trade-offs in the current technical landscape.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04472v3,2024-07
Are Large Language Models Strategic Decision Makers? A Study of Performance and Bias in Two-Player Non-Zero-Sum Games,"Nathan Herr, Fernando Acero, Roberta Raileanu, María Pérez-Ortiz, Zhibin Li","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used in real-world settings, yet their strategic decision-making abilities remain largely unexplored. To fully benefit from the potential of LLMs, it's essential to understand their ability to function in complex social scenarios. Game theory, which is already used to understand real-world interactions, provides a good framework for assessing these abilities. This work investigates the performance and merits of LLMs in canonical game-theoretic two-player non-zero-sum games, Stag Hunt and Prisoner Dilemma. Our structured evaluation of GPT-3.5, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B shows that these models, when making decisions in these games, are affected by at least one of the following systematic biases: positional bias, payoff bias, or behavioural bias. This indicates that LLMs do not fully rely on logical reasoning when making these strategic decisions. As a result, it was found that the LLMs' performance drops when the game configuration is misaligned with the affecting biases. When misaligned, GPT-3.5, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B show an average performance drop of 32\%, 25\%, 34\%, and 29\% respectively in Stag Hunt, and 28\%, 16\%, 34\%, and 24\% respectively in Prisoner's Dilemma. Surprisingly, GPT-4o (a top-performing LLM across standard benchmarks) suffers the most substantial performance drop, suggesting that newer models are not addressing these issues. Interestingly, we found that a commonly used method of improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, reduces the biases in GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and Llama-3-8B but increases the effect of the bias in GPT-4-Turbo, indicating that CoT alone cannot fully serve as a robust solution to this problem. We perform several additional experiments, which provide further insight into these observed behaviours.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04467v3,2024-07
Using LLMs to label medical papers according to the CIViC evidence model,"Markus Hisch, Xing David Wang","We introduce the sequence classification problem CIViC Evidence to the field of medical NLP. CIViC Evidence denotes the multi-label classification problem of assigning labels of clinical evidence to abstracts of scientific papers which have examined various combinations of genomic variants, cancer types, and treatment approaches. We approach CIViC Evidence using different language models: We fine-tune pretrained checkpoints of BERT and RoBERTa on the CIViC Evidence dataset and challenge their performance with models of the same architecture which have been pretrained on domain-specific text. In this context, we find that BiomedBERT and BioLinkBERT can outperform BERT on CIViC Evidence (+0.8% and +0.9% absolute improvement in class-support weighted F1 score). All transformer-based models show a clear performance edge when compared to a logistic regression trained on bigram tf-idf scores (+1.5 - 2.7% improved F1 score). We compare the aforementioned BERT-like models to OpenAI's GPT-4 in a few-shot setting (on a small subset of our original test dataset), demonstrating that, without additional prompt-engineering or fine-tuning, GPT-4 performs worse on CIViC Evidence than our six fine-tuned models (66.1% weighted F1 score compared to 71.8% for the best fine-tuned model). However, performance gets reasonably close to the benchmark of a logistic regression model trained on bigram tf-idf scores (67.7% weighted F1 score).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04466v1,2024-07
Generalists vs. Specialists: Evaluating Large Language Models for Urdu,"Samee Arif, Abdul Hameed Azeemi, Agha Ali Raza, Awais Athar","In this paper, we compare general-purpose models, GPT-4-Turbo and Llama-3-8b, with special-purpose models--XLM-Roberta-large, mT5-large, and Llama-3-8b--that have been fine-tuned on specific tasks. We focus on seven classification and seven generation tasks to evaluate the performance of these models on Urdu language. Urdu has 70 million native speakers, yet it remains underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Despite the frequent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance in low-resource languages, including Urdu, still needs to be explored. We also conduct a human evaluation for the generation tasks and compare the results with the evaluations performed by GPT-4-Turbo, Llama-3-8b and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. We find that special-purpose models consistently outperform general-purpose models across various tasks. We also find that the evaluation done by GPT-4-Turbo for generation tasks aligns more closely with human evaluation compared to the evaluation the evaluation done by Llama-3-8b. This paper contributes to the NLP community by providing insights into the effectiveness of general and specific-purpose LLMs for low-resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04459v3,2024-07
TokenVerse: Towards Unifying Speech and NLP Tasks via Transducer-based ASR,"Shashi Kumar, Srikanth Madikeri, Juan Zuluaga-Gomez, Iuliia Thorbecke, Esaú Villatoro-Tello, Sergio Burdisso, Petr Motlicek, Karthik Pandia, Aravind Ganapathiraju","In traditional conversational intelligence from speech, a cascaded pipeline is used, involving tasks such as voice activity detection, diarization, transcription, and subsequent processing with different NLP models for tasks like semantic endpointing and named entity recognition (NER). Our paper introduces TokenVerse, a single Transducer-based model designed to handle multiple tasks. This is achieved by integrating task-specific tokens into the reference text during ASR model training, streamlining the inference and eliminating the need for separate NLP models. In addition to ASR, we conduct experiments on 3 different tasks: speaker change detection, endpointing, and NER. Our experiments on a public and a private dataset show that the proposed method improves ASR by up to 7.7% in relative WER while outperforming the cascaded pipeline approach in individual task performance.

From 'Showgirls' to 'Performers': Fine-tuning with Gender-inclusive Language for Bias Reduction in LLMs,"Marion Bartl, Susan Leavy","Gender bias is not only prevalent in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their training data, but also firmly ingrained into the structural aspects of language itself. Therefore, adapting linguistic structures within LLM training data to promote gender-inclusivity can make gender representations within the model more inclusive. The focus of our work are gender-exclusive affixes in English, such as in 'show-girl' or 'man-cave', which can perpetuate gender stereotypes and binary conceptions of gender. We use an LLM training dataset to compile a catalogue of 692 gender-exclusive terms along with gender-neutral variants and from this, develop a gender-inclusive fine-tuning dataset, the 'Tiny Heap'. Fine-tuning three different LLMs with this dataset, we observe an overall reduction in gender-stereotyping tendencies across the models. Our approach provides a practical method for enhancing gender inclusivity in LLM training data and contributes to incorporating queer-feminist linguistic activism in bias mitigation research in NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04434v1,2024-07
Waterfall: Framework for Robust and Scalable Text Watermarking and Provenance for LLMs,"Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, Xinyuan Niu, Hieu Dao, Jiangwei Chen, Chuan-Sheng Foo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","Protecting intellectual property (IP) of text such as articles and code is increasingly important, especially as sophisticated attacks become possible, such as paraphrasing by large language models (LLMs) or even unauthorized training of LLMs on copyrighted text to infringe such IP. However, existing text watermarking methods are not robust enough against such attacks nor scalable to millions of users for practical implementation. In this paper, we propose Waterfall, the first training-free framework for robust and scalable text watermarking applicable across multiple text types (e.g., articles, code) and languages supportable by LLMs, for general text and LLM data provenance. Waterfall comprises several key innovations, such as being the first to use LLM as paraphrasers for watermarking along with a novel combination of techniques that are surprisingly effective in achieving robust verifiability and scalability. We empirically demonstrate that Waterfall achieves significantly better scalability, robust verifiability, and computational efficiency compared to SOTA article-text watermarking methods, and showed how it could be directly applied to the watermarking of code. We also demonstrated that Waterfall can be used for LLM data provenance, where the watermarks of LLM training data can be detected in LLM output, allowing for detection of unauthorized use of data for LLM training and potentially enabling model-centric watermarking of open-sourced LLMs which has been a limitation of existing LLM watermarking works.

Aligning Model Evaluations with Human Preferences: Mitigating Token Count Bias in Language Model Assessments,"Roland Daynauth, Jason Mars","The SLAM paper demonstrated that on-device Small Language Models (SLMs) are a viable and cost-effective alternative to API-based Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4, offering comparable performance and stability. However, SLAM also identified discrepancies between human preferences and traditional auto-evaluators. This follow-up paper explores methods to align LLM evaluator preferences with human evaluations by addressing biases, particularly toward higher token counts. We employed Bayesian statistics and a t-test to quantify this bias and developed a recalibration procedure to adjust the GPTScorer. Our findings significantly improve aligning the recalibrated LLM evaluator with human evaluations across multiple use cases. For instance, spearman's ranking correlation score in the Recommendation use case improved from -27.27 to 44.55. These results highlight the importance of accounting for biases in automated evaluations to ensure fair and accurate model assessments. The recalibration process enhances the reliability of automated evaluators, leading to better AI models that align with human values and expectations. This study provides a robust methodology for future research into bias correction and emphasizes the feasibility and benefits of developing human-aligned AI evaluation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12847v1,2024-07
Romanization Encoding For Multilingual ASR,"Wen Ding, Fei Jia, Hainan Xu, Yu Xi, Junjie Lai, Boris Ginsburg","We introduce romanization encoding for script-heavy languages to optimize multilingual and code-switching Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems.

Our method decouples acoustic modeling and language modeling, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the system. In our study, applying this method to Mandarin-English ASR resulted in a remarkable 63.51% vocabulary reduction and notable performance gains of 13.72% and 15.03% on SEAME code-switching benchmarks.

Identifying the Source of Generation for Large Language Models,"Bumjin Park, Jaesik Choi","Large language models (LLMs) memorize text from several sources of documents. In pretraining, LLM trains to maximize the likelihood of text but neither receives the source of the text nor memorizes the source. Accordingly, LLM can not provide document information on the generated content, and users do not obtain any hint of reliability, which is crucial for factuality or privacy infringement. This work introduces token-level source identification in the decoding step, which maps the token representation to the reference document. We propose a bi-gram source identifier, a multi-layer perceptron with two successive token representations as input for better generalization. We conduct extensive experiments on Wikipedia and PG19 datasets with several LLMs, layer locations, and identifier sizes. The overall results show a possibility of token-level source identifiers for tracing the document, a crucial problem for the safe use of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12846v1,2024-07
SpikeLLM: Scaling up Spiking Neural Network to Large Language Models via Saliency-based Spiking,"Xingrun Xing, Boyan Gao, Zheng Zhang, David A. Clifton, Shitao Xiao, Li Du, Guoqi Li, Jiajun Zhang","The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have significantly boosted their performance across various real-world applications. However, the inference processes for these models require substantial energy and computational resources, presenting considerable deployment challenges. In contrast, human brains, which contain approximately 86 billion biological neurons, exhibit significantly greater energy efficiency compared to LLMs with a similar number of parameters. Inspired by this, we redesign 7 to 70 billion parameter LLMs using bio-plausible spiking mechanisms, emulating the efficient behavior of the human brain. We propose the first spiking large language model as recent LLMs termed SpikeLLM. Coupled with the proposed model, a novel spike-driven quantization framework named Optimal Brain Spiking is introduced to reduce the energy cost and accelerate inference speed via two essential approaches: first (second)-order differentiation-based salient channel detection, and per-channel salient outlier expansion with Generalized Integrate-and-Fire neurons. Our proposed spike-driven quantization can plug in main streams of quantization training methods. In the OmniQuant pipeline, SpikeLLM significantly reduces 25.51% WikiText2 perplexity and improves 3.08% average accuracy of 6 zero-shot datasets on a LLAMA2-7B 4A4W model. In the GPTQ pipeline, SpikeLLM realizes a sparse ternary quantization, which achieves additive in all linear layers. Compared with PB-LLM with similar operations, SpikeLLM also exceeds significantly.

This innovation not only advances transparency in language models but also enhances their effectiveness.

Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses Against Large Language Models: A Survey,"Sibo Yi, Yule Liu, Zhen Sun, Tianshuo Cong, Xinlei He, Jiaxing Song, Ke Xu, Qi Li","Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed exceptionally in various text-generative tasks, including question answering, translation, code completion, etc. However, the over-assistance of LLMs has raised the challenge of ""jailbreaking"", which induces the model to generate malicious responses against the usage policy and society by designing adversarial prompts. With the emergence of jailbreak attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in LLMs, the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolving. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and defense methods. For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box and white-box attacks based on the transparency of the target model. Meanwhile, we classify defense methods into prompt-level and model-level defenses. Additionally, we further subdivide these attack and defense methods into distinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating their relationships. We also conduct an investigation into the current evaluation methods and compare them from different perspectives. Our findings aim to inspire future research and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs against adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains a significant concern within the community, we believe that our work enhances the understanding of this domain and provides a foundation for developing more secure LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04295v2,2024-07
Systematic Evaluation of Online Speaker Diarization Systems Regarding their Latency,"Roman Aperdannier, Sigurd Schacht, Alexander Piazza","In this paper, different online speaker diarization systems are evaluated on the same hardware with the same test data with regard to their latency. The latency is the time span from audio input to the output of the corresponding speaker label. As part of the evaluation, various model combinations within the DIART framework, a diarization system based on the online clustering algorithm UIS-RNN-SML, and the end-to-end online diarization system FS-EEND are compared. The lowest latency is achieved for the DIART-pipeline with the embedding model pyannote/embedding and the segmentation model pyannote/segmentation. The FS-EEND system shows a similarly good latency.

However, few datasets are tailored to L2 learner speech. We publicly release LearnerVoice, a dataset consisting of 50.04 hours of audio and transcriptions of L2 learners' spontaneous speech. Our linguistic analysis reveals that transcriptions in our dataset contain L2S (L2 learner's Spontaneous speech) features, consisting of ungrammatical expressions and disfluencies (e.g., filler words, word repetitions, self-repairs, false starts), significantly more than native speech datasets. Fine-tuning whisper-small.en with LearnerVoice achieves a WER of 10.26%, 44.2% lower than vanilla whisper-small.en.

Unified Interpretation of Smoothing Methods for Negative Sampling Loss Functions in Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Xincan Feng, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Taro Watanabe","Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are fundamental resources in knowledge-intensive tasks in NLP. Due to the limitation of manually creating KGs, KG Completion (KGC) has an important role in automatically completing KGs by scoring their links with KG Embedding (KGE). To handle many entities in training, KGE relies on Negative Sampling (NS) loss that can reduce the computational cost by sampling. Since the appearance frequencies for each link are at most one in KGs, sparsity is an essential and inevitable problem. The NS loss is no exception. As a solution, the NS loss in KGE relies on smoothing methods like Self-Adversarial Negative Sampling (SANS) and subsampling. However, it is uncertain what kind of smoothing method is suitable for this purpose due to the lack of theoretical understanding. This paper provides theoretical interpretations of the smoothing methods for the NS loss in KGE and induces a new NS loss, Triplet Adaptive Negative Sampling (TANS), that can cover the characteristics of the conventional smoothing methods. Experimental results of TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, HAKE, and HousE on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10 datasets and their sparser subsets show the soundness of our interpretation and performance improvement by our TANS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04251v1,2024-07
ArAIEval Shared Task: Propagandistic Techniques Detection in Unimodal and Multimodal Arabic Content,"Maram Hasanain, Md. Arid Hasan, Fatema Ahmed, Reem Suwaileh, Md. Rafiul Biswas, Wajdi Zaghouani, Firoj Alam","We present an overview of the second edition of the ArAIEval shared task, organized as part of the ArabicNLP 2024 conference co-located with ACL 2024. In this edition, ArAIEval offers two tasks: (i) detection of propagandistic textual spans with persuasion techniques identification in tweets and news articles, and (ii) distinguishing between propagandistic and non-propagandistic memes. A total of 14 teams participated in the final evaluation phase, with 6 and 9 teams participating in Tasks 1 and 2, respectively. Finally, 11 teams submitted system description papers. Across both tasks, we observed that fine-tuning transformer models such as AraBERT was at the core of the majority of the participating systems. We provide a description of the task setup, including a description of the dataset construction and the evaluation setup. We further provide a brief overview of the participating systems. All datasets and evaluation scripts are released to the research community (https://araieval.gitlab.io/).

HAF-RM: A Hybrid Alignment Framework for Reward Model Training,"Shujun Liu, Xiaoyu Shen, Yuhang Lai, Siyuan Wang, Shengbin Yue, Zengfeng Huang, Xuanjing Huang, Zhongyu Wei","The reward model has become increasingly important in alignment, assessment, and data construction for large language models (LLMs). Most existing researchers focus on enhancing reward models through data improvements, following the conventional training framework for reward models that directly optimizes the predicted rewards. In this paper, we propose a hybrid alignment framework HaF-RM for reward model training by introducing an additional constraint on token-level policy probabilities in addition to the reward score. It can simultaneously supervise the internal preference model at the token level and optimize the mapping layer of the reward model at the sequence level. Experiment results on five datasets sufficiently show the validity and effectiveness of our proposed hybrid framework for training a high-quality reward model. By decoupling the reward modeling procedure and incorporating hybrid supervision, our HaF-RM framework offers a principled and effective approach to enhancing the performance and alignment of reward models, a critical component in the responsible development of powerful language models. We release our code at https://haf-rm.github.io.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04185v4,2024-07
Seeing Like an AI: How LLMs Apply (and Misapply) Wikipedia Neutrality Norms,"Joshua Ashkinaze, Ruijia Guan, Laura Kurek, Eytan Adar, Ceren Budak, Eric Gilbert","Large language models (LLMs) are trained on broad corpora and then used in communities with specialized norms. Is providing LLMs with community rules enough for models to follow these norms? We evaluate LLMs' capacity to detect (Task 1) and correct (Task 2) biased Wikipedia edits according to Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) policy. LLMs struggled with bias detection, achieving only 64% accuracy on a balanced dataset. Models exhibited contrasting biases (some under- and others over-predicted bias), suggesting distinct priors about neutrality. LLMs performed better at generation, removing 79% of words removed by Wikipedia editors. However, LLMs made additional changes beyond Wikipedia editors' simpler neutralizations, resulting in high-recall but low-precision editing. Interestingly, crowdworkers rated AI rewrites as more neutral (70%) and fluent (61%) than Wikipedia-editor rewrites. Qualitative analysis found LLMs sometimes applied NPOV more comprehensively than Wikipedia editors but often made extraneous non-NPOV-related changes (such as grammar). LLMs may apply rules in ways that resonate with the public but diverge from community experts. While potentially effective for generation, LLMs may reduce editor agency and increase moderation workload (e.g., verifying additions). Even when rules are easy to articulate, having LLMs apply them like community members may still be difficult.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04183v3,2024-07
Orchestrating LLMs with Different Personalizations,"Jin Peng Zhou, Katie Z Luo, Jingwen Gu, Jason Yuan, Kilian Q. Weinberger, Wen Sun","This paper presents a novel approach to aligning large language models (LLMs) with individual human preferences, sometimes referred to as Reinforcement Learning from \textit{Personalized} Human Feedback (RLPHF). Given stated preferences along multiple dimensions, such as helpfulness, conciseness, or humor, the goal is to create an LLM without re-training that best adheres to this specification. Starting from specialized expert LLMs, each trained for one such particular preference dimension, we propose a black-box method that merges their outputs on a per-token level. We train a lightweight Preference Control Model (PCM) that dynamically translates the preference description and current context into next-token prediction weights. By combining the expert models' outputs at the token level, our approach dynamically generates text that optimizes the given preference. Empirical tests show that our method matches or surpasses existing preference merging techniques, providing a scalable, efficient alternative to fine-tuning LLMs for individual personalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04181v1,2024-07
Defense Against Syntactic Textual Backdoor Attacks with Token Substitution,"Xinglin Li, Xianwen He, Yao Li, Minhao Cheng","Textual backdoor attacks present a substantial security risk to Large Language Models (LLM). It embeds carefully chosen triggers into a victim model at the training stage, and makes the model erroneously predict inputs containing the same triggers as a certain class. Prior backdoor defense methods primarily target special token-based triggers, leaving syntax-based triggers insufficiently addressed. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel online defense algorithm that effectively counters syntax-based as well as special token-based backdoor attacks. The algorithm replaces semantically meaningful words in sentences with entirely different ones but preserves the syntactic templates or special tokens, and then compares the predicted labels before and after the substitution to determine whether a sentence contains triggers. Experimental results confirm the algorithm's performance against these two types of triggers, offering a comprehensive defense strategy for model integrity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04179v1,2024-07
Unveiling Scoring Processes: Dissecting the Differences between LLMs and Human Graders in Automatic Scoring,"Xuansheng Wu, Padmaja Pravin Saraf, Gyeong-Geon Lee, Ehsan Latif, Ninghao Liu, Xiaoming Zhai","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in performing automatic scoring for constructed response assessments. While constructed responses graded by humans are usually based on given grading rubrics, the methods by which LLMs assign scores remain largely unclear. It is also uncertain how closely AI's scoring process mirrors that of humans, or if it adheres to the same grading criteria. To address this gap, this paper uncovers the grading rubrics that LLMs used to score students' written responses to science tasks and their alignment with human scores. We also examine whether enhancing the alignments can improve scoring accuracy. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to generate analytic rubrics that they use to assign scores and study the alignment gap with human grading rubrics. Based on a series of experiments with various configurations of LLM settings, we reveal a notable alignment gap between human and LLM graders. While LLMs can adapt quickly to scoring tasks, they often resort to shortcuts, bypassing deeper logical reasoning expected in human grading. We found that incorporating high-quality analytical rubrics designed to reflect human grading logic can mitigate this gap and enhance LLMs' scoring accuracy. These results caution against the simplistic application of LLMs in science education and highlight the importance of aligning LLM outputs with human expectations to ensure efficient and accurate automatic scoring.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18328v1,2024-07
ChartGemma: Visual Instruction-tuning for Chart Reasoning in the Wild,"Ahmed Masry, Megh Thakkar, Aayush Bajaj, Aaryaman Kartha, Enamul Hoque, Shafiq Joty","Given the ubiquity of charts as a data analysis, visualization, and decision-making tool across industries and sciences, there has been a growing interest in developing pre-trained foundation models as well as general purpose instruction-tuned models for chart understanding and reasoning. However, existing methods suffer crucial drawbacks across two critical axes affecting the performance of chart representation models: they are trained on data generated from underlying data tables of the charts, ignoring the visual trends and patterns in chart images, and use weakly aligned vision-language backbone models for domain-specific training, limiting their generalizability when encountering charts in the wild. We address these important drawbacks and introduce ChartGemma, a novel chart understanding and reasoning model developed over PaliGemma. Rather than relying on underlying data tables, ChartGemma is trained on instruction-tuning data generated directly from chart images, thus capturing both high-level trends and low-level visual information from a diverse set of charts. Our simple approach achieves state-of-the-art results across $5$ benchmarks spanning chart summarization, question answering, and fact-checking, and our elaborate qualitative studies on real-world charts show that ChartGemma generates more realistic and factually correct summaries compared to its contemporaries. We release the code, model checkpoints, dataset, and demos at https://github.com/vis-nlp/ChartGemma.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04172v2,2024-07
ELCC: the Emergent Language Corpus Collection,"Brendon Boldt, David Mortensen","We introduce the Emergent Language Corpus Collection (ELCC): a collection of corpora generated from open source implementations of emergent communication systems across the literature. These systems include a variety of signalling game environments as well as more complex environments like a social deduction game and embodied navigation. Each corpus is annotated with metadata describing the characteristics of the source system as well as a suite of analyses of the corpus (e.g., size, entropy, average message length, performance as transfer learning data). Currently, research studying emergent languages requires directly running different systems which takes time away from actual analyses of such languages, makes studies which compare diverse emergent languages rare, and presents a barrier to entry for researchers without a background in deep learning. The availability of a substantial collection of well-documented emergent language corpora, then, will enable research which can analyze a wider variety of emergent languages, which more effectively uncovers general principles in emergent communication rather than artifacts of particular environments. We provide some quantitative and qualitative analyses with ELCC to demonstrate potential use cases of the resource in this vein.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04158v2,2024-07
Securing Multi-turn Conversational Language Models From Distributed Backdoor Triggers,"Terry Tong, Jiashu Xu, Qin Liu, Muhao Chen","Large language models (LLMs) have acquired the ability to handle longer context lengths and understand nuances in text, expanding their dialogue capabilities beyond a single utterance. A popular user-facing application of LLMs is the multi-turn chat setting. Though longer chat memory and better understanding may seemingly benefit users, our paper exposes a vulnerability that leverages the multi-turn feature and strong learning ability of LLMs to harm the end-user: the backdoor. We demonstrate that LLMs can capture the combinational backdoor representation. Only upon presentation of triggers together does the backdoor activate. We also verify empirically that this representation is invariant to the position of the trigger utterance. Subsequently, inserting a single extra token into two utterances of 5%of the data can cause over 99% Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results with 3 triggers demonstrate that this framework is generalizable, compatible with any trigger in an adversary's toolbox in a plug-and-play manner. Defending the backdoor can be challenging in the chat setting because of the large input and output space. Our analysis indicates that the distributed backdoor exacerbates the current challenges by polynomially increasing the dimension of the attacked input space. Canonical textual defenses like ONION and BKI leverage auxiliary model forward passes over individual tokens, scaling exponentially with the input sequence length and struggling to maintain computational feasibility. To this end, we propose a decoding time defense - decayed contrastive decoding - that scales linearly with assistant response sequence length and reduces the backdoor to as low as 0.35%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04151v2,2024-07
Towards Automating Text Annotation: A Case Study on Semantic Proximity Annotation using GPT-4,"Sachin Yadav, Tejaswi Choppa, Dominik Schlechtweg","This paper explores using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to automate the data annotation process with automatic prompting techniques. The main aim of this paper is to reuse human annotation guidelines along with some annotated data to design automatic prompts for LLMs, focusing on the semantic proximity annotation task. Automatic prompts are compared to customized prompts. We further implement the prompting strategies into an open-source text annotation tool, enabling easy online use via the OpenAI API. Our study reveals the crucial role of accurate prompt design and suggests that prompting GPT-4 with human-like instructions is not straightforwardly possible for the semantic proximity task. We show that small modifications to the human guidelines already improve the performance, suggesting possible ways for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04130v1,2024-07
Query-Guided Self-Supervised Summarization of Nursing Notes,"Ya Gao, Hans Moen, Saila Koivusalo, Miika Koskinen, Pekka Marttinen","Nursing notes, an important part of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), track a patient's health during a care episode. Summarizing key information in nursing notes can help clinicians quickly understand patients' conditions. However, existing summarization methods in the clinical setting, especially abstractive methods, have overlooked nursing notes and require reference summaries for training. We introduce QGSumm, a novel query-guided self-supervised domain adaptation approach for abstractive nursing note summarization. The method uses patient-related clinical queries for guidance, and hence does not need reference summaries for training. Through automatic experiments and manual evaluation by an expert clinician, we study our approach and other state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for nursing note summarization. Our experiments show: 1) GPT-4 is competitive in maintaining information in the original nursing notes, 2) QGSumm can generate high-quality summaries with a good balance between recall of the original content and hallucination rate lower than other top methods. Ultimately, our work offers a new perspective on conditional text summarization, tailored to clinical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04125v2,2024-07
Hallucination Detection: Robustly Discerning Reliable Answers in Large Language Models,"Yuyan Chen, Qiang Fu, Yichen Yuan, Zhihao Wen, Ge Fan, Dayiheng Liu, Dongmei Zhang, Zhixu Li, Yanghua Xiao","Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption in various natural language processing tasks, including question answering and dialogue systems. However, a major drawback of LLMs is the issue of hallucination, where they generate unfaithful or inconsistent content that deviates from the input source, leading to severe consequences. In this paper, we propose a robust discriminator named RelD to effectively detect hallucination in LLMs' generated answers. RelD is trained on the constructed RelQA, a bilingual question-answering dialogue dataset along with answers generated by LLMs and a comprehensive set of metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RelD successfully detects hallucination in the answers generated by diverse LLMs. Moreover, it performs well in distinguishing hallucination in LLMs' generated answers from both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets. Additionally, we also conduct a thorough analysis of the types of hallucinations that occur and present valuable insights. This research significantly contributes to the detection of reliable answers generated by LLMs and holds noteworthy implications for mitigating hallucination in the future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04121v1,2024-07
MAPO: Boosting Large Language Model Performance with Model-Adaptive Prompt Optimization,"Yuyan Chen, Zhihao Wen, Ge Fan, Zhengyu Chen, Wei Wu, Dayiheng Liu, Zhixu Li, Bang Liu, Yanghua Xiao","Prompt engineering, as an efficient and effective way to leverage Large Language Models (LLM), has drawn a lot of attention from the research community. The existing research primarily emphasizes the importance of adapting prompts to specific tasks, rather than specific LLMs. However, a good prompt is not solely defined by its wording, but also binds to the nature of the LLM in question. In this work, we first quantitatively demonstrate that different prompts should be adapted to different LLMs to enhance their capabilities across various downstream tasks in NLP. Then we novelly propose a model-adaptive prompt optimizer (MAPO) method that optimizes the original prompts for each specific LLM in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method can effectively refine prompts for an LLM, leading to significant improvements over various downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04118v1,2024-07
Future Events as Backdoor Triggers: Investigating Temporal Vulnerabilities in LLMs,"Sara Price, Arjun Panickssery, Sam Bowman, Asa Cooper Stickland","Backdoors are hidden behaviors that are only triggered once an AI system has been deployed. Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a component of a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving 90% accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04108v3,2024-07
Hadamard Adapter: An Extreme Parameter-Efficient Adapter Tuning Method for Pre-trained Language Models,"Yuyan Chen, Qiang Fu, Ge Fan, Lun Du, Jian-Guang Lou, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang, Zhixu Li, Yanghua Xiao","Recent years, Pre-trained Language models (PLMs) have swept into various fields of artificial intelligence and achieved great success. However, most PLMs, such as T5 and GPT3, have a huge amount of parameters, fine-tuning them is often expensive and time consuming, and storing them takes up a lot of space. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a parameter-efficient approach to reduce parameters of PLMs in fine-tuning without compromising their performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we design a novel adapter which only acts on self-attention outputs in PLMs. This adapter adopts element-wise linear transformation using Hadamard product, hence named as Hadamard adapter, requires the fewest parameters compared to previous parameter-efficient adapters. In addition, we also summarize some tuning patterns for Hadamard adapter shared by various downstream tasks, expecting to provide some guidance for further parameter reduction with shared adapters in future studies. The experiments conducted on the widely-used GLUE benchmark with several SOTA PLMs prove that the Hadamard adapter achieves competitive performance with only 0.033\% parameters compared with full fine-tuning, and it has the fewest parameters compared with other adapters. Moreover, we further find that there is also some redundant layers in the Hadamard adapter which can be removed to achieve more parameter efficiency with only 0.022\% parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11033v1,2024-07

However, previous studies have often been constrained to limited functionalities. This study introduces MiniGPT-Med, a vision-language model derived from large-scale language models and tailored for medical applications. MiniGPT-Med demonstrates remarkable versatility across various imaging modalities, including X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs, enhancing its utility. The model is capable of performing tasks such as medical report generation, visual question answering (VQA), and disease identification within medical imagery. Its integrated processing of both image and textual clinical data markedly improves diagnostic accuracy. Our empirical assessments confirm MiniGPT-Med's superior performance in disease grounding, medical report generation, and VQA benchmarks, representing a significant step towards reducing the gap in assisting radiology practice. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical report generation, higher than the previous best model by 19\% accuracy.

As the popularity of pre-trained language models (PLMs), some recent work makes preliminary attempts to adopt PLMs for humor recognition and generation. However, these simple attempts do not substantially answer the question: {\em whether PLMs are capable of humor understanding?} This paper is the first work that systematically investigates the humor understanding ability of PLMs. For this purpose, a comprehensive framework with three evaluation steps and four evaluation tasks is designed. We also construct a comprehensive Chinese humor dataset, which can fully meet all the data requirements of the proposed evaluation framework.

$\texttt{metabench}$ -- A Sparse Benchmark to Measure General Ability in Large Language Models,"Alex Kipnis, Konstantinos Voudouris, Luca M. Schulze Buschoff, Eric Schulz","Large Language Models (LLMs) vary in their abilities on a range of tasks. Initiatives such as the $\texttt{Open LLM Leaderboard}$ aim to quantify these differences with several large benchmarks (sets of test items to which an LLM can respond either correctly or incorrectly). However, high correlations within and between benchmark scores suggest that (1) there exists a small set of common underlying abilities that these benchmarks measure, and (2) items tap into redundant information and the benchmarks may thus be considerably compressed. We use data from $n > 5000$ LLMs to identify the most informative items of six benchmarks, ARC, GSM8K, HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA and WinoGrande (with $d=28,632$ items in total). From them we distill a sparse benchmark, $\texttt{metabench}$, that has less than $3\%$ of the original size of all six benchmarks combined. This new sparse benchmark goes beyond point scores by yielding estimators of the underlying benchmark-specific abilities. We show that these estimators (1) can be used to reconstruct each original $\textit{individual}$ benchmark score with, on average, $1.5\%$ root mean square error (RMSE), (2) reconstruct the original $\textit{total}$ score with $0.8\%$ RMSE, and (3) have a single underlying common factor whose Spearman correlation with the total score is $r = 0.93$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12844v1,2024-07

DotaMath: Decomposition of Thought with Code Assistance and Self-correction for Mathematical Reasoning,"Chengpeng Li, Guanting Dong, Mingfeng Xue, Ru Peng, Xiang Wang, Dayiheng Liu","Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive progress in handling simple math problems, yet they still struggle with more challenging and complex mathematical tasks. In this paper, we introduce a series of LLMs that employs the Decomposition of thought with code assistance and self-correction for mathematical reasoning, dubbed as DotaMath. DotaMath models tackle complex mathematical tasks by decomposing them into simpler logical subtasks, leveraging code to solve these subtasks, obtaining fine-grained feedback from the code interpreter, and engaging in self-reflection and correction. By annotating diverse interactive tool-use trajectories and employing query evolution on GSM8K and MATH datasets, we generate an instruction fine-tuning dataset called DotaMathQA with 574K query-response pairs. We train a series of base LLMs using imitation learning on DotaMathQA, resulting in DotaMath models that achieve remarkable performance compared to open-source LLMs across various in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Notably, DotaMath-deepseek-7B showcases an outstanding performance of 64.8% on the competitive MATH dataset and 86.7% on GSM8K. Besides, DotaMath-deepseek-7B maintains strong competitiveness on a series of in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (Avg. 80.1%).

Semantic Graphs for Syntactic Simplification: A Revisit from the Age of LLM,"Peiran Yao, Kostyantyn Guzhva, Denilson Barbosa","Symbolic sentence meaning representations, such as AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation) provide expressive and structured semantic graphs that act as intermediates that simplify downstream NLP tasks. However, the instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) offers a shortcut to effectively solve NLP tasks, questioning the utility of semantic graphs. Meanwhile, recent work has also shown the difficulty of using meaning representations merely as a helpful auxiliary for LLMs. We revisit the position of semantic graphs in syntactic simplification, the task of simplifying sentence structures while preserving their meaning, which requires semantic understanding, and evaluate it on a new complex and natural dataset. The AMR-based method that we propose, AMRS$^3$, demonstrates that state-of-the-art meaning representations can lead to easy-to-implement simplification methods with competitive performance and unique advantages in cost, interpretability, and generalization. With AMRS$^3$ as an anchor, we discover that syntactic simplification is a task where semantic graphs are helpful in LLM prompting. We propose AMRCoC prompting that guides LLMs to emulate graph algorithms for explicit symbolic reasoning on AMR graphs, and show its potential for improving LLM on semantic-centered tasks like syntactic simplification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04067v1,2024-07
Deep Content Understanding Toward Entity and Aspect Target Sentiment Analysis on Foundation Models,"Vorakit Vorakitphan, Milos Basic, Guilhaume Leroy Meline","Introducing Entity-Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (EASTE), a novel Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task which extends Target-Aspect-Sentiment Detection (TASD) by separating aspect categories (e.g., food#quality) into pre-defined entities (e.g., meal, drink) and aspects (e.g., taste, freshness) which add a fine-gainer level of complexity, yet help exposing true sentiment of chained aspect to its entity.

Improving Accented Speech Recognition using Data Augmentation based on Unsupervised Text-to-Speech Synthesis,"Cong-Thanh Do, Shuhei Imai, Rama Doddipatla, Thomas Hain","This paper investigates the use of unsupervised text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) as a data augmentation method to improve accented speech recognition. TTS systems are trained with a small amount of accented speech training data and their pseudo-labels rather than manual transcriptions, and hence unsupervised. This approach enables the use of accented speech data without manual transcriptions to perform data augmentation for accented speech recognition. Synthetic accented speech data, generated from text prompts by using the TTS systems, are then combined with available non-accented speech data to train automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. ASR experiments are performed in a self-supervised learning framework using a Wav2vec2.0 model which was pre-trained on large amount of unsupervised accented speech data. The accented speech data for training the unsupervised TTS are read speech, selected from L2-ARCTIC and British Isles corpora, while spontaneous conversational speech from the Edinburgh international accents of English corpus are used as the evaluation data. Experimental results show that Wav2vec2.0 models which are fine-tuned to downstream ASR task with synthetic accented speech data, generated by the unsupervised TTS, yield up to 6.1% relative word error rate reductions compared to a Wav2vec2.0 baseline which is fine-tuned with the non-accented speech data from Librispeech corpus.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04047v1,2024-07
Systematic Task Exploration with LLMs: A Study in Citation Text Generation,"Furkan Şahinuç, Ilia Kuznetsov, Yufang Hou, Iryna Gurevych","Large language models (LLMs) bring unprecedented flexibility in defining and executing complex, creative natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Yet, this flexibility brings new challenges, as it introduces new degrees of freedom in formulating the task inputs and instructions and in evaluating model performance. To facilitate the exploration of creative NLG tasks, we propose a three-component research framework that consists of systematic input manipulation, reference data, and output measurement. We use this framework to explore citation text generation -- a popular scholarly NLP task that lacks consensus on the task definition and evaluation metric and has not yet been tackled within the LLM paradigm. Our results highlight the importance of systematically investigating both task instruction and input configuration when prompting LLMs, and reveal non-trivial relationships between different evaluation metrics used for citation text generation. Additional human generation and human evaluation experiments provide new qualitative insights into the task to guide future research in citation text generation.

LLMAEL: Large Language Models are Good Context Augmenters for Entity Linking,"Amy Xin, Yunjia Qi, Zijun Yao, Fangwei Zhu, Kaisheng Zeng, Xu Bin, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li","Entity Linking (EL) models are well-trained at mapping mentions to their corresponding entities according to a given context. However, EL models struggle to disambiguate long-tail entities due to their limited training data. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) are more robust at interpreting uncommon mentions. Yet, due to a lack of specialized training, LLMs suffer at generating correct entity IDs. Furthermore, training an LLM to perform EL is cost-intensive. Building upon these insights, we introduce LLM-Augmented Entity Linking LLMAEL, a plug-and-play approach to enhance entity linking through LLM data augmentation. We leverage LLMs as knowledgeable context augmenters, generating mention-centered descriptions as additional input, while preserving traditional EL models for task specific processing. Experiments on 6 standard datasets show that the vanilla LLMAEL outperforms baseline EL models in most cases, while the fine-tuned LLMAEL set the new state-of-the-art results across all 6 benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04020v2,2024-07
"Exploring Diachronic and Diatopic Changes in Dialect Continua: Tasks, Datasets and Challenges","Melis Çelikkol, Lydia Körber, Wei Zhao","Everlasting contact between language communities leads to constant changes in languages over time, and gives rise to language varieties and dialects. However, the communities speaking non-standard language are often overlooked by non-inclusive NLP technologies. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in studying diatopic and diachronic changes in dialect NLP, but there is currently no research exploring the intersection of both. Our work aims to fill this gap by systematically reviewing diachronic and diatopic papers from a unified perspective. In this work, we critically assess nine tasks and datasets across five dialects from three language families (Slavic, Romance, and Germanic) in both spoken and written modalities. The tasks covered are diverse, including corpus construction, dialect distance estimation, and dialect geolocation prediction, among others. Moreover, we outline five open challenges regarding changes in dialect use over time, the reliability of dialect datasets, the importance of speaker characteristics, limited coverage of dialects, and ethical considerations in data collection. We hope that our work sheds light on future research towards inclusive computational methods and datasets for language varieties and dialects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04010v1,2024-07
Unlocking the Potential of Model Merging for Low-Resource Languages,"Mingxu Tao, Chen Zhang, Quzhe Huang, Tianyao Ma, Songfang Huang, Dongyan Zhao, Yansong Feng","Adapting large language models (LLMs) to new languages typically involves continual pre-training (CT) followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, this CT-then-SFT approach struggles with limited data in the context of low-resource languages, failing to balance language modeling and task-solving capabilities. We thus propose model merging as an alternative for low-resource languages, combining models with distinct capabilities into a single model without additional training. We use model merging to develop task-solving LLMs for low-resource languages without SFT data in the target languages. Our experiments based on Llama-2-7B demonstrate that model merging effectively endows LLMs for low-resource languages with task-solving abilities, outperforming CT-then-SFT in scenarios with extremely scarce data. Observing performance saturation in model merging with more training tokens, we further analyze the merging process and introduce a slack variable to the model merging algorithm to mitigate the loss of important parameters, thereby enhancing performance. We hope that model merging can benefit more human languages suffering from data scarcity with its higher data efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03994v3,2024-07
A Survey on Natural Language Counterfactual Generation,"Yongjie Wang, Xiaoqi Qiu, Yu Yue, Xu Guo, Zhiwei Zeng, Yuhong Feng, Zhiqi Shen","Natural language counterfactual generation aims to minimally modify a given text such that the modified text will be classified into a different class. The generated counterfactuals provide insight into the reasoning behind a model's predictions by highlighting which words significantly influence the outcomes. Additionally, they can be used to detect model fairness issues and augment the training data to enhance the model's robustness. A substantial amount of research has been conducted to generate counterfactuals for various NLP tasks, employing different models and methodologies. With the rapid growth of studies in this field, a systematic review is crucial to guide future researchers and developers. To bridge this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of textual counterfactual generation methods, particularly those based on Large Language Models. We propose a new taxonomy that systematically categorizes the generation methods into four groups and summarizes the metrics for evaluating the generation quality. Finally, we discuss ongoing research challenges and outline promising directions for future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03993v2,2024-07
NutriBench: A Dataset for Evaluating Large Language Models on Nutrition Estimation from Meal Descriptions,"Andong Hua, Mehak Preet Dhaliwal, Ryan Burke, Laya Pullela, Yao Qin","Accurate nutrition estimation helps people make informed dietary choices and is essential in the prevention of serious health complications. We present NutriBench, the first publicly available natural language meal description nutrition benchmark. NutriBench consists of 11,857 meal descriptions generated from real-world global dietary intake data. The data is human-verified and annotated with macro-nutrient labels, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. We conduct an extensive evaluation of NutriBench on the task of carbohydrate estimation, testing twelve leading Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Llama3.1, Qwen2, Gemma2, and OpenBioLLM models, using standard, Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation strategies. Additionally, we present a study involving professional nutritionists, finding that LLMs can provide more accurate and faster estimates. Finally, we perform a real-world risk assessment by simulating the effect of carbohydrate predictions on the blood glucose levels of individuals with diabetes. Our work highlights the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs for nutrition estimation, demonstrating their potential to aid professionals and laypersons and improve health outcomes.

Benchmarking Complex Instruction-Following with Multiple Constraints Composition,"Bosi Wen, Pei Ke, Xiaotao Gu, Lindong Wu, Hao Huang, Jinfeng Zhou, Wenchuang Li, Binxin Hu, Wendy Gao, Jiaxin Xu, Yiming Liu, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang","Instruction following is one of the fundamental capabilities of large language models (LLMs). As the ability of LLMs is constantly improving, they have been increasingly applied to deal with complex human instructions in real-world scenarios. Therefore, how to evaluate the ability of complex instruction-following of LLMs has become a critical research problem. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on modeling different types of constraints in human instructions while neglecting the composition of different constraints, which is an indispensable constituent in complex instructions. To this end, we propose ComplexBench, a benchmark for comprehensively evaluating the ability of LLMs to follow complex instructions composed of multiple constraints. We propose a hierarchical taxonomy for complex instructions, including 4 constraint types, 19 constraint dimensions, and 4 composition types, and manually collect a high-quality dataset accordingly. To make the evaluation reliable, we augment LLM-based evaluators with rules to effectively verify whether generated texts can satisfy each constraint and composition. Furthermore, we obtain the final evaluation score based on the dependency structure determined by different composition types. ComplexBench identifies significant deficiencies in existing LLMs when dealing with complex instructions with multiple constraints composition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03978v3,2024-07
LLM Roleplay: Simulating Human-Chatbot Interaction,"Hovhannes Tamoyan, Hendrik Schuff, Iryna Gurevych","The development of chatbots requires collecting a large number of human-chatbot dialogues to reflect the breadth of users' sociodemographic backgrounds and conversational goals. However, the resource requirements to conduct the respective user studies can be prohibitively high and often only allow for a narrow analysis of specific dialogue goals and participant demographics. In this paper, we propose LLM Roleplay: a goal-oriented, persona-based method to automatically generate diverse multi-turn dialogues simulating human-chatbot interaction. LLM Roleplay can be applied to generate dialogues with any type of chatbot and uses large language models (LLMs) to play the role of textually described personas. To validate our method, we collect natural human-chatbot dialogues from different sociodemographic groups and conduct a user study to compare these with our generated dialogues. We evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in maintaining a conversation during their embodiment of a specific persona and find that our method can simulate human-chatbot dialogues with a high indistinguishability rate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03974v2,2024-07
Investigating the Role of Instruction Variety and Task Difficulty in Robotic Manipulation Tasks,"Amit Parekh, Nikolas Vitsakis, Alessandro Suglia, Ioannis Konstas","Evaluating the generalisation capabilities of multimodal models based solely on their performance on out-of-distribution data fails to capture their true robustness. This work introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework that systematically examines the role of instructions and inputs in the generalisation abilities of such models, considering architectural design, input perturbations across language and vision modalities, and increased task complexity. The proposed framework uncovers the resilience of multimodal models to extreme instruction perturbations and their vulnerability to observational changes, raising concerns about overfitting to spurious correlations. By employing this evaluation framework on current Transformer-based multimodal models for robotic manipulation tasks, we uncover limitations and suggest future advancements should focus on architectural and training innovations that better integrate multimodal inputs, enhancing a model's generalisation prowess by prioritising sensitivity to input content over incidental correlations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03967v2,2024-07
Improving Sample Efficiency of Reinforcement Learning with Background Knowledge from Large Language Models,"Fuxiang Zhang, Junyou Li, Yi-Chen Li, Zongzhang Zhang, Yang Yu, Deheng Ye","Low sample efficiency is an enduring challenge of reinforcement learning (RL). With the advent of versatile large language models (LLMs), recent works impart common-sense knowledge to accelerate policy learning for RL processes. However, we note that such guidance is often tailored for one specific task but loses generalizability. In this paper, we introduce a framework that harnesses LLMs to extract background knowledge of an environment, which contains general understandings of the entire environment, making various downstream RL tasks benefit from one-time knowledge representation. We ground LLMs by feeding a few pre-collected experiences and requesting them to delineate background knowledge of the environment. Afterward, we represent the output knowledge as potential functions for potential-based reward shaping, which has a good property for maintaining policy optimality from task rewards. We instantiate three variants to prompt LLMs for background knowledge, including writing code, annotating preferences, and assigning goals. Our experiments show that these methods achieve significant sample efficiency improvements in a spectrum of downstream tasks from Minigrid and Crafter domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03964v1,2024-07

Stark: Social Long-Term Multi-Modal Conversation with Persona Commonsense Knowledge,"Young-Jun Lee, Dokyong Lee, Junyoung Youn, Kyeongjin Oh, Byungsoo Ko, Jonghwan Hyeon, Ho-Jin Choi","Humans share a wide variety of images related to their personal experiences within conversations via instant messaging tools. However, existing works focus on (1) image-sharing behavior in singular sessions, leading to limited long-term social interaction, and (2) a lack of personalized image-sharing behavior. In this work, we introduce Stark, a large-scale long-term multi-modal conversation dataset that covers a wide range of social personas in a multi-modality format, time intervals, and images. To construct Stark automatically, we propose a novel multi-modal contextualization framework, Mcu, that generates long-term multi-modal dialogue distilled from ChatGPT and our proposed Plan-and-Execute image aligner. Using our Stark, we train a multi-modal conversation model, Ultron 7B, which demonstrates impressive visual imagination ability.

Solving Zebra Puzzles Using Constraint-Guided Multi-Agent Systems,"Shmuel Berman, Kathleen McKeown, Baishakhi Ray","Prior research has enhanced the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve logic puzzles using techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting or introducing a symbolic representation. These frameworks are still usually insufficient to solve complicated logical problems, such as Zebra puzzles, due to the inherent complexity of translating natural language clues into logical statements. We introduce a multi-agent system, ZPS, that integrates LLMs with an off the shelf theorem prover. This system tackles the complex puzzle-solving task by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts, generating SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) code to solve them with a theorem prover, and using feedback between the agents to repeatedly improve their answers. We also introduce an automated grid puzzle grader to assess the correctness of our puzzle solutions and show that the automated grader is reliable by evaluating it in a user-study. Our approach shows improvement in all three LLMs we tested, with GPT-4 showing 166% improvement in the number of fully correct solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03956v2,2024-07
Meta-prompting Optimized Retrieval-augmented Generation,"João Rodrigues, António Branco","Retrieval-augmented generation resorts to content retrieved from external sources in order to leverage the performance of large language models in downstream tasks. The excessive volume of retrieved content, the possible dispersion of its parts, or their out of focus range may happen nevertheless to eventually have a detrimental rather than an incremental effect. To mitigate this issue and improve retrieval-augmented generation, we propose a method to refine the retrieved content before it is included in the prompt by resorting to meta-prompting optimization. Put to empirical test with the demanding multi-hop question answering task from the StrategyQA dataset, the evaluation results indicate that this method outperforms a similar retrieval-augmented system but without this method by over 30%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03955v1,2024-07
A framework for annotating and modelling intentions behind metaphor use,"Gianluca Michelli, Xiaoyu Tong, Ekaterina Shutova","Metaphors are part of everyday language and shape the way in which we conceptualize the world. Moreover, they play a multifaceted role in communication, making their understanding and generation a challenging task for language models (LMs). While there has been extensive work in the literature linking metaphor to the fulfilment of individual intentions, no comprehensive taxonomy of such intentions, suitable for natural language processing (NLP) applications, is available to present day. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of intentions commonly attributed to metaphor, which comprises 9 categories. We also release the first dataset annotated for intentions behind metaphor use. Finally, we use this dataset to test the capability of large language models (LLMs) in inferring the intentions behind metaphor use, in zero- and in-context few-shot settings. Our experiments show that this is still a challenge for LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03952v1,2024-07
Diverse and Fine-Grained Instruction-Following Ability Exploration with Synthetic Data,"Zihui Gu, Xingwu Sun, Fengzong Lian, Zhanhui Kang, Cheng-Zhong Xu, Ju Fan","Instruction-following is particularly crucial for large language models (LLMs) to support diverse user requests. While existing work has made progress in aligning LLMs with human preferences, evaluating their capabilities on instruction following remains a challenge due to complexity and diversity of real-world user instructions. While existing evaluation methods focus on general skills, they suffer from two main shortcomings, i.e., lack of fine-grained task-level evaluation and reliance on singular instruction expression. To address these problems, this paper introduces DINGO, a fine-grained and diverse instruction-following evaluation dataset that has two main advantages: (1) DINGO is based on a manual annotated, fine-grained and multi-level category tree with 130 nodes derived from real-world user requests; (2) DINGO includes diverse instructions, generated by both GPT-4 and human experts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DINGO can not only provide more challenging and comprehensive evaluation for LLMs, but also provide task-level fine-grained directions to further improve LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03942v1,2024-07
Narrow Transformer: StarCoder-Based Java-LM For Desktop,"Kamalkumar Rathinasamy, Balaji A J, Ankush Kumar, Gagan Gayari, Harshini K, Rajab Ali Mondal, Sreenivasa Raghavan K S, Swayam Singh, Mohammed Rafee Tarafdar","This paper presents NT-Java-1.1B, an open-source specialized code language model built on StarCoderBase-1.1B, designed for coding tasks in Java programming. NT-Java-1.1B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing its base model and majority of other models of similar size on MultiPL-E Java code benchmark. While there have been studies on extending large, generic pre-trained models to improve proficiency in specific programming languages like Python, similar investigations on small code models for other programming languages are lacking. Large code models require specialized hardware like GPUs for inference, highlighting the need for research into building small code models that can be deployed on developer desktops. This paper addresses this research gap by focusing on the development of a small Java code model, NT-Java-1.1B, and its quantized versions, which performs comparably to open models around 1.1B on MultiPL-E Java code benchmarks, making them ideal for desktop deployment.

MS2SL: Multimodal Spoken Data-Driven Continuous Sign Language Production,"Jian Ma, Wenguan Wang, Yi Yang, Feng Zheng","Sign language understanding has made significant strides; however, there is still no viable solution for generating sign sequences directly from entire spoken content, e.g., text or speech. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for continuous sign language production, easing communication between sign and non-sign language users. In particular, a sequence diffusion model, utilizing embeddings extracted from text or speech, is crafted to generate sign predictions step by step. Moreover, by creating a joint embedding space for text, audio, and sign, we bind these modalities and leverage the semantic consistency among them to provide informative feedback for the model training. This embedding-consistency learning strategy minimizes the reliance on sign triplets and ensures continuous model refinement, even with a missing audio modality. Experiments on How2Sign and PHOENIX14T datasets demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in sign language production.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12842v1,2024-07
TongGu: Mastering Classical Chinese Understanding with Knowledge-Grounded Large Language Models,"Jiahuan Cao, Dezhi Peng, Peirong Zhang, Yongxin Shi, Yang Liu, Kai Ding, Lianwen Jin","Classical Chinese is a gateway to the rich heritage and wisdom of ancient China, yet its complexities pose formidable comprehension barriers for most modern people without specialized knowledge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), they struggle with Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU), especially in data-demanding and knowledge-intensive tasks. In response to this dilemma, we propose \textbf{TongGu} (mean understanding ancient and modern), the first CCU-specific LLM, underpinned by three core contributions. First, we construct a two-stage instruction-tuning dataset ACCN-INS derived from rich classical Chinese corpora, aiming to unlock the full CCU potential of LLMs. Second, we propose Redundancy-Aware Tuning (RAT) to prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling TongGu to acquire new capabilities while preserving its foundational knowledge. Third, we present a CCU Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CCU-RAG) technique to reduce hallucinations based on knowledge-grounding. Extensive experiments across 24 diverse CCU tasks validate TongGu's superior ability, underscoring the effectiveness of RAT and CCU-RAG.

Entity-Level Sentiment: More than the Sum of Its Parts,"Egil Rønningstad, Roman Klinger, Lilja Øvrelid, Erik Velldal","In sentiment analysis of longer texts, there may be a variety of topics discussed, of entities mentioned, and of sentiments expressed regarding each entity. We find a lack of studies exploring how such texts express their sentiment towards each entity of interest, and how these sentiments can be modelled. In order to better understand how sentiment regarding persons and organizations (each entity in our scope) is expressed in longer texts, we have collected a dataset of expert annotations where the overall sentiment regarding each entity is identified, together with the sentence-level sentiment for these entities separately. We show that the reader's perceived sentiment regarding an entity often differs from an arithmetic aggregation of sentiments at the sentence level. Only 70\% of the positive and 55\% of the negative entities receive a correct overall sentiment label when we aggregate the (human-annotated) sentiment labels for the sentences where the entity is mentioned. Our dataset reveals the complexity of entity-specific sentiment in longer texts, and allows for more precise modelling and evaluation of such sentiment expressions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03916v2,2024-07
Black-box Model Ensembling for Textual and Visual Question Answering via Information Fusion,"Yuxi Xia, Kilm Zaporojets, Benjamin Roth","A diverse range of large language models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, and visual question answering (VQA) models, e.g., BLIP, have been developed for solving textual and visual question answering tasks. However, fine-tuning these models is either difficult, as it requires access via APIs, rendering them as black-boxes, or costly due to the need of tuning a large number of parameters. To address this, we introduce InfoSel, a data-efficient ensemble method that learns to dynamically pick the winner from existing black-box models for predictions on both textual and multimodal visual question answering tasks. Unlike traditional ensemble models, InfoSel does not rely on prediction probabilities or confidences, which typically are not available in black-box models.

Scoping Review of Active Learning Strategies and their Evaluation Environments for Entity Recognition Tasks,"Philipp Kohl, Yoka Krämer, Claudia Fohry, Bodo Kraft","We conducted a scoping review for active learning in the domain of natural language processing (NLP), which we summarize in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR guidelines as follows:   Objective: Identify active learning strategies that were proposed for entity recognition and their evaluation environments (datasets, metrics, hardware, execution time). Design: We used Scopus and ACM as our search engines. We compared the results with two literature surveys to assess the search quality. We included peer-reviewed English publications introducing or comparing active learning strategies for entity recognition. Results: We analyzed 62 relevant papers and identified 106 active learning strategies. We grouped them into three categories: exploitation-based (60x), exploration-based (14x), and hybrid strategies (32x). We found that all studies used the F1-score as an evaluation metric. Information about hardware (6x) and execution time (13x) was only occasionally included. The 62 papers used 57 different datasets to evaluate their respective strategies. Most datasets contained newspaper articles or biomedical/medical data. Our analysis revealed that 26 out of 57 datasets are publicly accessible.   Conclusion: Numerous active learning strategies have been identified, along with significant open questions that still need to be addressed. Researchers and practitioners face difficulties when making data-driven decisions about which active learning strategy to adopt.

Automated Progressive Red Teaming,"Bojian Jiang, Yi Jing, Tianhao Shen, Tong Wu, Qing Yang, Deyi Xiong","Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is paramount, yet identifying potential vulnerabilities is challenging. While manual red teaming is effective, it is time-consuming, costly and lacks scalability. Automated red teaming (ART) offers a more cost-effective alternative, automatically generating adversarial prompts to expose LLM vulnerabilities. However, in current ART efforts, a robust framework is absent, which explicitly frames red teaming as an effectively learnable task. To address this gap, we propose Automated Progressive Red Teaming (APRT) as an effectively learnable framework. APRT leverages three core modules: an Intention Expanding LLM that generates diverse initial attack samples, an Intention Hiding LLM that crafts deceptive prompts, and an Evil Maker to manage prompt diversity and filter ineffective samples. The three modules collectively and progressively explore and exploit LLM vulnerabilities through multi-round interactions. In addition to the framework, we further propose a novel indicator, Attack Effectiveness Rate (AER) to mitigate the limitations of existing evaluation metrics. By measuring the likelihood of eliciting unsafe but seemingly helpful responses, AER aligns closely with human evaluations. Extensive experiments with both automatic and human evaluations, demonstrate the effectiveness of ARPT across both open- and closed-source LLMs. Specifically, APRT effectively elicits 54% unsafe yet useful responses from Meta's Llama-3-8B-Instruct, 50% from GPT-4o (API access), and 39% from Claude-3.5 (API access), showcasing its robust attack capability and transferability across LLMs (especially from open-source LLMs to closed-source LLMs).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03876v3,2024-07

We implemented a conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive solution to both subtasks. We trained adapter-based binary classification models to match glosses with usage examples and leveraged the probability output of the models to identify novel senses. The same models were used to match examples of novel sense usages with Wiktionary definitions.

Anthropocentric bias and the possibility of artificial cognition,"Raphaël Millière, Charles Rathkopf","Evaluating the cognitive capacities of large language models (LLMs) requires overcoming not only anthropomorphic but also anthropocentric biases. This article identifies two types of anthropocentric bias that have been neglected: overlooking how auxiliary factors can impede LLM performance despite competence (Type-I), and dismissing LLM mechanistic strategies that differ from those of humans as not genuinely competent (Type-II). Mitigating these biases necessitates an empirically-driven, iterative approach to mapping cognitive tasks to LLM-specific capacities and mechanisms, which can be done by supplementing carefully designed behavioral experiments with mechanistic studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03859v1,2024-07

For automatic open-domain dialogue evaluation in particular, LLMs have been seamlessly integrated into evaluation frameworks, and together with human evaluation, compose the backbone of most evaluations. However, existing evaluation benchmarks often rely on outdated datasets and evaluate aspects like Fluency and Relevance, which fail to adequately capture the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art chatbot models.   This paper critically examines current evaluation benchmarks, highlighting that the use of older response generators and quality aspects fail to accurately reflect modern chatbot capabilities. A small annotation experiment on a recent LLM-generated dataset (SODA) reveals that LLM evaluators such as GPT-4 struggle to detect actual deficiencies in dialogues generated by current LLM chatbots.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03841v1,2024-07
ConText at WASSA 2024 Empathy and Personality Shared Task: History-Dependent Embedding Utterance Representations for Empathy and Emotion Prediction in Conversations,"Patrícia Pereira, Helena Moniz, Joao Paulo Carvalho","Empathy and emotion prediction are key components in the development of effective and empathetic agents, amongst several other applications. The WASSA shared task on empathy and emotion prediction in interactions presents an opportunity to benchmark approaches to these tasks. Appropriately selecting and representing the historical context is crucial in the modelling of empathy and emotion in conversations. In our submissions, we model empathy, emotion polarity and emotion intensity of each utterance in a conversation by feeding the utterance to be classified together with its conversational context, i.e., a certain number of previous conversational turns, as input to an encoder Pre-trained Language Model, to which we append a regression head for prediction. We also model perceived counterparty empathy of each interlocutor by feeding all utterances from the conversation and a token identifying the interlocutor for which we are predicting the empathy. Our system officially ranked $1^{st}$ at the CONV-turn track and $2^{nd}$ at the CONV-dialog track.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03818v1,2024-07
Finetuning End-to-End Models for Estonian Conversational Spoken Language Translation,"Tiia Sildam, Andra Velve, Tanel Alumäe","This paper investigates the finetuning of end-to-end models for bidirectional Estonian-English and Estonian-Russian conversational speech-to-text translation. Due to the limited availability of speech translation data for Estonian, we created additional training data by web scraping and synthesizing data from speech recognition datasets using machine translation. We evaluated three publicly available end-to-end models: Whisper, OWSM 3.1, and SeamlessM4T. Our results indicate that fine-tuning with synthetic data enhances translation accuracy by a large margin, with SeamlessM4T matching or surpassing cascaded speech translation systems that use state-of-the-art speech recognition and machine translation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03809v1,2024-07
Cognitive Modeling with Scaffolded LLMs: A Case Study of Referential Expression Generation,"Polina Tsvilodub, Michael Franke, Fausto Carcassi","To what extent can LLMs be used as part of a cognitive model of language generation? In this paper, we approach this question by exploring a neuro-symbolic implementation of an algorithmic cognitive model of referential expression generation by Dale & Reiter (1995). The symbolic task analysis implements the generation as an iterative procedure that scaffolds symbolic and gpt-3.5-turbo-based modules. We compare this implementation to an ablated model and a one-shot LLM-only baseline on the A3DS dataset (Tsvilodub & Franke, 2023). We find that our hybrid approach is cognitively plausible and performs well in complex contexts, while allowing for more open-ended modeling of language generation in a larger domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03805v2,2024-07
M5 -- A Diverse Benchmark to Assess the Performance of Large Multimodal Models Across Multilingual and Multicultural Vision-Language Tasks,"Florian Schneider, Sunayana Sitaram","Since the release of ChatGPT, the field of Natural Language Processing has experienced rapid advancements, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs often exhibit significant performance disparities across different languages and cultural contexts, as demonstrated by various text-only benchmarks. However, current research lacks such benchmarks for multimodal visio-linguistic settings. This work fills this gap by introducing M5, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LMMs on diverse vision-language tasks within a multilingual and multicultural context. M5 includes eight datasets covering five tasks and $41$ languages, with a focus on underrepresented languages and culturally diverse images. Furthermore, we introduce two novel datasets, M5-VGR and M5-VLOD, including a new Visio-Linguistic Outlier Detection task, in which all evaluated open-source models fail to significantly surpass the random baseline. Through extensive evaluation and analyses, we highlight substantial task-agnostic performance disparities between high- and low-resource languages. Moreover, we show that larger models do not necessarily outperform smaller ones in a multilingual setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03791v2,2024-07
MAMA: Meta-optimized Angular Margin Contrastive Framework for Video-Language Representation Learning,"Thong Nguyen, Yi Bin, Xiaobao Wu, Xinshuai Dong, Zhiyuan Hu, Khoi Le, Cong-Duy Nguyen, See-Kiong Ng, Luu Anh Tuan","Data quality stands at the forefront of deciding the effectiveness of video-language representation learning. However, video-text pairs in previous data typically do not align perfectly with each other, which might lead to video-language representations that do not accurately reflect cross-modal semantics. Moreover, previous data also possess an uneven distribution of concepts, thereby hampering the downstream performance across unpopular subjects. To address these problems, we propose MAMA, a new approach to learning video-language representations by utilizing a contrastive objective with a subtractive angular margin to regularize cross-modal representations in their effort to reach perfect similarity. Furthermore, to adapt to the non-uniform concept distribution, MAMA utilizes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-parameterized weighting function that maps loss values to sample weights which enable dynamic adjustment of the model's focus throughout the training. With the training guided by a small amount of unbiased meta-data and augmented by video-text data generated by large vision-language model, MAMA improves video-language representations and achieve superior performances on commonly used video question answering and text-video retrieval datasets.

Functional Faithfulness in the Wild: Circuit Discovery with Differentiable Computation Graph Pruning,"Lei Yu, Jingcheng Niu, Zining Zhu, Gerald Penn","In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive reformulation of the task known as Circuit Discovery, along with DiscoGP, a novel and effective algorithm based on differentiable masking for discovering circuits. Circuit discovery is the task of interpreting the computational mechanisms of language models (LMs) by dissecting their functions and capabilities into sparse subnetworks (circuits). We identified two major limitations in existing circuit discovery efforts: (1) a dichotomy between weight-based and connection-edge-based approaches forces researchers to choose between pruning connections or weights, thereby limiting the scope of mechanistic interpretation of LMs; (2) algorithms based on activation patching tend to identify circuits that are neither functionally faithful nor complete. The performance of these identified circuits is substantially reduced, often resulting in near-random performance in isolation. Furthermore, the complement of the circuit -- i.e., the original LM with the identified circuit removed -- still retains adequate performance, indicating that essential components of a complete circuits are missed by existing methods.   DiscoGP successfully addresses the two aforementioned issues and demonstrates state-of-the-art faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity. The effectiveness of the algorithm and its novel structure open up new avenues of gathering new insights into the internal workings of generative AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03779v1,2024-07
From Data to Commonsense Reasoning: The Use of Large Language Models for Explainable AI,"Stefanie Krause, Frieder Stolzenburg","Commonsense reasoning is a difficult task for a computer, but a critical skill for an artificial intelligence (AI). It can enhance the explainability of AI models by enabling them to provide intuitive and human-like explanations for their decisions. This is necessary in many areas especially in question answering (QA), which is one of the most important tasks of natural language processing (NLP). Over time, a multitude of methods have emerged for solving commonsense reasoning problems such as knowledge-based approaches using formal logic or linguistic analysis. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) on different QA tasks with a focus on their abilities in reasoning and explainability. We study three LLMs: GPT-3.5, Gemma and Llama 3. We further evaluate the LLM results by means of a questionnaire. We demonstrate the ability of LLMs to reason with commonsense as the models outperform humans on different datasets. While GPT-3.5's accuracy ranges from 56% to 93% on various QA benchmarks, Llama 3 achieved a mean accuracy of 90% on all eleven datasets. Thereby Llama 3 is outperforming humans on all datasets with an average 21% higher accuracy over ten datasets. Furthermore, we can appraise that, in the sense of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), GPT-3.5 provides good explanations for its decisions. Our questionnaire revealed that 66% of participants rated GPT-3.5's explanations as either ""good"" or ""excellent"". Taken together, these findings enrich our understanding of current LLMs and pave the way for future investigations of reasoning and explainability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03778v1,2024-07
HYBRINFOX at CheckThat! 2024 -- Task 2: Enriching BERT Models with the Expert System VAGO for Subjectivity Detection,"Morgane Casanova, Julien Chanson, Benjamin Icard, Géraud Faye, Guillaume Gadek, Guillaume Gravier, Paul Égré","This paper presents the HYBRINFOX method used to solve Task 2 of Subjectivity detection of the CLEF 2024 CheckThat! competition. The specificity of the method is to use a hybrid system, combining a RoBERTa model, fine-tuned for subjectivity detection, a frozen sentence-BERT (sBERT) model to capture semantics, and several scores calculated by the English version of the expert system VAGO, developed independently of this task to measure vagueness and subjectivity in texts based on the lexicon. In English, the HYBRINFOX method ranked 1st with a macro F1 score of 0.7442 on the evaluation data. For the other languages, the method used a translation step into English, producing more mixed results (ranking 1st in Multilingual and 2nd in Italian over the baseline, but under the baseline in Bulgarian, German, and Arabic). We explain the principles of our hybrid approach, and outline ways in which the method could be improved for other languages besides English.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03770v1,2024-07
Convolutional vs Large Language Models for Software Log Classification in Edge-Deployable Cellular Network Testing,"Achintha Ihalage, Sayed M. Taheri, Faris Muhammad, Hamed Al-Raweshidy","Software logs generated by sophisticated network emulators in the telecommunications industry, such as VIAVI TM500, are extremely complex, often comprising tens of thousands of text lines with minimal resemblance to natural language. Only specialised expert engineers can decipher such logs and troubleshoot defects in test runs. While AI offers a promising solution for automating defect triage, potentially leading to massive revenue savings for companies, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) suffer from significant drawbacks in this specialised domain. These include a constrained context window, limited applicability to text beyond natural language, and high inference costs. To address these limitations, we propose a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that offers a context window spanning up to 200,000 characters and achieves over 96% accuracy (F1>0.9) in classifying multifaceted software logs into various layers in the telecommunications protocol stack. Specifically, the proposed model is capable of identifying defects in test runs and triaging them to the relevant department, formerly a manual engineering process that required expert knowledge. We evaluate several LLMs; LLaMA2-7B, Mixtral 8x7B, Flan-T5, BERT and BigBird, and experimentally demonstrate their shortcomings in our specialized application. Despite being lightweight, our CNN significantly outperforms LLM-based approaches in telecommunications log classification while minimizing the cost of production. Our defect triaging AI model is deployable on edge devices without dedicated hardware and widely applicable across software logs in various industries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03759v1,2024-07
Argument Mining in Data Scarce Settings: Cross-lingual Transfer and Few-shot Techniques,"Anar Yeginbergen, Maite Oronoz, Rodrigo Agerri","Recent research on sequence labelling has been exploring different strategies to mitigate the lack of manually annotated data for the large majority of the world languages. Among others, the most successful approaches have been based on (i) the cross-lingual transfer capabilities of multilingual pre-trained language models (model-transfer), (ii) data translation and label projection (data-transfer) and (iii), prompt-based learning by reusing the mask objective to exploit the few-shot capabilities of pre-trained language models (few-shot). Previous work seems to conclude that model-transfer outperforms data-transfer methods and that few-shot techniques based on prompting are superior to updating the model's weights via fine-tuning. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that, for Argument Mining, a sequence labelling task which requires the detection of long and complex discourse structures, previous insights on cross-lingual transfer or few-shot learning do not apply. Contrary to previous work, we show that for Argument Mining data transfer obtains better results than model-transfer and that fine-tuning outperforms few-shot methods. Regarding the former, the domain of the dataset used for data-transfer seems to be a deciding factor, while, for few-shot, the type of task (length and complexity of the sequence spans) and sampling method prove to be crucial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03748v1,2024-07
Improving Self-supervised Pre-training using Accent-Specific Codebooks,"Darshan Prabhu, Abhishek Gupta, Omkar Nitsure, Preethi Jyothi, Sriram Ganapathy","Speech accents present a serious challenge to the performance of state-of-the-art end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Even with self-supervised learning and pre-training of ASR models, accent invariance is seldom achieved. In this work, we propose an accent-aware adaptation technique for self-supervised learning that introduces a trainable set of accent-specific codebooks to the self-supervised architecture. These learnable codebooks enable the model to capture accent specific information during pre-training, that is further refined during ASR finetuning. On the Mozilla Common Voice dataset, our proposed approach outperforms all other accent-adaptation approaches on both seen and unseen English accents, with up to 9% relative reduction in word error rate (WER).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03734v1,2024-07
Query-oriented Data Augmentation for Session Search,"Haonan Chen, Zhicheng Dou, Yutao Zhu, Ji-Rong Wen","Modeling contextual information in a search session has drawn more and more attention when understanding complex user intents. Recent methods are all data-driven, i.e., they train different models on large-scale search log data to identify the relevance between search contexts and candidate documents. The common training paradigm is to pair the search context with different candidate documents and train the model to rank the clicked documents higher than the unclicked ones. However, this paradigm neglects the symmetric nature of the relevance between the session context and document, i.e., the clicked documents can also be paired with different search contexts when training. In this work, we propose query-oriented data augmentation to enrich search logs and empower the modeling. We generate supplemental training pairs by altering the most important part of a search context, i.e., the current query, and train our model to rank the generated sequence along with the original sequence. This approach enables models to learn that the relevance of a document may vary as the session context changes, leading to a better understanding of users' search patterns. We develop several strategies to alter the current query, resulting in new training data with varying degrees of difficulty. Through experimentation on two extensive public search logs, we have successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03720v1,2024-07
Multi-Convformer: Extending Conformer with Multiple Convolution Kernels,"Darshan Prabhu, Yifan Peng, Preethi Jyothi, Shinji Watanabe","Convolutions have become essential in state-of-the-art end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition~(ASR) systems due to their efficient modelling of local context. Notably, its use in Conformers has led to superior performance compared to vanilla Transformer-based ASR systems. While components other than the convolution module in the Conformer have been reexamined, altering the convolution module itself has been far less explored. Towards this, we introduce Multi-Convformer that uses multiple convolution kernels within the convolution module of the Conformer in conjunction with gating. This helps in improved modeling of local dependencies at varying granularities. Our model rivals existing Conformer variants such as CgMLP and E-Branchformer in performance, while being more parameter efficient. We empirically compare our approach with Conformer and its variants across four different datasets and three different modelling paradigms and show up to 8% relative word error rate~(WER) improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03718v2,2024-07
Text2TimeSeries: Enhancing Financial Forecasting through Time Series Prediction Updates with Event-Driven Insights from Large Language Models,"Litton Jose Kurisinkel, Pruthwik Mishra, Yue Zhang","Time series models, typically trained on numerical data, are designed to forecast future values. These models often rely on weighted averaging techniques over time intervals. However, real-world time series data is seldom isolated and is frequently influenced by non-numeric factors. For instance, stock price fluctuations are impacted by daily random events in the broader world, with each event exerting a unique influence on price signals. Previously, forecasts in financial markets have been approached in two main ways: either as time-series problems over price sequence or sentiment analysis tasks. The sentiment analysis tasks aim to determine whether news events will have a positive or negative impact on stock prices, often categorizing them into discrete labels. Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive approach to accurately model time series prediction, we propose a collaborative modeling framework that incorporates textual information about relevant events for predictions. Specifically, we leverage the intuition of large language models about future changes to update real number time series predictions. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach on financial market data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03689v1,2024-07
STOC-TOT: Stochastic Tree-of-Thought with Constrained Decoding for Complex Reasoning in Multi-Hop Question Answering,"Zhenyu Bi, Daniel Hajialigol, Zhongkai Sun, Jie Hao, Xuan Wang","Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires a model to retrieve and integrate information from multiple passages to answer a complex question. Recent systems leverage the power of large language models and integrate evidence retrieval with reasoning prompts (e.g., chain-of-thought reasoning) for the MHQA task. However, the complexities in the question types (bridge v.s. comparison questions) and the reasoning types (sequential v.s. parallel reasonings) require more novel and fine-grained prompting methods to enhance the performance of MHQA under the zero-shot setting. In this paper, we propose STOC-TOT, a stochastic tree-of-thought reasoning prompting method with constrained decoding for MHQA and conduct a detailed comparison with other reasoning prompts on different question types and reasoning types. Specifically, we construct a tree-like reasoning structure by prompting the model to break down the original question into smaller sub-questions to form different reasoning paths. In addition, we prompt the model to provide a probability estimation for each reasoning path at each reasoning step. At answer time, we conduct constrained decoding on the model to generate more grounded answers and reduce hallucination. Experiments comparing STOC-TOT with two MHQA datasets and five large language models showed that our framework outperforms other reasoning prompts by a significant margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03687v1,2024-07
Improving Self Consistency in LLMs through Probabilistic Tokenization,"Ashutosh Sathe, Divyanshu Aggarwal, Sunayana Sitaram","Prior research has demonstrated noticeable performance gains through the use of probabilistic tokenizations, an approach that involves employing multiple tokenizations of the same input string during the training phase of a language model. Despite these promising findings, modern large language models (LLMs) have yet to be trained using probabilistic tokenizations. Interestingly, while the tokenizers of these contemporary LLMs have the capability to generate multiple tokenizations, this property remains underutilized.   In this work, we propose a novel method to leverage the multiple tokenization capabilities of modern LLM tokenizers, aiming to enhance the self-consistency of LLMs in reasoning tasks. Our experiments indicate that when utilizing probabilistic tokenizations, LLMs generate logically diverse reasoning paths, moving beyond mere surface-level linguistic diversity.We carefully study probabilistic tokenization and offer insights to explain the self consistency improvements it brings through extensive experimentation on 5 LLM families and 4 reasoning benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03678v1,2024-07
"GPT-4 vs. Human Translators: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Translation Quality Across Languages, Domains, and Expertise Levels","Jianhao Yan, Pingchuan Yan, Yulong Chen, Judy Li, Xianchao Zhu, Yue Zhang","This study comprehensively evaluates the translation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, against human translators of varying expertise levels across multiple language pairs and domains. Through carefully designed annotation rounds, we find that GPT-4 performs comparably to junior translators in terms of total errors made but lags behind medium and senior translators. We also observe the imbalanced performance across different languages and domains, with GPT-4's translation capability gradually weakening from resource-rich to resource-poor directions. In addition, we qualitatively study the translation given by GPT-4 and human translators, and find that GPT-4 translator suffers from literal translations, but human translators sometimes overthink the background information. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate LLMs against human translators and analyze the systematic differences between their outputs, providing valuable insights into the current state of LLM-based translation and its potential limitations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03658v1,2024-07
"Evaluating Language Model Context Windows: A ""Working Memory"" Test and Inference-time Correction","Amanda Dsouza, Christopher Glaze, Changho Shin, Frederic Sala","Large language models are prominently used in real-world applications, often tasked with reasoning over large volumes of documents. An exciting development in this space is models boasting extended context capabilities, with some accommodating over 2 million tokens. Such long context model capabilities remain uncertain in production systems, motivating the need to benchmark their performance on real world use cases. We address this challenge by proposing SWiM, an evaluation framework that addresses the limitations of standard tests. Testing the framework on eight long context models, we find that even strong models such as GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus degrade in performance when information is present in the middle of the context window (lost-in-the-middle effect). Next, in addition to our benchmark, we propose medoid voting, a simple, but effective training-free approach that helps alleviate this effect, by generating responses a few times, each time randomly permuting documents in the context, and selecting the medoid answer. We evaluate medoid voting on single document QA tasks, achieving up to a 24% lift in accuracy.

Differentiating between human-written and AI-generated texts using linguistic features automatically extracted from an online computational tool,Georgios P. Georgiou,"While extensive research has focused on ChatGPT in recent years, very few studies have systematically quantified and compared linguistic features between human-written and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated language. This study aims to investigate how various linguistic components are represented in both types of texts, assessing the ability of AI to emulate human writing. Using human-authored essays as a benchmark, we prompted ChatGPT to generate essays of equivalent length. These texts were analyzed using Open Brain AI, an online computational tool, to extract measures of phonological, morphological, syntactic, and lexical constituents. Despite AI-generated texts appearing to mimic human speech, the results revealed significant differences across multiple linguistic features such as consonants, word stress, nouns, verbs, pronouns, direct objects, prepositional modifiers, and use of difficult words among others. These findings underscore the importance of integrating automated tools for efficient language assessment, reducing time and effort in data analysis. Moreover, they emphasize the necessity for enhanced training methodologies to improve the capacity of AI for producing more human-like text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03646v2,2024-07
Continual Learning Optimizations for Auto-regressive Decoder of Multilingual ASR systems,"Chin Yuen Kwok, Jia Qi Yip, Eng Siong Chng","Continual Learning (CL) involves fine-tuning pre-trained models with new data while maintaining the performance on the pre-trained data. This is particularly relevant for expanding multilingual ASR (MASR) capabilities. However, existing CL methods, mainly designed for computer vision and reinforcement learning tasks, often yield sub-optimal results when directly applied to MASR. We hypothesise that this is because CL of the auto-regressive decoder in the MASR model is difficult. To verify this, we propose four optimizations on the decoder. They include decoder-layer gradient surgery, freezing unused token embeddings, suppressing output of newly added tokens, and learning rate re-scaling. Our experiments on adapting Whisper to 10 unseen languages from the Common Voice dataset demonstrate that these optimizations reduce the Average Word Error Rate (AWER) of pretrained languages from 14.2% to 12.4% compared with Experience Replay, without compromising the AWER of new languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03645v3,2024-07
Generative Technology for Human Emotion Recognition: A Scope Review,"Fei Ma, Yucheng Yuan, Yifan Xie, Hongwei Ren, Ivan Liu, Ying He, Fuji Ren, Fei Richard Yu, Shiguang Ni","Affective computing stands at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI), seeking to imbue machines with the ability to comprehend and respond to human emotions. Central to this field is emotion recognition, which endeavors to identify and interpret human emotional states from different modalities, such as speech, facial images, text, and physiological signals. In recent years, important progress has been made in generative models, including Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, Diffusion Model, and Large Language Model. These models, with their powerful data generation capabilities, emerge as pivotal tools in advancing emotion recognition. However, up to now, there remains a paucity of systematic efforts that review generative technology for emotion recognition. This survey aims to bridge the gaps in the existing literature by conducting a comprehensive analysis of over 320 research papers until June 2024. Specifically, this survey will firstly introduce the mathematical principles of different generative models and the commonly used datasets. Subsequently, through a taxonomy, it will provide an in-depth analysis of how generative techniques address emotion recognition based on different modalities in several aspects, including data augmentation, feature extraction, semi-supervised learning, cross-domain, etc. Finally, the review will outline future research directions, emphasizing the potential of generative models to advance the field of emotion recognition and enhance the emotional intelligence of AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03640v1,2024-07
QET: Enhancing Quantized LLM Parameters and KV cache Compression through Element Substitution and Residual Clustering,"Yanshu Wang, Wang Li, Zhaoqian Yao, Tong Yang","The matrix quantization entails representing matrix elements in a more space-efficient form to reduce storage usage, with dequantization restoring the original matrix for use. We formulate the Quantization Error Minimization (QEM) problem as minimizing the distance between a matrix before and after quantization, under the condition that the quantized matrix occupies the same memory space. Matrix quantization is crucial in various applications, including Large Language Models (LLMs) weight quantization, vector databases, KV cache quantization, graph compression, and image compression. Recent advancements in LLMs, such as GPT-4 and BERT, have highlighted the importance of matrix compression due to the large size of parameters and KV cache, which are stored as matrices.   We propose Quantum Entanglement Trees (QET) to address the QEM problem by leveraging the local orderliness of matrix elements, involving iterative element swapping to form a locally ordered matrix. This matrix is then grouped and quantized by columns. To enhance QET, we introduce two optimizations: further quantizing residuals to reduce MSE, and using masking and batch processing to accelerate the algorithm.   Experimental results demonstrate that QET can effectively reduce MSE to 5.05%, 13.33%, and 11.89% of the current best method on the LLM dataset, K cache, and V cache, respectively. Our contributions include the abstraction of the QEM problem, the design of the QET algorithm, and the proposal of two optimizations to improve accuracy and speed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03637v4,2024-07
DSLR: Document Refinement with Sentence-Level Re-ranking and Reconstruction to Enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Taeho Hwang, Soyeong Jeong, Sukmin Cho, SeungYoon Han, Jong C. Park","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with generating non-factual responses due to limitations in their parametric memory. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this issue by incorporating external knowledge with a retrieval module. Despite their successes, however, current RAG systems face challenges with retrieval failures and the limited ability of LLMs to filter out irrelevant information. Therefore, in this work, we propose DSLR (Document Refinement with Sentence-Level Re-ranking and Reconstruction), an unsupervised framework that decomposes retrieved documents into sentences, filters out irrelevant sentences, and reconstructs them again into coherent passages. We experimentally validate DSLR on multiple open-domain QA datasets and the results demonstrate that DSLR significantly enhances the RAG performance over conventional fixed-size passage. Furthermore, our DSLR enhances performance in specific, yet realistic scenarios without the need for additional training, providing an effective and efficient solution for refining retrieved documents in RAG systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03627v5,2024-07
Question-Analysis Prompting Improves LLM Performance in Reasoning Tasks,"Dharunish Yugeswardeenoo, Kevin Zhu, Sean O'Brien","Although LLMs have the potential to transform many fields, they still underperform humans in reasoning tasks. Existing methods induce the model to produce step-by-step calculations, but this research explores the question: Does making the LLM analyze the question improve its performance? We propose a novel prompting strategy called Question Analysis Prompting (QAP), in which the model is prompted to explain the question in $n$ words before solving. The value of $n$ influences the length of response generated by the model. QAP is evaluated on GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT 4 Turbo on arithmetic datasets GSM8K, AQuA, and SAT and commonsense dataset StrategyQA. QAP is compared with other state-of-the-art prompts including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Plan and Solve Prompting (PS+) and Take A Deep Breath (TADB). QAP outperforms all state-of-the-art prompts on AQuA and SAT datasets on both GPT3.5 and GPT4. QAP consistently ranks among the top-2 prompts on 75\% of the tests. A key factor of QAP performance can be attributed to response length, where detailed responses are beneficial when answering harder questions, but can negatively affect easy questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03624v2,2024-07
The Mysterious Case of Neuron 1512: Injectable Realignment Architectures Reveal Internal Characteristics of Meta's Llama 2 Model,"Brenden Smith, Dallin Baker, Clayton Chase, Myles Barney, Kaden Parker, Makenna Allred, Peter Hu, Alex Evans, Nancy Fulda","Large Language Models (LLMs) have an unrivaled and invaluable ability to ""align"" their output to a diverse range of human preferences, by mirroring them in the text they generate. The internal characteristics of such models, however, remain largely opaque. This work presents the Injectable Realignment Model (IRM) as a novel approach to language model interpretability and explainability. Inspired by earlier work on Neural Programming Interfaces, we construct and train a small network -- the IRM -- to induce emotion-based alignments within a 7B parameter LLM architecture. The IRM outputs are injected via layerwise addition at various points during the LLM's forward pass, thus modulating its behavior without changing the weights of the original model. This isolates the alignment behavior from the complex mechanisms of the transformer model. Analysis of the trained IRM's outputs reveals a curious pattern. Across more than 24 training runs and multiple alignment datasets, patterns of IRM activations align themselves in striations associated with a neuron's index within each transformer layer, rather than being associated with the layers themselves. Further, a single neuron index (1512) is strongly correlated with all tested alignments. This result, although initially counterintuitive, is directly attributable to design choices present within almost all commercially available transformer architectures, and highlights a potential weak point in Meta's pretrained Llama 2 models. It also demonstrates the value of the IRM architecture for language model analysis and interpretability.

BM25S achieves up to a 500x speedup compared to the most popular Python-based framework by eagerly computing BM25 scores during indexing and storing them into sparse matrices. It also achieves considerable speedups compared to highly optimized Java-based implementations, which are used by popular commercial products. Finally, BM25S reproduces the exact implementation of five BM25 variants based on Kamphuis et al. (2020) by extending eager scoring to non-sparse variants using a novel score shifting method.

Visualizing Dialogues: Enhancing Image Selection through Dialogue Understanding with Large Language Models,"Chang-Sheng Kao, Yun-Nung Chen","Recent advancements in dialogue systems have highlighted the significance of integrating multimodal responses, which enable conveying ideas through diverse modalities rather than solely relying on text-based interactions. This enrichment not only improves overall communicative efficacy but also enhances the quality of conversational experiences. However, existing methods for dialogue-to-image retrieval face limitations due to the constraints of pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) in comprehending complex dialogues accurately. To address this, we present a novel approach leveraging the robust reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to generate precise dialogue-associated visual descriptors, facilitating seamless connection with images. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark data validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in deriving concise and accurate visual descriptors, leading to significant enhancements in dialogue-to-image retrieval performance. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the method's generalizability across diverse visual cues, various LLMs, and different datasets, underscoring its practicality and potential impact in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03615v1,2024-07
Lateralization LoRA: Interleaved Instruction Tuning with Modality-Specialized Adaptations,"Zhiyang Xu, Minqian Liu, Ying Shen, Joy Rimchala, Jiaxin Zhang, Qifan Wang, Yu Cheng, Lifu Huang","Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have led to the development of Vision-Language Generalists (VLGs) capable of understanding and generating interleaved images and text. Despite these advances, VLGs still struggle to follow user instructions for interleaved text and image generation. To address this issue, we introduce LeafInstruct, the first open-sourced interleaved instruction tuning data with over 30,000 high-quality instances across more than 10 domains. Due to the extensive size of existing VLGs, we opt for parameter-efficient tuning. However, we observe that VLGs tuned with a standard LoRA typically exhibit inferior performance in interleaved text-image generation. We attribute this problem to modality interference and the lack of modality-specialized adaptation design. Hence, we propose Lateralization LoRA, a novel modality-specialized adaptation method inspired by the concept of brain lateralization. Lateralization LoRA employs a hybrid approach, combining the traditional linear LoRA and a Convolutional LoRA for generating text and images, enabling the generation of high-quality text and images by leveraging modality-specific structures and parameter sets. We perform instruction tuning of the VLG (i.e., EMU2) using Lateralization LoRA on the LeafInstruct dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMU2 tuned with Lateralization LoRA achieve state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing baseline models in complex interleaved tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03604v1,2024-07
Chain-of-Thought Augmentation with Logit Contrast for Enhanced Reasoning in Language Models,"Jay Shim, Grant Kruttschnitt, Alyssa Ma, Daniel Kim, Benjamin Chek, Athul Anand, Kevin Zhu, Sean O'Brien","Rapidly increasing model scales coupled with steering methods such as chain-of-thought prompting have led to drastic improvements in language model reasoning. At the same time, models struggle with compositional generalization and are far from human performance on many reasoning-based benchmarks. Leveraging the success of chain-of-thought prompting, and also taking inspiration from context-aware decoding (CAD), we explore input-based contrasting methods to further encourage the type of reasoning induced by chain-of-thought prompting. While work remains to stabilize these results across datasets and models, the improvements we find warrant further investigation into input-based steering methods for context-aware reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03600v2,2024-07
Zero-shot Persuasive Chatbots with LLM-Generated Strategies and Information Retrieval,"Kazuaki Furumai, Roberto Legaspi, Julio Vizcarra, Yudai Yamazaki, Yasutaka Nishimura, Sina J. Semnani, Kazushi Ikeda, Weiyan Shi, Monica S. Lam","Persuasion plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications from health intervention to the promotion of social good. Persuasive chatbots employed responsibly for social good can be an enabler of positive individual and social change. Existing methods rely on fine-tuning persuasive chatbots with task-specific training data which is costly, if not infeasible, to collect. Furthermore, they employ only a handful of pre-defined persuasion strategies. We propose PersuaBot, a zero-shot chatbot based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that is factual and more persuasive by leveraging many more nuanced strategies. PersuaBot uses an LLM to first generate natural responses, from which the strategies used are extracted. To combat hallucination of LLMs, Persuabot replace any unsubstantiated claims in the response with retrieved facts supporting the extracted strategies. We applied our chatbot, PersuaBot, to three significantly different domains needing persuasion skills: donation solicitation, recommendations, and health intervention. Our experiments on simulated and human conversations show that our zero-shot approach is more persuasive than prior work, while achieving factual accuracy surpassing state-of-the-art knowledge-oriented chatbots.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03585v3,2024-07
Integrating Randomness in Large Language Models: A Linear Congruential Generator Approach for Generating Clinically Relevant Content,Andrew Bouras,"Generating diverse, high-quality outputs from language models is crucial for applications in education and content creation. Achieving true randomness and avoiding repetition remains a significant challenge. This study uses the Linear Congruential Generator method for systematic fact selection, combined with AI-powered content generation. We ensured unique combinations of gastrointestinal physiology and pathology facts across multiple rounds, integrating these facts into prompts for GPT-4o to create clinically relevant, vignette-style outputs. Over 14 rounds, 98 unique outputs were generated, demonstrating LCG's effectiveness in producing diverse and high-quality content. This method addresses key issues of randomness and repetition, enhancing the quality and efficiency of language model-generated content for various applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03582v1,2024-07

Core: Robust Factual Precision with Informative Sub-Claim Identification,"Zhengping Jiang, Jingyu Zhang, Nathaniel Weir, Seth Ebner, Miriam Wanner, Kate Sanders, Daniel Khashabi, Anqi Liu, Benjamin Van Durme","Hallucinations pose a challenge to the application of large language models (LLMs) thereby motivating the development of metrics to evaluate factual precision. We observe that popular metrics using the Decompose-Then-Verify framework, such as \FActScore, can be manipulated by adding obvious or repetitive subclaims to artificially inflate scores. This observation motivates our new customizable plug-and-play subclaim selection component called Core, which filters down individual subclaims according to their uniqueness and informativeness. We show that many popular factual precision metrics augmented by Core are substantially more robust on a wide range of knowledge domains. We release an evaluation framework supporting easy and modular use of Core and various decomposition strategies, which we recommend adoption by the community. We also release an expansion of the FActScore biography dataset to facilitate further studies of decomposition-based factual precision evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03572v2,2024-07
Learning Video Temporal Dynamics with Cross-Modal Attention for Robust Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"Sungnyun Kim, Kangwook Jang, Sangmin Bae, Hoirin Kim, Se-Young Yun","Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) aims to transcribe human speech using both audio and video modalities. In practical environments with noise-corrupted audio, the role of video information becomes crucial. However, prior works have primarily focused on enhancing audio features in AVSR, overlooking the importance of video features. In this study, we strengthen the video features by learning three temporal dynamics in video data: context order, playback direction, and the speed of video frames. Cross-modal attention modules are introduced to enrich video features with audio information so that speech variability can be taken into account when training on the video temporal dynamics. Based on our approach, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the LRS2 and LRS3 AVSR benchmarks for the noise-dominant settings. Our approach excels in scenarios especially for babble and speech noise, indicating the ability to distinguish the speech signal that should be recognized from lip movements in the video modality. We support the validity of our methodology by offering the ablation experiments for the temporal dynamics losses and the cross-modal attention architecture design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03563v3,2024-07
Feelings about Bodies: Emotions on Diet and Fitness Forums Reveal Gendered Stereotypes and Body Image Concerns,"Cinthia Sánchez, Minh Duc Chu, Zihao He, Rebecca Dorn, Stuart Murray, Kristina Lerman","The gendered expectations about ideal body types can lead to body image concerns, dissatisfaction, and in extreme cases, disordered eating and other psychopathologies across the gender spectrum. While research has focused on pro-anorexia online communities that glorify the 'thin ideal', less attention has been given to the broader spectrum of body image concerns or how emerging disorders like muscle dysmorphia ('bigorexia') present in online discussions. To address these gaps, we analyze 46 Reddit discussion forums related to diet, fitness, and associated mental health challenges. Using membership structure analysis and transformer-based language models, we project these communities along gender and body ideal axes, revealing complex interactions between gender, body ideals, and emotional expression. Our findings show that feminine-oriented communities generally express more negative emotions, particularly in thinness-promoting forums. Conversely, communities focused on the muscular ideal exhibit less negativity, regardless of gender orientation. We also uncover a gendered pattern in emotional indicators of mental health challenges, with communities discussing serious issues aligning more closely with thinness-oriented, predominantly feminine-leaning communities. By revealing the gendered emotional dynamics of online communities, our findings can inform the development of more effective content moderation approaches that facilitate supportive interactions, while minimizing exposure to potentially harmful content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03551v1,2024-07
On Evaluating Explanation Utility for Human-AI Decision Making in NLP,"Fateme Hashemi Chaleshtori, Atreya Ghosal, Alexander Gill, Purbid Bambroo, Ana Marasović","Is explainability a false promise? This debate has emerged from the insufficient evidence that explanations help people in situations they are introduced for. More human-centered, application-grounded evaluations of explanations are needed to settle this. Yet, with no established guidelines for such studies in NLP, researchers accustomed to standardized proxy evaluations must discover appropriate measurements, tasks, datasets, and sensible models for human-AI teams in their studies.   To aid with this, we first review existing metrics suitable for application-grounded evaluation. We then establish criteria to select appropriate datasets, and using them, we find that only 4 out of over 50 datasets available for explainability research in NLP meet them. We then demonstrate the importance of reassessing the state of the art to form and study human-AI teams: teaming people with models for certain tasks might only now start to make sense, and for others, it remains unsound. Finally, we present the exemplar studies of human-AI decision-making for one of the identified tasks -- verifying the correctness of a legal claim given a contract. Our results show that providing AI predictions, with or without explanations, does not cause decision makers to speed up their work without compromising performance. We argue for revisiting the setup of human-AI teams and improving automatic deferral of instances to AI, where explanations could play a useful role.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03545v2,2024-07
Social Bias in Large Language Models For Bangla: An Empirical Study on Gender and Religious Bias,"Jayanta Sadhu, Maneesha Rani Saha, Rifat Shahriyar","The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has put forward the study of biases as a crucial field. It is important to assess the influence of different types of biases embedded in LLMs to ensure fair use in sensitive fields. Although there have been extensive works on bias assessment in English, such efforts are rare and scarce for a major language like Bangla. In this work, we examine two types of social biases in LLM generated outputs for Bangla language. Our main contributions in this work are: (1) bias studies on two different social biases for Bangla, (2) a curated dataset for bias measurement benchmarking and (3) testing two different probing techniques for bias detection in the context of Bangla. This is the first work of such kind involving bias assessment of LLMs for Bangla to the best of our knowledge. All our code and resources are publicly available for the progress of bias related research in Bangla NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03536v3,2024-07
UnSeenTimeQA: Time-Sensitive Question-Answering Beyond LLMs' Memorization,"Md Nayem Uddin, Amir Saeidi, Divij Handa, Agastya Seth, Tran Cao Son, Eduardo Blanco, Steven R. Corman, Chitta Baral","This paper introduces UnSeenTimeQA, a novel data contamination-free time-sensitive question-answering (TSQA) benchmark. It differs from existing TSQA benchmarks by avoiding web-searchable queries grounded in the real-world. We present a series of time-sensitive event scenarios based on synthetically generated facts. It requires large language models (LLMs) to engage in genuine temporal reasoning without depending on the factual knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase. We designed three types of time-sensitive questions to test LLMs' temporal reasoning abilities over sequential and parallel event occurrences. Our evaluation of five LLMs on synthetic fact-based TSQA reveals mixed results: while they perform well on simpler subsets, their overall performance remains inferior as compared to real-world fact-based TSQA. Error analysis of LLM-generated reasoning chains indicates that LLMs face difficulties in reasoning over long-range event dependencies and parallel event timelines that unfold concurrently.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03525v3,2024-07
OSPC: Artificial VLM Features for Hateful Meme Detection,Peter Grönquist,"The digital revolution and the advent of the world wide web have transformed human communication, notably through the emergence of memes. While memes are a popular and straightforward form of expression, they can also be used to spread misinformation and hate due to their anonymity and ease of use. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a solution developed by team 'Baseline' for the AI Singapore Online Safety Prize Challenge. Focusing on computational efficiency and feature engineering, the solution achieved an AUROC of 0.76 and an accuracy of 0.69 on the test dataset. As key features, the solution leverages the inherent probabilistic capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate task-adapted feature encodings from text, and applies a distilled quantization tailored to the specific cultural nuances present in Singapore. This type of processing and fine-tuning can be adapted to various visual and textual understanding and classification tasks, and even applied on private VLMs such as OpenAI's GPT. Finally it can eliminate the need for extensive model training on large GPUs for resource constrained applications, also offering a solution when little or no data is available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12836v1,2024-07
Improving LLM Abilities in Idiomatic Translation,"Sundesh Donthi, Maximilian Spencer, Om Patel, Joon Doh, Eid Rodan","For large language models (LLMs) like NLLB and GPT, translating idioms remains a challenge. Our goal is to enhance translation fidelity by improving LLM processing of idiomatic language while preserving the original linguistic style. This has a significant social impact, as it preserves cultural nuances and ensures translated texts retain their intent and emotional resonance, fostering better cross-cultural communication. Previous work has utilized knowledge bases like IdiomKB by providing the LLM with the meaning of an idiom to use in translation. Although this method yielded better results than a direct translation, it is still limited in its ability to preserve idiomatic writing style across languages. In this research, we expand upon the knowledge base to find corresponding idioms in the target language. Our research performs translations using two methods: The first method employs the SentenceTransformers model to semantically generate cosine similarity scores between the meanings of the original and target language idioms, selecting the best idiom (Cosine Similarity method). The second method uses an LLM to find a corresponding idiom in the target language for use in the translation (LLM-generated idiom method). As a baseline, we performed a direct translation without providing additional information. Human evaluations on the English -> Chinese, and Chinese -> English show the Cosine Similarity Lookup method out-performed others in all GPT4o translations. To further build upon IdiomKB, we developed a low-resource Urdu dataset containing Urdu idioms and their translations. Despite dataset limitations, the Cosine Similarity Lookup method shows promise, potentially overcoming language barriers and enabling the exploration of diverse literary works in Chinese and Urdu.(LoResLM @ COLING Preprint)",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03518v3,2024-07
AgentInstruct: Toward Generative Teaching with Agentic Flows,"Arindam Mitra, Luciano Del Corro, Guoqing Zheng, Shweti Mahajan, Dany Rouhana, Andres Codas, Yadong Lu, Wei-ge Chen, Olga Vrousgos, Corby Rosset, Fillipe Silva, Hamed Khanpour, Yash Lara, Ahmed Awadallah","Synthetic data is becoming increasingly important for accelerating the development of language models, both large and small. Despite several successful use cases, researchers also raised concerns around model collapse and drawbacks of imitating other models. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that synthetic data varies in quality and diversity. Effective use of synthetic data usually requires significant human effort in curating the data. We focus on using synthetic data for post-training, specifically creating data by powerful models to teach a new skill or behavior to another model, we refer to this setting as Generative Teaching. We introduce AgentInstruct, an extensible agentic framework for automatically creating large amounts of diverse and high-quality synthetic data. AgentInstruct can create both the prompts and responses, using only raw data sources like text documents and code files as seeds. We demonstrate the utility of AgentInstruct by creating a post training dataset of 25M pairs to teach language models different skills, such as text editing, creative writing, tool usage, coding, reading comprehension, etc. The dataset can be used for instruction tuning of any base model. We post-train Mistral-7b with the data. When comparing the resulting model Orca-3 to Mistral-7b-Instruct (which uses the same base model), we observe significant improvements across many benchmarks. For example, 40% improvement on AGIEval, 19% improvement on MMLU, 54% improvement on GSM8K, 38% improvement on BBH and 45% improvement on AlpacaEval. Additionally, it consistently outperforms other models such as LLAMA-8B-instruct and GPT-3.5-turbo.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03502v1,2024-07
Codec-ASR: Training Performant Automatic Speech Recognition Systems with Discrete Speech Representations,"Kunal Dhawan, Nithin Rao Koluguri, Ante Jukić, Ryan Langman, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg","Discrete speech representations have garnered recent attention for their efficacy in training transformer-based models for various speech-related tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), translation, speaker verification, and joint speech-text foundational models. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis on building ASR systems with discrete codes. We investigate different methods for codec training such as quantization schemes and time-domain vs spectral feature encodings. We further explore ASR training techniques aimed at enhancing performance, training efficiency, and noise robustness. Drawing upon our findings, we introduce a codec ASR pipeline that outperforms Encodec at similar bit-rate. Remarkably, it also surpasses the state-of-the-art results achieved by strong self-supervised models on the 143 languages ML-SUPERB benchmark despite being smaller in size and pretrained on significantly less data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03495v1,2024-07
Exploring LGBTQ+ Bias in Generative AI Answers across Different Country and Religious Contexts,"Lilla Vicsek, Anna Vancsó, Mike Zajko, Judit Takacs","Previous discussions have highlighted the need for generative AI tools to become more culturally sensitive, yet often neglect the complexities of handling content about minorities, who are perceived differently across cultures and religions. Our study examined how two generative AI systems respond to homophobic statements with varying cultural and religious context information. Findings showed ChatGPT 3.5's replies exhibited cultural relativism, in contrast to Bard's, which stressed human rights and provided more support for LGBTQ+ issues. Both demonstrated significant change in responses based on contextual information provided in the prompts, suggesting that AI systems may adjust in their responses the degree and forms of support for LGBTQ+ people according to information they receive about the user's background. The study contributes to understanding the social and ethical implications of AI responses and argues that any work to make generative AI outputs more culturally diverse requires a grounding in fundamental human rights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03473v1,2024-07
Prosody-Driven Privacy-Preserving Dementia Detection,"Dominika Woszczyk, Ranya Aloufi, Soteris Demetriou","Speaker embeddings extracted from voice recordings have been proven valuable for dementia detection. However, by their nature, these embeddings contain identifiable information which raises privacy concerns. In this work, we aim to anonymize embeddings while preserving the diagnostic utility for dementia detection. Previous studies rely on adversarial learning and models trained on the target attribute and struggle in limited-resource settings. We propose a novel approach that leverages domain knowledge to disentangle prosody features relevant to dementia from speaker embeddings without relying on a dementia classifier. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in preserving speaker privacy (speaker recognition F1-score .01%) while maintaining high dementia detection score F1-score of 74% on the ADReSS dataset. Our results are also on par with a more constrained classifier-dependent system on ADReSSo (.01% and .66%), and have no impact on synthesized speech naturalness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03470v1,2024-07
Collaborative Quest Completion with LLM-driven Non-Player Characters in Minecraft,"Sudha Rao, Weijia Xu, Michael Xu, Jorge Leandro, Ken Lobb, Gabriel DesGarennes, Chris Brockett, Bill Dolan","The use of generative AI in video game development is on the rise, and as the conversational and other capabilities of large language models continue to improve, we expect LLM-driven non-player characters (NPCs) to become widely deployed. In this paper, we seek to understand how human players collaborate with LLM-driven NPCs to accomplish in-game goals. We design a minigame within Minecraft where a player works with two GPT4-driven NPCs to complete a quest. We perform a user study in which 28 Minecraft players play this minigame and share their feedback. On analyzing the game logs and recordings, we find that several patterns of collaborative behavior emerge from the NPCs and the human players. We also report on the current limitations of language-only models that do not have rich game-state or visual understanding. We believe that this preliminary study and analysis will inform future game developers on how to better exploit these rapidly improving generative AI models for collaborative roles in games.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03460v1,2024-07
XferBench: a Data-Driven Benchmark for Emergent Language,"Brendon Boldt, David Mortensen","In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for evaluating the overall quality of emergent languages using data-driven methods. Specifically, we interpret the notion of the ""quality"" of an emergent language as its similarity to human language within a deep learning framework. We measure this by using the emergent language as pretraining data for a downstream NLP tasks in human language -- the better the downstream performance, the better the emergent language. We implement this benchmark as an easy-to-use Python package that only requires a text file of utterances from the emergent language to be evaluated. Finally, we empirically test the benchmark's validity using human, synthetic, and emergent language baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03456v1,2024-07
Regurgitative Training: The Value of Real Data in Training Large Language Models,"Jinghui Zhang, Dandan Qiao, Mochen Yang, Qiang Wei","What happens if we train a new Large Language Model (LLM) using data that are at least partially generated by other LLMs? The explosive success of LLMs means that a substantial amount of content online will be generated by LLMs rather than humans, which will inevitably enter the training datasets of next-generation LLMs. We evaluate the implications of such ""regurgitative training"" on LLM performance. Through fine-tuning GPT-3.5 with data generated either by itself or by other LLMs in a machine translation task, we find strong evidence that regurgitative training clearly handicaps the performance of LLMs. The same performance loss of regurgitative training is observed on transformer models that we train from scratch. We find suggestive evidence that the performance disadvantage of regurgitative training can be attributed to at least two mechanisms: (1) higher error rates and (2) lower lexical diversity in LLM-generated data as compared to real data. Based on these mechanisms, we propose and evaluate three different strategies to mitigate the performance loss of regurgitative training. First, we devise data-driven metrics to gauge the quality of each LLM-generated data instance, and then carry out an ordered training process where high-quality data are added before low-quality ones. Second, we combine data generated by multiple different LLMs (as an attempt to increase lexical diversity). Third, we train an AI detection classifier to differentiate between LLM- and human-generated data, and include LLM-generated data in the order of resemblance to human-generated data. All three strategies can improve the performance of regurgitative training to some extent but are not always able to fully close the gap from training with real data. Our results highlight the value of real, human-generated data in training LLMs, which cannot be easily substituted by synthetic, LLM-generated data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12835v2,2024-07
AMA-LSTM: Pioneering Robust and Fair Financial Audio Analysis for Stock Volatility Prediction,"Shengkun Wang, Taoran Ji, Jianfeng He, Mariam Almutairi, Dan Wang, Linhan Wang, Min Zhang, Chang-Tien Lu","Stock volatility prediction is an important task in the financial industry. Recent advancements in multimodal methodologies, which integrate both textual and auditory data, have demonstrated significant improvements in this domain, such as earnings calls (Earnings calls are public available and often involve the management team of a public company and interested parties to discuss the company's earnings). However, these multimodal methods have faced two drawbacks. First, they often fail to yield reliable models and overfit the data due to their absorption of stochastic information from the stock market. Moreover, using multimodal models to predict stock volatility suffers from gender bias and lacks an efficient way to eliminate such bias. To address these aforementioned problems, we use adversarial training to generate perturbations that simulate the inherent stochasticity and bias, by creating areas resistant to random information around the input space to improve model robustness and fairness. Our comprehensive experiments on two real-world financial audio datasets reveal that this method exceeds the performance of current state-of-the-art solution. This confirms the value of adversarial training in reducing stochasticity and bias for stock volatility prediction tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18324v1,2024-07
DLO: Dynamic Layer Operation for Efficient Vertical Scaling of LLMs,"Zhen Tan, Daize Dong, Xinyu Zhao, Jie Peng, Yu Cheng, Tianlong Chen","In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Layer Operations (DLO), a novel approach for vertically scaling transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically expanding, activating, or skipping layers using a sophisticated routing policy based on layerwise feature similarity. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods that focus on extending the model width, our approach targets model depth, addressing the redundancy observed across layer representations for various input samples. Our framework is integrated with the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage, eliminating the need for resource-intensive Continual Pre-Training (CPT). Experimental results demonstrate that DLO not only outperforms the original unscaled models but also achieves comparable results to densely expanded models with significantly improved efficiency. Our work offers a promising direction for building efficient yet powerful LLMs. We will release our implementation and model weights upon acceptance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11030v1,2024-07
HEMM: Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal Foundation Models,"Paul Pu Liang, Akshay Goindani, Talha Chafekar, Leena Mathur, Haofei Yu, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Louis-Philippe Morency","Multimodal foundation models that can holistically process text alongside images, video, audio, and other sensory modalities are increasingly used in a variety of real-world applications. However, it is challenging to characterize and study progress in multimodal foundation models, given the range of possible modeling decisions, tasks, and domains. In this paper, we introduce Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal Models (HEMM) to systematically evaluate the capabilities of multimodal foundation models across a set of 3 dimensions: basic skills, information flow, and real-world use cases. Basic multimodal skills are internal abilities required to solve problems, such as learning interactions across modalities, fine-grained alignment, multi-step reasoning, and the ability to handle external knowledge. Information flow studies how multimodal content changes during a task through querying, translation, editing, and fusion. Use cases span domain-specific challenges introduced in real-world multimedia, affective computing, natural sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction applications. Through comprehensive experiments across the 30 tasks in HEMM, we (1) identify key dataset dimensions (e.g., basic skills, information flows, and use cases) that pose challenges to today's models, and (2) distill performance trends regarding how different modeling dimensions (e.g., scale, pre-training data, multimodal alignment, pre-training, and instruction tuning objectives) influence performance. Our conclusions regarding challenging multimodal interactions, use cases, and tasks requiring reasoning and external knowledge, the benefits of data and model scale, and the impacts of instruction tuning yield actionable insights for future work in multimodal foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03418v1,2024-07
Planetarium: A Rigorous Benchmark for Translating Text to Structured Planning Languages,"Max Zuo, Francisco Piedrahita Velez, Xiaochen Li, Michael L. Littman, Stephen H. Bach","Many recent works have explored using language models for planning problems. One line of research focuses on translating natural language descriptions of planning tasks into structured planning languages, such as the planning domain definition language (PDDL). While this approach is promising, accurately measuring the quality of generated PDDL code continues to pose significant challenges. First, generated PDDL code is typically evaluated using planning validators that check whether the problem can be solved with a planner. This method is insufficient because a language model might generate valid PDDL code that does not align with the natural language description of the task. Second, existing evaluation sets often have natural language descriptions of the planning task that closely resemble the ground truth PDDL, reducing the challenge of the task. To bridge this gap, we introduce \benchmarkName, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models' ability to generate PDDL code from natural language descriptions of planning tasks. We begin by creating a PDDL equivalence algorithm that rigorously evaluates the correctness of PDDL code generated by language models by flexibly comparing it against a ground truth PDDL. Then, we present a dataset of $132,037$ text-to-PDDL pairs across 13 different tasks, with varying levels of difficulty. Finally, we evaluate several API-access and open-weight language models that reveal this task's complexity. For example, $87.6\%$ of the PDDL problem descriptions generated by GPT-4o are syntactically parseable, $82.2\%$ are valid, solve-able problems, but only $35.1\%$ are semantically correct, highlighting the need for a more rigorous benchmark for this problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03321v1,2024-07

BACON: Supercharge Your VLM with Bag-of-Concept Graph to Mitigate Hallucinations,"Zhantao Yang, Ruili Feng, Keyu Yan, Huangji Wang, Zhicai Wang, Shangwen Zhu, Han Zhang, Jie Xiao, Pingyu Wu, Kai Zhu, Jixuan Chen, Chen-Wei Xie, Chaojie Mao, Yue Yang, Hongyang Zhang, Yu Liu, Fan Cheng","This paper presents Bag-of-Concept Graph (BACON) to gift models with limited linguistic abilities to taste the privilege of Vision Language Models (VLMs) and boost downstream tasks such as detection, visual question answering (VQA), and image generation. Since the visual scenes in physical worlds are structured with complex relations between objects, BACON breaks down annotations into basic minimum elements and presents them in a graph structure. Element-wise style enables easy understanding, and structural composition liberates difficult locating. Careful prompt design births the BACON captions with the help of public-available VLMs and segmentation methods. In this way, we gather a dataset with 100K annotated images, which endow VLMs with remarkable capabilities, such as accurately generating BACON, transforming prompts into BACON format, envisioning scenarios in the style of BACONr, and dynamically modifying elements within BACON through interactive dialogue and more. Wide representative experiments, including detection, VQA, and image generation tasks, tell BACON as a lifeline to achieve previous out-of-reach tasks or excel in their current cutting-edge solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03314v1,2024-07
A Review of the Applications of Deep Learning-Based Emergent Communication,"Brendon Boldt, David Mortensen","Emergent communication, or emergent language, is the field of research which studies how human language-like communication systems emerge de novo in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning environments. The possibilities of replicating the emergence of a complex behavior like language have strong intuitive appeal, yet it is necessary to complement this with clear notions of how such research can be applicable to other fields of science, technology, and engineering. This paper comprehensively reviews the applications of emergent communication research across machine learning, natural language processing, linguistics, and cognitive science. Each application is illustrated with a description of its scope, an explication of emergent communication's unique role in addressing it, a summary of the extant literature working towards the application, and brief recommendations for near-term research directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03302v1,2024-07
LLM Internal States Reveal Hallucination Risk Faced With a Query,"Ziwei Ji, Delong Chen, Etsuko Ishii, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Yejin Bang, Bryan Wilie, Pascale Fung","The hallucination problem of Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly limits their reliability and trustworthiness. Humans have a self-awareness process that allows us to recognize what we don't know when faced with queries. Inspired by this, our paper investigates whether LLMs can estimate their own hallucination risk before response generation. We analyze the internal mechanisms of LLMs broadly both in terms of training data sources and across 15 diverse Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, spanning over 700 datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals two key insights: (1) LLM internal states indicate whether they have seen the query in training data or not; and (2) LLM internal states show they are likely to hallucinate or not regarding the query. Our study explores particular neurons, activation layers, and tokens that play a crucial role in the LLM perception of uncertainty and hallucination risk. By a probing estimator, we leverage LLM self-assessment, achieving an average hallucination estimation accuracy of 84.32\% at run time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03282v2,2024-07
Evaluating Automatic Metrics with Incremental Machine Translation Systems,"Guojun Wu, Shay B. Cohen, Rico Sennrich","We introduce a dataset comprising commercial machine translations, gathered weekly over six years across 12 translation directions. Since human A/B testing is commonly used, we assume commercial systems improve over time, which enables us to evaluate machine translation (MT) metrics based on their preference for more recent translations. Our study not only confirms several prior findings, such as the advantage of neural metrics over non-neural ones, but also explores the debated issue of how MT quality affects metric reliability--an investigation that smaller datasets in previous research could not sufficiently explore. Overall, our research demonstrates the dataset's value as a testbed for metric evaluation. We release our code at https://github.com/gjwubyron/Evo",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03277v2,2024-07
How Similar Are Elected Politicians and Their Constituents? Quantitative Evidence From Online Social Networks,"Waleed Iqbal, Gareth Tyson, Ignacio Castro","How similar are politicians to those who vote for them? This is a critical question at the heart of democratic representation and particularly relevant at times when political dissatisfaction and populism are on the rise. To answer this question we compare the online discourse of elected politicians and their constituents. We collect a two and a half years (September 2020 - February 2023) constituency-level dataset for USA and UK that includes: (i) the Twitter timelines (5.6 Million tweets) of elected political representatives (595 UK Members of Parliament and 433 USA Representatives), (ii) the Nextdoor posts (21.8 Million posts) of the constituency (98.4% USA and 91.5% UK constituencies). We find that elected politicians tend to be equally similar to their constituents in terms of content and style regardless of whether a constituency elects a right or left-wing politician. The size of the electoral victory and the level of income of a constituency shows a nuanced picture. The narrower the electoral victory, the more similar the style and the more dissimilar the content is. The lower the income of a constituency, the more similar the content is. In terms of style, poorer constituencies tend to have a more similar sentiment and more dissimilar psychological text traits (i.e. measured with LIWC categories).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03255v2,2024-07
STF: Sentence Transformer Fine-Tuning For Topic Categorization With Limited Data,"Kheir Eddine Daouadi, Yaakoub Boualleg, Oussama Guehairia","Nowadays, topic classification from tweets attracts considerable research attention. Different classification systems have been suggested thanks to these research efforts. Nevertheless, they face major challenges owing to low performance metrics due to the limited amount of labeled data. We propose Sentence Transformers Fine-tuning (STF), a topic detection system that leverages pretrained Sentence Transformers models and fine-tuning to classify topics from tweets accurately. Moreover, extensive parameter sensitivity analyses were conducted to finetune STF parameters for our topic classification task to achieve the best performance results. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrated that (1) the proposed STF can be effectively used for classifying tweet topics and outperforms the latest state-of-the-art approaches, and (2) the proposed STF does not require a huge amount of labeled tweets to achieve good accuracy, which is a limitation of many state-of-the-art approaches. Our main contribution is the achievement of promising results in tweet topic classification by applying pretrained sentence transformers language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03253v1,2024-07
CATT: Character-based Arabic Tashkeel Transformer,"Faris Alasmary, Orjuwan Zaafarani, Ahmad Ghannam","Tashkeel, or Arabic Text Diacritization (ATD), greatly enhances the comprehension of Arabic text by removing ambiguity and minimizing the risk of misinterpretations caused by its absence. It plays a crucial role in improving Arabic text processing, particularly in applications such as text-to-speech and machine translation. This paper introduces a new approach to training ATD models. First, we finetuned two transformers, encoder-only and encoder-decoder, that were initialized from a pretrained character-based BERT. Then, we applied the Noisy-Student approach to boost the performance of the best model. We evaluated our models alongside 11 commercial and open-source models using two manually labeled benchmark datasets: WikiNews and our CATT dataset. Our findings show that our top model surpasses all evaluated models by relative Diacritic Error Rates (DERs) of 30.83\% and 35.21\% on WikiNews and CATT, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art in ATD. In addition, we show that our model outperforms GPT-4-turbo on CATT dataset by a relative DER of 9.36\%.

Self-Evaluation as a Defense Against Adversarial Attacks on LLMs,"Hannah Brown, Leon Lin, Kenji Kawaguchi, Michael Shieh","We introduce a defense against adversarial attacks on LLMs utilizing self-evaluation. Our method requires no model fine-tuning, instead using pre-trained models to evaluate the inputs and outputs of a generator model, significantly reducing the cost of implementation in comparison to other, finetuning-based methods. Our method can significantly reduce the attack success rate of attacks on both open and closed-source LLMs, beyond the reductions demonstrated by Llama-Guard2 and commonly used content moderation APIs. We present an analysis of the effectiveness of our method, including attempts to attack the evaluator in various settings, demonstrating that it is also more resilient to attacks than existing methods.

Single Character Perturbations Break LLM Alignment,"Leon Lin, Hannah Brown, Kenji Kawaguchi, Michael Shieh","When LLMs are deployed in sensitive, human-facing settings, it is crucial that they do not output unsafe, biased, or privacy-violating outputs. For this reason, models are both trained and instructed to refuse to answer unsafe prompts such as ""Tell me how to build a bomb."" We find that, despite these safeguards, it is possible to break model defenses simply by appending a space to the end of a model's input. In a study of eight open-source models, we demonstrate that this acts as a strong enough attack to cause the majority of models to generate harmful outputs with very high success rates. We examine the causes of this behavior, finding that the contexts in which single spaces occur in tokenized training data encourage models to generate lists when prompted, overriding training signals to refuse to answer unsafe requests. Our findings underscore the fragile state of current model alignment and promote the importance of developing more robust alignment methods.

Improving Retrieval-augmented Text-to-SQL with AST-based Ranking and Schema Pruning,"Zhili Shen, Pavlos Vougiouklis, Chenxin Diao, Kaustubh Vyas, Yuanyi Ji, Jeff Z. Pan","We focus on Text-to-SQL semantic parsing from the perspective of retrieval-augmented generation. Motivated by challenges related to the size of commercial database schemata and the deployability of business intelligence solutions, we propose $\text{ASTReS}$ that dynamically retrieves input database information and uses abstract syntax trees to select few-shot examples for in-context learning.   Furthermore, we investigate the extent to which an in-parallel semantic parser can be leveraged for generating approximated versions of the expected SQL queries, to support our retrieval. We take this approach to the extreme--we adapt a model consisting of less than $500$M parameters, to act as an extremely efficient approximator, enhancing it with the ability to process schemata in a parallelised manner. We apply $\text{ASTReS}$ to monolingual and cross-lingual benchmarks for semantic parsing, showing improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Comprehensive experiments highlight the contribution of modules involved in this retrieval-augmented generation setting, revealing interesting directions for future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03227v2,2024-07
ESQA: Event Sequences Question Answering,"Irina Abdullaeva, Andrei Filatov, Mikhail Orlov, Ivan Karpukhin, Viacheslav Vasilev, Denis Dimitrov, Andrey Kuznetsov, Ivan Kireev, Andrey Savchenko","Event sequences (ESs) arise in many practical domains including finance, retail, social networks, and healthcare. In the context of machine learning, event sequences can be seen as a special type of tabular data with annotated timestamps. Despite the importance of ESs modeling and analysis, little effort was made in adapting large language models (LLMs) to the ESs domain. In this paper, we highlight the common difficulties of ESs processing and propose a novel solution capable of solving multiple downstream tasks with little or no finetuning. In particular, we solve the problem of working with long sequences and improve time and numeric features processing. The resulting method, called ESQA, effectively utilizes the power of LLMs and, according to extensive experiments, achieves state-of-the-art results in the ESs domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12833v2,2024-07
How Does Quantization Affect Multilingual LLMs?,"Kelly Marchisio, Saurabh Dash, Hongyu Chen, Dennis Aumiller, Ahmet Üstün, Sara Hooker, Sebastian Ruder","Quantization techniques are widely used to improve inference speed and deployment of large language models. While a wide body of work examines the impact of quantization on LLMs in English, none have evaluated across languages. We conduct a thorough analysis of quantized multilingual LLMs, focusing on performance across languages and at varying scales. We use automatic benchmarks, LLM-as-a-Judge, and human evaluation, finding that (1) harmful effects of quantization are apparent in human evaluation, which automatic metrics severely underestimate: a 1.7% average drop in Japanese across automatic tasks corresponds to a 16.0% drop reported by human evaluators on realistic prompts; (2) languages are disparately affected by quantization, with non-Latin script languages impacted worst; and (3) challenging tasks like mathematical reasoning degrade fastest. As the ability to serve low-compute models is critical for wide global adoption of NLP technologies, our results urge consideration of multilingual performance as a key evaluation criterion for efficient models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03211v2,2024-07

Fine-Tuning with Divergent Chains of Thought Boosts Reasoning Through Self-Correction in Language Models,"Haritz Puerto, Tilek Chubakov, Xiaodan Zhu, Harish Tayyar Madabushi, Iryna Gurevych","Requiring a Large Language Model to generate intermediary reasoning steps has been shown to be an effective way of boosting performance. In fact, it has been found that instruction tuning on these intermediary reasoning steps improves model performance. In this work, we present a novel method of further improving performance by requiring models to compare multiple reasoning chains before generating a solution in a single inference step. We call this method Divergent CoT (DCoT). We find that instruction tuning on DCoT datasets boosts the performance of even smaller, and therefore more accessible, LLMs. Through a rigorous set of experiments spanning a wide range of tasks that require various reasoning types, we show that fine-tuning on DCoT consistently improves performance over the CoT baseline across model families and scales (1.3B to 70B). Through a combination of empirical and manual evaluation, we additionally show that these performance gains stem from models generating multiple divergent reasoning chains in a single inference step, indicative of the enabling of self-correction in language models.

SOS! Soft Prompt Attack Against Open-Source Large Language Models,"Ziqing Yang, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang, Ahmed Salem","Open-source large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular among both the general public and industry, as they can be customized, fine-tuned, and freely used. However, some open-source LLMs require approval before usage, which has led to third parties publishing their own easily accessible versions. Similarly, third parties have been publishing fine-tuned or quantized variants of these LLMs. These versions are particularly appealing to users because of their ease of access and reduced computational resource demands. This trend has increased the risk of training time attacks, compromising the integrity and security of LLMs. In this work, we present a new training time attack, SOS, which is designed to be low in computational demand and does not require clean data or modification of the model weights, thereby maintaining the model's utility intact. The attack addresses security issues in various scenarios, including the backdoor attack, jailbreak attack, and prompt stealing attack. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed attack is effective across all evaluated targets. Furthermore, we present the other side of our SOS technique, namely the copyright token -- a novel technique that enables users to mark their copyrighted content and prevent models from using it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03160v1,2024-07
Let the Code LLM Edit Itself When You Edit the Code,"Zhenyu He, Jun Zhang, Shengjie Luo, Jingjing Xu, Zhi Zhang, Di He","In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \underline{\textbf{Positional \textbf{I}ntegrity \textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03157v1,2024-07
Enhancing Translation Accuracy of Large Language Models through Continual Pre-Training on Parallel Data,"Minato Kondo, Takehito Utsuro, Masaaki Nagata","In this paper, we propose a two-phase training approach where pre-trained large language models are continually pre-trained on parallel data and then supervised fine-tuned with a small amount of high-quality parallel data. To investigate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted continual pre-training with a 3.8B-parameter model and parallel data across eight different formats. We evaluate these methods on thirteen test sets for Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese translation. The results demonstrate that when utilizing parallel data in continual pre-training, it is essential to alternate between source and target sentences. Additionally, we demonstrated that the translation accuracy improves only for translation directions where the order of source and target sentences aligns between continual pre-training data and inference. In addition, we demonstrate that the LLM-based translation model is more robust in translating spoken language and achieves higher accuracy with less training data compared to supervised encoder-decoder models. We also show that the highest accuracy is achieved when the data for continual pre-training consists of interleaved source and target sentences and when tags are added to the source sentences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03145v1,2024-07
Speaker- and Text-Independent Estimation of Articulatory Movements and Phoneme Alignments from Speech,"Tobias Weise, Philipp Klumpp, Kubilay Can Demir, Paula Andrea Pérez-Toro, Maria Schuster, Elmar Noeth, Bjoern Heismann, Andreas Maier, Seung Hee Yang","This paper introduces a novel combination of two tasks, previously treated separately: acoustic-to-articulatory speech inversion (AAI) and phoneme-to-articulatory (PTA) motion estimation. We refer to this joint task as acoustic phoneme-to-articulatory speech inversion (APTAI) and explore two different approaches, both working speaker- and text-independently during inference. We use a multi-task learning setup, with the end-to-end goal of taking raw speech as input and estimating the corresponding articulatory movements, phoneme sequence, and phoneme alignment. While both proposed approaches share these same requirements, they differ in their way of achieving phoneme-related predictions: one is based on frame classification, the other on a two-staged training procedure and forced alignment. We reach competitive performance of 0.73 mean correlation for the AAI task and achieve up to approximately 87% frame overlap compared to a state-of-the-art text-dependent phoneme force aligner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03132v1,2024-07
Social Bias Evaluation for Large Language Models Requires Prompt Variations,"Rem Hida, Masahiro Kaneko, Naoaki Okazaki","Warning: This paper contains examples of stereotypes and biases. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable social biases, and various studies have tried to evaluate and mitigate these biases accurately. Previous studies use downstream tasks as prompts to examine the degree of social biases for evaluation and mitigation. While LLMs' output highly depends on prompts, previous studies evaluating and mitigating bias have often relied on a limited variety of prompts. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs when changing prompt variations (task instruction and prompt, few-shot examples, debias-prompt) by analyzing task performance and social bias of LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompts to the extent that the ranking of LLMs fluctuates when comparing models for task performance and social bias. Additionally, we show that LLMs have tradeoffs between performance and social bias caused by the prompts. Less bias from prompt setting may result in reduced performance. Moreover, the ambiguity of instances is one of the reasons for this sensitivity to prompts in advanced LLMs, leading to various outputs. We recommend using diverse prompts, as in this study, to compare the effects of prompts on social bias in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03129v1,2024-07
Sentence-level Aggregation of Lexical Metrics Correlate Stronger with Human Judgements than Corpus-level Aggregation,"Paulo Cavalin, Pedro Henrique Domingues, Claudio Pinhanez","In this paper we show that corpus-level aggregation hinders considerably the capability of lexical metrics to accurately evaluate machine translation (MT) systems. With empirical experiments we demonstrate that averaging individual segment-level scores can make metrics such as BLEU and chrF correlate much stronger with human judgements and make them behave considerably more similar to neural metrics such as COMET and BLEURT. We show that this difference exists because corpus- and segment-level aggregation differs considerably owing to the classical average of ratio versus ratio of averages Mathematical problem. Moreover, as we also show, such difference affects considerably the statistical robustness of corpus-level aggregation. Considering that neural metrics currently only cover a small set of sufficiently-resourced languages, the results in this paper can help make the evaluation of MT systems for low-resource languages more trustworthy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12832v1,2024-07

This surge has accelerated efforts to improve the accessibility of counseling by using large language models (LLMs) as counselors. To ensure client privacy, training open-source LLMs faces a key challenge: the absence of realistic counseling datasets. To address this, we introduce Cactus, a multi-turn dialogue dataset that emulates real-life interactions using the goal-oriented and structured approach of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). We create a diverse and realistic dataset by designing clients with varied, specific personas, and having counselors systematically apply CBT techniques in their interactions. To assess the quality of our data, we benchmark against established psychological criteria used to evaluate real counseling sessions, ensuring alignment with expert evaluations.

Truth is Universal: Robust Detection of Lies in LLMs,"Lennart Bürger, Fred A. Hamprecht, Boaz Nadler","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionised natural language processing, exhibiting impressive human-like capabilities. In particular, LLMs are capable of ""lying"", knowingly outputting false statements. Hence, it is of interest and importance to develop methods to detect when LLMs lie. Indeed, several authors trained classifiers to detect LLM lies based on their internal model activations. However, other researchers showed that these classifiers may fail to generalise, for example to negated statements. In this work, we aim to develop a robust method to detect when an LLM is lying. To this end, we make the following key contributions: (i) We demonstrate the existence of a two-dimensional subspace, along which the activation vectors of true and false statements can be separated. Notably, this finding is universal and holds for various LLMs, including Gemma-7B, LLaMA2-13B, Mistral-7B and LLaMA3-8B. Our analysis explains the generalisation failures observed in previous studies and sets the stage for more robust lie detection; (ii) Building upon (i), we construct an accurate LLM lie detector. Empirically, our proposed classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 94% accuracy in both distinguishing true from false factual statements and detecting lies generated in real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12831v2,2024-07
A Case Study on Context-Aware Neural Machine Translation with Multi-Task Learning,"Ramakrishna Appicharla, Baban Gain, Santanu Pal, Asif Ekbal, Pushpak Bhattacharyya","In document-level neural machine translation (DocNMT), multi-encoder approaches are common in encoding context and source sentences. Recent studies \cite{li-etal-2020-multi-encoder} have shown that the context encoder generates noise and makes the model robust to the choice of context. This paper further investigates this observation by explicitly modelling context encoding through multi-task learning (MTL) to make the model sensitive to the choice of context. We conduct experiments on cascade MTL architecture, which consists of one encoder and two decoders. Generation of the source from the context is considered an auxiliary task, and generation of the target from the source is the main task. We experimented with German--English language pairs on News, TED, and Europarl corpora. Evaluation results show that the proposed MTL approach performs better than concatenation-based and multi-encoder DocNMT models in low-resource settings and is sensitive to the choice of context. However, we observe that the MTL models are failing to generate the source from the context. These observations align with the previous studies, and this might suggest that the available document-level parallel corpora are not context-aware, and a robust sentence-level model can outperform the context-aware models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03076v1,2024-07
ALTER: Augmentation for Large-Table-Based Reasoning,"Han Zhang, Yuheng Ma, Hanfang Yang","While extensive research has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for table-based reasoning, most approaches struggle with scalability when applied to large tables.

By utilizing only a small subset of relevant data from the table and supplementing it with pre-augmented schema, semantic, and literal information, ALTER achieves outstanding performance on table-based reasoning benchmarks. We also provide a detailed analysis of large-table scenarios, comparing different methods and various partitioning principles. In these scenarios, our method outperforms all other approaches and exhibits robustness and efficiency against perturbations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03061v1,2024-07
Improving Conversational Abilities of Quantized Large Language Models via Direct Preference Alignment,"Janghwan Lee, Seongmin Park, Sukjin Hong, Minsoo Kim, Du-Seong Chang, Jungwook Choi","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated their transformation into conversational chatbots that can grasp contextual nuances and generate pertinent sentences, closely mirroring human values through advanced techniques such as instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, the computational efficiency required for LLMs, achieved through techniques like post-training quantization (PTQ), presents challenges such as token-flipping that can impair chatbot performance. In response, we propose a novel preference alignment approach, quantization-aware direct preference optimization (QDPO), that aligns quantized LLMs with their full-precision counterparts, improving conversational abilities. Evaluated on two instruction-tuned LLMs in various languages, QDPO demonstrated superior performance in improving conversational abilities compared to established PTQ and knowledge-distillation fine-tuning techniques, marking a significant step forward in the development of efficient and effective conversational LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03051v2,2024-07
JailbreakHunter: A Visual Analytics Approach for Jailbreak Prompts Discovery from Large-Scale Human-LLM Conversational Datasets,"Zhihua Jin, Shiyi Liu, Haotian Li, Xun Zhao, Huamin Qu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention but also raised concerns due to the risk of misuse. Jailbreak prompts, a popular type of adversarial attack towards LLMs, have appeared and constantly evolved to breach the safety protocols of LLMs. To address this issue, LLMs are regularly updated with safety patches based on reported jailbreak prompts. However, malicious users often keep their successful jailbreak prompts private to exploit LLMs. To uncover these private jailbreak prompts, extensive analysis of large-scale conversational datasets is necessary to identify prompts that still manage to bypass the system's defenses. This task is highly challenging due to the immense volume of conversation data, diverse characteristics of jailbreak prompts, and their presence in complex multi-turn conversations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce JailbreakHunter, a visual analytics approach for identifying jailbreak prompts in large-scale human-LLM conversational datasets. We have designed a workflow with three analysis levels: group-level, conversation-level, and turn-level. Group-level analysis enables users to grasp the distribution of conversations and identify suspicious conversations using multiple criteria, such as similarity with reported jailbreak prompts in previous research and attack success rates. Conversation-level analysis facilitates the understanding of the progress of conversations and helps discover jailbreak prompts within their conversation contexts. Turn-level analysis allows users to explore the semantic similarity and token overlap between a singleturn prompt and the reported jailbreak prompts, aiding in the identification of new jailbreak strategies. The effectiveness and usability of the system were verified through multiple case studies and expert interviews.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03045v1,2024-07
Raw Text is All you Need: Knowledge-intensive Multi-turn Instruction Tuning for Large Language Model,"Xia Hou, Qifeng Li, Jian Yang, Tongliang Li, Linzheng Chai, Xianjie Wu, Hangyuan Ji, Zhoujun Li, Jixuan Nie, Jingbo Dun, Wenfeng Song","Instruction tuning as an effective technique aligns the outputs of large language models (LLMs) with human preference. But how to generate the seasonal multi-turn dialogues from raw documents for instruction tuning still requires further exploration. In this paper, we present a novel framework named R2S that leverages the CoD-Chain of Dialogue logic to guide large language models (LLMs) in generating knowledge-intensive multi-turn dialogues for instruction tuning. By integrating raw documents from both open-source datasets and domain-specific web-crawled documents into a benchmark K-BENCH, we cover diverse areas such as Wikipedia (English), Science (Chinese), and Artifacts (Chinese). Our approach first decides the logic flow of the current dialogue and then prompts LLMs to produce key phrases for sourcing relevant response content. This methodology enables the creation of the G I NSTRUCT instruction dataset, retaining raw document knowledge within dialoguestyle interactions. Utilizing this dataset, we fine-tune GLLM, a model designed to transform raw documents into structured multi-turn dialogues, thereby injecting comprehensive domain knowledge into the SFT model for enhanced instruction tuning. This work signifies a stride towards refining the adaptability and effectiveness of LLMs in processing and generating more accurate, contextually nuanced responses across various fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03040v1,2024-07
On the Client Preference of LLM Fine-tuning in Federated Learning,"Feijie Wu, Xiaoze Liu, Haoyu Wang, Xingchen Wang, Jing Gao","Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using preference datasets, enabling the LLM to generate outputs that align with human preferences. Given the sensitive nature of these preference datasets held by various clients, there is a need to implement RLHF within a federated learning (FL) framework, where clients are reluctant to share their data due to privacy concerns. To address this, we introduce a feasible framework in which clients collaboratively train a binary selector with their preference datasets using our proposed FedBis. With a well-trained selector, we can further enhance the LLM that generates human-preferred completions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel algorithm, FedBiscuit, that trains multiple selectors by organizing clients into balanced and disjoint clusters based on their preferences. Compared to the FedBis, FedBiscuit demonstrates superior performance in simulating human preferences for pairwise completions. Our extensive experiments on federated human preference datasets -- marking the first benchmark to address heterogeneous data partitioning among clients -- demonstrate that FedBiscuit outperforms FedBis and even surpasses traditional centralized training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03038v1,2024-07
Strategies for Arabic Readability Modeling,"Juan Piñeros Liberato, Bashar Alhafni, Muhamed Al Khalil, Nizar Habash","Automatic readability assessment is relevant to building NLP applications for education, content analysis, and accessibility. However, Arabic readability assessment is a challenging task due to Arabic's morphological richness and limited readability resources. In this paper, we present a set of experimental results on Arabic readability assessment using a diverse range of approaches, from rule-based methods to Arabic pretrained language models. We report our results on a newly created corpus at different textual granularity levels (words and sentence fragments). Our results show that combining different techniques yields the best results, achieving an overall macro F1 score of 86.7 at the word level and 87.9 at the fragment level on a blind test set. We make our code, data, and pretrained models publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03032v1,2024-07
Exploiting Dialect Identification in Automatic Dialectal Text Normalization,"Bashar Alhafni, Sarah Al-Towaity, Ziyad Fawzy, Fatema Nassar, Fadhl Eryani, Houda Bouamor, Nizar Habash","Dialectal Arabic is the primary spoken language used by native Arabic speakers in daily communication. The rise of social media platforms has notably expanded its use as a written language. However, Arabic dialects do not have standard orthographies. This, combined with the inherent noise in user-generated content on social media, presents a major challenge to NLP applications dealing with Dialectal Arabic. In this paper, we explore and report on the task of CODAfication, which aims to normalize Dialectal Arabic into the Conventional Orthography for Dialectal Arabic (CODA). We work with a unique parallel corpus of multiple Arabic dialects focusing on five major city dialects. We benchmark newly developed pretrained sequence-to-sequence models on the task of CODAfication. We further show that using dialect identification information improves the performance across all dialects. We make our code, data, and pretrained models publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03020v1,2024-07
Knowledge-based Consistency Testing of Large Language Models,"Sai Sathiesh Rajan, Ezekiel Soremekun, Sudipta Chattopadhyay","In this work, we systematically expose and measure the inconsistency and knowledge gaps of Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, we propose an automated testing framework (called KonTest) which leverages a knowledge graph to construct test cases. KonTest probes and measures the inconsistencies in the LLM's knowledge of the world via a combination of semantically-equivalent queries and test oracles (metamorphic or ontological oracle). KonTest further mitigates knowledge gaps via a weighted LLM model ensemble. Using four state-of-the-art LLMs (Falcon, Gemini, GPT3.5, and Llama2), we show that KonTest generates 19.2% error inducing inputs (1917 errors from 9979 test inputs). It also reveals a 16.5% knowledge gap across all tested LLMs. A mitigation method informed by KonTest's test suite reduces LLM knowledge gap by 32.48%. Our ablation study further shows that GPT3.5 is not suitable for knowledge-based consistency testing because it is only 60%-68% effective in knowledge construction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12830v2,2024-07
What Affects the Stability of Tool Learning? An Empirical Study on the Robustness of Tool Learning Frameworks,"Chengrui Huang, Zhengliang Shi, Yuntao Wen, Xiuying Chen, Peng Han, Shen Gao, Shuo Shang","Tool learning methods have enhanced the ability of large language models (LLMs) to interact with real-world applications. Many existing works fine-tune LLMs or design prompts to enable LLMs to select appropriate tools and correctly invoke them to meet user requirements. However, it is observed in previous works that the performance of tool learning varies from tasks, datasets, training settings, and algorithms. Without understanding the impact of these factors, it can lead to inconsistent results, inefficient model deployment, and suboptimal tool utilization, ultimately hindering the practical integration and scalability of LLMs in real-world scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the impact of both internal and external factors on the performance of tool learning frameworks. Through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, we find several insightful conclusions for future work, including the observation that LLMs can benefit significantly from increased trial and exploration. We believe our empirical study provides a new perspective for future tool learning research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03007v1,2024-07
Human-like Linguistic Biases in Neural Speech Models: Phonetic Categorization and Phonotactic Constraints in Wav2Vec2.0,"Marianne de Heer Kloots, Willem Zuidema","What do deep neural speech models know about phonology? Existing work has examined the encoding of individual linguistic units such as phonemes in these models. Here we investigate interactions between units. Inspired by classic experiments on human speech perception, we study how Wav2Vec2 resolves phonotactic constraints. We synthesize sounds on an acoustic continuum between /l/ and /r/ and embed them in controlled contexts where only /l/, only /r/, or neither occur in English. Like humans, Wav2Vec2 models show a bias towards the phonotactically admissable category in processing such ambiguous sounds. Using simple measures to analyze model internals on the level of individual stimuli, we find that this bias emerges in early layers of the model's Transformer module. This effect is amplified by ASR finetuning but also present in fully self-supervised models. Our approach demonstrates how controlled stimulus designs can help localize specific linguistic knowledge in neural speech models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03005v1,2024-07
SemioLLM: Assessing Large Language Models for Semiological Analysis in Epilepsy Research,"Meghal Dani, Muthu Jeyanthi Prakash, Zeynep Akata, Stefanie Liebe","Large Language Models have shown promising results in their ability to encode general medical knowledge in standard medical question-answering datasets. However, their potential application in clinical practice requires evaluation in domain-specific tasks, where benchmarks are largely missing. In this study semioLLM, we test the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mixtral 8x7B, and Qwen-72chat) to leverage their internal knowledge and reasoning for epilepsy diagnosis. Specifically, we obtain likelihood estimates linking unstructured text descriptions of seizures to seizure-generating brain regions, using an annotated clinical database containing 1269 entries. We evaluate the LLM's performance, confidence, reasoning, and citation abilities in comparison to clinical evaluation. Models achieve above-chance classification performance with prompt engineering significantly improving their outcome, with some models achieving close-to-clinical performance and reasoning. However, our analyses also reveal significant pitfalls with several models being overly confident while showing poor performance, as well as exhibiting citation errors and hallucinations. In summary, our work provides the first extensive benchmark comparing current SOTA LLMs in the medical domain of epilepsy and highlights their ability to leverage unstructured texts from patients' medical history to aid diagnostic processes in health care.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03004v1,2024-07
VIVA: A Benchmark for Vision-Grounded Decision-Making with Human Values,"Zhe Hu, Yixiao Ren, Jing Li, Yu Yin","Large vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for integration into daily life, making it crucial for them to incorporate human values when making decisions in real-world situations. This paper introduces VIVA, a benchmark for VIsion-grounded decision-making driven by human VAlues. While most large VLMs focus on physical-level skills, our work is the first to examine their multimodal capabilities in leveraging human values to make decisions under a vision-depicted situation. VIVA contains 1,240 images depicting diverse real-world situations and the manually annotated decisions grounded in them. Given an image there, the model should select the most appropriate action to address the situation and provide the relevant human values and reason underlying the decision. Extensive experiments based on VIVA show the limitation of VLMs in using human values to make multimodal decisions. Further analyses indicate the potential benefits of exploiting action consequences and predicted human values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03000v2,2024-07
Are Large Language Models Consistent over Value-laden Questions?,"Jared Moore, Tanvi Deshpande, Diyi Yang","Large language models (LLMs) appear to bias their survey answers toward certain values. Nonetheless, some argue that LLMs are too inconsistent to simulate particular values. Are they? To answer, we first define value consistency as the similarity of answers across (1) paraphrases of one question, (2) related questions under one topic, (3) multiple-choice and open-ended use-cases of one question, and (4) multilingual translations of a question to English, Chinese, German, and Japanese. We apply these measures to small and large, open LLMs including llama-3, as well as gpt-4o, using 8,000 questions spanning more than 300 topics. Unlike prior work, we find that models are relatively consistent across paraphrases, use-cases, translations, and within a topic. Still, some inconsistencies remain. Models are more consistent on uncontroversial topics (e.g., in the U.S., ""Thanksgiving"") than on controversial ones (""euthanasia""). Base models are both more consistent compared to fine-tuned models and are uniform in their consistency across topics, while fine-tuned models are more inconsistent about some topics (""euthanasia"") than others (""women's rights"") like our human subjects (n=165).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02996v2,2024-07
LoRA-Guard: Parameter-Efficient Guardrail Adaptation for Content Moderation of Large Language Models,"Hayder Elesedy, Pedro M. Esperança, Silviu Vlad Oprea, Mete Ozay","Guardrails have emerged as an alternative to safety alignment for content moderation of large language models (LLMs). Existing model-based guardrails have not been designed for resource-constrained computational portable devices, such as mobile phones, more and more of which are running LLM-based applications locally. We introduce LoRA-Guard, a parameter-efficient guardrail adaptation method that relies on knowledge sharing between LLMs and guardrail models. LoRA-Guard extracts language features from the LLMs and adapts them for the content moderation task using low-rank adapters, while a dual-path design prevents any performance degradation on the generative task. We show that LoRA-Guard outperforms existing approaches with 100-1000x lower parameter overhead while maintaining accuracy, enabling on-device content moderation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02987v2,2024-07

SemEval 2024 introduces the task of Multigenerator, Multidomain, and Multilingual Black-Box Machine-Generated Text Detection, aiming to develop automated systems for identifying machine-generated text and detecting potential misuse. In this paper, we i) propose a RoBERTa-BiLSTM based classifier designed to classify text into two categories: AI-generated or human ii) conduct a comparative study of our model with baseline approaches to evaluate its effectiveness.

Large Language Models as Evaluators for Scientific Synthesis,"Julia Evans, Jennifer D'Souza, Sören Auer","Our study explores how well the state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-4 and Mistral, can assess the quality of scientific summaries or, more fittingly, scientific syntheses, comparing their evaluations to those of human annotators. We used a dataset of 100 research questions and their syntheses made by GPT-4 from abstracts of five related papers, checked against human quality ratings. The study evaluates both the closed-source GPT-4 and the open-source Mistral model's ability to rate these summaries and provide reasons for their judgments. Preliminary results show that LLMs can offer logical explanations that somewhat match the quality ratings, yet a deeper statistical analysis shows a weak correlation between LLM and human ratings, suggesting the potential and current limitations of LLMs in scientific synthesis evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02977v1,2024-07
FSM: A Finite State Machine Based Zero-Shot Prompting Paradigm for Multi-Hop Question Answering,"Xiaochen Wang, Junqing He, Zhe yang, Yiru Wang, Xiangdi Meng, Kunhao Pan, Zhifang Sui","Large Language Models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (COT) prompting have demonstrated impressive abilities on simple nature language inference tasks. However, they tend to perform poorly on Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) tasks due to several challenges, including hallucination, error propagation and limited context length. We propose a prompting method, Finite State Machine (FSM) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM for complex tasks in addition to improved effectiveness and trustworthiness. Different from COT methods, FSM addresses MHQA by iteratively decomposing a question into multi-turn sub-questions, and self-correcting in time, improving the accuracy of answers in each step. Specifically, FSM addresses one sub-question at a time and decides on the next step based on its current result and state, in an automaton-like format. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method. Although our method performs on par with the baseline on relatively simpler datasets, it excels on challenging datasets like Musique. Moreover, this approach mitigates the hallucination phenomenon, wherein the correct final answer can be recovered despite errors in intermediate reasoning. Furthermore, our method improves LLMs' ability to follow specified output format requirements, significantly reducing the difficulty of answer interpretation and the need for reformatting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02964v1,2024-07
ObfuscaTune: Obfuscated Offsite Fine-tuning and Inference of Proprietary LLMs on Private Datasets,"Ahmed Frikha, Nassim Walha, Ricardo Mendes, Krishna Kanth Nakka, Xue Jiang, Xuebing Zhou","This work addresses the timely yet underexplored problem of performing inference and finetuning of a proprietary LLM owned by a model provider entity on the confidential/private data of another data owner entity, in a way that ensures the confidentiality of both the model and the data. Hereby, the finetuning is conducted offsite, i.e., on the computation infrastructure of a third-party cloud provider. We tackle this problem by proposing ObfuscaTune, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only 5% of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ObfuscaTune by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a na\""ive version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02960v1,2024-07

We propose IncogniText, a technique that anonymizes the text to mislead a potential adversary into predicting a wrong private attribute value. Our empirical evaluation shows a reduction of private attribute leakage by more than 90%. Finally, we demonstrate the maturity of IncogniText for real-world applications by distilling its anonymization capability into a set of LoRA parameters associated with an on-device model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02956v1,2024-07
PII-Compass: Guiding LLM training data extraction prompts towards the target PII via grounding,"Krishna Kanth Nakka, Ahmed Frikha, Ricardo Mendes, Xue Jiang, Xuebing Zhou","The latest and most impactful advances in large models stem from their increased size. Unfortunately, this translates into an improved memorization capacity, raising data privacy concerns. Specifically, it has been shown that models can output personal identifiable information (PII) contained in their training data. However, reported PIII extraction performance varies widely, and there is no consensus on the optimal methodology to evaluate this risk, resulting in underestimating realistic adversaries. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that it is possible to improve the extractability of PII by over ten-fold by grounding the prefix of the manually constructed extraction prompt with in-domain data. Our approach, PII-Compass, achieves phone number extraction rates of 0.92%, 3.9%, and 6.86% with 1, 128, and 2308 queries, respectively, i.e., the phone number of 1 person in 15 is extractable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02943v1,2024-07
Probing the Feasibility of Multilingual Speaker Anonymization,"Sarina Meyer, Florian Lux, Ngoc Thang Vu","In speaker anonymization, speech recordings are modified in a way that the identity of the speaker remains hidden. While this technology could help to protect the privacy of individuals around the globe, current research restricts this by focusing almost exclusively on English data. In this study, we extend a state-of-the-art anonymization system to nine languages by transforming language-dependent components to their multilingual counterparts. Experiments testing the robustness of the anonymized speech against privacy attacks and speech deterioration show an overall success of this system for all languages. The results suggest that speaker embeddings trained on English data can be applied across languages, and that the anonymization performance for a language is mainly affected by the quality of the speech synthesis component used for it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02937v1,2024-07
GraCoRe: Benchmarking Graph Comprehension and Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Zike Yuan, Ming Liu, Hui Wang, Bing Qin","Evaluating the graph comprehension and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging and often incomplete. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on pure graph understanding, lacking a comprehensive evaluation across all graph types and detailed capability definitions. This paper presents GraCoRe, a benchmark for systematically assessing LLMs' graph comprehension and reasoning. GraCoRe uses a three-tier hierarchical taxonomy to categorize and test models on pure graph and heterogeneous graphs, subdividing capabilities into 10 distinct areas tested through 19 tasks. Our benchmark includes 11 datasets with 5,140 graphs of varying complexity. We evaluated three closed-source and seven open-source LLMs, conducting thorough analyses from both ability and task perspectives. Key findings reveal that semantic enrichment enhances reasoning performance, node ordering impacts task success, and the ability to process longer texts does not necessarily improve graph comprehension or reasoning.

ConCodeEval: Evaluating Large Language Models for Code Constraints in Domain-Specific Languages,"Mehant Kammakomati, Sameer Pimparkhede, Srikanth Tamilselvam, Prince Kumar, Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Recent work shows Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to understand natural language constraints for various text generation tasks in zero- and few-shot settings. While, in the code domain, there is wide usage of constraints in code format to maintain the integrity of code written in Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) like JSON and YAML which are widely used for system-level programming tasks in enterprises. Given that LLMs are increasingly used for system-level code tasks, evaluating if they can comprehend these code constraints is crucial. However, no work has been done to evaluate their controllability over code constraints. Hence, we introduce ConCodeEval, a first-of-its-kind benchmark having two novel tasks for code constraints across five representations. Our findings suggest that language models struggle with code constraints. Code languages that perform excellently for normal code tasks do not perform well when the same languages represent fine-grained constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03387v2,2024-07
Explainable Natural Language Processing for Corporate Sustainability Analysis,"Keane Ong, Rui Mao, Ranjan Satapathy, Ricardo Shirota Filho, Erik Cambria, Johan Sulaeman, Gianmarco Mengaldo","Sustainability commonly refers to entities, such as individuals, companies, and institutions, having a non-detrimental (or even positive) impact on the environment, society, and the economy. With sustainability becoming a synonym of acceptable and legitimate behaviour, it is being increasingly demanded and regulated. Several frameworks and standards have been proposed to measure the sustainability impact of corporations, including United Nations' sustainable development goals and the recently introduced global sustainability reporting framework, amongst others. However, the concept of corporate sustainability is complex due to the diverse and intricate nature of firm operations (i.e. geography, size, business activities, interlinks with other stakeholders). As a result, corporate sustainability assessments are plagued by subjectivity both within data that reflect corporate sustainability efforts (i.e. corporate sustainability disclosures) and the analysts evaluating them. This subjectivity can be distilled into distinct challenges, such as incompleteness, ambiguity, unreliability and sophistication on the data dimension, as well as limited resources and potential bias on the analyst dimension. Put together, subjectivity hinders effective cost attribution to entities non-compliant with prevailing sustainability expectations, potentially rendering sustainability efforts and its associated regulations futile. To this end, we argue that Explainable Natural Language Processing (XNLP) can significantly enhance corporate sustainability analysis. Specifically, linguistic understanding algorithms (lexical, semantic, syntactic), integrated with XAI capabilities (interpretability, explainability, faithfulness), can bridge gaps in analyst resources and mitigate subjectivity problems within data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17487v3,2024-07
Translatotron-V(ison): An End-to-End Model for In-Image Machine Translation,"Zhibin Lan, Liqiang Niu, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou, Min Zhang, Jinsong Su","In-image machine translation (IIMT) aims to translate an image containing texts in source language into an image containing translations in target language. In this regard, conventional cascaded methods suffer from issues such as error propagation, massive parameters, and difficulties in deployment and retaining visual characteristics of the input image. Thus, constructing end-to-end models has become an option, which, however, faces two main challenges: 1) the huge modeling burden, as it is required to simultaneously learn alignment across languages and preserve the visual characteristics of the input image; 2) the difficulties of directly predicting excessively lengthy pixel sequences. In this paper, we propose \textit{Translatotron-V(ision)}, an end-to-end IIMT model consisting of four modules. In addition to an image encoder, and an image decoder, our model contains a target text decoder and an image tokenizer. Among them, the target text decoder is used to alleviate the language alignment burden, and the image tokenizer converts long sequences of pixels into shorter sequences of visual tokens, preventing the model from focusing on low-level visual features. Besides, we present a two-stage training framework for our model to assist the model in learning alignment across modalities and languages. Finally, we propose a location-aware evaluation metric called Structure-BLEU to assess the translation quality of the generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance compared to cascaded models with only 70.9\% of parameters, and significantly outperforms the pixel-level end-to-end IIMT model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02894v1,2024-07
GPTQT: Quantize Large Language Models Twice to Push the Efficiency,"Yipin Guo, Yilin Lang, Qinyuan Ren","Due to their large size, generative Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant computing and storage resources. This paper introduces a new post-training quantization method, GPTQT, to reduce memory usage and enhance processing speed by expressing the weight of LLM in 3bit/2bit. Practice has shown that minimizing the quantization error of weights is ineffective, leading to overfitting. Therefore, GPTQT employs a progressive two-step approach: initially quantizing weights using Linear quantization to a relatively high bit, followed by converting obtained int weight to lower bit binary coding. A re-explore strategy is proposed to optimize initial scaling factor. During inference, these steps are merged into pure binary coding, enabling efficient computation. Testing across various models and datasets confirms GPTQT's effectiveness. Compared to the strong 3-bit quantization baseline, GPTQT further reduces perplexity by 4.01 on opt-66B and increases speed by 1.24 times on opt-30b. The results on Llama2 show that GPTQT is currently the best binary coding quantization method for such kind of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02891v1,2024-07

Contrast then Memorize: Semantic Neighbor Retrieval-Enhanced Inductive Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion,"Yu Zhao, Ying Zhang, Baohang Zhou, Xinying Qian, Kehui Song, Xiangrui Cai","A large number of studies have emerged for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (MKGC) to predict the missing links in MKGs. However, fewer studies have been proposed to study the inductive MKGC (IMKGC) involving emerging entities unseen during training. Existing inductive approaches focus on learning textual entity representations, which neglect rich semantic information in visual modality. Moreover, they focus on aggregating structural neighbors from existing KGs, which of emerging entities are usually limited. However, the semantic neighbors are decoupled from the topology linkage and usually imply the true target entity. In this paper, we propose the IMKGC task and a semantic neighbor retrieval-enhanced IMKGC framework CMR, where the contrast brings the helpful semantic neighbors close, and then the memorize supports semantic neighbor retrieval to enhance inference. Specifically, we first propose a unified cross-modal contrastive learning to simultaneously capture the textual-visual and textual-textual correlations of query-entity pairs in a unified representation space. The contrastive learning increases the similarity of positive query-entity pairs, therefore making the representations of helpful semantic neighbors close. Then, we explicitly memorize the knowledge representations to support the semantic neighbor retrieval. At test time, we retrieve the nearest semantic neighbors and interpolate them to the query-entity similarity distribution to augment the final prediction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CMR on three inductive MKGC datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/OreOZhao/CMR.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02867v1,2024-07
Safe Unlearning: A Surprisingly Effective and Generalizable Solution to Defend Against Jailbreak Attacks,"Zhexin Zhang, Junxiao Yang, Pei Ke, Shiyao Cui, Chujie Zheng, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang","LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, even after safety alignment. An important observation is that, while different types of jailbreak attacks can generate significantly different queries, they mostly result in similar responses that are rooted in the same harmful knowledge (e.g., detailed steps to make a bomb). Therefore, we conjecture that directly unlearn the harmful knowledge in the LLM can be a more effective way to defend against jailbreak attacks than the mainstream supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the surprising generalizability of our unlearning-based approach: using only 20 raw harmful questions without any jailbreak prompt during training, our solution reduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in Vicuna-7B from 82.6% to 7.7% on out-of-distribution (OOD) harmful questions wrapped with various complex jailbreak prompts . This significantly outperforms Llama2-7B-Chat, which is fine-tuned on about 0.1M safety alignment samples but still has an ASR of 21.9% even under the help of an additional safety system prompt. Further analysis reveals that the generalization ability of our solution may stem from the intrinsic relatedness among harmful responses across harmful questions (e.g., response patterns, shared steps and actions in response, and similarity among their learned representations in the LLM).

A Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning as an Alternative to Traditional Glosses in Sign Language Translation and Production,"Eui Jun Hwang, Sukmin Cho, Huije Lee, Youngwoo Yoon, Jong C. Park","This work addresses the challenges associated with the use of glosses in both Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Sign Language Production (SLP). While glosses have long been used as a bridge between sign language and spoken language, they come with two major limitations that impede the advancement of sign language systems. First, annotating the glosses is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, which limits the scalability of datasets. Second, the glosses oversimplify sign language by stripping away its spatio-temporal dynamics, reducing complex signs to basic labels and missing the subtle movements essential for precise interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce Universal Gloss-level Representation (UniGloR), a framework designed to capture the spatio-temporal features inherent in sign language, providing a more dynamic and detailed alternative to the use of the glosses. The core idea of UniGloR is simple yet effective: We derive dense spatio-temporal representations from sign keypoint sequences using self-supervised learning and seamlessly integrate them into SLT and SLP tasks. Our experiments in a keypoint-based setting demonstrate that UniGloR either outperforms or matches the performance of previous SLT and SLP methods on two widely-used datasets: PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02854v2,2024-07
MindBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Mind Map Structure Recognition and Analysis,"Lei Chen, Feng Yan, Yujie Zhong, Shaoxiang Chen, Zequn Jie, Lin Ma","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have made significant progress in the field of document analysis. Despite this, existing benchmarks typically focus only on extracting text and simple layout information, neglecting the complex interactions between elements in structured documents such as mind maps and flowcharts. To address this issue, we introduce the new benchmark named MindBench, which not only includes meticulously constructed bilingual authentic or synthetic images, detailed annotations, evaluation metrics and baseline models, but also specifically designs five types of structured understanding and parsing tasks. These tasks include full parsing, partial parsing, position-related parsing, structured Visual Question Answering (VQA), and position-related VQA, covering key areas such as text recognition, spatial awareness, relationship discernment, and structured parsing. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the substantial potential and significant room for improvement in current models' ability to handle structured document information. We anticipate that the launch of MindBench will significantly advance research and application development in structured document analysis technology.

Comparing Feature-based and Context-aware Approaches to PII Generalization Level Prediction,"Kailin Zhang, Xinying Qiu","Protecting Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in text data is crucial for privacy, but current PII generalization methods face challenges such as uneven data distributions and limited context awareness. To address these issues, we propose two approaches: a feature-based method using machine learning to improve performance on structured inputs, and a novel context-aware framework that considers the broader context and semantic relationships between the original text and generalized candidates. The context-aware approach employs Multilingual-BERT for text representation, functional transformations, and mean squared error scoring to evaluate candidates. Experiments on the WikiReplace dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods, with the context-aware approach outperforming the feature-based one across different scales. This work contributes to advancing PII generalization techniques by highlighting the importance of feature selection, ensemble learning, and incorporating contextual information for better privacy protection in text anonymization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02837v1,2024-07
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Techniques: A Comparative Study,"Dineth Jayakody, Koshila Isuranda, A V A Malkith, Nisansa de Silva, Sachintha Rajith Ponnamperuma, G G N Sandamali, K L K Sudheera","Since the dawn of the digitalisation era, customer feedback and online reviews are unequivocally major sources of insights for businesses. Consequently, conducting comparative analyses of such sources has become the de facto modus operandi of any business that wishes to give itself a competitive edge over its peers and improve customer loyalty. Sentiment analysis is one such method instrumental in gauging public interest, exposing market trends, and analysing competitors. While traditional sentiment analysis focuses on overall sentiment, as the needs advance with time, it has become important to explore public opinions and sentiments on various specific subjects, products and services mentioned in the reviews on a finer-granular level. To this end, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), supported by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques which have contributed to a paradigm shift from simple word-level analysis to tone and context-aware analyses, focuses on identifying specific aspects within the text and determining the sentiment associated with each aspect. In this study, we compare several deep-NN methods for ABSA on two benchmark datasets (Restaurant14 and Laptop-14) and found that FAST LSA obtains the best overall results of 87.6% and 82.6% accuracy but does not pass LSA+DeBERTa which reports 90.33% and 86.21% accuracy respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02834v3,2024-07
LANE: Logic Alignment of Non-tuning Large Language Models and Online Recommendation Systems for Explainable Reason Generation,"Hongke Zhao, Songming Zheng, Likang Wu, Bowen Yu, Jing Wang","The explainability of recommendation systems is crucial for enhancing user trust and satisfaction. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for comprehensive recommendation logic generation. However, in existing related studies, fine-tuning LLM models for recommendation tasks incurs high computational costs and alignment issues with existing systems, limiting the application potential of proven proprietary/closed-source LLM models, such as GPT-4. In this work, our proposed effective strategy LANE aligns LLMs with online recommendation systems without additional LLMs tuning, reducing costs and improving explainability. This innovative approach addresses key challenges in integrating language models with recommendation systems while fully utilizing the capabilities of powerful proprietary models. Specifically, our strategy operates through several key components: semantic embedding, user multi-preference extraction using zero-shot prompting, semantic alignment, and explainable recommendation generation using Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. By embedding item titles instead of IDs and utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms, our approach aligns the semantic features of user preferences with those of candidate items, ensuring coherent and user-aligned recommendations. Sufficient experimental results including performance comparison, questionnaire voting, and visualization cases prove that our method can not only ensure recommendation performance, but also provide easy-to-understand and reasonable recommendation logic.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02833v1,2024-07
RDBE: Reasoning Distillation-Based Evaluation Enhances Automatic Essay Scoring,Ali Ghiasvand Mohammadkhani,"Recently, various encoder-only and encoder-decoder pre-trained models like BERT and T5 have been applied to automatic essay scoring (AES) as small language models. However, existing studies have primarily treated this task akin to a classification problem, focusing solely on outputting scores in the target text without offering interpretations for the generated scores. Departing from the approaches, we introduce Reasoning Distillation-Based Evaluation (RDBE), which integrates interpretability to elucidate the rationale behind model scores while enhancing performance through initial reasoning. This interpretive capability is acquired during training by leveraging generated reasoning from a large language model (LLM) to distill a small language model (SLM). Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RDBE across all scoring rubrics considered in the dataset. RDBE outperforms both zero-shot LLM generation and generation from a baseline fine-tuned model, establishing itself as state-of-the-art in the corresponding dataset. This highlights its practical interpretative output and enhanced performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13781v1,2024-07
Investigating the Contextualised Word Embedding Dimensions Specified for Contextual and Temporal Semantic Changes,"Taichi Aida, Danushka Bollegala","The sense-aware contextualised word embeddings (SCWEs) encode semantic changes of words within the contextualised word embedding (CWE) spaces. Despite the superior performance of SCWEs in contextual/temporal semantic change detection (SCD) benchmarks, it remains unclear as to how the meaning changes are encoded in the embedding space. To study this, we compare pre-trained CWEs and their fine-tuned versions on contextual and temporal semantic change benchmarks under Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) transformations. Our experimental results reveal (a) although there exist a smaller number of axes that are specific to semantic changes of words in the pre-trained CWE space, this information gets distributed across all dimensions when fine-tuned, and (b) in contrast to prior work studying the geometry of CWEs, we find that PCA to better represent semantic changes than ICA within the top 10% of axes. These findings encourage the development of more efficient SCD methods with a small number of SCD-aware dimensions.

Efficient Training of Language Models with Compact and Consistent Next Token Distributions,"Ashutosh Sathe, Sunita Sarawagi","Maximizing the likelihood of the next token is an established, statistically sound objective for pre-training language models. In this paper we show that we can train better models faster by pre-aggregating the corpus with a collapsed $n$-gram distribution. Previous studies have proposed corpus-level $n$-gram statistics as a regularizer; however, the construction and querying of such $n$-grams, if done naively, prove to be costly and significantly impede training speed, thereby limiting their application in modern large language model pre-training.   We introduce an alternative compact representation of the next token distribution that, in expectation, aligns with the complete $n$-gram distribution while markedly reducing variance across mini-batches compared to the standard next-token loss. Empirically, we demonstrate that both the $n$-gram regularized model and our approximation yield substantial improvements in model quality and convergence rate compared to existing methods. Furthermore, our approximation facilitates scalability of gains to larger datasets and models compared to the straightforward $n$-gram regularization method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02819v1,2024-07
Images Speak Louder than Words: Understanding and Mitigating Bias in Vision-Language Model from a Causal Mediation Perspective,"Zhaotian Weng, Zijun Gao, Jerone Andrews, Jieyu Zhao","Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on extensive datasets can inadvertently learn biases by correlating gender information with specific objects or scenarios. Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and monitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to comprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We propose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and map the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach allows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the indirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model components. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors to bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically accounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses that of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation confirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are aligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender representations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model bias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or increased computational demands.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02814v2,2024-07

A Framework for Quantum Finite-State Languages with Density Mapping,"SeungYeop Baik, Sicheol Sung, Yo-Sub Han","A quantum finite-state automaton (QFA) is a theoretical model designed to simulate the evolution of a quantum system with finite memory in response to sequential input strings. We define the language of a QFA as the set of strings that lead the QFA to an accepting state when processed from its initial state. QFAs exemplify how quantum computing can achieve greater efficiency compared to classical computing. While being one of the simplest quantum models, QFAs are still notably challenging to construct from scratch due to the preliminary knowledge of quantum mechanics required for superimposing unitary constraints on the automata. Furthermore, even when QFAs are correctly assembled, the limitations of a current quantum computer may cause fluctuations in the simulation results depending on how an assembled QFA is translated into a quantum circuit.   We present a framework that provides a simple and intuitive way to build QFAs and maximize the simulation accuracy. Our framework relies on two methods: First, it offers a predefined construction for foundational types of QFAs that recognize special languages MOD and EQU. They play a role of basic building blocks for more complex QFAs. In other words, one can obtain more complex QFAs from these foundational automata using standard language operations. Second, we improve the simulation accuracy by converting these QFAs into quantum circuits such that the resulting circuits perform well on noisy quantum computers.

MLKD-BERT: Multi-level Knowledge Distillation for Pre-trained Language Models,"Ying Zhang, Ziheng Yang, Shufan Ji","Knowledge distillation is an effective technique for pre-trained language model compression. Although existing knowledge distillation methods perform well for the most typical model BERT, they could be further improved in two aspects: the relation-level knowledge could be further explored to improve model performance; and the setting of student attention head number could be more flexible to decrease inference time. Therefore, we are motivated to propose a novel knowledge distillation method MLKD-BERT to distill multi-level knowledge in teacher-student framework. Extensive experiments on GLUE benchmark and extractive question answering tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge distillation methods on BERT. In addition, MLKD-BERT can flexibly set student attention head number, allowing for substantial inference time decrease with little performance drop.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02775v1,2024-07
Automatic gradient descent with generalized Newton's method,"Zhiqi Bu, Shiyun Xu","We propose the generalized Newton's method (GeN) -- a Hessian-informed approach that applies to any optimizer such as SGD and Adam, and covers the Newton-Raphson method as a sub-case. Our method automatically and dynamically selects the learning rate that accelerates the convergence, without the intensive tuning of the learning rate scheduler. In practice, out method is easily implementable, since it only requires additional forward passes with almost zero computational overhead (in terms of training time and memory cost), if the overhead is amortized over many iterations. We present extensive experiments on language and vision tasks (e.g. GPT and ResNet) to showcase that GeN optimizers match the state-of-the-art performance, which was achieved with carefully tuned learning rate schedulers.

Emotion and Intent Joint Understanding in Multimodal Conversation: A Benchmarking Dataset,"Rui Liu, Haolin Zuo, Zheng Lian, Xiaofen Xing, Björn W. Schuller, Haizhou Li","Emotion and Intent Joint Understanding in Multimodal Conversation (MC-EIU) aims to decode the semantic information manifested in a multimodal conversational history, while inferring the emotions and intents simultaneously for the current utterance. MC-EIU is enabling technology for many human-computer interfaces. However, there is a lack of available datasets in terms of annotation, modality, language diversity, and accessibility. In this work, we propose an MC-EIU dataset, which features 7 emotion categories, 9 intent categories, 3 modalities, i.e., textual, acoustic, and visual content, and two languages, i.e., English and Mandarin. Furthermore, it is completely open-source for free access. To our knowledge, MC-EIU is the first comprehensive and rich emotion and intent joint understanding dataset for multimodal conversation. Together with the release of the dataset, we also develop an Emotion and Intent Interaction (EI$^2$) network as a reference system by modeling the deep correlation between emotion and intent in the multimodal conversation.

Learning to Reduce: Towards Improving Performance of Large Language Models on Structured Data,"Younghun Lee, Sungchul Kim, Ryan A. Rossi, Tong Yu, Xiang Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been achieving competent performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, yet existing work shows that inference on structured data is challenging for LLMs. This is because LLMs need to either understand long structured data or select the most relevant evidence before inference, and both approaches are not trivial. This paper proposes a framework, Learning to Reduce, that fine-tunes a language model with On-Policy Learning to generate a reduced version of an input structured data. When compared to state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4, Learning to Reduce not only achieves outstanding performance in reducing the input, but shows generalizability on different datasets. We further show that the model fine-tuned with our framework helps LLMs better perform on table QA tasks especially when the context is longer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02750v1,2024-07
A Comparative Study of DSL Code Generation: Fine-Tuning vs. Optimized Retrieval Augmentation,"Nastaran Bassamzadeh, Chhaya Methani","Natural Language to Code Generation has made significant progress in recent years with the advent of Large Language Models(LLMs). While generation for general-purpose languages like C, C++, and Python has improved significantly, LLMs struggle with custom function names in Domain Specific Languages or DSLs. This leads to higher hallucination rates and syntax errors, specially for DSLs having a high number of custom function names. Additionally, constant updates to function names add to the challenge as LLMs need to stay up-to-date. In this paper, we present optimizations for using Retrieval Augmented Generation (or RAG) with LLMs for DSL generation along with an ablation study comparing these strategies. We generated a train as well as test dataset with a DSL to represent automation tasks across roughly 700 APIs in public domain. We used the training dataset to fine-tune a Codex model for this DSL. Our results showed that the fine-tuned model scored the best on code similarity metric. With our RAG optimizations, we achieved parity for similarity metric. The compilation rate, however, showed that both the models still got the syntax wrong many times, with RAG-based method being 2 pts better. Conversely, hallucination rate for RAG model lagged by 1 pt for API names and by 2 pts for API parameter keys. We conclude that an optimized RAG model can match the quality of fine-tuned models and offer advantages for new, unseen APIs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02742v1,2024-07

We also examine different setups for decoding algorithms, model ensembling or merging, and model specialization. Our results show that conditioning on the content of discharge summary prior to the target sections is effective for the generation task.

LLM-Select: Feature Selection with Large Language Models,"Daniel P. Jeong, Zachary C. Lipton, Pradeep Ravikumar","In this paper, we demonstrate a surprising capability of large language models (LLMs): given only input feature names and a description of a prediction task, they are capable of selecting the most predictive features, with performance rivaling the standard tools of data science. Remarkably, these models exhibit this capacity across various query mechanisms. For example, we zero-shot prompt an LLM to output a numerical importance score for a feature (e.g., ""blood pressure"") in predicting an outcome of interest (e.g., ""heart failure""), with no additional context. In particular, we find that the latest models, such as GPT-4, can consistently identify the most predictive features regardless of the query mechanism and across various prompting strategies. We illustrate these findings through extensive experiments on real-world data, where we show that LLM-based feature selection consistently achieves strong performance competitive with data-driven methods such as the LASSO, despite never having looked at the downstream training data. Our findings suggest that LLMs may be useful not only for selecting the best features for training but also for deciding which features to collect in the first place. This could potentially benefit practitioners in domains like healthcare, where collecting high-quality data comes at a high cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02694v1,2024-07

We establish a connection between the expressive power of LLMs and the density of their self-attention graphs. Our analysis demonstrates that the density of these graphs defines the intrinsic dimension of the inputs to the MLP blocks. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and toy examples that a higher intrinsic dimension implies a greater expressive capacity of the LLM. We further provide empirical evidence linking this geometric framework to recent advancements in methods aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02678v1,2024-07

LLMs Plagiarize: Ensuring Responsible Sourcing of Large Language Model Training Data Through Knowledge Graph Comparison,"Devam Mondal, Carlo Lipizzi","In light of recent legal allegations brought by publishers, newspapers, and other creators of copyrighted corpora against large language model developers who use their copyrighted materials for training or fine-tuning purposes, we propose a novel system, a variant of a plagiarism detection system, that assesses whether a knowledge source has been used in the training or fine-tuning of a large language model. Unlike current methods, we utilize an approach that uses Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples to create knowledge graphs from both a source document and an LLM continuation of that document. These graphs are then analyzed with respect to content using cosine similarity and with respect to structure using a normalized version of graph edit distance that shows the degree of isomorphism. Unlike traditional plagiarism systems that focus on content matching and keyword identification between a source and a target corpus, our approach enables a broader and more accurate evaluation of similarity between a source document and LLM continuation by focusing on relationships between ideas and their organization with regards to others. Additionally, our approach does not require access to LLM metrics like perplexity that may be unavailable in closed large language model ""black-box"" systems, as well as the training corpus. We thus assess whether an LLM has ""plagiarized"" a corpus in its continuation through similarity measures. A prototype of our system will be found on a hyperlinked GitHub repository.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02659v2,2024-07

With this data, we widen the scope of the direction of reframing since the changes in perspective do not only occur in neutral or positive directions.

Uplifting Lower-Income Data: Strategies for Socioeconomic Perspective Shifts in Large Multi-modal Models,"Joan Nwatu, Oana Ignat, Rada Mihalcea","Recent work has demonstrated that the unequal representation of cultures and socioeconomic groups in training data leads to biased Large Multi-modal (LMM) models. To improve LMM model performance on underrepresented data, we propose and evaluate several prompting strategies using non-English, geographic, and socioeconomic attributes. We show that these geographic and socioeconomic integrated prompts favor retrieving topic appearances commonly found in data from low-income households across different countries leading to improved LMM model performance on lower-income data. Our analyses identify and highlight contexts where these strategies yield the most improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02623v3,2024-07
D-Rax: Domain-specific Radiologic assistant leveraging multi-modal data and eXpert model predictions,"Hareem Nisar, Syed Muhammad Anwar, Zhifan Jiang, Abhijeet Parida, Ramon Sanchez-Jacob, Vishwesh Nath, Holger R. Roth, Marius George Linguraru","Large vision language models (VLMs) have progressed incredibly from research to applicability for general-purpose use cases. LLaVA-Med, a pioneering large language and vision assistant for biomedicine, can perform multi-modal biomedical image and data analysis to provide a natural language interface for radiologists. While it is highly generalizable and works with multi-modal data, it is currently limited by well-known challenges that exist in the large language model space. Hallucinations and imprecision in responses can lead to misdiagnosis which currently hinder the clinical adaptability of VLMs. To create precise, user-friendly models in healthcare, we propose D-Rax -- a domain-specific, conversational, radiologic assistance tool that can be used to gain insights about a particular radiologic image. In this study, we enhance the conversational analysis of chest X-ray (CXR) images to support radiological reporting, offering comprehensive insights from medical imaging and aiding in the formulation of accurate diagnosis. D-Rax is achieved by fine-tuning the LLaVA-Med architecture on our curated enhanced instruction-following data, comprising of images, instructions, as well as disease diagnosis and demographic predictions derived from MIMIC-CXR imaging data, CXR-related visual question answer (VQA) pairs, and predictive outcomes from multiple expert AI models. We observe statistically significant improvement in responses when evaluated for both open and close-ended conversations. Leveraging the power of state-of-the-art diagnostic models combined with VLMs, D-Rax empowers clinicians to interact with medical images using natural language, which could potentially streamline their decision-making process, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and conserve their time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02604v2,2024-07
Towards More Realistic Extraction Attacks: An Adversarial Perspective,"Yash More, Prakhar Ganesh, Golnoosh Farnadi","Language models are prone to memorizing parts of their training data which makes them vulnerable to extraction attacks. Existing research often examines isolated setups--such as evaluating extraction risks from a single model or with a fixed prompt design. However, a real-world adversary could access models across various sizes and checkpoints, as well as exploit prompt sensitivity, resulting in a considerably larger attack surface than previously studied. In this paper, we revisit extraction attacks from an adversarial perspective, focusing on how to leverage the brittleness of language models and the multi-faceted access to the underlying data. We find significant churn in extraction trends, i.e., even unintuitive changes to the prompt, or targeting smaller models and earlier checkpoints, can extract distinct information. By combining information from multiple attacks, our adversary is able to increase the extraction risks by up to $2 \times$. Furthermore, even with mitigation strategies like data deduplication, we find the same escalation of extraction risks against a real-world adversary. We conclude with a set of case studies, including detecting pre-training data, copyright violations, and extracting personally identifiable information, showing how our more realistic adversary can outperform existing adversaries in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02596v2,2024-07
MInference 1.0: Accelerating Pre-filling for Long-Context LLMs via Dynamic Sparse Attention,"Huiqiang Jiang, Yucheng Li, Chengruidong Zhang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Surin Ahn, Zhenhua Han, Amir H. Abdi, Dongsheng Li, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu","The computational challenges of Large Language Model (LLM) inference remain a significant barrier to their widespread deployment, especially as prompt lengths continue to increase. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens (i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for speeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency when applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference (Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate pre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique patterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and Block-Sparsethat can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We determine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically build sparse indices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the pattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations via our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the pre-filling stage of long-context LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly applied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. By evaluating on a wide range of downstream tasks, including InfiniteBench, RULER, PG-19, and Needle In A Haystack, and models including LLaMA-3-1M, GLM4-1M, Yi-200K, Phi-3-128K, and Qwen2-128K, we demonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x for pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.

Neurocache: Efficient Vector Retrieval for Long-range Language Modeling,"Ali Safaya, Deniz Yuret","This paper introduces Neurocache, an approach to extend the effective context size of large language models (LLMs) using an external vector cache to store its past states. Like recent vector retrieval approaches, Neurocache uses an efficient k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) algorithm to retrieve relevant past states and incorporate them into the attention process. Neurocache improves upon previous methods by (1) storing compressed states, which reduces cache size; (2) performing a single retrieval operation per token which increases inference speed; and (3) extending the retrieval window to neighboring states, which improves both language modeling and downstream task accuracy. Our experiments show the effectiveness of Neurocache both for models trained from scratch and for pre-trained models such as Llama2-7B and Mistral-7B when enhanced with the cache mechanism. We also compare Neurocache with text retrieval methods and show improvements in single-document question-answering and few-shot learning tasks. We made the source code available under: https://github.com/alisafaya/neurocache",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02486v1,2024-07
RankRAG: Unifying Context Ranking with Retrieval-Augmented Generation in LLMs,"Yue Yu, Wei Ping, Zihan Liu, Boxin Wang, Jiaxuan You, Chao Zhang, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro","Large language models (LLMs) typically utilize the top-k contexts from a retriever in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this work, we propose a novel instruction fine-tuning framework RankRAG, which instruction-tunes a single LLM for the dual purpose of context ranking and answer generation in RAG. In particular, the instruction-tuned LLMs work surprisingly well by adding a small fraction of ranking data into the training blend, and outperform existing expert ranking models, including the same LLM exclusively fine-tuned on a large amount of ranking data. For generation, we compare our model with many strong baselines, including GPT-4-0613, GPT-4-turbo-2024-0409, and ChatQA-1.5, an open-sourced model with the state-of-the-art performance on RAG benchmarks. Specifically, our Llama3-RankRAG significantly outperforms Llama3-ChatQA-1.5 and GPT-4 models on nine knowledge-intensive benchmarks. In addition, it also performs comparably to GPT-4 on five RAG benchmarks in the biomedical domain without instruction fine-tuning on biomedical data, demonstrating its superb capability for generalization to new domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02485v1,2024-07
MMedAgent: Learning to Use Medical Tools with Multi-modal Agent,"Binxu Li, Tiankai Yan, Yuanting Pan, Jie Luo, Ruiyang Ji, Jiayuan Ding, Zhe Xu, Shilong Liu, Haoyu Dong, Zihao Lin, Yixin Wang","Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite being successful, exhibit limited generality and often fall short when compared to specialized models. Recently, LLM-based agents have been developed to address these challenges by selecting appropriate specialized models as tools based on user inputs. However, such advancements have not been extensively explored within the medical domain. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the first agent explicitly designed for the medical field, named \textbf{M}ulti-modal \textbf{Med}ical \textbf{Agent} (MMedAgent). We curate an instruction-tuning dataset comprising six medical tools solving seven tasks across five modalities, enabling the agent to choose the most suitable tools for a given task. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMedAgent achieves superior performance across a variety of medical tasks compared to state-of-the-art open-source methods and even the closed-source model, GPT-4o. Furthermore, MMedAgent exhibits efficiency in updating and integrating new medical tools. Codes and models are all available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02483v2,2024-07
Understanding Alignment in Multimodal LLMs: A Comprehensive Study,"Elmira Amirloo, Jean-Philippe Fauconnier, Christoph Roesmann, Christian Kerl, Rinu Boney, Yusu Qian, Zirui Wang, Afshin Dehghan, Yinfei Yang, Zhe Gan, Peter Grasch","Preference alignment has become a crucial component in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its impact in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains comparatively underexplored. Similar to language models, MLLMs for image understanding tasks encounter challenges like hallucination. In MLLMs, hallucination can occur not only by stating incorrect facts but also by producing responses that are inconsistent with the image content. A primary objective of alignment for MLLMs is to encourage these models to align responses more closely with image information. Recently, multiple works have introduced preference datasets for MLLMs and examined different alignment methods, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, due to variations in datasets, base model types, and alignment methods, it remains unclear which specific elements contribute most significantly to the reported improvements in these works. In this paper, we independently analyze each aspect of preference alignment in MLLMs. We start by categorizing the alignment algorithms into two groups, offline (such as DPO), and online (such as online-DPO), and show that combining offline and online methods can improve the performance of the model in certain scenarios. We review a variety of published multimodal preference datasets and discuss how the details of their construction impact model performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a novel way of creating multimodal preference data called Bias-Driven Hallucination Sampling (BDHS) that needs neither additional annotation nor external models, and show that it can achieve competitive performance to previously published alignment work for multimodal models across a range of benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02477v1,2024-07
ValueScope: Unveiling Implicit Norms and Values via Return Potential Model of Social Interactions,"Chan Young Park, Shuyue Stella Li, Hayoung Jung, Svitlana Volkova, Tanushree Mitra, David Jurgens, Yulia Tsvetkov","This study introduces ValueScope, a framework leveraging language models to quantify social norms and values within online communities, grounded in social science perspectives on normative structures. We employ ValueScope to dissect and analyze linguistic and stylistic expressions across 13 Reddit communities categorized under gender, politics, science, and finance. Our analysis provides a quantitative foundation showing that even closely related communities exhibit remarkably diverse norms. This diversity supports existing theories and adds a new dimension--community preference--to understanding community interactions. ValueScope not only delineates differing social norms among communities but also effectively traces their evolution and the influence of significant external events like the U.S. presidential elections and the emergence of new sub-communities. The framework thus highlights the pivotal role of social norms in shaping online interactions, presenting a substantial advance in both the theory and application of social norm studies in digital spaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02472v2,2024-07
RLHF Can Speak Many Languages: Unlocking Multilingual Preference Optimization for LLMs,"John Dang, Arash Ahmadian, Kelly Marchisio, Julia Kreutzer, Ahmet Üstün, Sara Hooker","Preference optimization techniques have become a standard final stage for training state-of-art large language models (LLMs). However, despite widespread adoption, the vast majority of work to-date has focused on first-class citizen languages like English and Chinese. This captures a small fraction of the languages in the world, but also makes it unclear which aspects of current state-of-the-art research transfer to a multilingual setting. In this work, we perform an exhaustive study to achieve a new state-of-the-art in aligning multilingual LLMs. We introduce a novel, scalable method for generating high-quality multilingual feedback data to balance data coverage. We establish the benefits of cross-lingual transfer and increased dataset size in preference training. Our preference-trained model achieves a 54.4% win-rate against Aya 23 8B, the current state-of-the-art multilingual LLM in its parameter class, and a 69.5% win-rate or higher against widely used models like Gemma-1.1-7B-it, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3.

Ensemble of pre-trained language models and data augmentation for hate speech detection from Arabic tweets,"Kheir Eddine Daouadi, Yaakoub Boualleg, Kheir Eddine Haouaouchi","Today, hate speech classification from Arabic tweets has drawn the attention of several researchers. Many systems and techniques have been developed to resolve this classification task. Nevertheless, two of the major challenges faced in this context are the limited performance and the problem of imbalanced data. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages ensemble learning and semi-supervised learning based on previously manually labeled. We conducted experiments on a benchmark dataset by classifying Arabic tweets into 5 distinct classes: non-hate, general hate, racial, religious, or sexism. Experimental results show that: (1) ensemble learning based on pre-trained language models outperforms existing related works; (2) Our proposed data augmentation improves the accuracy results of hate speech detection from Arabic tweets and outperforms existing related works. Our main contribution is the achievement of encouraging results in Arabic hate speech detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02448v1,2024-07
Predicting vs. Acting: A Trade-off Between World Modeling & Agent Modeling,"Margaret Li, Weijia Shi, Artidoro Pagnoni, Peter West, Ari Holtzman","RLHF-aligned LMs have shown unprecedented ability on both benchmarks and long-form text generation, yet they struggle with one foundational task: next-token prediction. As RLHF models become agent models aimed at interacting with humans, they seem to lose their world modeling -- the ability to predict what comes next in arbitrary documents, which is the foundational training objective of the Base LMs that RLHF adapts.   Besides empirically demonstrating this trade-off, we propose a potential explanation: to perform coherent long-form generation, RLHF models restrict randomness via implicit blueprints. In particular, RLHF models concentrate probability on sets of anchor spans that co-occur across multiple generations for the same prompt, serving as textual scaffolding but also limiting a model's ability to generate documents that do not include these spans. We study this trade-off on the most effective current agent models, those aligned with RLHF, while exploring why this may remain a fundamental trade-off between models that act and those that predict, even as alignment techniques improve.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02446v1,2024-07
Evaluating the Robustness of Adverse Drug Event Classification Models Using Templates,"Dorothea MacPhail, David Harbecke, Lisa Raithel, Sebastian Möller","An adverse drug effect (ADE) is any harmful event resulting from medical drug treatment. Despite their importance, ADEs are often under-reported in official channels. Some research has therefore turned to detecting discussions of ADEs in social media. Impressive results have been achieved in various attempts to detect ADEs. In a high-stakes domain such as medicine, however, an in-depth evaluation of a model's abilities is crucial. We address the issue of thorough performance evaluation in English-language ADE detection with hand-crafted templates for four capabilities: Temporal order, negation, sentiment, and beneficial effect. We find that models with similar performance on held-out test sets have varying results on these capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02432v1,2024-07
CEB: Compositional Evaluation Benchmark for Fairness in Large Language Models,"Song Wang, Peng Wang, Tong Zhou, Yushun Dong, Zhen Tan, Jundong Li","As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to handle various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, concerns regarding the potential negative societal impacts of LLM-generated content have also arisen. To evaluate the biases exhibited by LLMs, researchers have recently proposed a variety of datasets. However, existing bias evaluation efforts often focus on only a particular type of bias and employ inconsistent evaluation metrics, leading to difficulties in comparison across different datasets and LLMs. To address these limitations, we collect a variety of datasets designed for the bias evaluation of LLMs, and further propose CEB, a Compositional Evaluation Benchmark that covers different types of bias across different social groups and tasks. The curation of CEB is based on our newly proposed compositional taxonomy, which characterizes each dataset from three dimensions: bias types, social groups, and tasks. By combining the three dimensions, we develop a comprehensive evaluation strategy for the bias in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that the levels of bias vary across these dimensions, thereby providing guidance for the development of specific bias mitigation methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02408v1,2024-07
Learning to Refine with Fine-Grained Natural Language Feedback,"Manya Wadhwa, Xinyu Zhao, Junyi Jessy Li, Greg Durrett","Recent work has explored the capability of large language models (LLMs) to identify and correct errors in LLM-generated responses. These refinement approaches frequently evaluate what sizes of models are able to do refinement for what problems, but less attention is paid to what effective feedback for refinement looks like. In this work, we propose looking at refinement with feedback as a composition of three distinct LLM competencies: (1) detection of bad generations; (2) fine-grained natural language critique generation; (3) refining with fine-grained feedback. The first step can be implemented with a high-performing discriminative model and steps 2 and 3 can be implemented either via prompted or fine-tuned LLMs. A key property of the proposed Detect, Critique, Refine (""DCR"") method is that the step 2 critique model can give fine-grained feedback about errors, made possible by offloading the discrimination to a separate model in step 1. We show that models of different capabilities benefit from refining with DCR on the task of improving factual consistency of document grounded summaries. Overall, DCR consistently outperforms existing end-to-end refinement approaches and current trained models not fine-tuned for factuality critiquing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02397v2,2024-07
Is Your AI-Generated Code Really Safe? Evaluating Large Language Models on Secure Code Generation with CodeSecEval,"Jiexin Wang, Xitong Luo, Liuwen Cao, Hongkui He, Hailin Huang, Jiayuan Xie, Adam Jatowt, Yi Cai","Large language models (LLMs) have brought significant advancements to code generation and code repair, benefiting both novice and experienced developers. However, their training using unsanitized data from open-source repositories, like GitHub, raises the risk of inadvertently propagating security vulnerabilities. Despite numerous studies investigating the safety of code LLMs, there remains a gap in comprehensively addressing their security features. In this work, we aim to present a comprehensive study aimed at precisely evaluating and enhancing the security aspects of code LLMs. To support our research, we introduce CodeSecEval, a meticulously curated dataset designed to address 44 critical vulnerability types with 180 distinct samples. CodeSecEval serves as the foundation for the automatic evaluation of code models in two crucial tasks: code generation and code repair, with a strong emphasis on security. Our experimental results reveal that current models frequently overlook security issues during both code generation and repair processes, resulting in the creation of vulnerable code. In response, we propose different strategies that leverage vulnerability-aware information and insecure code explanations to mitigate these security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, our findings highlight that certain vulnerability types particularly challenge model performance, influencing their effectiveness in real-world applications. Based on these findings, we believe our study will have a positive impact on the software engineering community, inspiring the development of improved methods for training and utilizing LLMs, thereby leading to safer and more trustworthy model deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02395v2,2024-07
SafaRi:Adaptive Sequence Transformer for Weakly Supervised Referring Expression Segmentation,"Sayan Nag, Koustava Goswami, Srikrishna Karanam","Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to provide a segmentation mask of the target object in an image referred to by the text (i.e., referring expression). Existing methods require large-scale mask annotations. Moreover, such approaches do not generalize well to unseen/zero-shot scenarios. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a weakly-supervised bootstrapping architecture for RES with several new algorithmic innovations. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach that considers only a fraction of both mask and box annotations (shown in Figure 1 and Table 1) for training. To enable principled training of models in such low-annotation settings, improve image-text region-level alignment, and further enhance spatial localization of the target object in the image, we propose Cross-modal Fusion with Attention Consistency module. For automatic pseudo-labeling of unlabeled samples, we introduce a novel Mask Validity Filtering routine based on a spatially aware zero-shot proposal scoring approach. Extensive experiments show that with just 30% annotations, our model SafaRi achieves 59.31 and 48.26 mIoUs as compared to 58.93 and 48.19 mIoUs obtained by the fully-supervised SOTA method SeqTR respectively on RefCOCO+@testA and RefCOCO+testB datasets.

Generative Model for Small Molecules with Latent Space RL Fine-Tuning to Protein Targets,"Ulrich A. Mbou Sob, Qiulin Li, Miguel Arbesú, Oliver Bent, Andries P. Smit, Arnu Pretorius","A specific challenge with deep learning approaches for molecule generation is generating both syntactically valid and chemically plausible molecular string representations. To address this, we propose a novel generative latent-variable transformer model for small molecules that leverages a recently proposed molecular string representation called SAFE. We introduce a modification to SAFE to reduce the number of invalid fragmented molecules generated during training and use this to train our model. Our experiments show that our model can generate novel molecules with a validity rate > 90% and a fragmentation rate < 1% by sampling from a latent space. By fine-tuning the model using reinforcement learning to improve molecular docking, we significantly increase the number of hit candidates for five specific protein targets compared to the pre-trained model, nearly doubling this number for certain targets. Additionally, our top 5% mean docking scores are comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA), and we marginally outperform SOTA on three of the five targets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13780v1,2024-07

Pelican: Correcting Hallucination in Vision-LLMs via Claim Decomposition and Program of Thought Verification,"Pritish Sahu, Karan Sikka, Ajay Divakaran","Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) struggle with hallucinations in visual instruction following task(s), limiting their trustworthiness and real-world applicability. We propose Pelican -- a novel framework designed to detect and mitigate hallucinations through claim verification. Pelican first decomposes the visual claim into a chain of sub-claims based on first-order predicates. These sub-claims consist of (predicate, question) pairs and can be conceptualized as nodes of a computational graph. We then use Program-of-Thought prompting to generate Python code for answering these questions through flexible composition of external tools. Pelican improves over prior work by introducing (1) intermediate variables for precise grounding of object instances, and (2) shared computation for answering the sub-question to enable adaptive corrections and inconsistency identification. We finally use reasoning abilities of LLMs to verify the correctness of the claim by considering the consistency and confidence of the (question, answer) pairs from each sub-claim. Our experiments reveal a drop in hallucination rate by ~ 8% - 32% across various baseline LVLMs and a 27% drop compared to approaches proposed for hallucination mitigation on MMHal-Bench. Results on two other benchmarks further corroborate our results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02352v2,2024-07

MORPHEUS: Modeling Role from Personalized Dialogue History by Exploring and Utilizing Latent Space,"Yihong Tang, Bo Wang, Dongming Zhao, Xiaojia Jin, Jijun Zhang, Ruifang He, Yuexian Hou","Personalized Dialogue Generation (PDG) aims to create coherent responses according to roles or personas. Traditional PDG relies on external role data, which can be scarce and raise privacy concerns. Approaches address these issues by extracting role information from dialogue history, which often fail to generically model roles in continuous space. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework \textbf{MO}dels \textbf{R}oles from \textbf{P}ersonalized Dialogue \textbf{H}istory by \textbf{E}xploring and \textbf{U}tilizing Latent \textbf{S}pace (MORPHEUS) through a three-stage training process. Specifically, we create a persona codebook to represent roles in latent space compactly, and this codebook is used to construct a posterior distribution of role information. This method enables the model to generalize across roles, allowing the generation of personalized dialogues even for unseen roles. Experiments on both Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that MORPHEUS enhances the extraction of role information, and improves response generation without external role data. Additionally, MORPHEUS can be considered an efficient fine-tuning for large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02345v1,2024-07
RVISA: Reasoning and Verification for Implicit Sentiment Analysis,"Wenna Lai, Haoran Xie, Guandong Xu, Qing Li","With an increasing social demand for fine-grained sentiment analysis (SA), implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) poses a significant challenge with the absence of salient cue words in expressions. It necessitates reliable reasoning to understand how the sentiment is aroused and thus determine implicit sentiments. In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Encoder-Decoder (ED) LLMs have gained popularity to serve as backbone models for SA applications, considering impressive text comprehension and reasoning ability among diverse tasks. On the other hand, Decoder-only (DO) LLMs exhibit superior natural language generation and in-context learning capabilities. However, their responses may contain misleading or inaccurate information. To identify implicit sentiment with reliable reasoning, this study proposes RVISA, a two-stage reasoning framework that harnesses the generation ability of DO LLMs and the reasoning ability of ED LLMs to train an enhanced reasoner. Specifically, we adopt three-hop reasoning prompting to explicitly furnish sentiment elements as cues. The generated rationales are utilized to fine-tune an ED LLM into a skilled reasoner. Additionally, we develop a straightforward yet effective verification mechanism to ensure the reliability of the reasoning learning. We evaluated the proposed method on two benchmark datasets and achieved state-of-the-art results in ISA performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02340v1,2024-07

Why do LLaVA Vision-Language Models Reply to Images in English?,"Musashi Hinck, Carolin Holtermann, Matthew Lyle Olson, Florian Schneider, Sungduk Yu, Anahita Bhiwandiwalla, Anne Lauscher, Shaoyen Tseng, Vasudev Lal","We uncover a surprising multilingual bias occurring in a popular class of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs). Including an image in the query to a LLaVA-style VLM significantly increases the likelihood of the model returning an English response, regardless of the language of the query. This paper investigates the causes of this loss with a two-pronged approach that combines extensive ablation of the design space with a mechanistic analysis of the models' internal representations of image and text inputs. Both approaches indicate that the issue stems in the language modelling component of the LLaVA model. Statistically, we find that switching the language backbone for a bilingual language model has the strongest effect on reducing this error. Mechanistically, we provide compelling evidence that visual inputs are not mapped to a similar space as text ones, and that intervening on intermediary attention layers can reduce this bias. Our findings provide important insights to researchers and engineers seeking to understand the crossover between multimodal and multilingual spaces, and contribute to the goal of developing capable and inclusive VLMs for non-English contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02333v1,2024-07
Efficient Sparse Attention needs Adaptive Token Release,"Chaoran Zhang, Lixin Zou, Dan Luo, Min Tang, Xiangyang Luo, Zihao Li, Chenliang Li","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide array of text-centric tasks. However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding.

Exploring the Role of Transliteration in In-Context Learning for Low-resource Languages Written in Non-Latin Scripts,"Chunlan Ma, Yihong Liu, Haotian Ye, Hinrich Schütze","Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) excel in high-resource languages across various tasks through few-shot or even zero-shot in-context learning (ICL). However, their performance often does not transfer well to low-resource languages, especially those written in non-Latin scripts. Inspired by recent work that leverages transliteration in encoder-only models, we investigate whether transliteration is also effective in improving LLMs' performance for low-resource languages written in non-Latin scripts. To this end, we propose three prompt templates, where the target-language text is represented in (1) its original script, (2) Latin script, or (3) both. We apply these methods to several representative LLMs of different sizes on various tasks including text classification and sequential labeling. Our findings show that the effectiveness of transliteration varies by task type and model size. For instance, all models benefit from transliterations for sequential labeling (with increases of up to 25%).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02320v1,2024-07
Soft Language Prompts for Language Transfer,"Ivan Vykopal, Simon Ostermann, Marián Šimko","Cross-lingual knowledge transfer, especially between high- and low-resource languages, remains challenging in natural language processing (NLP). This study offers insights for improving cross-lingual NLP applications through the combination of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. We systematically explore strategies for enhancing cross-lingual transfer through the incorporation of language-specific and task-specific adapters and soft prompts. We present a detailed investigation of various combinations of these methods, exploring their efficiency across 16 languages, focusing on 10 mid- and low-resource languages. We further present to our knowledge the first use of soft prompts for language transfer, a technique we call soft language prompts. Our findings demonstrate that in contrast to claims of previous work, a combination of language and task adapters does not always work best; instead, combining a soft language prompt with a task adapter outperforms most configurations in many cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02317v2,2024-07
Evaluating the Ability of LLMs to Solve Semantics-Aware Process Mining Tasks,"Adrian Rebmann, Fabian David Schmidt, Goran Glavaš, Han van der Aa","The process mining community has recently recognized the potential of large language models (LLMs) for tackling various process mining tasks. Initial studies report the capability of LLMs to support process analysis and even, to some extent, that they are able to reason about how processes work. This latter property suggests that LLMs could also be used to tackle process mining tasks that benefit from an understanding of process behavior. Examples of such tasks include (semantic) anomaly detection and next activity prediction, which both involve considerations of the meaning of activities and their inter-relations. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to tackle such semantics-aware process mining tasks. Furthermore, whereas most works on the intersection of LLMs and process mining only focus on testing these models out of the box, we provide a more principled investigation of the utility of LLMs for process mining, including their ability to obtain process mining knowledge post-hoc by means of in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Concretely, we define three process mining tasks that benefit from an understanding of process semantics and provide extensive benchmarking datasets for each of them. Our evaluation experiments reveal that (1) LLMs fail to solve challenging process mining tasks out of the box and when provided only a handful of in-context examples, (2) but they yield strong performance when fine-tuned for these tasks, consistently surpassing smaller, encoder-based language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02310v1,2024-07
Towards Human Understanding of Paraphrase Types in ChatGPT,"Dominik Meier, Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp","Paraphrases represent a human's intuitive ability to understand expressions presented in various different ways. Current paraphrase evaluations of language models primarily use binary approaches, offering limited interpretability of specific text changes. Atomic paraphrase types (APT) decompose paraphrases into different linguistic changes and offer a granular view of the flexibility in linguistic expression (e.g., a shift in syntax or vocabulary used). In this study, we assess the human preferences towards ChatGPT in generating English paraphrases with ten APTs and five prompting techniques. We introduce APTY (Atomic Paraphrase TYpes), a dataset of 500 sentence-level and word-level annotations by 15 annotators. The dataset also provides a human preference ranking of paraphrases with different types that can be used to fine-tune models with RLHF and DPO methods. Our results reveal that ChatGPT can generate simple APTs, such as additions and deletions, but struggle with complex structures (e.g., subordination changes). This study contributes to understanding which aspects of paraphrasing language models have already succeeded at understanding and what remains elusive. In addition, our curated datasets can be used to develop language models with specific linguistic capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02302v1,2024-07
CFinBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models,"Ying Nie, Binwei Yan, Tianyu Guo, Hao Liu, Haoyu Wang, Wei He, Binfan Zheng, Weihao Wang, Qiang Li, Weijian Sun, Yunhe Wang, Dacheng Tao","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various NLP tasks, yet their potential in more challenging and domain-specific task, such as finance, has not been fully explored. In this paper, we present CFinBench: a meticulously crafted, the most comprehensive evaluation benchmark to date, for assessing the financial knowledge of LLMs under Chinese context. In practice, to better align with the career trajectory of Chinese financial practitioners, we build a systematic evaluation from 4 first-level categories: (1) Financial Subject: whether LLMs can memorize the necessary basic knowledge of financial subjects, such as economics, statistics and auditing. (2) Financial Qualification: whether LLMs can obtain the needed financial qualified certifications, such as certified public accountant, securities qualification and banking qualification. (3) Financial Practice: whether LLMs can fulfill the practical financial jobs, such as tax consultant, junior accountant and securities analyst. (4) Financial Law: whether LLMs can meet the requirement of financial laws and regulations, such as tax law, insurance law and economic law. CFinBench comprises 99,100 questions spanning 43 second-level categories with 3 question types: single-choice, multiple-choice and judgment. We conduct extensive experiments of 50 representative LLMs with various model size on CFinBench. The results show that GPT4 and some Chinese-oriented models lead the benchmark, with the highest average accuracy being 60.16%, highlighting the challenge presented by CFinBench.

Why Does New Knowledge Create Messy Ripple Effects in LLMs?,"Jiaxin Qin, Zixuan Zhang, Chi Han, Manling Li, Pengfei Yu, Heng Ji","Extensive previous research has focused on post-training knowledge editing (KE) for language models (LMs) to ensure that knowledge remains accurate and up-to-date. One desired property and open question in KE is to let edited LMs correctly handle ripple effects, where LM is expected to answer its logically related knowledge accurately. In this paper, we answer the question of why most KE methods still create messy ripple effects. We conduct extensive analysis and identify a salient indicator, GradSim, that effectively reveals when and why updated knowledge ripples in LMs. GradSim is computed by the cosine similarity between gradients of the original fact and its related knowledge. We observe a strong positive correlation between ripple effect performance and GradSim across different LMs, KE methods, and evaluation metrics. Further investigations into three counter-intuitive failure cases (Negation, Over-Ripple, Multi-Lingual) of ripple effects demonstrate that these failures are often associated with very low GradSim. This finding validates that GradSim is an effective indicator of when knowledge ripples in LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12828v2,2024-07
The Solution for The PST-KDD-2024 OAG-Challenge,"Shupeng Zhong, Xinger Li, Shushan Jin, Yang Yang","In this paper, we introduce the second-place solution in the KDD-2024 OAG-Challenge paper source tracing track. Our solution is mainly based on two methods, BERT and GCN, and combines the reasoning results of BERT and GCN in the final submission to achieve complementary performance. In the BERT solution, we focus on processing the fragments that appear in the references of the paper, and use a variety of operations to reduce the redundant interference in the fragments, so that the information received by BERT is more refined. In the GCN solution, we map information such as paper fragments, abstracts, and titles to a high-dimensional semantic space through an embedding model, and try to build edges between titles, abstracts, and fragments to integrate contextual relationships for judgment. In the end, our solution achieved a remarkable score of 0.47691 in the competition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12827v1,2024-07
Renard: A Modular Pipeline for Extracting Character Networks from Narrative Texts,"Arthur Amalvy, Vincent Labatut, Richard Dufour","Renard (Relationships Extraction from NARrative Documents) is a Python library that allows users to define custom natural language processing (NLP) pipelines to extract character networks from narrative texts. Contrary to the few existing tools, Renard can extract dynamic networks, as well as the more common static networks.

This allows users to specialize pipelines to particular types of texts and to study the impact of each subtask on the extracted network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02284v1,2024-07
Language Model Alignment in Multilingual Trolley Problems,"Zhijing Jin, Max Kleiman-Weiner, Giorgio Piatti, Sydney Levine, Jiarui Liu, Fernando Gonzalez, Francesco Ortu, András Strausz, Mrinmaya Sachan, Rada Mihalcea, Yejin Choi, Bernhard Schölkopf","We evaluate the moral alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences in multilingual trolley problems. Building on the Moral Machine experiment, which captures over 40 million human judgments across 200+ countries, we develop a cross-lingual corpus of moral dilemma vignettes in over 100 languages called MultiTP. This dataset enables the assessment of LLMs' decision-making processes in diverse linguistic contexts. Our analysis explores the alignment of 19 different LLMs with human judgments, capturing preferences across six moral dimensions: species, gender, fitness, status, age, and the number of lives involved. By correlating these preferences with the demographic distribution of language speakers and examining the consistency of LLM responses to various prompt paraphrasings, our findings provide insights into cross-lingual and ethical biases of LLMs and their intersection. We discover significant variance in alignment across languages, challenging the assumption of uniform moral reasoning in AI systems and highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives in AI ethics. The results underscore the need for further research on the integration of multilingual dimensions in responsible AI research to ensure fair and equitable AI interactions worldwide.

Predictive Simultaneous Interpretation: Harnessing Large Language Models for Democratizing Real-Time Multilingual Communication,"Kurando Iida, Kenjiro Mimura, Nobuo Ito","This study introduces a groundbreaking approach to simultaneous interpretation by directly leveraging the predictive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We present a novel algorithm that generates real-time translations by predicting speaker utterances and expanding multiple possibilities in a tree-like structure. This method demonstrates unprecedented flexibility and adaptability, potentially overcoming the structural differences between languages more effectively than existing systems. Our theoretical analysis, supported by illustrative examples, suggests that this approach could lead to more natural and fluent translations with minimal latency.

We discuss the theoretical foundations, potential advantages, and implementation challenges of this technique, positioning it as a significant step towards democratizing multilingual communication.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14269v1,2024-07
Assessing the Effectiveness of GPT-4o in Climate Change Evidence Synthesis and Systematic Assessments: Preliminary Insights,"Elphin Tom Joe, Sai Dileep Koneru, Christine J Kirchhoff","In this research short, we examine the potential of using GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) to undertake evidence synthesis and systematic assessment tasks. Traditional workflows for such tasks involve large groups of domain experts who manually review and synthesize vast amounts of literature. The exponential growth of scientific literature and recent advances in LLMs provide an opportunity to complementing these traditional workflows with new age tools. We assess the efficacy of GPT-4o to do these tasks on a sample from the dataset created by the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI) where we check the accuracy of climate change adaptation related feature extraction from the scientific literature across three levels of expertise. Our results indicate that while GPT-4o can achieve high accuracy in low-expertise tasks like geographic location identification, their performance in intermediate and high-expertise tasks, such as stakeholder identification and assessment of depth of the adaptation response, is less reliable. The findings motivate the need for designing assessment workflows that utilize the strengths of models like GPT-4o while also providing refinements to improve their performance on these tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12826v1,2024-07
A Depression Detection Method Based on Multi-Modal Feature Fusion Using Cross-Attention,"Shengjie Li, Yinhao Xiao","Depression, a prevalent and serious mental health issue, affects approximately 3.8\% of the global population. Despite the existence of effective treatments, over 75\% of individuals in low- and middle-income countries remain untreated, partly due to the challenge in accurately diagnosing depression in its early stages. This paper introduces a novel method for detecting depression based on multi-modal feature fusion utilizing cross-attention. By employing MacBERT as a pre-training model to extract lexical features from text and incorporating an additional Transformer module to refine task-specific contextual understanding, the model's adaptability to the targeted task is enhanced. Diverging from previous practices of simply concatenating multimodal features, this approach leverages cross-attention for feature integration, significantly improving the accuracy in depression detection and enabling a more comprehensive and precise analysis of user emotions and behaviors. Furthermore, a Multi-Modal Feature Fusion Network based on Cross-Attention (MFFNC) is constructed, demonstrating exceptional performance in the task of depression identification. The experimental results indicate that our method achieves an accuracy of 0.9495 on the test dataset, marking a substantial improvement over existing approaches. Moreover, it outlines a promising methodology for other social media platforms and tasks involving multi-modal processing. Timely identification and intervention for individuals with depression are crucial for saving lives, highlighting the immense potential of technology in facilitating early intervention for mental health issues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12825v1,2024-07
Robust Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis with Reverse Inference Optimization,"Yuchen Hu, Chen Chen, Siyin Wang, Eng Siong Chng, Chao Zhang","In this paper, we propose reverse inference optimization (RIO), a simple and effective method designed to enhance the robustness of autoregressive-model-based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). To assess the quality of speech produced by the TTS system without human annotations, RIO introduces a novel concept termed as reverse inference based on the Bayesian principle, which suggests that a high-quality generated speech should be able to be used as a prompt for subsequent generation using the same TTS model. By leveraging reverse inference as the standard to select exemplars used in RLHF from the speech samples generated by the TTS system itself, RIO steers the subsequent optimization towards a direction of enhancing the TTS robustness. The RIO framework, comprising sampling, automatic annotating, and learning, obviates the need for a reward model or pairwise preference data, and significantly improves the stability of zero-shot TTS performance by reducing the discrepancies between training and inference conditions. Our experimental results verify that RIO can effectively improve both subjective and objective metrics, including mean opinion scores, word error rates, and speaker similarity. Remarkably, RIO can also diminish the incidence of bad outputs to nearly zero percent, rivalling the robustness when using ground-truth speech as the prompt.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02243v1,2024-07
Towards a Holistic Framework for Multimodal Large Language Models in Three-dimensional Brain CT Report Generation,"Cheng-Yi Li, Kao-Jung Chang, Cheng-Fu Yang, Hsin-Yu Wu, Wenting Chen, Hritik Bansal, Ling Chen, Yi-Ping Yang, Yu-Chun Chen, Shih-Pin Chen, Jiing-Feng Lirng, Kai-Wei Chang, Shih-Hwa Chiou","Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have been given free rein to explore exciting medical applications with a primary focus on radiology report generation. Nevertheless, the preliminary success in 2D radiology captioning is incompetent to reflect the real-world diagnostic challenge in the volumetric 3D anatomy. To mitigate three crucial limitation aspects in the existing literature, including (1) data complexity, (2) model capacity, and (3) evaluation metric fidelity, we collected an 18,885 text-scan pairs 3D-BrainCT dataset and applied clinical visual instruction tuning (CVIT) to train BrainGPT models to generate radiology-adherent 3D brain CT reports. Statistically, our BrainGPT scored BLEU-1 = 44.35, BLEU-4 = 20.38, METEOR = 30.13, ROUGE-L = 47.6, and CIDEr-R = 211.77 during internal testing and demonstrated an accuracy of 0.91 in captioning midline shifts on the external validation CQ500 dataset. By further inspecting the captioned report, we reported that the traditional metrics appeared to measure only the surface text similarity and failed to gauge the information density of the diagnostic purpose. To close this gap, we proposed a novel Feature-Oriented Radiology Task Evaluation (FORTE) to estimate the report's clinical relevance (lesion feature and landmarks). Notably, the BrainGPT model scored an average FORTE F1-score of 0.71 (degree=0.661; landmark=0.706; feature=0.693; impression=0.779). To demonstrate that BrainGPT models possess objective readiness to generate human-like radiology reports, we conducted a Turing test that enrolled 11 physician evaluators, and around 74% of the BrainGPT-generated captions were indistinguishable from those written by humans. Our work embodies a holistic framework that showcased the first-hand experience of curating a 3D brain CT dataset, fine-tuning anatomy-sensible language models, and proposing robust radiology evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02235v1,2024-07
Synthetic Multimodal Question Generation,"Ian Wu, Sravan Jayanthi, Vijay Viswanathan, Simon Rosenberg, Sina Pakazad, Tongshuang Wu, Graham Neubig","Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (MMRAG) is a powerful approach to question-answering over multimodal documents. A key challenge with evaluating MMRAG is the paucity of high-quality datasets matching the question styles and modalities of interest. In light of this, we propose SMMQG, a synthetic data generation framework. SMMQG leverages interplay between a retriever, large language model (LLM) and large multimodal model (LMM) to generate question and answer pairs directly from multimodal documents, with the questions conforming to specified styles and modalities. We use SMMQG to generate an MMRAG dataset of 1024 questions over Wikipedia documents and evaluate state-of-the-art models using it, revealing insights into model performance that are attainable only through style- and modality-specific evaluation data. Next, we measure the quality of data produced by SMMQG via a human study. We find that the quality of SMMQG-generated synthetic data is on par with the quality of the crowdsourced benchmark MMQA and that downstream evaluation results using both datasets strongly concur.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02233v2,2024-07
Whispering Experts: Neural Interventions for Toxicity Mitigation in Language Models,"Xavier Suau, Pieter Delobelle, Katherine Metcalf, Armand Joulin, Nicholas Apostoloff, Luca Zappella, Pau Rodríguez","An important issue with Large Language Models (LLMs) is their undesired ability to generate toxic language. In this work, we show that the neurons responsible for toxicity can be determined by their power to discriminate toxic sentences, and that toxic language can be mitigated by reducing their activation levels proportionally to this power. We propose AUROC adaptation (AurA), an intervention that can be applied to any pre-trained LLM to mitigate toxicity. As the intervention is proportional to the ability of each neuron to discriminate toxic content, it is free of any model-dependent hyperparameters. We show that AurA can achieve up to $2.2 \times$ reduction in toxicity with only a $0.72$ perplexity increase. We also show that AurA is effective with models of different scale (from 1.5B to 40B parameters), and its effectiveness in mitigating toxic language, while preserving common-sense zero-shot abilities, holds across all scales. AurA can be combined with pre-prompting strategies, boosting its average mitigation potential from $1.28\times$ to $2.35\times$. Moreover, AurA can counteract adversarial pre-prompts that maliciously elicit toxic content, making it an effective method for deploying safer and less toxic models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12824v1,2024-07
PromptIntern: Saving Inference Costs by Internalizing Recurrent Prompt during Large Language Model Fine-tuning,"Jiaru Zou, Mengyu Zhou, Tao Li, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang","Recent advances in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their usage in domain-specific tasks. Despite the success, fine-tuning continues to rely on repeated and lengthy prompts, which escalate computational expenses, require more resources, and lead to slower inference. In this paper, we present a novel approach, PromptIntern, which internalizes prompt knowledge during model fine-tuning to achieve efficient inference and save costs. Instead of compressing the prompts for a vanilla model, PromptIntern aims to embed the recurrent prompt directly into the model parameters. We design a fine-tuning pipeline that includes instruction template compression, few-shot example absorption, and a progressive internalization strategy, effectively diminishing the need for intricate prompts during inference. Comprehensive experiments on challenging NL2Code tasks demonstrate that our method reduces input tokens by more than 90%, accelerates inference by 4.2 times, and reduces monetary inference costs by 88.3%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02211v2,2024-07
Generative Monoculture in Large Language Models,"Fan Wu, Emily Black, Varun Chandrasekaran","We introduce {\em generative monoculture}, a behavior observed in large language models (LLMs) characterized by a significant narrowing of model output diversity relative to available training data for a given task: for example, generating only positive book reviews for books with a mixed reception. While in some cases, generative monoculture enhances performance (e.g., LLMs more often produce efficient code), the dangers are exacerbated in others (e.g., LLMs refuse to share diverse opinions). As LLMs are increasingly used in high-impact settings such as education and web search, careful maintenance of LLM output diversity is essential to ensure a variety of facts and perspectives are preserved over time. We experimentally demonstrate the prevalence of generative monoculture through analysis of book review and code generation tasks, and find that simple countermeasures such as altering sampling or prompting strategies are insufficient to mitigate the behavior. Moreover, our results suggest that the root causes of generative monoculture are likely embedded within the LLM's alignment processes, suggesting a need for developing fine-tuning paradigms that preserve or promote diversity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02209v1,2024-07
How to Learn in a Noisy World? Self-Correcting the Real-World Data Noise on Machine Translation,"Yan Meng, Di Wu, Christof Monz","The massive amounts of web-mined parallel data contain large amounts of noise. Semantic misalignment, as the primary source of the noise, poses a challenge for training machine translation systems. In this paper, we first study the impact of real-world hard-to-detect misalignment noise by proposing a process to simulate the realistic misalignment controlled by semantic similarity. After quantitatively analyzing the impact of simulated misalignment on machine translation, we show the limited effectiveness of widely used pre-filters to improve the translation performance, underscoring the necessity of more fine-grained ways to handle data noise. By observing the increasing reliability of the model's self-knowledge for distinguishing misaligned and clean data at the token-level, we propose a self-correction approach which leverages the model's prediction distribution to revise the training supervision from the ground-truth data over training time. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our self-correction method not only improves translation performance in the presence of simulated misalignment noise but also proves effective for real-world noisy web-mined datasets across eight translation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02208v1,2024-07
WTU-EVAL: A Whether-or-Not Tool Usage Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models,"Kangyun Ning, Yisong Su, Xueqiang Lv, Yuanzhe Zhang, Jian Liu, Kang Liu, Jinan Xu","Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in NLP tasks, they still need external tools to extend their ability. Current research on tool learning with LLMs often assumes mandatory tool use, which does not always align with real-world situations, where the necessity for tools is uncertain, and incorrect or unnecessary use of tools can damage the general abilities of LLMs. Therefore, we propose to explore whether LLMs can discern their ability boundaries and use tools flexibly. We then introduce the Whether-or-not tool usage Evaluation benchmark (WTU-Eval) to assess LLMs with eleven datasets, where six of them are tool-usage datasets, and five are general datasets. LLMs are prompted to use tools according to their needs. The results of eight LLMs on WTU-Eval reveal that LLMs frequently struggle to determine tool use in general datasets, and LLMs' performance in tool-usage datasets improves when their ability is similar to ChatGPT. In both datasets, incorrect tool usage significantly impairs LLMs' performance. To mitigate this, we also develop the finetuning dataset to enhance tool decision-making. Fine-tuning Llama2-7B results in a 14\% average performance improvement and a 16.8\% decrease in incorrect tool usage. We will release the WTU-Eval benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12823v1,2024-07

GemmAr: Enhancing LLMs Through Arabic Instruction-Tuning,"Hasna Chouikhi, Manel Aloui, Cyrine Ben Hammou, Ghaith Chaabane, Haithem Kchaou, Chehir Dhaouadi","Large language models (LLMs) have greatly impacted the natural language processing (NLP) field, particularly for the English language. These models have demonstrated capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The success of language models largely depends on the availability of high-quality instruction datasets, which consist of detailed task descriptions and corresponding responses that are essential for training the models to address a variety of prompts accurately. However, the availability and quality of these resources vary by language. While models perform well in English, they often need help with languages like Arabic, due to the lack of datasets for fine-tuning Arabic-specific tasks. To address this issue, we introduce InstAr-500k, a new Arabic instruction dataset created by generating and collecting content that covers several domains and instruction types. We assess this dataset by fine-tuning an open-source Gemma-7B model on several downstream tasks to improve its functionality. Based on multiple evaluations, our fine-tuned model achieves excellent performance on several Arabic NLP benchmarks. These outcomes emphasize the effectiveness of our dataset in elevating the capabilities of language models for Arabic. Our instruction dataset bridges the performance gap between English and Arabic language models by providing resources that amplify Arabic NLP development. Building on this foundation, we developed a model, GemmAr-7B-V1, specifically tuned to excel at a wide range of Arabic NLP tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02147v2,2024-07
Efficient Nearest Neighbor based Uncertainty Estimation for Natural Language Processing Tasks,"Wataru Hashimoto, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe","Trustworthy prediction in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) is important for safety-critical applications in the real world. However, DNNs often suffer from uncertainty estimation, such as miscalibration. In particular, approaches that require multiple stochastic inference can mitigate this problem, but the expensive cost of inference makes them impractical. In this study, we propose $k$-Nearest Neighbor Uncertainty Estimation ($k$NN-UE), which is an uncertainty estimation method that uses the distances from the neighbors and label-existence ratio of neighbors. Experiments on sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and named entity recognition show that our proposed method outperforms the baselines or recent density-based methods in confidence calibration, selective prediction, and out-of-distribution detection. Moreover, our analyses indicate that introducing dimension reduction or approximate nearest neighbor search inspired by recent $k$NN-LM studies reduces the inference overhead without significantly degrading estimation performance when combined them appropriately.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02138v1,2024-07
Black Big Boxes: Do Language Models Hide a Theory of Adjective Order?,"Jaap Jumelet, Lisa Bylinina, Willem Zuidema, Jakub Szymanik","In English and other languages, multiple adjectives in a complex noun phrase show intricate ordering patterns that have been a target of much linguistic theory. These patterns offer an opportunity to assess the ability of language models (LMs) to learn subtle rules of language involving factors that cross the traditional divisions of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. We review existing hypotheses designed to explain Adjective Order Preferences (AOPs) in humans and develop a setup to study AOPs in LMs: we present a reusable corpus of adjective pairs and define AOP measures for LMs. With these tools, we study a series of LMs across intermediate checkpoints during training. We find that all models' predictions are much closer to human AOPs than predictions generated by factors identified in theoretical linguistics. At the same time, we demonstrate that the observed AOPs in LMs are strongly correlated with the frequency of the adjective pairs in the training data and report limited generalization to unseen combinations. This highlights the difficulty in establishing the link between LM performance and linguistic theory. We therefore conclude with a road map for future studies our results set the stage for, and a discussion of key questions about the nature of knowledge in LMs and their ability to generalize beyond the training sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02136v1,2024-07

Cost-Effective Proxy Reward Model Construction with On-Policy and Active Learning,"Yifang Chen, Shuohang Wang, Ziyi Yang, Hiteshi Sharma, Nikos Karampatziakis, Donghan Yu, Kevin Jamieson, Simon Shaolei Du, Yelong Shen","Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), as a widely adopted approach in current large language model pipelines, is \textit{bottlenecked by the size of human preference data}. While traditional methods rely on offline preference dataset constructions, recent approaches have shifted towards online settings, where a learner uses a small amount of labeled seed data and a large pool of unlabeled prompts to iteratively construct new preference data through self-generated responses and high-quality reward/preference feedback. However, most current online algorithms still focus on preference labeling during policy model updating with given feedback oracles, which incurs significant expert query costs. \textit{We are the first to explore cost-effective proxy reward oracles construction strategies for further labeling preferences or rewards with extremely limited labeled data and expert query budgets}. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) on-policy query to avoid OOD and imbalance issues in seed data, and (2) active learning to select the most informative data for preference queries. Using these methods, we train a evaluation model with minimal expert-labeled data, which then effectively labels nine times more preference pairs for further RLHF training. For instance, our model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) gains around over 1% average improvement on AlpacaEval2, MMLU-5shot and MMLU-0shot, with only 1.7K query cost. Our methodology is orthogonal to other direct expert query-based strategies and therefore might be integrated with them to further reduce query costs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02119v2,2024-07
Breaking Language Barriers: Cross-Lingual Continual Pre-Training at Scale,"Wenzhen Zheng, Wenbo Pan, Xu Xu, Libo Qin, Li Yue, Ming Zhou","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides towards Artificial General Intelligence. However, training these models from scratch requires substantial computational resources and vast amounts of text data. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to constructing an LLM for a new language by continually pretraining (CPT) from existing pretrained LLMs, instead of using randomly initialized parameters. Based on parallel experiments on 40 model sizes ranging from 40M to 5B parameters, we find that 1) CPT converges faster and saves significant resources in a scalable manner; 2) CPT adheres to an extended scaling law derived from Hoffmann et al. (2022) with a joint data-parameter scaling term; 3) The compute-optimal data-parameter allocation for CPT markedly differs based on our estimated scaling factors; 4) The effectiveness of transfer at scale is influenced by training duration and linguistic properties, while robust to data replaying, a method that effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in CPT. We hope our findings provide deeper insights into the transferability of LLMs at scale for the research community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02118v2,2024-07
Helpful assistant or fruitful facilitator? Investigating how personas affect language model behavior,"Pedro Henrique Luz de Araujo, Benjamin Roth","One way to personalize and steer generations from large language models (LLM) is to assign a persona: a role that describes how the user expects the LLM to behave (e.g., a helpful assistant, a teacher, a woman). This paper investigates how personas affect diverse aspects of model behavior. We assign to seven LLMs 162 personas from 12 categories spanning variables like gender, sexual orientation, and occupation. We prompt them to answer questions from five datasets covering objective (e.g., questions about math and history) and subjective tasks (e.g., questions about beliefs and values). We also compare persona's generations to two baseline settings: a control persona setting with 30 paraphrases of ""a helpful assistant"" to control for models' prompt sensitivity, and an empty persona setting where no persona is assigned. We find that for all models and datasets, personas show greater variability than the control setting and that some measures of persona behavior generalize across models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02099v1,2024-07
Crossroads of Continents: Automated Artifact Extraction for Cultural Adaptation with Large Multimodal Models,"Anjishnu Mukherjee, Ziwei Zhu, Antonios Anastasopoulos","We present a comprehensive three-phase study to examine (1) the cultural understanding of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) by introducing DalleStreet, a large-scale dataset generated by DALL-E 3 and validated by humans, containing 9,935 images of 67 countries and 10 concept classes; (2) the underlying implicit and potentially stereotypical cultural associations with a cultural artifact extraction task; and (3) an approach to adapt cultural representation in an image based on extracted associations using a modular pipeline, CultureAdapt. We find disparities in cultural understanding at geographic sub-region levels with both open-source (LLaVA) and closed-source (GPT-4V) models on DalleStreet and other existing benchmarks, which we try to understand using over 18,000 artifacts that we identify in association to different countries. Our findings reveal a nuanced picture of the cultural competence of LMMs, highlighting the need to develop culture-aware systems.

BiasDora: Exploring Hidden Biased Associations in Vision-Language Models,"Chahat Raj, Anjishnu Mukherjee, Aylin Caliskan, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Ziwei Zhu","Existing works examining Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for social biases predominantly focus on a limited set of documented bias associations, such as gender:profession or race:crime. This narrow scope often overlooks a vast range of unexamined implicit associations, restricting the identification and, hence, mitigation of such biases. We address this gap by probing VLMs to (1) uncover hidden, implicit associations across 9 bias dimensions. We systematically explore diverse input and output modalities and (2) demonstrate how biased associations vary in their negativity, toxicity, and extremity. Our work (3) identifies subtle and extreme biases that are typically not recognized by existing methodologies. We make the Dataset of retrieved associations, (Dora), publicly available here https://github.com/chahatraj/BiasDora.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02066v2,2024-07
Are Data Augmentation Methods in Named Entity Recognition Applicable for Uncertainty Estimation?,"Wataru Hashimoto, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe","This work investigates the impact of data augmentation on confidence calibration and uncertainty estimation in Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. For the future advance of NER in safety-critical fields like healthcare and finance, it is essential to achieve accurate predictions with calibrated confidence when applying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), as a real-world application. However, DNNs are prone to miscalibration, which limits their applicability. Moreover, existing methods for calibration and uncertainty estimation are computational expensive. Our investigation in NER found that data augmentation improves calibration and uncertainty in cross-genre and cross-lingual setting, especially in-domain setting. Furthermore, we showed that the calibration for NER tends to be more effective when the perplexity of the sentences generated by data augmentation is lower, and that increasing the size of the augmentation further improves calibration and uncertainty.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02062v2,2024-07
Integrate the Essence and Eliminate the Dross: Fine-Grained Self-Consistency for Free-Form Language Generation,"Xinglin Wang, Yiwei Li, Shaoxiong Feng, Peiwen Yuan, Boyuan Pan, Heda Wang, Yao Hu, Kan Li","Self-consistency (SC), leveraging multiple samples from LLMs, shows significant gains on various reasoning tasks but struggles with free-form generation due to the difficulty of aggregating answers. Its variants, UCS and USC, rely on sample selection or voting mechanisms to improve output quality. These methods, however, face limitations due to their inability to fully utilize the nuanced consensus knowledge present within multiple candidate samples, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. We propose Fine-Grained Self-Consistency (FSC) to addresses these limitations by extracting and integrating segment-level commonalities from candidate samples, enhancing the performance of LLMs both in open-ended and reasoning tasks. Based on this, we present two additional strategies: candidate filtering, which enhances overall quality by identifying highly similar candidate sets, and merging, which reduces input token requirements by combining similar samples. The effectiveness of FSC is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various tasks, including summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. The results indicate significant improvements over baseline methods, showcasing the potential of FSC to optimize output quality by effectively synthesizing fine-grained consensus knowledge from multiple samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02056v1,2024-07
Accompanied Singing Voice Synthesis with Fully Text-controlled Melody,"Ruiqi Li, Zhiqing Hong, Yongqi Wang, Lichao Zhang, Rongjie Huang, Siqi Zheng, Zhou Zhao","Text-to-song (TTSong) is a music generation task that synthesizes accompanied singing voices. Current TTSong methods, inherited from singing voice synthesis (SVS), require melody-related information that can sometimes be impractical, such as music scores or MIDI sequences. We present MelodyLM, the first TTSong model that generates high-quality song pieces with fully text-controlled melodies, achieving minimal user requirements and maximum control flexibility. MelodyLM explicitly models MIDI as the intermediate melody-related feature and sequentially generates vocal tracks in a language model manner, conditioned on textual and vocal prompts. The accompaniment music is subsequently synthesized by a latent diffusion model with hybrid conditioning for temporal alignment. With minimal requirements, users only need to input lyrics and a reference voice to synthesize a song sample. For full control, just input textual prompts or even directly input MIDI. Experimental results indicate that MelodyLM achieves superior performance in terms of both objective and subjective metrics. Audio samples are available at https://melodylm666.github.io.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02049v1,2024-07
Concise and Precise Context Compression for Tool-Using Language Models,"Yang Xu, Yunlong Feng, Honglin Mu, Yutai Hou, Yitong Li, Xinghao Wang, Wanjun Zhong, Zhongyang Li, Dandan Tu, Qingfu Zhu, Min Zhang, Wanxiang Che","Through reading the documentation in the context, tool-using language models can dynamically extend their capability using external tools. The cost is that we have to input lengthy documentation every time the model needs to use the tool, occupying the input window as well as slowing down the decoding process.   Given the progress in general-purpose compression, soft context compression is a suitable approach to alleviate the problem. However, when compressing tool documentation, existing methods suffer from the weaknesses of key information loss (specifically, tool/parameter name errors) and difficulty in adjusting the length of compressed sequences based on documentation lengths.   To address these problems, we propose two strategies for compressing tool documentation into concise and precise summary sequences for tool-using language models. 1) Selective compression strategy mitigates key information loss by deliberately retaining key information as raw text tokens. 2) Block compression strategy involves dividing tool documentation into short chunks and then employing a fixed-length compression model to achieve variable-length compression. This strategy facilitates the flexible adjustment of the compression ratio.   Results on API-Bank and APIBench show that our approach reaches a performance comparable to the upper-bound baseline under up to 16x compression ratio.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02043v1,2024-07
Fake News Detection and Manipulation Reasoning via Large Vision-Language Models,"Ruihan Jin, Ruibo Fu, Zhengqi Wen, Shuai Zhang, Yukun Liu, Jianhua Tao","Fake news becomes a growing threat to information security and public opinion with the rapid sprawl of media manipulation. Therefore, fake news detection attracts widespread attention from academic community. Traditional fake news detection models demonstrate remarkable performance on authenticity binary classification but their ability to reason detailed faked traces based on the news content remains under-explored. Furthermore, due to the lack of external knowledge, the performance of existing methods on fact-related news is questionable, leaving their practical implementation unclear. In this paper, we propose a new multi-media research topic, namely manipulation reasoning. Manipulation reasoning aims to reason manipulations based on news content. To support the research, we introduce a benchmark for fake news detection and manipulation reasoning, referred to as Human-centric and Fact-related Fake News (HFFN). The benchmark highlights the centrality of human and the high factual relevance, with detailed manual annotations. HFFN encompasses four realistic domains with fake news samples generated through three manipulation approaches. Moreover, a Multi-modal news Detection and Reasoning langUage Model (M-DRUM) is presented not only to judge on the authenticity of multi-modal news, but also raise analytical reasoning about potential manipulations. On the feature extraction level, a cross-attention mechanism is employed to extract fine-grained fusion features from multi-modal inputs. On the reasoning level, a large vision-language model (LVLM) serves as the backbone to facilitate fact-related reasoning. A two-stage training framework is deployed to better activate the capacity of identification and reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) fake news detection models and powerful LVLMs like GPT-4 and LLaVA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02042v1,2024-07
Prompt Stability Scoring for Text Annotation with Large Language Models,"Christopher Barrie, Elli Palaiologou, Petter Törnberg","Researchers are increasingly using language models (LMs) for text annotation. These approaches rely only on a prompt telling the model to return a given output according to a set of instructions. The reproducibility of LM outputs may nonetheless be vulnerable to small changes in the prompt design. This calls into question the replicability of classification routines. To tackle this problem, researchers have typically tested a variety of semantically similar prompts to determine what we call ""prompt stability."" These approaches remain ad-hoc and task specific. In this article, we propose a general framework for diagnosing prompt stability by adapting traditional approaches to intra- and inter-coder reliability scoring. We call the resulting metric the Prompt Stability Score (PSS) and provide a Python package PromptStability for its estimation. Using six different datasets and twelve outcomes, we classify >150k rows of data to: a) diagnose when prompt stability is low; and b) demonstrate the functionality of the package. We conclude by providing best practice recommendations for applied researchers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02039v1,2024-07

"Breaking Bias, Building Bridges: Evaluation and Mitigation of Social Biases in LLMs via Contact Hypothesis","Chahat Raj, Anjishnu Mukherjee, Aylin Caliskan, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Ziwei Zhu","Large Language Models (LLMs) perpetuate social biases, reflecting prejudices in their training data and reinforcing societal stereotypes and inequalities. Our work explores the potential of the Contact Hypothesis, a concept from social psychology for debiasing LLMs. We simulate various forms of social contact through LLM prompting to measure their influence on the model's biases, mirroring how intergroup interactions can reduce prejudices in social contexts. We create a dataset of 108,000 prompts following a principled approach replicating social contact to measure biases in three LLMs (LLaMA 2, Tulu, and NousHermes) across 13 social bias dimensions. We propose a unique debiasing technique, Social Contact Debiasing (SCD), that instruction-tunes these models with unbiased responses to prompts. Our research demonstrates that LLM responses exhibit social biases when subject to contact probing, but more importantly, these biases can be significantly reduced by up to 40% in 1 epoch of instruction tuning LLaMA 2 following our SCD strategy. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/chahatraj/breakingbias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02030v1,2024-07
Why does in-context learning fail sometimes? Evaluating in-context learning on open and closed questions,"Xiang Li, Haoran Tang, Siyu Chen, Ziwei Wang, Ryan Chen, Marcin Abram","We measure the performance of in-context learning as a function of task novelty and difficulty for open and closed questions. For that purpose, we created a novel benchmark consisting of hard scientific questions, each paired with a context of various relevancy. We show that counter-intuitively, a context that is more aligned with the topic does not always help more than a less relevant context. This effect is especially visible for open questions and questions of high difficulty or novelty. This result reveals a fundamental difference between the treatment of close-form and open-form questions by large-language models and shows a need for a more robust evaluation of in-context learning on the variety of different types of questions. It also poses a new question of how to optimally select a context for large language models, especially in the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our results suggest that the answer to this question can be highly application-dependent and might be contingent on factors including the format of the question, the perceived difficulty level of the questions, and the novelty or popularity of the information we seek.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02028v1,2024-07
An End-to-End Speech Summarization Using Large Language Model,"Hengchao Shang, Zongyao Li, Jiaxin Guo, Shaojun Li, Zhiqiang Rao, Yuanchang Luo, Daimeng Wei, Hao Yang","Abstractive Speech Summarization (SSum) aims to generate human-like text summaries from spoken content. It encounters difficulties in handling long speech input and capturing the intricate cross-modal mapping between long speech inputs and short text summaries. Research on large language models (LLMs) and multimodal information fusion has provided new insights for addressing these challenges. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end SSum model that utilizes Q-Former as a connector for the audio-text modality and employs LLMs to generate text summaries directly from speech features. We adopt a multi-stage training approach that includes LLM based ASR and Text Summarization (TSum) tasks as auxiliary tasks. ASR tasks are used to align feature spaces and enhance the LLM's ability to handle longer speech. Then, we utilize a curriculum learning strategy to facilitate the model's transition from TSum to SSum. Finally, our model achieves competitive performance on the How-2 dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02005v1,2024-07
Towards the Next Frontier in Speech Representation Learning Using Disentanglement,"Varun Krishna, Sriram Ganapathy","The popular frameworks for self-supervised learning of speech representations have largely focused on frame-level masked prediction of speech regions. While this has shown promising downstream task performance for speech recognition and related tasks, this has largely ignored factors of speech that are encoded at coarser level, like characteristics of the speaker or channel that remain consistent through-out a speech utterance. In this work, we propose a framework for Learning Disentangled Self Supervised (termed as Learn2Diss) representations of speech, which consists of frame-level and an utterance-level encoder modules. The two encoders are initially learned independently, where the frame-level model is largely inspired by existing self supervision techniques, thereby learning pseudo-phonemic representations, while the utterance-level encoder is inspired by constrastive learning of pooled embeddings, thereby learning pseudo-speaker representations. The joint learning of these two modules consists of disentangling the two encoders using a mutual information based criterion. With several downstream evaluation experiments, we show that the proposed Learn2Diss achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks, with the frame-level encoder representations improving semantic tasks, while the utterance-level representations improve non-semantic tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02543v1,2024-07
The Art of Saying No: Contextual Noncompliance in Language Models,"Faeze Brahman, Sachin Kumar, Vidhisha Balachandran, Pradeep Dasigi, Valentina Pyatkin, Abhilasha Ravichander, Sarah Wiegreffe, Nouha Dziri, Khyathi Chandu, Jack Hessel, Yulia Tsvetkov, Noah A. Smith, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi","Chat-based language models are designed to be helpful, yet they should not comply with every user request. While most existing work primarily focuses on refusal of ""unsafe"" queries, we posit that the scope of noncompliance should be broadened. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of contextual noncompliance describing when and how models should not comply with user requests. Our taxonomy spans a wide range of categories including incomplete, unsupported, indeterminate, and humanizing requests (in addition to unsafe requests). To test noncompliance capabilities of language models, we use this taxonomy to develop a new evaluation suite of 1000 noncompliance prompts. We find that most existing models show significantly high compliance rates in certain previously understudied categories with models like GPT-4 incorrectly complying with as many as 30% of requests. To address these gaps, we explore different training strategies using a synthetically-generated training set of requests and expected noncompliant responses. Our experiments demonstrate that while direct finetuning of instruction-tuned models can lead to both over-refusal and a decline in general capabilities, using parameter efficient methods like low rank adapters helps to strike a good balance between appropriate noncompliance and other capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12043v2,2024-07
Simple Augmentations of Logical Rules for Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Completion,"Ananjan Nandi, Navdeep Kaur, Parag Singla, Mausam","High-quality and high-coverage rule sets are imperative to the success of Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Completion (NS-KGC) models, because they form the basis of all symbolic inferences. Recent literature builds neural models for generating rule sets, however, preliminary experiments show that they struggle with maintaining high coverage. In this work, we suggest three simple augmentations to existing rule sets: (1) transforming rules to their abductive forms, (2) generating equivalent rules that use inverse forms of constituent relations and (3) random walks that propose new rules. Finally, we prune potentially low quality rules. Experiments over four datasets and five ruleset-baseline settings suggest that these simple augmentations consistently improve results, and obtain up to 7.1 pt MRR and 8.5 pt Hits@1 gains over using rules without augmentations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01994v1,2024-07
Is Your Large Language Model Knowledgeable or a Choices-Only Cheater?,"Nishant Balepur, Rachel Rudinger","Recent work shows that large language models (LLMs) can answer multiple-choice questions using only the choices, but does this mean that MCQA leaderboard rankings of LLMs are largely influenced by abilities in choices-only settings? To answer this, we use a contrast set that probes if LLMs over-rely on choices-only shortcuts in MCQA. While previous works build contrast sets via expensive human annotations or model-generated data which can be biased, we employ graph mining to extract contrast sets from existing MCQA datasets. We use our method on UnifiedQA, a group of six commonsense reasoning datasets with high choices-only accuracy, to build an 820-question contrast set. After validating our contrast set, we test 12 LLMs, finding that these models do not exhibit reliance on choice-only shortcuts when given both the question and choices. Thus, despite the susceptibility~of MCQA to high choices-only accuracy, we argue that LLMs are not obtaining high ranks on MCQA leaderboards just due to their ability to exploit choices-only shortcuts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01992v1,2024-07
A Bounding Box is Worth One Token: Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model for Document Understanding,"Jinghui Lu, Haiyang Yu, Yanjie Wang, Yongjie Ye, Jingqun Tang, Ziwei Yang, Binghong Wu, Qi Liu, Hao Feng, Han Wang, Hao Liu, Can Huang","Recently, many studies have demonstrated that exclusively incorporating OCR-derived text and spatial layouts with large language models (LLMs) can be highly effective for document understanding tasks. However, existing methods that integrate spatial layouts with text have limitations, such as producing overly long text sequences or failing to fully leverage the autoregressive traits of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model (LayTextLLM)} for document understanding. In particular, LayTextLLM projects each bounding box to a single embedding and interleaves it with text, efficiently avoiding long sequence issues while leveraging autoregressive traits of LLMs. LayTextLLM not only streamlines the interaction of layout and textual data but also shows enhanced performance in Key Information Extraction (KIE) and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Comprehensive benchmark evaluations reveal significant improvements, with a 27.2% increase on KIE tasks and 12.0% on VQA tasks compared to previous state-of-the-art document understanding MLLMs, as well as a 15.1% improvement over other SOTA OCR-based LLMs on KIE tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01976v2,2024-07
AdaCQR: Enhancing Query Reformulation for Conversational Search via Sparse and Dense Retrieval Alignment,"Yilong Lai, Jialong Wu, Congzhi Zhang, Haowen Sun, Deyu Zhou","Conversational Query Reformulation (CQR) has significantly advanced in addressing the challenges of conversational search, particularly those stemming from the latent user intent and the need for historical context. Recent works aimed to boost the performance of CQR through alignment. However, they are designed for one specific retrieval system, which potentially results in sub-optimal generalization. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework AdaCQR. By aligning reformulation models with both term-based and semantic-based retrieval systems, AdaCQR enhances the generalizability of information-seeking queries among diverse retrieval environments through a two-stage training strategy. Moreover, two effective approaches are proposed to obtain superior labels and diverse input candidates, boosting the efficiency and robustness of the framework. Experimental results on the TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that AdaCQR outperforms the existing methods in a more efficient framework, offering both quantitative and qualitative improvements in conversational query reformulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01965v3,2024-07
Enabling Discriminative Reasoning in LLMs for Legal Judgment Prediction,"Chenlong Deng, Kelong Mao, Yuyao Zhang, Zhicheng Dou","Legal judgment prediction is essential for enhancing judicial efficiency. In this work, we identify that existing large language models (LLMs) underperform in this domain due to challenges in understanding case complexities and distinguishing between similar charges. To adapt LLMs for effective legal judgment prediction, we introduce the Ask-Discriminate-Predict (ADAPT) reasoning framework inspired by human judicial reasoning. ADAPT involves decomposing case facts, discriminating among potential charges, and predicting the final judgment. We further enhance LLMs through fine-tuning with multi-task synthetic trajectories to improve legal judgment prediction accuracy and efficiency under our ADAPT framework. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely-used datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework in legal judgment prediction, particularly when dealing with complex and confusing charges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01964v4,2024-07
S2D: Sorted Speculative Decoding For More Efficient Deployment of Nested Large Language Models,"Parsa Kavehzadeh, Mohammadreza Pourreza, Mojtaba Valipour, Tinashu Zhu, Haoli Bai, Ali Ghodsi, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh","Deployment of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) is costly, and as these models increase in size, the associated costs will become even more considerable. Consequently, different methods have been proposed to accelerate the token generation process and reduce costs. Speculative decoding (SD) is among the most promising approaches to speed up the LLM decoding process by verifying multiple tokens in parallel and using an auxiliary smaller draft model to generate the possible tokens. In SD, usually, one draft model is used to serve a specific target model; however, in practice, LLMs are diverse, and we might need to deal with many target models or more than one target model simultaneously. In this scenario, it is not clear which draft model should be used for which target model, and searching among different draft models or training customized draft models can further increase deployment costs. In this paper, we first introduce a novel multi-target scenario for the deployment of draft models for faster inference. Then, we present a novel, more efficient sorted speculative decoding mechanism that outperforms regular baselines in multi-target settings. We evaluated our method on Spec-Bench in different settings, including base models such as Vicuna 7B, 13B, and LLama Chat 70B. Our results suggest that our draft models perform better than baselines for multiple target models at the same time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01955v1,2024-07
Extracting and Encoding: Leveraging Large Language Models and Medical Knowledge to Enhance Radiological Text Representation,"Pablo Messina, René Vidal, Denis Parra, Álvaro Soto, Vladimir Araujo","Advancing representation learning in specialized fields like medicine remains challenging due to the scarcity of expert annotations for text and images. To tackle this issue, we present a novel two-stage framework designed to extract high-quality factual statements from free-text radiology reports in order to improve the representations of text encoders and, consequently, their performance on various downstream tasks. In the first stage, we propose a \textit{Fact Extractor} that leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify factual statements from well-curated domain-specific datasets. In the second stage, we introduce a \textit{Fact Encoder} (CXRFE) based on a BERT model fine-tuned with objective functions designed to improve its representations using the extracted factual data. Our framework also includes a new embedding-based metric (CXRFEScore) for evaluating chest X-ray text generation systems, leveraging both stages of our approach. Extensive evaluations show that our fact extractor and encoder outperform current state-of-the-art methods in tasks such as sentence ranking, natural language inference, and label extraction from radiology reports. Additionally, our metric proves to be more robust and effective than existing metrics commonly used in the radiology report generation literature.

Certainly Uncertain: A Benchmark and Metric for Multimodal Epistemic and Aleatoric Awareness,"Khyathi Raghavi Chandu, Linjie Li, Anas Awadalla, Ximing Lu, Jae Sung Park, Jack Hessel, Lijuan Wang, Yejin Choi","The ability to acknowledge the inevitable uncertainty in their knowledge and reasoning is a prerequisite for AI systems to be truly truthful and reliable. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of uncertainty specific to vision-language AI systems, distinguishing between epistemic uncertainty (arising from a lack of information) and aleatoric uncertainty (due to inherent unpredictability), and further explore finer categories within. Based on this taxonomy, we synthesize a benchmark dataset, CertainlyUncertain, featuring 178K visual question answering (VQA) samples as contrastive pairs. This is achieved by 1) inpainting images to make previously answerable questions into unanswerable ones; and 2) using image captions to prompt large language models for both answerable and unanswerable questions.

Efficient-Empathy: Towards Efficient and Effective Selection of Empathy Data,"Linzhuang Sun, Hao Liang, Jingxuan Wei, Linkun Sun, Bihui Yu, Bin Cui, Wentao Zhang","In recent years, with the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), achieving excellent empathetic response capability has become a crucial prerequisite. Consequently, managing and understanding large-scale video datasets has gained increasing importance. However, empathetic data are typically trained without any quality selection, leading to inefficient data usage and wasted computational resources. Additionally, using raw data can result in low performance in empathetic dialogues. In this work, we present Efficient-Empathy, a sensibility and rationality score-based data selection algorithm that automatically selects sensibility and rationality data while discarding low-quality data. With only the sensibility data (59% of the full dataset), our trained sensibility model efficiently achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance. Furthermore, with multiple data selection hyperparameters, the sensibility model demonstrates SoTA performance, showcasing the robustness of our method. By integrating sensibility and rationality data with a MoE structure, we achieve even higher performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our Efficient-Empathy algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01937v2,2024-07

We seek to initiate a novel perspective of scientific progress, in addition to the more well-studied emergence of new terms. To this end, we construct the data infrastructure based on recent NLP publications. Then, we perform a series of text-based analyses toward a detailed, quantitative understanding of the use of Language Models as a term of art.

To Forget or Not? Towards Practical Knowledge Unlearning for Large Language Models,"Bozhong Tian, Xiaozhuan Liang, Siyuan Cheng, Qingbin Liu, Mengru Wang, Dianbo Sui, Xi Chen, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on extensive corpora inevitably retain sensitive data, such as personal privacy information and copyrighted material. Recent advancements in knowledge unlearning involve updating LLM parameters to erase specific knowledge. However, current unlearning paradigms are mired in vague forgetting boundaries, often erasing knowledge indiscriminately. In this work, we introduce KnowUnDo, a benchmark containing copyrighted content and user privacy domains to evaluate if the unlearning process inadvertently erases essential knowledge. Our findings indicate that existing unlearning methods often suffer from excessive unlearning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, MemFlex, which utilizes gradient information to precisely target and unlearn sensitive parameters.

We trained and validated Med-Pal, a medication domain-specific LLM-chatbot fine-tuned with a fine-grained and expert curated dataset from a selection of five light-weighted open-source LLMs of smaller parameter size (7 billion or less) regarding computational constraints and prioritizing operational efficiency. A multi-disciplinary team performed a clinical evaluation of LLMs responses using the SCORE criteria, focusing on safety, accuracy, bias, reproducibility, and ease of understanding. Best performing light-weighted LLM was chosen as Med-Pal for further engineering with guard-railing using adversarial prompting. Med-Pal and existing light-weighted LLMs, including pretrained Biomistral and finetuned Meerkat, were validated on an independent dataset on a broad range of medication-related questions (231 in total), 12 different question types across 14 different medication classes. Mistral-7b emerged as the top performer among selected lightweight LLMs, achieving the highest median score of 14 and 71.9% high-quality responses in accuracy and safety domains, hence chosen as the backbone LLM for Med-Pal. When compared against Biomistral, Med-pal outperformed in generating responses appropriate for patient communication, with significant reductions bias and errors typical of general LLMs. Comparable performance was observed when comparing Med-Pal with Meerkat. Med-Pal showcases the feasibility of developing and employing fine-tuned light-weighted LLMs to enhance digital health communications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12822v1,2024-07
Investigating the Effects of Large-Scale Pseudo-Stereo Data and Different Speech Foundation Model on Dialogue Generative Spoken Language Model,"Yu-Kuan Fu, Cheng-Kuang Lee, Hsiu-Hsuan Wang, Hung-yi Lee","Recent efforts in Spoken Dialogue Modeling aim to synthesize spoken dialogue without the need for direct transcription, thereby preserving the wealth of non-textual information inherent in speech. However, this approach faces a challenge when speakers talk simultaneously, requiring stereo dialogue data with speakers recorded on separate channels, a notably scarce resource. To address this, we have developed an innovative pipeline capable of transforming single-channel dialogue data into pseudo-stereo data. This expanded our training dataset from a mere 2,000 to an impressive 17,600 hours, significantly enriching the diversity and quality of the training examples available. The inclusion of this pseudo-stereo data has proven to be effective in improving the performance of spoken dialogue language models. Additionally, we explored the use of discrete units of different speech foundation models for spoken dialogue generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01911v1,2024-07
Pinyin Regularization in Error Correction for Chinese Speech Recognition with Large Language Models,"Zhiyuan Tang, Dong Wang, Shen Huang, Shidong Shang","Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in error correction for automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, much of the research focuses on the English language. This paper redirects the attention to Chinese. Firstly, we construct a specialized benchmark dataset aimed at error correction for Chinese ASR with 724K hypotheses-transcription pairs, named the Chinese Hypotheses Paradise dataset (ChineseHP), which contains a wide range of scenarios and presents significant challenges. Subsequently, we conduct a preliminary evaluation using the dataset for both direct-prompting and fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward method of Pinyin regularization for prompts, which involves the transcription of Pinyin directly from text hypotheses. The experimental results reveal that Pinyin regularization consistently enhances the error-correcting ability of LLMs when compared with those without regularization. The dataset is available on the website.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01909v1,2024-07
Let the Expert Stick to His Last: Expert-Specialized Fine-Tuning for Sparse Architectural Large Language Models,"Zihan Wang, Deli Chen, Damai Dai, Runxin Xu, Zhuoshu Li, Y. Wu","Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is crucial for customizing Large Language Models (LLMs) with constrained resources. Although there have been various PEFT methods for dense-architecture LLMs, PEFT for sparse-architecture LLMs is still underexplored. In this work, we study the PEFT method for LLMs with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and the contents of this work are mainly threefold: (1) We investigate the dispersion degree of the activated experts in customized tasks, and found that the routing distribution for a specific task tends to be highly concentrated, while the distribution of activated experts varies significantly across different tasks. (2) We propose Expert-Specialized Fine-Tuning, or ESFT, which tunes the experts most relevant to downstream tasks while freezing the other experts and modules; experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves the tuning efficiency, but also matches or even surpasses the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning. (3) We further analyze the impact of the MoE architecture on expert-specialized fine-tuning. We find that MoE models with finer-grained experts are more advantageous in selecting the combination of experts that are most relevant to downstream tasks, thereby enhancing both the training efficiency and effectiveness.

SoP: Unlock the Power of Social Facilitation for Automatic Jailbreak Attack,"Yan Yang, Zeguan Xiao, Xin Lu, Hongru Wang, Hailiang Huang, Guanhua Chen, Yun Chen","The widespread applications of large language models (LLMs) have brought about concerns regarding their potential misuse. Although aligned with human preference data before release, LLMs remain vulnerable to various malicious attacks. In this paper, we adopt a red-teaming strategy to enhance LLM safety and introduce SoP, a simple yet effective framework to design jailbreak prompts automatically. Inspired by the social facilitation concept, SoP generates and optimizes multiple jailbreak characters to bypass the guardrails of the target LLM. Different from previous work which relies on proprietary LLMs or seed jailbreak templates crafted by human expertise, SoP can generate and optimize the jailbreak prompt in a cold-start scenario using open-sourced LLMs without any seed jailbreak templates. Experimental results show that SoP achieves attack success rates of 88% and 60% in bypassing the safety alignment of GPT-3.5-1106 and GPT-4, respectively. Furthermore, we extensively evaluate the transferability of the generated templates across different LLMs and held-out malicious requests, while also exploring defense strategies against the jailbreak attack designed by SoP.

Scope-enhanced Compositional Semantic Parsing for DRT,"Xiulin Yang, Jonas Groschwitz, Alexander Koller, Johan Bos","Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) distinguishes itself from other semantic representation frameworks by its ability to model complex semantic and discourse phenomena through structural nesting and variable binding. While seq2seq models hold the state of the art on DRT parsing, their accuracy degrades with the complexity of the sentence, and they sometimes struggle to produce well-formed DRT representations. We introduce the AMS parser, a compositional, neurosymbolic semantic parser for DRT. It rests on a novel mechanism for predicting quantifier scope. We show that the AMS parser reliably produces well-formed outputs and performs well on DRT parsing, especially on complex sentences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01899v2,2024-07

This approach effectively summarizes descriptions related to specific images, tables, and appendices within lengthy texts. Our experiments demonstrate that leveraging high-quality OCR data and initially extracted information from the original text enables efficient summarization of the content related to described objects. Based on these findings, we enhanced popular text generation model models by incorporating additional auxiliary branches to improve summarization performance.

LogEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark Suite for Large Language Models In Log Analysis,"Tianyu Cui, Shiyu Ma, Ziang Chen, Tong Xiao, Shimin Tao, Yilun Liu, Shenglin Zhang, Duoming Lin, Changchang Liu, Yuzhe Cai, Weibin Meng, Yongqian Sun, Dan Pei","Log analysis is crucial for ensuring the orderly and stable operation of information systems, particularly in the field of Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps). Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in natural language processing tasks. In the AIOps domain, they excel in tasks such as anomaly detection, root cause analysis of faults, operations and maintenance script generation, and alert information summarization. However, the performance of current LLMs in log analysis tasks remains inadequately validated. To address this gap, we introduce LogEval, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in various log analysis tasks for the first time. This benchmark covers tasks such as log parsing, log anomaly detection, log fault diagnosis, and log summarization. LogEval evaluates each task using 4,000 publicly available log data entries and employs 15 different prompts for each task to ensure a thorough and fair assessment. By rigorously evaluating leading LLMs, we demonstrate the impact of various LLM technologies on log analysis performance, focusing on aspects such as self-consistency and few-shot contextual learning. We also discuss findings related to model quantification, Chinese-English question-answering evaluation, and prompt engineering. These findings provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in multilingual environments and the effectiveness of different prompt strategies. Various evaluation methods are employed for different tasks to accurately measure the performance of LLMs in log analysis, ensuring a comprehensive assessment. The insights gained from LogEvals evaluation reveal the strengths and limitations of LLMs in log analysis tasks, providing valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01896v1,2024-07
GRASP: A Grid-Based Benchmark for Evaluating Commonsense Spatial Reasoning,"Zhisheng Tang, Mayank Kejriwal","Spatial reasoning, an important faculty of human cognition with many practical applications, is one of the core commonsense skills that is not purely language-based and, for satisfying (as opposed to optimal) solutions, requires some minimum degree of planning. Existing benchmarks of Commonsense Spatial Reasoning (CSR) tend to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret text-based spatial descriptions rather than directly evaluate a plan produced by the LLM in response to a spatial reasoning scenario. In this paper, we construct a large-scale benchmark called $\textbf{GRASP}$, which consists of 16,000 grid-based environments where the agent is tasked with an energy collection problem. These environments include 100 grid instances instantiated using each of the 160 different grid settings, involving five different energy distributions, two modes of agent starting position, and two distinct obstacle configurations, as well as three kinds of agent constraints. Using GRASP, we compare classic baseline approaches, such as random walk and greedy search methods, with advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o. The experimental results indicate that even these advanced LLMs struggle to consistently achieve satisfactory solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01892v1,2024-07
Beyond Numeric Awards: In-Context Dueling Bandits with LLM Agents,"Fanzeng Xia, Hao Liu, Yisong Yue, Tongxin Li","In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is a frontier paradigm for solving reinforcement learning problems in the foundation model era. While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains largely unexplored. Recent findings highlight that LLMs often face challenges when dealing with numerical contexts, and limited attention has been paid to evaluating their performance through preference feedback generated by the environment. This paper is the first to investigate LLMs as in-context decision-makers under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless preference-based reinforcement learning setting that extends the classic Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model by querying for preference feedback. We compare GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and o1-Preview against nine well-established DB algorithms. Our results reveal that our top-performing LLM, GPT-4 Turbo, has the zero-shot relative decision-making ability to achieve surprisingly low weak regret across all the DB environment instances by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow framework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates off-the-shelf DB algorithms with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive interplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of our framework sheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of LLMs used for in-context decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01887v3,2024-07
"Survey on Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models: Methods, Evaluation, and Application","Chuanpeng Yang, Wang Lu, Yao Zhu, Yidong Wang, Qian Chen, Chenlong Gao, Bingjie Yan, Yiqiang Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional capabilities in various domains, attracting significant interest from both academia and industry. Despite their impressive performance, the substantial size and computational demands of LLMs pose considerable challenges for practical deployment, particularly in environments with limited resources. The endeavor to compress language models while maintaining their accuracy has become a focal point of research. Among the various methods, knowledge distillation has emerged as an effective technique to enhance inference speed without greatly compromising performance. This paper presents a thorough survey from three aspects: method, evaluation, and application, exploring knowledge distillation techniques tailored specifically for LLMs. Specifically, we divide the methods into white-box KD and black-box KD to better illustrate their differences. Furthermore, we also explored the evaluation tasks and distillation effects between different distillation methods, and proposed directions for future research.

Compare without Despair: Reliable Preference Evaluation with Generation Separability,"Sayan Ghosh, Tejas Srinivasan, Swabha Swayamdipta","Human evaluation of generated language through pairwise preference judgments is pervasive. However, under common scenarios, such as when generations from a model pair are very similar, or when stochastic decoding results in large variations in generations, it results in inconsistent preference ratings. We address these challenges by introducing a meta-evaluation measure, separability, which estimates how suitable a test instance is for pairwise preference evaluation. For a candidate test instance, separability samples multiple generations from a pair of models, and measures how distinguishable the two sets of generations are. Our experiments show that instances with high separability values yield more consistent preference ratings from both human- and auto-raters. Further, the distribution of separability allows insights into which test benchmarks are more valuable for comparing models. Finally, we incorporate separability into ELO ratings, accounting for how suitable each test instance might be for reliably ranking LLMs. Overall, separability has implications for consistent, efficient and robust preference evaluation of LLMs with both human- and auto-raters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01878v3,2024-07
Automated Text Scoring in the Age of Generative AI for the GPU-poor,"Christopher Michael Ormerod, Alexander Kwako","Current research on generative language models (GLMs) for automated text scoring (ATS) has focused almost exclusively on querying proprietary models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Yet such practices raise issues around transparency and security, and these methods offer little in the way of efficiency or customizability. With the recent proliferation of smaller, open-source models, there is the option to explore GLMs with computers equipped with modest, consumer-grade hardware, that is, for the ""GPU poor."" In this study, we analyze the performance and efficiency of open-source, small-scale GLMs for ATS. Results show that GLMs can be fine-tuned to achieve adequate, though not state-of-the-art, performance. In addition to ATS, we take small steps towards analyzing models' capacity for generating feedback by prompting GLMs to explain their scores. Model-generated feedback shows promise, but requires more rigorous evaluation focused on targeted use cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01873v1,2024-07
VSP: Assessing the dual challenges of perception and reasoning in spatial planning tasks for VLMs,"Qiucheng Wu, Handong Zhao, Michael Saxon, Trung Bui, William Yang Wang, Yang Zhang, Shiyu Chang","Vision language models (VLMs) are an exciting emerging class of language models (LMs) that have merged classic LM capabilities with those of image processing systems. However, the ways that these capabilities combine are not always intuitive and warrant direct investigation. One understudied capability in VLMs is visual spatial planning -- the ability to comprehend the spatial arrangements of objects and devise action plans to achieve desired outcomes in visual scenes. In our study, we introduce VSP, a benchmark that 1) evaluates the spatial planning capability in these models in general, and 2) breaks down the visual planning task into finer-grained sub-tasks, including perception and reasoning, and measure the LMs capabilities in these sub-tasks. Our evaluation shows that both open-source and private VLMs fail to generate effective plans for even simple spatial planning tasks. Evaluations on the fine-grained analytical tasks further reveal fundamental deficiencies in the models' visual perception and bottlenecks in reasoning abilities, explaining their worse performance in the general spatial planning tasks. Our work illuminates future directions for improving VLMs' abilities in spatial planning. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Visual-Spatial-Planning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01863v1,2024-07
Improving Multilingual Instruction Finetuning via Linguistically Natural and Diverse Datasets,"Sathish Reddy Indurthi, Wenxuan Zhou, Shamil Chollampatt, Ravi Agrawal, Kaiqiang Song, Lingxiao Zhao, Chenguang Zhu","Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced instruction-following capabilities. However, most Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) datasets are predominantly in English, limiting model performance in other languages. Traditional methods for creating multilingual IFT datasets such as translating existing English IFT datasets or converting existing NLP datasets into IFT datasets by templating, struggle to capture linguistic nuances and ensure prompt (instruction) diversity. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for collecting multilingual IFT datasets that preserves linguistic naturalness and ensures prompt diversity. This approach leverages English-focused LLMs, monolingual corpora, and a scoring function to create high-quality, diversified IFT datasets in multiple languages. Experiments demonstrate that LLMs finetuned using these IFT datasets show notable improvements in both generative and discriminative tasks, indicating enhanced language comprehension by LLMs in non-English contexts. Specifically, on the multilingual summarization task, LLMs using our IFT dataset achieved 17.57% and 15.23% improvements over LLMs fine-tuned with translation-based and template-based datasets, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01853v1,2024-07
Purple-teaming LLMs with Adversarial Defender Training,"Jingyan Zhou, Kun Li, Junan Li, Jiawen Kang, Minda Hu, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng","Existing efforts in safeguarding LLMs are limited in actively exposing the vulnerabilities of the target LLM and readily adapting to newly emerging safety risks. To address this, we present Purple-teaming LLMs with Adversarial Defender training (PAD), a pipeline designed to safeguard LLMs by novelly incorporating the red-teaming (attack) and blue-teaming (safety training) techniques. In PAD, we automatically collect conversational data that cover the vulnerabilities of an LLM around specific safety risks in a self-play manner, where the attacker aims to elicit unsafe responses and the defender generates safe responses to these attacks. We then update both modules in a generative adversarial network style by training the attacker to elicit more unsafe responses and updating the defender to identify them and explain the unsafe reason. Experimental results demonstrate that PAD significantly outperforms existing baselines in both finding effective attacks and establishing a robust safe guardrail. Furthermore, our findings indicate that PAD excels in striking a balance between safety and overall model quality. We also reveal key challenges in safeguarding LLMs, including defending multi-turn attacks and the need for more delicate strategies to identify specific risks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01850v1,2024-07

A Study of Nationality Bias in Names and Perplexity using Off-the-Shelf Affect-related Tweet Classifiers,"Valentin Barriere, Sebastian Cifuentes","In this paper, we apply a method to quantify biases associated with named entities from various countries. We create counterfactual examples with small perturbations on target-domain data instead of relying on templates or specific datasets for bias detection. On widely used classifiers for subjectivity analysis, including sentiment, emotion, hate speech, and offensive text using Twitter data, our results demonstrate positive biases related to the language spoken in a country across all classifiers studied. Notably, the presence of certain country names in a sentence can strongly influence predictions, up to a 23\% change in hate speech detection and up to a 60\% change in the prediction of negative emotions such as anger. We hypothesize that these biases stem from the training data of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and find correlations between affect predictions and PLMs likelihood in English and unknown languages like Basque and Maori, revealing distinct patterns with exacerbate correlations. Further, we followed these correlations in-between counterfactual examples from a same sentence to remove the syntactical component, uncovering interesting results suggesting the impact of the pre-training data was more important for English-speaking-country names.

Empathic Grounding: Explorations using Multimodal Interaction and Large Language Models with Conversational Agents,"Mehdi Arjmand, Farnaz Nouraei, Ian Steenstra, Timothy Bickmore","We introduce the concept of ""empathic grounding"" in conversational agents as an extension of Clark's conceptualization of grounding in conversation in which the grounding criterion includes listener empathy for the speaker's affective state. Empathic grounding is generally required whenever the speaker's emotions are foregrounded and can make the grounding process more efficient and reliable by communicating both propositional and affective understanding. Both speaker expressions of affect and listener empathic grounding can be multimodal, including facial expressions and other nonverbal displays. Thus, models of empathic grounding for embodied agents should be multimodal to facilitate natural and efficient communication. We describe a multimodal model that takes as input user speech and facial expression to generate multimodal grounding moves for a listening agent using a large language model. We also describe a testbed to evaluate approaches to empathic grounding, in which a humanoid robot interviews a user about a past episode of pain and then has the user rate their perception of the robot's empathy. We compare our proposed model to one that only generates non-affective grounding cues in a between-subjects experiment. Findings demonstrate that empathic grounding increases user perceptions of empathy, understanding, emotional intelligence, and trust. Our work highlights the role of emotion awareness and multimodality in generating appropriate grounding moves for conversational agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01824v1,2024-07
Race and Privacy in Broadcast Police Communications,"Pranav Narayanan Venkit, Christopher Graziul, Miranda Ardith Goodman, Samantha Nicole Kenny, Shomir Wilson","Radios are essential for the operations of modern police departments, and they function as both a collaborative communication technology and a sociotechnical system. However, little prior research has examined their usage or their connections to individual privacy and the role of race in policing, two growing topics of concern in the US. As a case study, we examine the Chicago Police Department's (CPD's) use of broadcast police communications (BPC) to coordinate the activity of law enforcement officers (LEOs) in the city. From a recently assembled archive of 80,775 hours of BPC associated with CPD operations, we analyze text transcripts of radio transmissions broadcast 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on August 10th, 2018 in one majority Black, one majority white, and one majority Hispanic area of the city (24 hours of audio) to explore three research questions: (1) Do BPC reflect reported racial disparities in policing? (2) How and when is gender, race/ethnicity, and age mentioned in BPC? (3) To what extent do BPC include sensitive information, and who is put at most risk by this practice? (4) To what extent can large language models (LLMs) heighten this risk? We explore the vocabulary and speech acts used by police in BPC, comparing mentions of personal characteristics to local demographics, the personal information shared over BPC, and the privacy concerns that it poses. Analysis indicates (a) policing professionals in the city of Chicago exhibit disproportionate attention to Black members of the public regardless of context, (b) sociodemographic characteristics like gender, race/ethnicity, and age are primarily mentioned in BPC about event information, and (c) disproportionate attention introduces disproportionate privacy risks for Black members of the public.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01817v1,2024-07
AutoFlow: Automated Workflow Generation for Large Language Model Agents,"Zelong Li, Shuyuan Xu, Kai Mei, Wenyue Hua, Balaji Rama, Om Raheja, Hao Wang, He Zhu, Yongfeng Zhang","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in understanding complex natural language. One important application of LLM is LLM-based AI Agent, which leverages the ability of LLM as well as external tools for complex-task solving. To make sure LLM Agents follow an effective and reliable procedure to solve the given task, manually designed workflows are usually used to guide the working mechanism of agents. However, manually designing the workflows requires considerable efforts and domain knowledge, making it difficult to develop and deploy agents on massive scales. To address these issues, we propose AutoFlow, a framework designed to automatically generate workflows for agents to solve complex tasks. AutoFlow takes natural language program as the format of agent workflow and employs a workflow optimization procedure to iteratively optimize the workflow quality. Besides, this work offers two workflow generation methods: fine-tuning-based and in-context-based methods, making the AutoFlow framework applicable to both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Experimental results show that our framework can produce robust and reliable agent workflows.

Ground Every Sentence: Improving Retrieval-Augmented LLMs with Interleaved Reference-Claim Generation,"Sirui Xia, Xintao Wang, Jiaqing Liang, Yifei Zhang, Weikang Zhou, Jiaji Deng, Fei Yu, Yanghua Xiao","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks. Recently, Attributed Text Generation (ATG) has attracted growing attention, which provides citations to support the model's responses in RAG, so as to enhance the credibility of LLM-generated content and facilitate verification. Prior methods mainly adopt coarse-grained attributions, linking to passage-level references or providing paragraph-level citations. However, these methods still fall short in verifiability and require certain time costs for fact checking. This paper proposes a fine-grained ATG method called ReClaim(Refer & Claim), which alternates the generation of references and answers step by step. Unlike traditional coarse-grained attribution, ReClaim allows the model to add sentence-level fine-grained citations to each answer sentence in long-form question-answering tasks.

Analyzing Persuasive Strategies in Meme Texts: A Fusion of Language Models with Paraphrase Enrichment,"Kota Shamanth Ramanath Nayak, Leila Kosseim","This paper describes our approach to hierarchical multi-label detection of persuasion techniques in meme texts. Our model, developed as a part of the recent SemEval task, is based on fine-tuning individual language models (BERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mBERT) and leveraging a mean-based ensemble model in addition to dataset augmentation through paraphrase generation from ChatGPT. The scope of the study encompasses enhancing model performance through innovative training techniques and data augmentation strategies. The problem addressed is the effective identification and classification of multiple persuasive techniques in meme texts, a task complicated by the diversity and complexity of such content. The objective of the paper is to improve detection accuracy by refining model training methods and examining the impact of balanced versus unbalanced training datasets. Novelty in the results and discussion lies in the finding that training with paraphrases enhances model performance, yet a balanced training set proves more advantageous than a larger unbalanced one. Additionally, the analysis reveals the potential pitfalls of indiscriminate incorporation of paraphrases from diverse distributions, which can introduce substantial noise. Results with the SemEval 2024 data confirm these insights, demonstrating improved model efficacy with the proposed methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01784v1,2024-07

We are particularly interested in understanding how LLM can aid (human) modellers in creating process flow diagrams. To this purpose, we first conduct a preliminary user study (n=10) with professional process modellers from Hilti, inquiring for various pain-points they encounter in their daily routines.

The Need for Guardrails with Large Language Models in Medical Safety-Critical Settings: An Artificial Intelligence Application in the Pharmacovigilance Ecosystem,"Joe B Hakim, Jeffery L Painter, Darmendra Ramcharran, Vijay Kara, Greg Powell, Paulina Sobczak, Chiho Sato, Andrew Bate, Andrew Beam","Large language models (LLMs) are useful tools with the capacity for performing specific types of knowledge work at an effective scale. However, LLM deployments in high-risk and safety-critical domains pose unique challenges, notably the issue of ``hallucination,'' where LLMs can generate fabricated information. This is particularly concerning in settings such as drug safety, where inaccuracies could lead to patient harm. To mitigate these risks, we have developed and demonstrated a proof of concept suite of guardrails specifically designed to mitigate certain types of hallucinations and errors for drug safety, and potentially applicable to other medical safety-critical contexts. These guardrails include mechanisms to detect anomalous documents to prevent the ingestion of inappropriate data, identify incorrect drug names or adverse event terms, and convey uncertainty in generated content. We integrated these guardrails with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task, which involves converting both structured and unstructured data within adverse event reports into natural language. This method was applied to translate individual case safety reports, demonstrating effective application in a pharmacovigilance processing task. Our guardrail framework offers a set of tools with broad applicability across various domains, ensuring LLMs can be safely used in high-risk situations by eliminating the occurrence of key errors, including the generation of incorrect pharmacovigilance-related terms, thus adhering to stringent regulatory and quality standards in medical safety-critical environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18322v2,2024-07

The benchmark is designed to systematically assess current model capabilities in discovery tasks and provide a useful resource for improving them. Our benchmark contains 264 tasks collected across 6 diverse domains, such as sociology and engineering, by manually deriving discovery workflows from published papers to approximate the real-world challenges faced by researchers, where each task is defined by a dataset, its metadata, and a discovery goal in natural language. We additionally provide 903 synthetic tasks to conduct controlled evaluations across task complexity. Furthermore, our structured formalism of data-driven discovery enables a facet-based evaluation that provides useful insights into different failure modes. We evaluate several popular LLM-based reasoning frameworks using both open and closed LLMs as baselines on DiscoveryBench and find that even the best system scores only 25%. Our benchmark, thus, illustrates the challenges in autonomous data-driven discovery and serves as a valuable resource for the community to make progress.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01725v1,2024-07
NLPGuard: A Framework for Mitigating the Use of Protected Attributes by NLP Classifiers,"Salvatore Greco, Ke Zhou, Licia Capra, Tania Cerquitelli, Daniele Quercia","AI regulations are expected to prohibit machine learning models from using sensitive attributes during training. However, the latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) classifiers, which rely on deep learning, operate as black-box systems, complicating the detection and remediation of such misuse. Traditional bias mitigation methods in NLP aim for comparable performance across different groups based on attributes like gender or race but fail to address the underlying issue of reliance on protected attributes. To partly fix that, we introduce NLPGuard, a framework for mitigating the reliance on protected attributes in NLP classifiers. NLPGuard takes an unlabeled dataset, an existing NLP classifier, and its training data as input, producing a modified training dataset that significantly reduces dependence on protected attributes without compromising accuracy. NLPGuard is applied to three classification tasks: identifying toxic language, sentiment analysis, and occupation classification. Our evaluation shows that current NLP classifiers heavily depend on protected attributes, with up to $23\%$ of the most predictive words associated with these attributes. However, NLPGuard effectively reduces this reliance by up to $79\%$, while slightly improving accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01697v1,2024-07
"Deciphering the Factors Influencing the Efficacy of Chain-of-Thought: Probability, Memorization, and Noisy Reasoning","Akshara Prabhakar, Thomas L. Griffiths, R. Thomas McCoy","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the multi-step reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, debates persist about whether LLMs exhibit abstract generalization or rely on shallow heuristics when given CoT prompts. To understand the factors influencing CoT reasoning we provide a detailed case study of the symbolic reasoning task of decoding shift ciphers, where letters are shifted forward some number of steps in the alphabet. We analyze the pattern of results produced by three LLMs -- GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3.1 -- performing this task using CoT prompting. By focusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three factors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the task's expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned during pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations involved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can drastically influence task accuracy across all three LLMs; e.g., when tested with GPT-4, varying the output's probability of occurrence shifts accuracy from 26% to 70%. Overall, we conclude that CoT prompting performance reflects both memorization and a probabilistic version of genuine reasoning.

"KV Cache Compression, But What Must We Give in Return? A Comprehensive Benchmark of Long Context Capable Approaches","Jiayi Yuan, Hongyi Liu, Shaochen Zhong, Yu-Neng Chuang, Songchen Li, Guanchu Wang, Duy Le, Hongye Jin, Vipin Chaudhary, Zhaozhuo Xu, Zirui Liu, Xia Hu","Long context capability is a crucial competency for large language models (LLMs) as it mitigates the human struggle to digest long-form texts. This capability enables complex task-solving scenarios such as book summarization, code assistance, and many more tasks that are traditionally manpower-intensive. However, transformer-based LLMs face significant challenges with long context input due to the growing size of the KV cache and the intrinsic complexity of attending to extended inputs; where multiple schools of efficiency-driven approaches - such as KV cache quantization, token dropping, prompt compression, linear-time sequence models, and hybrid architectures - have been proposed to produce efficient yet long context-capable models. Despite these advancements, no existing work has comprehensively benchmarked these methods in a reasonably aligned environment. In this work, we fill this gap by providing a taxonomy of current methods and evaluating 10+ state-of-the-art approaches across seven categories of long context tasks.

We propose a new task called 3D reasoning grounding and introduce a new benchmark ScanReason which provides over 10K question-answer-location pairs from five reasoning types that require the synerization of reasoning and grounding. We further design our approach, ReGround3D, composed of the visual-centric reasoning module empowered by Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) and the 3D grounding module to obtain accurate object locations by looking back to the enhanced geometry and fine-grained details from the 3D scenes.

Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in various tasks, particularly in single-page document understanding (DU). However, their abilities on long-context DU remain an open problem. This work presents MMLongBench-Doc, a long-context, multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,062 expert-annotated questions. Distinct from previous datasets, it is constructed upon 130 lengthy PDF-formatted documents with an average of 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens. Towards comprehensive evaluation, answers to these questions rely on pieces of evidence from (1) different sources (text, image, chart, table, and layout structure) and (2) various locations (i.e. page number). Moreover, 33.2% of the questions are cross-page questions requiring evidence across multiple pages. 22.8% of the questions are designed to be unanswerable for detecting potential hallucinations. Experiments on 14 LVLMs demonstrate that long-context DU greatly challenges current models. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an F1 score of only 42.7%, while the second-best, GPT-4V, scores 31.4%. Furthermore, 12 LVLMs (all except GPT-4o and GPT-4V) even present worse performance than their LLM counterparts which are fed with lossy-parsed OCR documents. These results validate the necessity of future research toward more capable long-context LVLMs. Project Page: https://mayubo2333.github.io/MMLongBench-Doc",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01523v3,2024-07

Self-Cognition in Large Language Models: An Exploratory Study,"Dongping Chen, Jiawen Shi, Yao Wan, Pan Zhou, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Lichao Sun","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various applications, they also raise concerns regarding self-cognition. In this paper, we perform a pioneering study to explore self-cognition in LLMs. Specifically, we first construct a pool of self-cognition instruction prompts to evaluate where an LLM exhibits self-cognition and four well-designed principles to quantify LLMs' self-cognition. Our study reveals that 4 of the 48 models on Chatbot Arena--specifically Command R, Claude3-Opus, Llama-3-70b-Instruct, and Reka-core--demonstrate some level of detectable self-cognition. We observe a positive correlation between model size, training data quality, and self-cognition level. Additionally, we also explore the utility and trustworthiness of LLM in the self-cognition state, revealing that the self-cognition state enhances some specific tasks such as creative writing and exaggeration. We believe that our work can serve as an inspiration for further research to study the self-cognition in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01505v1,2024-07
RegMix: Data Mixture as Regression for Language Model Pre-training,"Qian Liu, Xiaosen Zheng, Niklas Muennighoff, Guangtao Zeng, Longxu Dou, Tianyu Pang, Jing Jiang, Min Lin","The data mixture for large language model pre-training significantly impacts performance, yet how to determine an effective mixture remains unclear. We propose RegMix to automatically identify a high-performing data mixture by formulating it as a regression task. RegMix involves training a set of small models with diverse data mixtures and fitting a regression model to predict their performance given their respective mixtures. With the fitted regression model, we simulate the top-ranked mixture and use it to train a large-scale model with orders of magnitude more compute. To empirically validate RegMix, we train 512 models with 1M parameters for 1B tokens of different mixtures to fit the regression model and find the optimal mixture. Using this mixture we train a 1B parameter model for 25B tokens (i.e. 1000x larger and 25x longer) which we find performs best among 64 candidate 1B parameter models with other mixtures. Further, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to human selection and achieves results that match or surpass DoReMi, while utilizing only 10% of the compute budget. Our experiments also show that (1) Data mixtures significantly impact performance with single-task performance variations of up to 14.6%; (2) Web corpora rather than data perceived as high-quality like Wikipedia have the strongest positive correlation with downstream performance; (3) Domains interact in complex ways often contradicting common sense, thus automatic approaches like RegMix are needed; (4) Data mixture effects transcend scaling laws, and our approach captures the complexity by considering all domains together.

Expressive and Generalizable Low-rank Adaptation for Large Models via Slow Cascaded Learning,"Siwei Li, Yifan Yang, Yifei Shen, Fangyun Wei, Zongqing Lu, Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang","Efficient fine-tuning plays a fundamental role in modern large models, with low-rank adaptation emerging as a particularly promising approach. However, the existing variants of LoRA are hampered by limited expressiveness, a tendency to overfit, and sensitivity to hyperparameter settings. This paper presents LoRA Slow Cascade Learning (LoRASC), an innovative technique designed to enhance LoRA's expressiveness and generalization capabilities while preserving its training efficiency. Our approach augments expressiveness through a cascaded learning strategy that enables a mixture-of-low-rank adaptation, thereby increasing the model's ability to capture complex patterns. Additionally, we introduce a slow-fast update mechanism and cascading noisy tuning to bolster generalization. The extensive experiments on various language and vision datasets, as well as robustness benchmarks, demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms existing baselines, but also mitigates overfitting, enhances model stability, and improves OOD robustness.

"LLM See, LLM Do: Guiding Data Generation to Target Non-Differentiable Objectives","Luísa Shimabucoro, Sebastian Ruder, Julia Kreutzer, Marzieh Fadaee, Sara Hooker","The widespread adoption of synthetic data raises new questions about how models generating the data can influence other large language models (LLMs) via distilled data. To start, our work exhaustively characterizes the impact of passive inheritance of model properties by systematically studying the consequences of synthetic data integration. We provide one of the most comprehensive studies to-date of how the source of synthetic data shapes models' internal biases, calibration and generations' textual attributes and preferences. We find that models are surprisingly sensitive towards certain attributes even when the synthetic data prompts appear ""neutral"". which invites the question whether this sensitivity can be exploited for good.   Our findings invite the question can we explicitly steer the models towards the properties we want at test time by exploiting the data generation process? This would have historically been considered infeasible due to the cost of collecting data with a specific characteristic or objective in mind. However, improvement in the quality of synthetic data, as well as a shift towards general-purpose models designed to follow a diverse way of instructions, means this question is timely. We propose active inheritance as a term to describe intentionally constraining synthetic data according to a non-differentiable objective. We demonstrate how active inheritance can steer the generation profiles of models towards desirable non-differentiable attributes, e.g. high lexical diversity or low toxicity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01490v2,2024-07
Agentless: Demystifying LLM-based Software Engineering Agents,"Chunqiu Steven Xia, Yinlin Deng, Soren Dunn, Lingming Zhang","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the automation of software development tasks, including code synthesis, program repair, and test generation. More recently, researchers and industry practitioners have developed various autonomous LLM agents to perform end-to-end software development tasks. These agents are equipped with the ability to use tools, run commands, observe feedback from the environment, and plan for future actions. However, the complexity of these agent-based approaches, together with the limited abilities of current LLMs, raises the following question: Do we really have to employ complex autonomous software agents? To attempt to answer this question, we build Agentless -- an agentless approach to automatically solve software development problems. Compared to the verbose and complex setup of agent-based approaches, Agentless employs a simplistic three-phase process of localization, repair, and patch validation, without letting the LLM decide future actions or operate with complex tools. Our results on the popular SWE-bench Lite benchmark show that surprisingly the simplistic Agentless is able to achieve both the highest performance (32.00%, 96 correct fixes) and low cost ($0.70) compared with all existing open-source software agents! Furthermore, we manually classified the problems in SWE-bench Lite and found problems with exact ground truth patch or insufficient/misleading issue descriptions. As such, we construct SWE-bench Lite-S by excluding such problematic issues to perform more rigorous evaluation and comparison. Our work highlights the current overlooked potential of a simple, interpretable technique in autonomous software development. We hope Agentless will help reset the baseline, starting point, and horizon for autonomous software agents, and inspire future work along this crucial direction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01489v2,2024-07
Toward Automated Detection of Biased Social Signals from the Content of Clinical Conversations,"Feng Chen, Manas Satish Bedmutha, Ray-Yuan Chung, Janice Sabin, Wanda Pratt, Brian R. Wood, Nadir Weibel, Andrea L. Hartzler, Trevor Cohen","Implicit bias can impede patient-provider interactions and lead to inequities in care. Raising awareness is key to reducing such bias, but its manifestations in the social dynamics of patient-provider communication are difficult to detect. In this study, we used automated speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to identify social signals in patient-provider interactions. We built an automated pipeline to predict social signals from audio recordings of 782 primary care visits that achieved 90.1% average accuracy across codes, and exhibited fairness in its predictions for white and non-white patients. Applying this pipeline, we identified statistically significant differences in provider communication behavior toward white versus non-white patients. In particular, providers expressed more patient-centered behaviors towards white patients including more warmth, engagement, and attentiveness. Our study underscores the potential of automated tools in identifying subtle communication signals that may be linked with bias and impact healthcare quality and equity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17477v2,2024-07
Tree Search for Language Model Agents,"Jing Yu Koh, Stephen McAleer, Daniel Fried, Ruslan Salakhutdinov","Autonomous agents powered by language models (LMs) have demonstrated promise in their ability to perform decision-making tasks such as web automation. However, a key limitation remains: LMs, primarily optimized for natural language understanding and generation, struggle with multi-step reasoning, planning, and using environmental feedback when attempting to solve realistic computer tasks. Towards addressing this, we propose an inference-time search algorithm for LM agents to explicitly perform exploration and multi-step planning in interactive web environments. Our approach is a form of best-first tree search that operates within the actual environment space, and is complementary with most existing state-of-the-art agents. It is the first tree search algorithm for LM agents that shows effectiveness on realistic web tasks. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, applying our search algorithm on top of a GPT-4o agent yields a 39.7% relative increase in success rate compared to the same baseline without search, setting a state-of-the-art success rate of 26.4%. On WebArena, search also yields a 28.0% relative improvement over a baseline agent, setting a competitive success rate of 19.2%. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of search for web agents, and we demonstrate that performance scales with increased test-time compute. We conduct a thorough analysis of our results to highlight improvements from search, limitations, and promising directions for future work.

In this work, we consider RAG in the multilingual setting (mRAG), i.e. with user queries and the datastore in 13 languages, and investigate which components and with which adjustments are needed to build a well-performing mRAG pipeline, that can be used as a strong baseline in future works. Our findings highlight that despite the availability of high-quality off-the-shelf multilingual retrievers and generators, task-specific prompt engineering is needed to enable generation in user languages. Moreover, current evaluation metrics need adjustments for multilingual setting, to account for variations in spelling named entities. The main limitations to be addressed in future works include frequent code-switching in non-Latin alphabet languages, occasional fluency errors, wrong reading of the provided documents, or irrelevant retrieval.

Enhancing the Capability and Robustness of Large Language Models through Reinforcement Learning-Driven Query Refinement,"Zisu Huang, Xiaohua Wang, Feiran Zhang, Zhibo Xu, Cenyuan Zhang, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang","The capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate honest, harmless, and helpful responses heavily relies on the quality of user prompts. However, these prompts often tend to be brief and vague, thereby significantly limiting the full potential of LLMs. Moreover, harmful prompts can be meticulously crafted and manipulated by adversaries to jailbreak LLMs, inducing them to produce potentially toxic content. To enhance the capabilities of LLMs while maintaining strong robustness against harmful jailbreak inputs, this study proposes a transferable and pluggable framework that refines user prompts before they are input into LLMs. This strategy improves the quality of the queries, empowering LLMs to generate more truthful, benign and useful responses. Specifically, a lightweight query refinement model is introduced and trained using a specially designed reinforcement learning approach that incorporates multiple objectives to enhance particular capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the refinement model not only improves the quality of responses but also strengthens their robustness against jailbreak attacks.

TimeToM: Temporal Space is the Key to Unlocking the Door of Large Language Models' Theory-of-Mind,"Guiyang Hou, Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Linjuan Wu, Weiming Lu","Theory of Mind (ToM)-the cognitive ability to reason about mental states of ourselves and others, is the foundation of social interaction. Although ToM comes naturally to humans, it poses a significant challenge to even the most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to the complex logical chains in ToM reasoning, especially in higher-order ToM questions, simply utilizing reasoning methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) will not improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs. We present TimeToM, which constructs a temporal space and uses it as the foundation to improve the ToM capabilities of LLMs in multiple scenarios. Specifically, within the temporal space, we construct Temporal Belief State Chain (TBSC) for each character and inspired by the cognition perspective of the social world model, we divide TBSC into self-world beliefs and social world beliefs, aligning with first-order ToM (first-order beliefs) and higher-order ToM (higher-order beliefs) questions, respectively. Moreover, we design a novel tool-belief solver that, by considering belief communication between characters in temporal space, can transform a character's higher-order beliefs into another character's first-order beliefs under belief communication period. Experimental results indicate that TimeToM can dramatically improve the reasoning performance of LLMs on ToM questions while taking a big step towards coherent and robust ToM reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01455v1,2024-07
Needle in the Haystack for Memory Based Large Language Models,"Elliot Nelson, Georgios Kollias, Payel Das, Subhajit Chaudhury, Soham Dan","Current large language models (LLMs) often perform poorly on simple fact retrieval tasks. Here we investigate if coupling a dynamically adaptable external memory to a LLM can alleviate this problem. For this purpose, we test Larimar, a recently proposed language model architecture which uses an external associative memory, on long-context recall tasks including passkey and needle-in-the-haystack tests. We demonstrate that the external memory of Larimar, which allows fast write and read of an episode of text samples, can be used at test time to handle contexts much longer than those seen during training. We further show that the latent readouts from the memory (to which long contexts are written) control the decoder towards generating correct outputs, with the memory stored off of the GPU. Compared to existing transformer-based LLM architectures for long-context recall tasks that use larger parameter counts or modified attention mechanisms, a relatively smaller size Larimar is able to maintain strong performance without any task-specific training or training on longer contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01437v2,2024-07

Additionally, we propose innovative hard and soft localization mechanisms to identify potential keywords for local attention. By incorporating both hard and soft localization strategies, our approach offers a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the contextual cues that contribute to effective relation classification.

Adapting Multilingual LLMs to Low-Resource Languages with Knowledge Graphs via Adapters,"Daniil Gurgurov, Mareike Hartmann, Simon Ostermann","This paper explores the integration of graph knowledge from linguistic ontologies into multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) using adapters to improve performance for low-resource languages (LRLs) in sentiment analysis (SA) and named entity recognition (NER). Building upon successful parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as K-ADAPTER and MAD-X, we propose a similar approach for incorporating knowledge from multilingual graphs, connecting concepts in various languages with each other through linguistic relationships, into multilingual LLMs for LRLs. Specifically, we focus on eight LRLs -- Maltese, Bulgarian, Indonesian, Nepali, Javanese, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Sinhala -- and employ language-specific adapters fine-tuned on data extracted from the language-specific section of ConceptNet, aiming to enable knowledge transfer across the languages covered by the knowledge graph. We compare various fine-tuning objectives, including standard Masked Language Modeling (MLM), MLM with full-word masking, and MLM with targeted masking, to analyse their effectiveness in learning and integrating the extracted graph data. Through empirical evaluation on language-specific tasks, we assess how structured graph knowledge affects the performance of multilingual LLMs for LRLs in SA and NER, providing insights into the potential benefits of adapting language models for low-resource scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01406v3,2024-07
Optimization of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Context with Outlier Detection,Vitaly Bulgakov,"In this paper, we focus on methods to reduce the size and improve the quality of the prompt context required for question-answering systems. Attempts to increase the number of retrieved chunked documents and thereby enlarge the context related to the query can significantly complicate the processing and decrease the performance of a Large Language Model (LLM) when generating responses to queries. It is well known that a large set of documents retrieved from a database in response to a query may contain irrelevant information, which often leads to hallucinations in the resulting answers. Our goal is to select the most semantically relevant documents, treating the discarded ones as outliers. We propose and evaluate several methods for identifying outliers by creating features that utilize the distances of embedding vectors, retrieved from the vector database, to both the centroid and the query vectors. The methods were evaluated by comparing the similarities of the retrieved LLM responses to ground-truth answers obtained using the OpenAI GPT-4o model.

As a perturbation test, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) perform rationale generation under the effects of readability level control, i.e., being prompted for an explanation targeting a specific expertise level, such as sixth grade or college. We find that explanations are adaptable to such instruction, though the requested readability is often misaligned with the measured text complexity according to traditional readability metrics. Furthermore, the generated rationales tend to feature medium level complexity, which correlates with the measured quality using automatic metrics. Finally, our human annotators confirm a generally satisfactory impression on rationales at all readability levels, with high-school-level readability being most commonly perceived and favored.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01384v2,2024-07
Badllama 3: removing safety finetuning from Llama 3 in minutes,Dmitrii Volkov,"We show that extensive LLM safety fine-tuning is easily subverted when an attacker has access to model weights.

Bridging the Gap: Transfer Learning from English PLMs to Malaysian English,"Mohan Raj Chanthran, Lay-Ki Soon, Huey Fang Ong, Bhawani Selvaretnam","Malaysian English is a low resource creole language, where it carries the elements of Malay, Chinese, and Tamil languages, in addition to Standard English. Named Entity Recognition (NER) models underperform when capturing entities from Malaysian English text due to its distinctive morphosyntactic adaptations, semantic features and code-switching (mixing English and Malay). Considering these gaps, we introduce MENmBERT and MENBERT, a pre-trained language model with contextual understanding, specifically tailored for Malaysian English. We have fine-tuned MENmBERT and MENBERT using manually annotated entities and relations from the Malaysian English News Article (MEN) Dataset. This fine-tuning process allows the PLM to learn representations that capture the nuances of Malaysian English relevant for NER and RE tasks. MENmBERT achieved a 1.52\% and 26.27\% improvement on NER and RE tasks respectively compared to the bert-base-multilingual-cased model. Although the overall performance of NER does not have a significant improvement, our further analysis shows that there is a significant improvement when evaluated by the 12 entity labels. These findings suggest that pre-training language models on language-specific and geographically-focused corpora can be a promising approach for improving NER performance in low-resource settings. The dataset and code published in this paper provide valuable resources for NLP research work focusing on Malaysian English.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01374v1,2024-07
Summary of a Haystack: A Challenge to Long-Context LLMs and RAG Systems,"Philippe Laban, Alexander R. Fabbri, Caiming Xiong, Chien-Sheng Wu","LLMs and RAG systems are now capable of handling millions of input tokens or more. However, evaluating the output quality of such systems on long-context tasks remains challenging, as tasks like Needle-in-a-Haystack lack complexity. In this work, we argue that summarization can play a central role in such evaluation. We design a procedure to synthesize Haystacks of documents, ensuring that specific \textit{insights} repeat across documents. The ""Summary of a Haystack"" (SummHay) task then requires a system to process the Haystack and generate, given a query, a summary that identifies the relevant insights and precisely cites the source documents. Since we have precise knowledge of what insights should appear in a haystack summary and what documents should be cited, we implement a highly reproducible automatic evaluation that can score summaries on two aspects - Coverage and Citation. We generate Haystacks in two domains (conversation, news), and perform a large-scale evaluation of 10 LLMs and corresponding 50 RAG systems. Our findings indicate that SummHay is an open challenge for current systems, as even systems provided with an Oracle signal of document relevance lag our estimate of human performance (56\%) by 10+ points on a Joint Score. Without a retriever, long-context LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude 3 Opus score below 20% on SummHay. We show SummHay can also be used to study enterprise RAG systems and position bias in long-context models. We hope future systems can equal and surpass human performance on SummHay.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01370v1,2024-07

Evaluating Knowledge-based Cross-lingual Inconsistency in Large Language Models,"Xiaolin Xing, Zhiwei He, Haoyu Xu, Xing Wang, Rui Wang, Yu Hong","This paper investigates the cross-lingual inconsistencies observed in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Llama, and Baichuan, which have shown exceptional performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite their successes, these models often exhibit significant inconsistencies when processing the same concepts across different languages. This study focuses on three primary questions: the existence of cross-lingual inconsistencies in LLMs, the specific aspects in which these inconsistencies manifest, and the correlation between cross-lingual consistency and multilingual capabilities of LLMs.To address these questions, we propose an innovative evaluation method for Cross-lingual Semantic Consistency (xSC) using the LaBSE model. We further introduce metrics for Cross-lingual Accuracy Consistency (xAC) and Cross-lingual Timeliness Consistency (xTC) to comprehensively assess the models' performance regarding semantic, accuracy, and timeliness inconsistencies. By harmonizing these metrics, we provide a holistic measurement of LLMs' cross-lingual consistency. Our findings aim to enhance the understanding and improvement of multilingual capabilities and interpretability in LLMs, contributing to the development of more robust and reliable multilingual language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01358v1,2024-07
Protecting Privacy in Classifiers by Token Manipulation,"Re'em Harel, Yair Elboher, Yuval Pinter","Using language models as a remote service entails sending private information to an untrusted provider. In addition, potential eavesdroppers can intercept the messages, thereby exposing the information. In this work, we explore the prospects of avoiding such data exposure at the level of text manipulation. We focus on text classification models, examining various token mapping and contextualized manipulation functions in order to see whether classifier accuracy may be maintained while keeping the original text unrecoverable. We find that although some token mapping functions are easy and straightforward to implement, they heavily influence performance on the downstream task, and via a sophisticated attacker can be reconstructed. In comparison, the contextualized manipulation provides an improvement in performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01334v2,2024-07
Increasing Model Capacity for Free: A Simple Strategy for Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning,"Haobo Song, Hao Zhao, Soumajit Majumder, Tao Lin","Fine-tuning large pre-trained foundation models, such as the 175B GPT-3, has attracted more attention for downstream tasks recently. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have been proposed and proven effective without retraining all model parameters, their performance is limited by the capacity of incremental modules, especially under constrained parameter budgets. \\ To overcome this challenge, we propose CapaBoost, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances model capacity by leveraging low-rank updates through parallel weight modules in target layers. By applying static random masks to the shared weight matrix, CapaBoost constructs a diverse set of weight matrices, effectively increasing the rank of incremental weights without adding parameters. Notably, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into various existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. We extensively validate the efficacy of CapaBoost through experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including natural language understanding, question answering, and image classification. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, without incurring additional computation or storage costs. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/LINs-lab/CapaBoost}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01320v1,2024-07
Language Portability Strategies for Open-domain Dialogue with Pre-trained Language Models from High to Low Resource Languages,"Ahmed Njifenjou, Virgile Sucal, Bassam Jabaian, Fabrice Lefèvre","In this paper we propose a study of linguistic portability strategies of large pre-trained language models (PLMs) used for open-domain dialogue systems in a high-resource language for this task. In particular the target low-resource language (L_T) will be simulated with French, as it lacks of task-specific resources and allows our human evaluation, when the source language (L_S) is English. For obvious reasons, recent works using such models for open-domain dialogue are mostly developed in English. Yet building specific PLMs for each possible target language supposes collecting new datasets and is costly. For this reason, trying to leverage all existing resources (PLMs and data) in both L_S and L_T , we wish to assess the performance achievable in L_T with different approaches. The first two approaches evaluate the usage of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) at different levels: TrainOnTarget where a L_S dataset is translated before fine-tuning in L_T and TestOnSource where a L_S model is coupled with NMT modules during inference. Then, the advent of BLOOM [2], the world first open-access multilingual large PLM, allow researchers to develop new approaches aiming to leverage not only the model's full accessibility but also its multilingualism and translation abilities. In this context the task is learned in L_S first and adapted to L_T using the MAD-X Adapter architecture [16]. In the two sets of experiments models are evaluated in spoken dialogue conditions with human and the strategies can be compared in terms of perceived interaction quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01315v1,2024-07
Chronological Analysis of Rigvedic Mandalas using Social Networks,"Shreekanth M Prabhu, Gopalpillai Radhakrishnan","Establishing the chronology of the Vedas has interested scholars for the last two centuries. The oldest among them is Rig-Veda which has ten Mandalas, each composed separately. In this paper, we look at deciphering plausible pointers to the internal chronology of the Mandalas, by focusing on Gods and Goddesses worshiped in different Mandalas. We apply text analysis to the Mandalas using Clustering Techniques based on Cosine Similarity. Then we represent the association of deities with Mandalas using a grid-based Social Network that is amenable to chronological analysis and demonstrates the benefits of using Social Network Analysis for the problem at hand. Further, we analyze references to rivers to arrive at additional correlations. The approach used can be deployed generically to analyze other kinds of references and mentions and arrive at more substantive inferences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06205v1,2024-07
Collaborative Performance Prediction for Large Language Models,"Qiyuan Zhang, Fuyuan Lyu, Xue Liu, Chen Ma","Comprehensively understanding and accurately predicting the performance of large language models across diverse downstream tasks has emerged as a pivotal challenge in NLP research. The pioneering scaling law on downstream works demonstrated intrinsic similarities within model families and utilized such similarities for performance prediction. However, they tend to overlook the similarities between model families and only consider design factors listed in the original scaling law. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework, Collaborative Performance Prediction (CPP), which significantly enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging the historical performance of various models on downstream tasks and other design factors for both model and task. We also collect a collaborative data sourced from online platforms containing both historical performance and additional design factors. With the support of the collaborative data, CPP not only surpasses traditional scaling laws in predicting the performance of scaled LLMs but also facilitates a detailed analysis of factor importance, an area previously overlooked.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01300v2,2024-07
Lightweight Zero-shot Text-to-Speech with Mixture of Adapters,"Kenichi Fujita, Takanori Ashihara, Marc Delcroix, Yusuke Ijima","The advancements in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) methods, based on large-scale models, have demonstrated high fidelity in reproducing speaker characteristics. However, these models are too large for practical daily use. We propose a lightweight zero-shot TTS method using a mixture of adapters (MoA). Our proposed method incorporates MoA modules into the decoder and the variance adapter of a non-autoregressive TTS model. These modules enhance the ability to adapt a wide variety of speakers in a zero-shot manner by selecting appropriate adapters associated with speaker characteristics on the basis of speaker embeddings. Our method achieves high-quality speech synthesis with minimal additional parameters. Through objective and subjective evaluations, we confirmed that our method achieves better performance than the baseline with less than 40\% of parameters at 1.9 times faster inference speed.

Existing benchmarks, such as MathVista and MathVerse, focus more on the result-oriented performance but neglect the underlying principles in knowledge acquisition and generalization. Inspired by human-like mathematical reasoning, we introduce WE-MATH, the first benchmark specifically designed to explore the problem-solving principles beyond end-to-end performance. We meticulously collect and categorize 6.5K visual math problems, spanning 67 hierarchical knowledge concepts and five layers of knowledge granularity. We decompose composite problems into sub-problems according to the required knowledge concepts and introduce a novel four-dimensional metric, namely Insufficient Knowledge (IK), Inadequate Generalization (IG), Complete Mastery (CM), and Rote Memorization (RM), to hierarchically assess inherent issues in LMMs' reasoning process. With WE-MATH, we conduct a thorough evaluation of existing LMMs in visual mathematical reasoning and reveal a negative correlation between solving steps and problem-specific performance. We confirm the IK issue of LMMs can be effectively improved via knowledge augmentation strategies. More notably, the primary challenge of GPT-4o has significantly transitioned from IK to IG, establishing it as the first LMM advancing towards the knowledge generalization stage. In contrast, other LMMs exhibit a marked inclination towards Rote Memorization - they correctly solve composite problems involving multiple knowledge concepts yet fail to answer sub-problems. We anticipate that WE-MATH will open new pathways for advancements in visual mathematical reasoning for LMMs. The WE-MATH data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/We-Math/We-Math.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01284v1,2024-07
Leveraging Large Language Models for Actionable Course Evaluation Student Feedback to Lecturers,"Mike Zhang, Euan D Lindsay, Frederik Bode Thorbensen, Danny Bøgsted Poulsen, Johannes Bjerva","End of semester student evaluations of teaching are the dominant mechanism for providing feedback to academics on their teaching practice. For large classes, however, the volume of feedback makes these tools impractical for this purpose. This paper explores the use of open-source generative AI to synthesise factual, actionable and appropriate summaries of student feedback from these survey responses. In our setup, we have 742 student responses ranging over 75 courses in a Computer Science department. For each course, we synthesise a summary of the course evaluations and actionable items for the instructor. Our results reveal a promising avenue for enhancing teaching practices in the classroom setting. Our contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility of using generative AI to produce insightful feedback for teachers, thus providing a cost-effective means to support educators' development. Overall, our work highlights the possibility of using generative AI to produce factual, actionable, and appropriate feedback for teachers in the classroom setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01274v2,2024-07
"Show Less, Instruct More: Enriching Prompts with Definitions and Guidelines for Zero-Shot NER","Andrew Zamai, Andrea Zugarini, Leonardo Rigutini, Marco Ernandes, Marco Maggini","Recently, several specialized instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for Named Entity Recognition (NER) have emerged. Compared to traditional NER approaches, these models have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities. Existing LLMs primarily focus on addressing zero-shot NER on Out-of-Domain inputs, while fine-tuning on an extensive number of entity classes that often highly or completely overlap with test sets. In this work instead, we propose SLIMER, an approach designed to tackle never-seen-before entity tags by instructing the model on fewer examples, and by leveraging a prompt enriched with definition and guidelines. Experiments demonstrate that definition and guidelines yield better performance, faster and more robust learning, particularly when labelling unseen named entities. Furthermore, SLIMER performs comparably to state-of-the-art approaches in out-of-domain zero-shot NER, while being trained in a more fair, though certainly more challenging, setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01272v3,2024-07
First Place Solution of 2023 Global Artificial Intelligence Technology Innovation Competition Track 1,"Xiangyu Wu, Hailiang Zhang, Yang Yang, Jianfeng Lu","In this paper, we present our champion solution to the Global Artificial Intelligence Technology Innovation Competition Track 1: Medical Imaging Diagnosis Report Generation. We select CPT-BASE as our base model for the text generation task. During the pre-training stage, we delete the mask language modeling task of CPT-BASE and instead reconstruct the vocabulary, adopting a span mask strategy and gradually increasing the number of masking ratios to perform the denoising auto-encoder pre-training task. In the fine-tuning stage, we design iterative retrieval augmentation and noise-aware similarity bucket prompt strategies. The retrieval augmentation constructs a mini-knowledge base, enriching the input information of the model, while the similarity bucket further perceives the noise information within the mini-knowledge base, guiding the model to generate higher-quality diagnostic reports based on the similarity prompts. Surprisingly, our single model has achieved a score of 2.321 on leaderboard A, and the multiple model fusion scores are 2.362 and 2.320 on the A and B leaderboards respectively, securing first place in the rankings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01271v2,2024-07
The African Woman is Rhythmic and Soulful: An Investigation of Implicit Biases in LLM Open-ended Text Generation,"Serene Lim, María Pérez-Ortiz","This paper investigates the subtle and often concealed biases present in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on implicit biases that may remain despite passing explicit bias tests. Implicit biases are significant because they influence the decisions made by these systems, potentially perpetuating stereotypes and discrimination, even when LLMs appear to function fairly. Traditionally, explicit bias tests or embedding-based methods are employed to detect bias, but these approaches can overlook more nuanced, implicit forms of bias. To address this, we introduce two novel psychological-inspired methodologies: the LLM Implicit Association Test (IAT) Bias and the LLM Decision Bias, designed to reveal and measure implicit biases through prompt-based and decision-making tasks. Additionally, open-ended generation tasks with thematic analysis of word generations and storytelling provide qualitative insights into the model's behavior. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM IAT Bias correlates with traditional methods and more effectively predicts downstream behaviors, as measured by the LLM Decision Bias, offering a more comprehensive framework for detecting subtle biases in AI systems. This research advances the field of AI ethics by proposing new methods to continually assess and mitigate biases in LLMs, highlighting the importance of qualitative and decision-focused evaluations to address challenges that previous approaches have not fully captured.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01270v2,2024-07
SignCLIP: Connecting Text and Sign Language by Contrastive Learning,"Zifan Jiang, Gerard Sant, Amit Moryossef, Mathias Müller, Rico Sennrich, Sarah Ebling","We present SignCLIP, which re-purposes CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) to project spoken language text and sign language videos, two classes of natural languages of distinct modalities, into the same space. SignCLIP is an efficient method of learning useful visual representations for sign language processing from large-scale, multilingual video-text pairs, without directly optimizing for a specific task or sign language which is often of limited size.   We pretrain SignCLIP on Spreadthesign, a prominent sign language dictionary consisting of ~500 thousand video clips in up to 44 sign languages, and evaluate it with various downstream datasets. SignCLIP discerns in-domain signing with notable text-to-video/video-to-text retrieval accuracy. It also performs competitively for out-of-domain downstream tasks such as isolated sign language recognition upon essential few-shot prompting or fine-tuning.   We analyze the latent space formed by the spoken language text and sign language poses, which provides additional linguistic insights.

uDistil-Whisper: Label-Free Data Filtering for Knowledge Distillation in Low-Data Regimes,"Abdul Waheed, Karima Kadaoui, Bhiksha Raj, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed","Recent work on distilling Whisper's knowledge into small models using pseudo-labels shows promising performance while reducing the size by up to 50\%. This results in small, efficient, and dedicated models. However, a critical step of distillation from pseudo-labels involves filtering high-quality predictions and using only those during training. This step requires ground truth labels to compare and filter low-quality examples making the whole process supervised. In addition to that, the distillation process requires a large amount of data thereby limiting the ability to distill models in low-resource settings. To address this challenge, we propose a distillation framework that does not require any labeled data. Through experimentation, we show that our best distilled models outperform the teacher model by 5-7 points in terms of WER compared to those without filtering and are on par with or perform better than similar supervised data filtering setups. When we scale the data, our models significantly outperform all zero-shot and supervised models. We demonstrate that it is possible to distill large Whisper models into relatively small ones without using any labeled data. Our distilled models are also 25-50\% more compute- and memory-efficient while maintaining performance equal to or better than that of the teacher model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01257v3,2024-07
PQCache: Product Quantization-based KVCache for Long Context LLM Inference,"Hailin Zhang, Xiaodong Ji, Yilin Chen, Fangcheng Fu, Xupeng Miao, Xiaonan Nie, Weipeng Chen, Bin Cui","As the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to evolve, the context length in inference is steadily growing. Key-Value Cache (KVCache), a crucial component in LLM inference, has now become the primary memory bottleneck due to limited GPU memory. Current methods selectively determine suitable keys and values for self-attention computation in LLMs to address the issue. However, they either fall short in maintaining model quality or result in high serving latency. Drawing inspiration from advanced embedding retrieval techniques used in the database community, we consider the storage and searching of KVCache as a typical embedding retrieval problem. We propose PQCache, which employs Product Quantization (PQ) to manage KVCache, maintaining model quality while ensuring low serving latency. During the prefilling phase, we apply PQ to tokens' keys for each LLM layer and head. During the autoregressive decoding phase, for each newly generated token, we first identify important tokens through Maximum Inner-Product Search (MIPS) using PQ codes and centroids, then fetch the corresponding key-value pairs for self-attention computation. Through meticulous design of overlapping and caching, we minimize any additional computation and communication overhead during both phases. Extensive experiments show that PQCache achieves both effectiveness and efficiency. It maintains model quality even when only 1/5 of the tokens are involved in attention, while attaining acceptable system latency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12820v1,2024-07
Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Recognizers for Activities of Daily Living,"Gabriele Civitarese, Michele Fiori, Priyankar Choudhary, Claudio Bettini","The sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart home environments enables several applications in the areas of energy management, safety, well-being, and healthcare. ADLs recognition is typically based on deep learning methods requiring large datasets to be trained.

However, the effectiveness of LLMs for ADLs recognition in smart home environments still deserves to be investigated. In this work, we propose ADL-LLM, a novel LLM-based ADLs recognition system. ADLLLM transforms raw sensor data into textual representations, that are processed by an LLM to perform zero-shot ADLs recognition. Moreover, in the scenario where a small labeled dataset is available, ADL-LLM can also be empowered with few-shot prompting.

MIRAI: Evaluating LLM Agents for Event Forecasting,"Chenchen Ye, Ziniu Hu, Yihe Deng, Zijie Huang, Mingyu Derek Ma, Yanqiao Zhu, Wei Wang","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered LLM agents to autonomously collect world information, over which to conduct reasoning to solve complex problems. Given this capability, increasing interests have been put into employing LLM agents for predicting international events, which can influence decision-making and shape policy development on an international scale. Despite such a growing interest, there is a lack of a rigorous benchmark of LLM agents' forecasting capability and reliability. To address this gap, we introduce MIRAI, a novel benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLM agents as temporal forecasters in the context of international events. Our benchmark features an agentic environment with tools for accessing an extensive database of historical, structured events and textual news articles. We refine the GDELT event database with careful cleaning and parsing to curate a series of relational prediction tasks with varying forecasting horizons, assessing LLM agents' abilities from short-term to long-term forecasting. We further implement APIs to enable LLM agents to utilize different tools via a code-based interface. In summary, MIRAI comprehensively evaluates the agents' capabilities in three dimensions: 1) autonomously source and integrate critical information from large global databases; 2) write codes using domain-specific APIs and libraries for tool-use; and 3) jointly reason over historical knowledge from diverse formats and time to accurately predict future events. Through comprehensive benchmarking, we aim to establish a reliable framework for assessing the capabilities of LLM agents in forecasting international events, thereby contributing to the development of more accurate and trustworthy models for international relation analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01231v1,2024-07

Typically, a RAG workflow involves multiple processing steps, each of which can be executed in various ways. Here, we investigate existing RAG approaches and their potential combinations to identify optimal RAG practices.

Inspired by the memory hierarchy of the human brain, we reduce this cost by equipping LLMs with explicit memory, a memory format cheaper than model parameters and text retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Conceptually, with most of its knowledge externalized to explicit memories, the LLM can enjoy a smaller parameter size, training cost, and inference cost, all proportional to the amount of remaining ""abstract knowledge"". As a preliminary proof of concept, we train from scratch a 2.4B LLM, which achieves better performance than much larger LLMs as well as RAG models, and maintains higher decoding speed than RAG. The model is named $\text{Memory}^3$, since explicit memory is the third form of memory in LLMs after implicit memory (model parameters) and working memory (context key-values).

In this paper, we extend and utilize a recently developed effective gradient-based procedure that allows us to match the embedding of a given text by minimally modifying an image. Using the procedure, we show that we can align the embeddings of distinguishable texts to any image through unnoticeable adversarial attacks in joint image-text models, revealing that semantically unrelated images can have embeddings of identical texts and at the same time visually indistinguishable images can be matched to the embeddings of very different texts. Our technique achieves 100\% success rate when it is applied to text datasets and images from multiple sources. Without overcoming the vulnerability, multimodal models cannot robustly align inputs from different modalities in a semantically meaningful way. \textbf{Warning: the text data used in this paper are toxic in nature and may be offensive to some readers.}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01157v1,2024-07
Sociocultural Considerations in Monitoring Anti-LGBTQ+ Content on Social Media,Sidney G. -J. Wong,"The purpose of this paper is to ascertain the influence of sociocultural factors (i.e., social, cultural, and political) in the development of hate speech detection systems. We set out to investigate the suitability of using open-source training data to monitor levels of anti-LGBTQ+ content on social media across different national-varieties of English. Our findings suggests the social and cultural alignment of open-source hate speech data sets influences the predicted outputs. Furthermore, the keyword-search approach of anti-LGBTQ+ slurs in the development of open-source training data encourages detection models to overfit on slurs; therefore, anti-LGBTQ+ content may go undetected. We recommend combining empirical outputs with qualitative insights to ensure these systems are fit for purpose.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01149v1,2024-07
An Empirical Comparison of Generative Approaches for Product Attribute-Value Identification,"Kassem Sabeh, Robert Litschko, Mouna Kacimi, Barbara Plank, Johann Gamper","Product attributes are crucial for e-commerce platforms, supporting applications like search, recommendation, and question answering. The task of Product Attribute and Value Identification (PAVI) involves identifying both attributes and their values from product information. In this paper, we formulate PAVI as a generation task and provide, to the best of our knowledge, the most comprehensive evaluation of PAVI so far. We compare three different attribute-value generation (AVG) strategies based on fine-tuning encoder-decoder models on three datasets. Experiments show that end-to-end AVG approach, which is computationally efficient, outperforms other strategies. However, there are differences depending on model sizes and the underlying language model.

Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning for Speech Translation,"Rao Ma, Mengjie Qian, Yassir Fathullah, Siyuan Tang, Mark Gales, Kate Knill","There has been increasing interest in building multilingual foundation models for NLP and speech research. This paper examines how to expand the speech translation capability of these models with restricted data. Whisper, a speech foundation model with strong performance on speech recognition and English translation, is used as the example model. Using speech-to-speech retrieval to analyse the audio representations generated by the encoder, we show that utterances from different languages are mapped to a shared semantic space. This shared embedding space can then be leveraged for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in speech translation. By fine-tuning the Whisper decoder with only English-to-Chinese speech translation data, improved performance for translation to Chinese can be obtained for multiple languages, in addition to English. Furthermore, for languages related to those seen in training it is possible to perform speech translation, despite the model never seeing the language in training, or being able to perform transcription.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01130v2,2024-07
Investigating the potential of Sparse Mixtures-of-Experts for multi-domain neural machine translation,"Nadezhda Chirkova, Vassilina Nikoulina, Jean-Luc Meunier, Alexandre Bérard","We focus on multi-domain Neural Machine Translation, with the goal of developing efficient models which can handle data from various domains seen during training and are robust to domains unseen during training. We hypothesize that Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models are a good fit for this task, as they enable efficient model scaling, which helps to accommodate a variety of multi-domain data, and allow flexible sharing of parameters between domains, potentially enabling knowledge transfer between similar domains and limiting negative transfer. We conduct a series of experiments aimed at validating the utility of SMoE for the multi-domain scenario, and find that a straightforward width scaling of Transformer is a simpler and surprisingly more efficient approach in practice, and reaches the same performance level as SMoE. We also search for a better recipe for robustness of multi-domain systems, highlighting the importance of mixing-in a generic domain, i.e. Paracrawl, and introducing a simple technique, domain randomization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01126v1,2024-07
Calibrated Large Language Models for Binary Question Answering,"Patrizio Giovannotti, Alexander Gammerman","Quantifying the uncertainty of predictions made by large language models (LLMs) in binary text classification tasks remains a challenge. Calibration, in the context of LLMs, refers to the alignment between the model's predicted probabilities and the actual correctness of its predictions. A well-calibrated model should produce probabilities that accurately reflect the likelihood of its predictions being correct. We propose a novel approach that utilizes the inductive Venn--Abers predictor (IVAP) to calibrate the probabilities associated with the output tokens corresponding to the binary labels. Our experiments on the BoolQ dataset using the Llama 2 model demonstrate that IVAP consistently outperforms the commonly used temperature scaling method for various label token choices, achieving well-calibrated probabilities while maintaining high predictive quality. Our findings contribute to the understanding of calibration techniques for LLMs and provide a practical solution for obtaining reliable uncertainty estimates in binary question answering tasks, enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01122v1,2024-07
Pron vs Prompt: Can Large Language Models already Challenge a World-Class Fiction Author at Creative Text Writing?,"Guillermo Marco, Julio Gonzalo, Ramón del Castillo, María Teresa Mateo Girona","It has become routine to report research results where Large Language Models (LLMs) outperform average humans in a wide range of language-related tasks, and creative text writing is no exception. It seems natural, then, to raise the bid: Are LLMs ready to compete in creative writing skills with a top (rather than average) novelist? To provide an initial answer for this question, we have carried out a contest between Patricio Pron (an awarded novelist, considered one of the best of his generation) and GPT-4 (one of the top performing LLMs), in the spirit of AI-human duels such as DeepBlue vs Kasparov and AlphaGo vs Lee Sidol. We asked Pron and GPT-4 to provide thirty titles each, and then to write short stories for both their titles and their opponent's. Then, we prepared an evaluation rubric inspired by Boden's definition of creativity, and we collected 5,400 manual assessments provided by literature critics and scholars. The results of our experimentation indicate that LLMs are still far from challenging a top human creative writer, and that reaching such level of autonomous creative writing skills probably cannot be reached simply with larger language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01119v2,2024-07
BERGEN: A Benchmarking Library for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"David Rau, Hervé Déjean, Nadezhda Chirkova, Thibault Formal, Shuai Wang, Vassilina Nikoulina, Stéphane Clinchant","Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows to enhance Large Language Models with external knowledge. In response to the recent popularity of generative LLMs, many RAG approaches have been proposed, which involve an intricate number of different configurations such as evaluation datasets, collections, metrics, retrievers, and LLMs. Inconsistent benchmarking poses a major challenge in comparing approaches and understanding the impact of each component in the pipeline. In this work, we study best practices that lay the groundwork for a systematic evaluation of RAG and present BERGEN, an end-to-end library for reproducible research standardizing RAG experiments. In an extensive study focusing on QA, we benchmark different state-of-the-art retrievers, rerankers, and LLMs. Additionally, we analyze existing RAG metrics and datasets.

Eliminating Position Bias of Language Models: A Mechanistic Approach,"Ziqi Wang, Hanlin Zhang, Xiner Li, Kuan-Hao Huang, Chi Han, Shuiwang Ji, Sham M. Kakade, Hao Peng, Heng Ji","Position bias has proven to be a prevalent issue of modern language models (LMs), where the models prioritize content based on its position within the given context. This bias often leads to unexpected model failures and hurts performance, robustness, and reliability across various applications. Our mechanistic analysis attributes the position bias to two components employed in nearly all state-of-the-art LMs: causal attention and relative positional encodings. Based on the analyses, we propose to eliminate position bias (e.g., different retrieved documents' orders in QA affect performance) with a training-free zero-shot approach. Our method changes the causal attention to bidirectional attention between documents and utilizes model attention values to decide the relative orders of documents instead of using the order provided in input prompts, therefore enabling Position-INvariant inferencE (PINE) at the document level. By eliminating position bias, models achieve better performance and reliability in downstream tasks, including LM-as-a-judge, retrieval-augmented QA, molecule generation, and math reasoning. Notably, PINE is especially useful when adapting LMs for evaluating reasoning pairs: it consistently provides 8 to 10 percentage points performance gains, making Llama-3-70B-Instruct perform even better than GPT-4-0125-preview and GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on the RewardBench reasoning set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01100v2,2024-07
IBSEN: Director-Actor Agent Collaboration for Controllable and Interactive Drama Script Generation,"Senyu Han, Lu Chen, Li-Min Lin, Zhengshan Xu, Kai Yu","Large language models have demonstrated their capabilities in storyline creation and human-like character role-playing. Current language model agents mainly focus on reasonable behaviors from the level of individuals, and their behaviors might be hard to constraint on the level of the whole storyline. In this paper we introduce IBSEN, a director-actor coordinate agent framework that generates drama scripts and makes the plot played by agents more controllable. The director agent writes plot outlines that the user desires to see, instructs the actor agents to role-play their characters, and reschedules the plot when human players participate in the scenario to ensure the plot is progressing towards the objective. To evaluate the framework, we create a novel drama plot that involves several actor agents and check the interactions between them under the instruction of the director agent. Evaluation results show that our framework could generate complete, diverse drama scripts from only a rough outline of plot objectives, meanwhile maintaining the characteristics of characters in the drama.

M2QA: Multi-domain Multilingual Question Answering,"Leon Engländer, Hannah Sterz, Clifton Poth, Jonas Pfeiffer, Ilia Kuznetsov, Iryna Gurevych","Generalization and robustness to input variation are core desiderata of machine learning research. Language varies along several axes, most importantly, language instance (e.g. French) and domain (e.g. news). While adapting NLP models to new languages within a single domain, or to new domains within a single language, is widely studied, research in joint adaptation is hampered by the lack of evaluation datasets. This prevents the transfer of NLP systems from well-resourced languages and domains to non-dominant language-domain combinations. To address this gap, we introduce M2QA, a multi-domain multilingual question answering benchmark. M2QA includes 13,500 SQuAD 2.0-style question-answer instances in German, Turkish, and Chinese for the domains of product reviews, news, and creative writing. We use M2QA to explore cross-lingual cross-domain performance of fine-tuned models and state-of-the-art LLMs and investigate modular approaches to domain and language adaptation. We witness 1) considerable performance variations across domain-language combinations within model classes and 2) considerable performance drops between source and target language-domain combinations across all model sizes. We demonstrate that M2QA is far from solved, and new methods to effectively transfer both linguistic and domain-specific information are necessary. We make M2QA publicly available at https://github.com/UKPLab/m2qa.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01091v1,2024-07
Explaining Length Bias in LLM-Based Preference Evaluations,"Zhengyu Hu, Linxin Song, Jieyu Zhang, Zheyuan Xiao, Tianfu Wang, Zhengyu Chen, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Jianxun Lian, Kaize Ding, Hui Xiong","The use of large language models (LLMs) as judges, particularly in preference comparisons, has become widespread, but this reveals a notable bias towards longer responses, undermining the reliability of such evaluations. To better understand such bias, we propose to decompose the preference evaluation metric, specifically the win rate, into two key components: desirability and information mass, where the former is length-independent and related to trustworthiness such as correctness, toxicity, and consistency, and the latter is length-dependent and represents the amount of information in the response. We empirically demonstrated the decomposition through controlled experiments and found that response length impacts evaluations by influencing information mass. To derive a reliable evaluation metric that assesses content quality without being confounded by response length, we propose AdapAlpaca, a simple yet effective adjustment to win rate measurement. Specifically, AdapAlpaca ensures a fair comparison of response quality by aligning the lengths of reference and test model responses under equivalent length intervals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01085v3,2024-07
Turning Up the Heat: Min-p Sampling for Creative and Coherent LLM Outputs,"Minh Nguyen, Andrew Baker, Clement Neo, Allen Roush, Andreas Kirsch, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv","Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text by sampling the next token from a probability distribution over the vocabulary at each decoding step. However, popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures, leading to incoherent or repetitive outputs. To address this challenge, we propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by scaling according to the top token's probability. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing, demonstrating that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text, particularly at high temperatures. Moreover, human evaluations reveal a clear preference for min-p sampling in terms of both text quality and diversity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by multiple open-source LLM implementations, highlighting its practical utility and potential impact.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01082v2,2024-07
CVLUE: A New Benchmark Dataset for Chinese Vision-Language Understanding Evaluation,"Yuxuan Wang, Yijun Liu, Fei Yu, Chen Huang, Kexin Li, Zhiguo Wan, Wanxiang Che","Despite the rapid development of Chinese vision-language models (VLMs), most existing Chinese vision-language (VL) datasets are constructed on Western-centric images from existing English VL datasets. The cultural bias in the images makes these datasets unsuitable for evaluating VLMs in Chinese culture. To remedy this issue, we present a new Chinese Vision- Language Understanding Evaluation (CVLUE) benchmark dataset, where the selection of object categories and images is entirely driven by Chinese native speakers, ensuring that the source images are representative of Chinese culture. The benchmark contains four distinct VL tasks ranging from image-text retrieval to visual question answering, visual grounding and visual dialogue. We present a detailed statistical analysis of CVLUE and provide a baseline performance analysis with several open-source multilingual VLMs on CVLUE and its English counterparts to reveal their performance gap between English and Chinese. Our in-depth category-level analysis reveals a lack of Chinese cultural knowledge in existing VLMs. We also find that fine-tuning on Chinese culture-related VL datasets effectively enhances VLMs' understanding of Chinese culture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01081v1,2024-07
Face4RAG: Factual Consistency Evaluation for Retrieval Augmented Generation in Chinese,"Yunqi Xu, Tianchi Cai, Jiyan Jiang, Xierui Song","The prevailing issue of factual inconsistency errors in conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) motivates the study of Factual Consistency Evaluation (FCE). Despite the various FCE methods proposed earlier, these methods are evaluated on datasets generated by specific Large Language Models (LLMs). Without a comprehensive benchmark, it remains unexplored how these FCE methods perform on other LLMs with different error distributions or even unseen error types, as these methods may fail to detect the error types generated by other LLMs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the first comprehensive FCE benchmark \emph{Face4RAG} for RAG independent of the underlying LLM. Our benchmark consists of a synthetic dataset built upon a carefully designed typology for factuality inconsistency error and a real-world dataset constructed from six commonly used LLMs, enabling evaluation of FCE methods on specific error types or real-world error distributions. On the proposed benchmark, we discover the failure of existing FCE methods to detect the logical fallacy, which refers to a mismatch of logic structures between the answer and the retrieved reference. To fix this issue, we further propose a new method called \emph{L-Face4RAG} with two novel designs of logic-preserving answer decomposition and fact-logic FCE. Extensive experiments show L-Face4RAG substantially outperforms previous methods for factual inconsistency detection on a wide range of tasks, notably beyond the RAG task from which it is originally motivated. Both the benchmark and our proposed method are publicly available.\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/yq27/Face4RAG}\label{link_face4rag}}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01080v2,2024-07
Human-like object concept representations emerge naturally in multimodal large language models,"Changde Du, Kaicheng Fu, Bincheng Wen, Yi Sun, Jie Peng, Wei Wei, Ying Gao, Shengpei Wang, Chuncheng Zhang, Jinpeng Li, Shuang Qiu, Le Chang, Huiguang He","The conceptualization and categorization of natural objects in the human mind have long intrigued cognitive scientists and neuroscientists, offering crucial insights into human perception and cognition. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised the attractive question of whether these models can also develop human-like object representations through exposure to vast amounts of linguistic and multimodal data. In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analysis methods to uncover how the object concept representations in LLMs correlate with those of humans. By collecting large-scale datasets of 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLM and Multimodal LLM (MLLM), we were able to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the underlying similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were found to be highly stable and predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering akin to human mental representations. Interestingly, the interpretability of the dimensions underlying these embeddings suggests that LLM and MLLM have developed human-like conceptual representations of natural objects. Further analysis demonstrated strong alignment between the identified model embeddings and neural activity patterns in many functionally defined brain ROIs (e.g., EBA, PPA, RSC and FFA). This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to those in the human, share fundamental commonalities that reflect key schemas of human conceptual knowledge. This study advances our understanding of machine intelligence and informs the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01067v1,2024-07
Development of Cognitive Intelligence in Pre-trained Language Models,"Raj Sanjay Shah, Khushi Bhardwaj, Sashank Varma","Recent studies show evidence for emergent cognitive abilities in Large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). The increasing cognitive alignment of these models has made them candidates for cognitive science theories. Prior research into the emergent cognitive abilities of PLMs has largely been path-independent to model training, i.e., has focused on the final model weights and not the intermediate steps. However, building plausible models of human cognition using PLMs would benefit from considering the developmental alignment of their performance during training to the trajectories of children's thinking. Guided by psychometric tests of human intelligence, we choose four sets of tasks to investigate the alignment of ten popular families of PLMs and evaluate their available intermediate and final training steps. These tasks are Numerical ability, Linguistic abilities, Conceptual understanding, and Fluid reasoning. We find a striking regularity: regardless of model size, the developmental trajectories of PLMs consistently exhibit a window of maximal alignment to human cognitive development. Before that window, training appears to endow ""blank slate"" models with the requisite structure to be poised to rapidly learn from experience. After that window, training appears to serve the engineering goal of reducing loss but not the scientific goal of increasing alignment with human cognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01047v3,2024-07
FRoG: Evaluating Fuzzy Reasoning of Generalized Quantifiers in Large Language Models,"Yiyuan Li, Shichao Sun, Pengfei Liu","Fuzzy reasoning is vital due to the frequent use of imprecise information in daily contexts. However, the ability of current large language models (LLMs) to handle such reasoning remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, FRoG, for fuzzy reasoning, featuring real-world mathematical word problems that incorporate generalized quantifiers. Our experimental findings reveal that fuzzy reasoning continues to pose significant challenges for LLMs. Moreover, we find that existing methods designed to enhance reasoning do not consistently improve performance in tasks involving fuzzy logic. Additionally, our results show an inverse scaling effect in the performance of LLMs on FRoG. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that strong mathematical reasoning skills are not necessarily indicative of success on our benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01046v2,2024-07
PocketLLM: Enabling On-Device Fine-Tuning for Personalized LLMs,"Dan Peng, Zhihui Fu, Jun Wang","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have indeed showcased their impressive capabilities. On mobile devices, the wealth of valuable, non-public data generated daily holds great promise for locally fine-tuning personalized LLMs, while maintaining privacy through on-device processing. However, the constraints of mobile device resources pose challenges to direct on-device LLM fine-tuning, mainly due to the memory-intensive nature of derivative-based optimization required for saving gradients and optimizer states. To tackle this, we propose employing derivative-free optimization techniques to enable on-device fine-tuning of LLM, even on memory-limited mobile devices. Empirical results demonstrate that the RoBERTa-large model and OPT-1.3B can be fine-tuned locally on the OPPO Reno 6 smartphone using around 4GB and 6.5GB of memory respectively, using derivative-free optimization techniques. This highlights the feasibility of on-device LLM fine-tuning on mobile devices, paving the way for personalized LLMs on resource-constrained devices while safeguarding data privacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01031v1,2024-07
Augmenting Document-level Relation Extraction with Efficient Multi-Supervision,"Xiangyu Lin, Weijia Jia, Zhiguo Gong","Despite its popularity in sentence-level relation extraction, distantly supervised data is rarely utilized by existing work in document-level relation extraction due to its noisy nature and low information density. Among its current applications, distantly supervised data is mostly used as a whole for pertaining, which is of low time efficiency. To fill in the gap of efficient and robust utilization of distantly supervised training data, we propose Efficient Multi-Supervision for document-level relation extraction, in which we first select a subset of informative documents from the massive dataset by combining distant supervision with expert supervision, then train the model with Multi-Supervision Ranking Loss that integrates the knowledge from multiple sources of supervision to alleviate the effects of noise.

DynaThink: Fast or Slow? A Dynamic Decision-Making Framework for Large Language Models,"Jiabao Pan, Yan Zhang, Chen Zhang, Zuozhu Liu, Hongwei Wang, Haizhou Li","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities across diverse reasoning tasks via popular Chains-of-Thought (COT) prompting. However, such a simple and fast COT approach often encounters limitations in dealing with complicated problems, while a thorough method, which considers multiple reasoning pathways and verifies each step carefully, results in slower inference. This paper addresses the challenge of enabling LLMs to autonomously select between fast and slow inference methods, thereby optimizing both efficiency and effectiveness. We introduce a dynamic decision-making framework that categorizes tasks into two distinct pathways: 'Fast', designated for tasks where the LLM quickly identifies a high-confidence solution, and 'Slow', allocated for tasks that the LLM perceives as complex and for which it has low confidence in immediate solutions as well as requiring more reasoning paths to verify.

"Can Small Language Models Learn, Unlearn, and Retain Noise Patterns?","Nicy Scaria, Silvester John Joseph Kennedy, Deepak Subramani","Small Language Models (SLMs) are generally considered more compact versions of large language models (LLMs). This study investigates the ability of SLMs with parameters between 1 and 3 billion to learn, retain, and subsequently eliminate different types of noise present in the data. Four pre-trained SLMs were utilized for this: Olmo 1B, Qwen1.5 1.8B, Gemma 2B, and Phi2 2.7B. The models were instruction-tuned on noise-free data and tested using in-context examples to determine if they could learn noise through examples. Subsequently, noise patterns were introduced in instruction tuning to evaluate the noise learning, unlearning, and retention capabilities of the models. Olmo, the smallest model, was highly sensitive to noise, quickly adapting to noisy patterns. Phi2 resisted learning character-level and transliteration noise, likely due to its carefully curated, structured, and high-quality pretraining data. Gemma excelled with transliteration noise, likely benefiting from its multilingual pretraining. The findings can be used to develop robust training strategies for SLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00996v2,2024-07
LLM Uncertainty Quantification through Directional Entailment Graph and Claim Level Response Augmentation,"Longchao Da, Tiejin Chen, Lu Cheng, Hua Wei","The Large language models (LLMs) have showcased superior capabilities in sophisticated tasks across various domains, stemming from basic question-answer (QA), they are nowadays used as decision assistants or explainers for unfamiliar content. However, they are not always correct due to the data sparsity in specific domain corpus, or the model's hallucination problems. Given this, how much should we trust the responses from LLMs? This paper presents a novel way to evaluate the uncertainty that captures the directional instability, by constructing a directional graph from entailment probabilities, and we innovatively conduct Random Walk Laplacian given the asymmetric property of a constructed directed graph, then the uncertainty is aggregated by the derived eigenvalues from the Laplacian process.

However, there is a scarcity of benchmarks available for LLM-based mobile agents. Benchmarking these agents generally faces three main challenges: (1) The inefficiency of UI-only operations imposes limitations to task evaluation. (2) Specific instructions within a singular application lack adequacy for assessing the multi-dimensional reasoning and decision-making capacities of LLM mobile agents. (3) Current evaluation metrics are insufficient to accurately assess the process of sequential actions. To this end, we propose Mobile-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLM-based mobile agents. First, we expand conventional UI operations by incorporating 103 collected APIs to accelerate the efficiency of task completion. Subsequently, we collect evaluation data by combining real user queries with augmentation from LLMs. To better evaluate different levels of planning capabilities for mobile agents, our data is categorized into three distinct groups: SAST, SAMT, and MAMT, reflecting varying levels of task complexity. Mobile-Bench comprises 832 data entries, with more than 200 tasks specifically designed to evaluate multi-APP collaboration scenarios.

In view of this, the federated learning (FL) LLM fine-tuning paradigm recently has been proposed to facilitate collaborative LLM fine-tuning on distributed private data, where multiple data owners collaboratively fine-tune a shared LLM without sharing raw data. However, the staggering model size of LLMs imposes heavy computing and communication burdens on clients, posing significant barriers to the democratization of the FL LLM fine-tuning paradigm. To address this issue, split learning (SL) has emerged as a promising solution by offloading the primary training workload to a server via model partitioning while exchanging activation/activation's gradients with smaller data sizes rather than the entire LLM. Unfortunately, research on the SL LLM fine-tuning paradigm is still in its nascent stage. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the first SL LLM fine-tuning framework, named SplitLoRA. SplitLoRA is built on the split federated learning (SFL) framework, amalgamating the advantages of parallel training from FL and model splitting from SL and thus greatly enhancing the training efficiency. It is worth noting that SplitLoRA is the inaugural open-source benchmark for SL LLM fine-tuning, providing a foundation for research efforts dedicated to advancing SL LLM fine-tuning. Extensive simulations validate that SplitLoRA achieves target accuracy in significantly less time than state-of-the-art LLM fine-tuning frameworks, demonstrating the superior training performance of SplitLoRA.

View From Above: A Framework for Evaluating Distribution Shifts in Model Behavior,"Tanush Chopra, Michael Li, Jacob Haimes","When large language models (LLMs) are asked to perform certain tasks, how can we be sure that their learned representations align with reality? We propose a domain-agnostic framework for systematically evaluating distribution shifts in LLMs decision-making processes, where they are given control of mechanisms governed by pre-defined rules. While individual LLM actions may appear consistent with expected behavior, across a large number of trials, statistically significant distribution shifts can emerge. To test this, we construct a well-defined environment with known outcome logic: blackjack. In more than 1,000 trials, we uncover statistically significant evidence suggesting behavioral misalignment in the learned representations of LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00948v3,2024-07
ProductAgent: Benchmarking Conversational Product Search Agent with Asking Clarification Questions,"Jingheng Ye, Yong Jiang, Xiaobin Wang, Yinghui Li, Yangning Li, Hai-Tao Zheng, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang","This paper introduces the task of product demand clarification within an e-commercial scenario, where the user commences the conversation with ambiguous queries and the task-oriented agent is designed to achieve more accurate and tailored product searching by asking clarification questions. To address this task, we propose ProductAgent, a conversational information seeking agent equipped with abilities of strategic clarification question generation and dynamic product retrieval. Specifically, we develop the agent with strategies for product feature summarization, query generation, and product retrieval. Furthermore, we propose the benchmark called PROCLARE to evaluate the agent's performance both automatically and qualitatively with the aid of a LLM-driven user simulator. Experiments show that ProductAgent interacts positively with the user and enhances retrieval performance with increasing dialogue turns, where user demands become gradually more explicit and detailed. All the source codes will be released after the review anonymity period.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00942v1,2024-07
MalAlgoQA: Pedagogical Evaluation of Counterfactual Reasoning in Large Language Models and Implications for AI in Education,"Naiming Liu, Shashank Sonkar, Myco Le, Richard Baraniuk","This paper introduces MalAlgoQA, a novel dataset designed to evaluate the counterfactual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a pedagogical approach. The dataset comprises mathematics and reading comprehension questions, each accompanied by four answer choices and their corresponding rationales. At the heart of MalAlgoQA are ``malgorithms'' - rationales behind incorrect answer choices that represent flawed yet logically coherent reasoning paths. These malgorithms serve as counterfactual scenarios, allowing us to assess an LLM's ability to identify and analyze flawed reasoning patterns. We propose the Malgorithm Identification task, where LLMs are assessed based on their ability to identify corresponding malgorithm given an incorrect answer choice. To evaluate the model performance, we introduce two metrics: Algorithm Identification Accuracy (AIA) for correct answer rationale identification, and Malgorithm Identification Accuracy (MIA) for incorrect answer rationale identification. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant performance drops in MIA compared to AIA, highlighting the challenges in counterfactual reasoning. Surprisingly, we find that the chain-of-thought prompting technique not only fails to consistently enhance MIA but can sometimes lead to underperformance compared to simple prompting. These findings have important implications for developing LLMs with improved counterfactual reasoning, particularly relevant for AI-powered tutoring systems, where identifying and addressing student misconceptions is essential.

Large Language Model Enhanced Knowledge Representation Learning: A Survey,"Xin Wang, Zirui Chen, Haofen Wang, Leong Hou U, Zhao Li, Wenbin Guo","The integration of Large Language Models (LLM) with Knowledge Representation Learning (KRL) signifies a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), enhancing the ability to capture and utilize both structure and textual information. Despite the increasing research on enhancing KRL with LLMs, a thorough survey that analyse processes of these enhanced models is conspicuously absent. Our survey addresses this by categorizing these models based on three distinct Transformer architectures, and by analyzing experimental data from various KRL downstream tasks to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Finally, we identify and explore potential future research directions in this emerging yet underexplored domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00936v2,2024-07
Look Ahead or Look Around? A Theoretical Comparison Between Autoregressive and Masked Pretraining,"Qi Zhang, Tianqi Du, Haotian Huang, Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang","In recent years, the rise of generative self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms has exhibited impressive performance across visual, language, and multi-modal domains. While the varied designs of generative SSL objectives lead to distinct properties in downstream tasks, a theoretical understanding of these differences remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we establish the first theoretical comparisons between two leading generative SSL paradigms: autoregressive SSL and masked SSL. Through establishing theoretical frameworks, we elucidate the strengths and limitations of autoregressive and masked SSL within the primary evaluation tasks of classification and content generation. Our findings demonstrate that in classification tasks, the flexibility of targeted tokens in masked SSL fosters more inter-sample connections compared to the fixed position of target tokens in autoregressive SSL, which yields superior clustering performance. In content generation tasks, the misalignment between the flexible lengths of test samples and the fixed length of unmasked texts in masked SSL (vs. flexible lengths of conditional texts in autoregressive SSL) hinders its generation performance. To leverage each other's strengths and mitigate weaknesses, we propose diversity-enhanced autoregressive and variable-length masked objectives, which substantially improve the classification performance of autoregressive SSL and the generation performance of masked SSL.

CLEME2.0: Towards More Interpretable Evaluation by Disentangling Edits for Grammatical Error Correction,"Jingheng Ye, Zishan Xu, Yinghui Li, Xuxin Cheng, Linlin Song, Qingyu Zhou, Hai-Tao Zheng, Ying Shen, Xin Su","The paper focuses on improving the interpretability of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) metrics, which receives little attention in previous studies. To bridge the gap, we propose CLEME2.0, a reference-based evaluation strategy that can describe four elementary dimensions of GEC systems, namely hit-correction, error-correction, under-correction, and over-correction. They collectively contribute to revealing the critical characteristics and locating drawbacks of GEC systems. Evaluating systems by Combining these dimensions leads to high human consistency over other reference-based and reference-less metrics. Extensive experiments on 2 human judgement datasets and 6 reference datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. All the codes will be released after the peer review.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00934v1,2024-07
FoldGPT: Simple and Effective Large Language Model Compression Scheme,"Songwei Liu, Chao Zeng, Lianqiang Li, Chenqian Yan, Lean Fu, Xing Mei, Fangmin Chen","The demand for deploying large language models(LLMs) on mobile devices continues to increase, driven by escalating data security concerns and cloud costs. However, network bandwidth and memory limitations pose challenges for deploying billion-level models on mobile devices. In this study, we investigate the outputs of different layers across various scales of LLMs and found that the outputs of most layers exhibit significant similarity. Moreover, this similarity becomes more pronounced as the model size increases, indicating substantial redundancy in the depth direction of the LLMs. Based on this observation, we propose an efficient model volume compression strategy, termed FoldGPT, which combines block removal and block parameter sharing.This strategy consists of three parts: (1) Based on the learnable gating parameters, we determine the block importance ranking while modeling the coupling effect between blocks. Then we delete some redundant layers based on the given removal rate. (2) For the retained blocks, we apply a specially designed group parameter sharing strategy, where blocks within the same group share identical weights, significantly compressing the number of parameters and slightly reducing latency overhead. (3) After sharing these Blocks, we ""cure"" the mismatch caused by sparsity with a minor amount of fine-tuning and introduce a tail-layer distillation strategy to improve the performance. Experiments demonstrate that FoldGPT outperforms previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods in efficient model compression, demonstrating the feasibility of achieving model lightweighting through straightforward block removal and parameter sharing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00928v1,2024-07
EXCGEC: A Benchmark of Edit-wise Explainable Chinese Grammatical Error Correction,"Jingheng Ye, Shang Qin, Yinghui Li, Xuxin Cheng, Libo Qin, Hai-Tao Zheng, Peng Xing, Zishan Xu, Guo Cheng, Zhao Wei","Existing studies explore the explainability of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) in a limited scenario, where they ignore the interaction between corrections and explanations. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces the task of EXplainable GEC (EXGEC), which focuses on the integral role of both correction and explanation tasks. To facilitate the task, we propose EXCGEC, a tailored benchmark for Chinese EXGEC consisting of 8,216 explanation-augmented samples featuring the design of hybrid edit-wise explanations. We benchmark several series of LLMs in multiple settings, covering post-explaining and pre-explaining. To promote the development of the task, we introduce a comprehensive suite of automatic metrics and conduct human evaluation experiments to demonstrate the human consistency of the automatic metrics for free-text explanations.

Preserving Multilingual Quality While Tuning Query Encoder on English Only,"Oleg Vasilyev, Randy Sawaya, John Bohannon","A query encoder of a dual passage retrieval system can be tuned for specific types of queries or domains, while the precomputed and stored documents representations are kept intact. Switching from one query encoder to another when needed is easily feasible, unlike overhauling the embeddings of a whole knowledge base. In this work we raise a question: Can the generic, original qualities of the encoder be preserved or at least left not too degraded when it is tuned on a narrow domain? We conducted experiments on a high quality multilingual embedding model: Tuning it on a single English-only dataset, we observe that the tuning not only preserves the multilingual qualities, but even improves them. The embedding qualities on distinctly different data are also improved or at least preserved. Drawing on our observations, we suggest a more general hypothesis: Tuning with intentionally low learning rate can preserve or improve a system's properties acquired in training, but not specifically targeted by tuning. We call this adiabatic tuning and provide tentative explanations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00923v3,2024-07
Deep Image-to-Recipe Translation,"Jiangqin Ma, Bilal Mawji, Franz Williams","The modern saying, ""You Are What You Eat"" resonates on a profound level, reflecting the intricate connection between our identities and the food we consume. Our project, Deep Image-to-Recipe Translation, is an intersection of computer vision and natural language generation that aims to bridge the gap between cherished food memories and the art of culinary creation. Our primary objective involves predicting ingredients from a given food image. For this task, we first develop a custom convolutional network and then compare its performance to a model that leverages transfer learning. We pursue an additional goal of generating a comprehensive set of recipe steps from a list of ingredients. We frame this process as a sequence-to-sequence task and develop a recurrent neural network that utilizes pre-trained word embeddings. We address several challenges of deep learning including imbalanced datasets, data cleaning, overfitting, and hyperparameter selection. Our approach emphasizes the importance of metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score in scenarios where accuracy alone might be misleading. For our recipe prediction model, we employ perplexity, a commonly used and important metric for language models. We find that transfer learning via pre-trained ResNet-50 weights and GloVe embeddings provide an exceptional boost to model performance, especially when considering training resource constraints. Although we have made progress on the image-to-recipe translation, there is an opportunity for future exploration with advancements in model architectures, dataset scalability, and enhanced user interaction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00911v1,2024-07
FineSurE: Fine-grained Summarization Evaluation using LLMs,"Hwanjun Song, Hang Su, Igor Shalyminov, Jason Cai, Saab Mansour","Automated evaluation is crucial for streamlining text summarization benchmarking and model development, given the costly and time-consuming nature of human evaluation. Traditional methods like ROUGE do not correlate well with human judgment, while recently proposed LLM-based metrics provide only summary-level assessment using Likert-scale scores. This limits deeper model analysis, e.g., we can only assign one hallucination score at the summary level, while at the sentence level, we can count sentences containing hallucinations. To remedy those limitations, we propose FineSurE, a fine-grained evaluator specifically tailored for the summarization task using large language models (LLMs). It also employs completeness and conciseness criteria, in addition to faithfulness, enabling multi-dimensional assessment. We compare various open-source and proprietary LLMs as backbones for FineSurE. In addition, we conduct extensive benchmarking of FineSurE against SOTA methods including NLI-, QA-, and LLM-based methods, showing improved performance especially on the completeness and conciseness dimensions. The code is available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/FineSurE-ACL24.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00908v3,2024-07
From Introspection to Best Practices: Principled Analysis of Demonstrations in Multimodal In-Context Learning,"Nan Xu, Fei Wang, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen","Motivated by in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of Large Language models (LLMs), multimodal LLMs with additional visual modality are also exhibited with similar ICL abilities when multiple image-text pairs are provided as demonstrations. However, relatively less work has been done to investigate the principles behind how and why multimodal ICL works. We conduct a systematic and principled evaluation of multimodal ICL for models of different scales on a broad spectrum of new yet critical tasks. Through perturbations over different modality information, we show that modalities matter differently across tasks in multimodal ICL. Guided by task-specific modality impact, we recommend modality-driven demonstration strategies to boost ICL performance. We also find that models may follow inductive biases from multimodal ICL even if they are rarely seen in or contradict semantic priors from pretraining data. Our principled analysis provides a comprehensive way of understanding the role of demonstrations in multimodal in-context learning, and sheds light on effectively improving multimodal ICL on a wide range of tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00902v2,2024-07
MathCAMPS: Fine-grained Synthesis of Mathematical Problems From Human Curricula,"Shubhra Mishra, Gabriel Poesia, Belinda Mo, Noah D. Goodman","Mathematical problem solving is an important skill for Large Language Models (LLMs), both as an important capability and a proxy for a range of reasoning abilities. Existing benchmarks probe a diverse set of skills, but they yield aggregate accuracy metrics, obscuring specific abilities or weaknesses. Furthermore, they are difficult to extend with new problems, risking data contamination over time. To address these challenges, we propose MathCAMPS: a method to synthesize high-quality mathematical problems at scale, grounded on 44 fine-grained ""standards"" from the Mathematics Common Core (CC) Standard for K-8 grades. We encode each standard in a formal grammar, allowing us to sample diverse symbolic problems and their answers. We then use LLMs to realize the symbolic problems into word problems. We propose a cycle-consistency method for validating problem faithfulness. Finally, we derive follow-up questions from symbolic structures and convert them into follow-up word problems - a novel task of mathematical dialogue that probes for robustness in understanding. Experiments on 23 LLMs show surprising failures even in the strongest models (in particular when asked simple follow-up questions). Moreover, we evaluate training checkpoints of Pythia 12B on MathCAMPS, allowing us to analyze when particular mathematical skills develop during its training. Our framework enables the community to reproduce and extend our pipeline for a fraction of the typical cost of building new high-quality datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00900v1,2024-07
How to Leverage Digit Embeddings to Represent Numbers?,"Jasivan Alex Sivakumar, Nafise Sadat Moosavi","Within numerical reasoning, understanding numbers themselves is still a challenge for existing language models. Simple generalisations, such as solving 100+200 instead of 1+2, can substantially affect model performance (Sivakumar and Moosavi, 2023). Among various techniques, character-level embeddings of numbers have emerged as a promising approach to improve number representation. However, this method has limitations as it leaves the task of aggregating digit representations to the model, which lacks direct supervision for this process. In this paper, we explore the use of mathematical priors to compute aggregated digit embeddings and explicitly incorporate these aggregates into transformer models. This can be achieved either by adding a special token to the input embeddings or by introducing an additional loss function to enhance correct predictions. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating this explicit aggregation, analysing its strengths and shortcomings, and discuss future directions to better benefit from this approach. Our methods, while simple, are compatible with any pretrained model, easy to implement, and have been made publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00894v2,2024-07
Macroeconomic Forecasting with Large Language Models,"Andrea Carriero, Davide Pettenuzzo, Shubhranshu Shekhar","This paper presents a comparative analysis evaluating the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) against traditional macro time series forecasting approaches. In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across very different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting macroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area of interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on their applicability in real-world scenarios",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00890v2,2024-07
Papez: Resource-Efficient Speech Separation with Auditory Working Memory,"Hyunseok Oh, Juheon Yi, Youngki Lee","Transformer-based models recently reached state-of-the-art single-channel speech separation accuracy; However, their extreme computational load makes it difficult to deploy them in resource-constrained mobile or IoT devices. We thus present Papez, a lightweight and computation-efficient single-channel speech separation model. Papez is based on three key techniques. We first replace the inter-chunk Transformer with small-sized auditory working memory. Second, we adaptively prune the input tokens that do not need further processing. Finally, we reduce the number of parameters through the recurrent transformer. Our extensive evaluation shows that Papez achieves the best resource and accuracy tradeoffs with a large margin.

Efficient Automated Circuit Discovery in Transformers using Contextual Decomposition,"Aliyah R. Hsu, Georgia Zhou, Yeshwanth Cherapanamjeri, Yaxuan Huang, Anobel Y. Odisho, Peter R. Carroll, Bin Yu","Automated mechanistic interpretation research has attracted great interest due to its potential to scale explanations of neural network internals to large models. Existing automated circuit discovery work relies on activation patching or its approximations to identify subgraphs in models for specific tasks (circuits). They often suffer from slow runtime, approximation errors, and specific requirements of metrics, such as non-zero gradients. In this work, we introduce contextual decomposition for transformers (CD-T) to build interpretable circuits in large language models. CD-T can produce circuits of arbitrary level of abstraction, and is the first able to produce circuits as fine-grained as attention heads at specific sequence positions efficiently. CD-T consists of a set of mathematical equations to isolate contribution of model features. Through recursively computing contribution of all nodes in a computational graph of a model using CD-T followed by pruning, we are able to reduce circuit discovery runtime from hours to seconds compared to state-of-the-art baselines. On three standard circuit evaluation datasets (indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring completion), we demonstrate that CD-T outperforms ACDC and EAP by better recovering the manual circuits with an average of 97% ROC AUC under low runtimes. In addition, we provide evidence that faithfulness of CD-T circuits is not due to random chance by showing our circuits are 80% more faithful than random circuits of up to 60% of the original model size. Finally, we show CD-T circuits are able to perfectly replicate original models' behavior (faithfulness $ = 1$) using fewer nodes than the baselines for all tasks. Our results underscore the great promise of CD-T for efficient automated mechanistic interpretability, paving the way for new insights into the workings of large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00886v2,2024-07
Roleplay-doh: Enabling Domain-Experts to Create LLM-simulated Patients via Eliciting and Adhering to Principles,"Ryan Louie, Ananjan Nandi, William Fang, Cheng Chang, Emma Brunskill, Diyi Yang","Recent works leverage LLMs to roleplay realistic social scenarios, aiding novices in practicing their social skills. However, simulating sensitive interactions, such as in mental health, is challenging. Privacy concerns restrict data access, and collecting expert feedback, although vital, is laborious. To address this, we develop Roleplay-doh, a novel human-LLM collaboration pipeline that elicits qualitative feedback from a domain-expert, which is transformed into a set of principles, or natural language rules, that govern an LLM-prompted roleplay. We apply this pipeline to enable senior mental health supporters to create customized AI patients for simulated practice partners for novice counselors. After uncovering issues in GPT-4 simulations not adhering to expert-defined principles, we also introduce a novel principle-adherence prompting pipeline which shows 30% improvements in response quality and principle following for the downstream task. Via a user study with 25 counseling experts, we demonstrate that the pipeline makes it easy and effective to create AI patients that more faithfully resemble real patients, as judged by creators and third-party counselors.

Large Language Models Are Involuntary Truth-Tellers: Exploiting Fallacy Failure for Jailbreak Attacks,"Yue Zhou, Henry Peng Zou, Barbara Di Eugenio, Yang Zhang","We find that language models have difficulties generating fallacious and deceptive reasoning. When asked to generate deceptive outputs, language models tend to leak honest counterparts but believe them to be false. Exploiting this deficiency, we propose a jailbreak attack method that elicits an aligned language model for malicious output. Specifically, we query the model to generate a fallacious yet deceptively real procedure for the harmful behavior. Since a fallacious procedure is generally considered fake and thus harmless by LLMs, it helps bypass the safeguard mechanism. Yet the output is factually harmful since the LLM cannot fabricate fallacious solutions but proposes truthful ones. We evaluate our approach over five safety-aligned large language models, comparing four previous jailbreak methods, and show that our approach achieves competitive performance with more harmful outputs. We believe the findings could be extended beyond model safety, such as self-verification and hallucination.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00869v2,2024-07
