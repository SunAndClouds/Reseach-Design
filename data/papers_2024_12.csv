The Text Classification Pipeline: Starting Shallow going Deeper,"Marco Siino, Ilenia Tinnirello, Marco La Cascia","Text Classification (TC) stands as a cornerstone within the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly when viewed through the lens of computer science and engineering. The past decade has seen deep learning revolutionize TC, propelling advancements in text retrieval, categorization, information extraction, and summarization. The scholarly literature is rich with datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, with English being the predominant language of focus, despite studies involving Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, and others. The efficacy of TC models relies heavily on their ability to capture intricate textual relationships and nonlinear correlations, necessitating a comprehensive examination of the entire TC pipeline.   This monograph provides an in-depth exploration of the TC pipeline, with a particular emphasis on evaluating the impact of each component on the overall performance of TC models. The pipeline includes state-of-the-art datasets, text preprocessing techniques, text representation methods, classification models, evaluation metrics, current results and future trends. Each chapter meticulously examines these stages, presenting technical innovations and significant recent findings. The work critically assesses various classification strategies, offering comparative analyses, examples, case studies, and experimental evaluations. These contributions extend beyond a typical survey, providing a detailed and insightful exploration of TC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00174v1,2024-12
DeepLL: Considering Linear Logic for the Analysis of Deep Learning Experiments,Nick Papoulias,"Deep Learning experiments have critical requirements regarding the careful handling of their datasets as well as the efficient and correct usage of APIs that interact with hardware accelerators. On the one hand, software mistakes during data handling can contaminate experiments and lead to incorrect results. On the other hand, poorly coded APIs that interact with the hardware can lead to sub-optimal usage and untrustworthy conclusions. In this work we investigate the use of Linear Logic for the analysis of Deep Learning experiments. We show that primitives and operators of Linear Logic can be used to express: (i) an abstract representation of the control flow of an experiment, (ii) a set of available experimental resources, such as API calls to the underlying data-structures and hardware as well as (iii) reasoning rules about the correct consumption of resources during experiments. Our proposed model is not only lightweight but also easy to comprehend having both a symbolic and a visual component. Finally, its artifacts are themselves proofs in Linear Logic that can be readily verified by off-the-shelf reasoners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00169v1,2024-12
Measuring Large Language Models Capacity to Annotate Journalistic Sourcing,"Subramaniam Vincent, Phoebe Wang, Zhan Shi, Sahas Koka, Yi Fang","Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, the capacities of Large Language Models and their evaluation have been in constant discussion and evaluation both in academic research and in the industry. Scenarios and benchmarks have been developed in several areas such as law, medicine and math (Bommasani et al., 2023) and there is continuous evaluation of model variants. One area that has not received sufficient scenario development attention is journalism, and in particular journalistic sourcing and ethics. Journalism is a crucial truth-determination function in democracy (Vincent, 2023), and sourcing is a crucial pillar to all original journalistic output. Evaluating the capacities of LLMs to annotate stories for the different signals of sourcing and how reporters justify them is a crucial scenario that warrants a benchmark approach. It offers potential to build automated systems to contrast more transparent and ethically rigorous forms of journalism with everyday fare. In this paper we lay out a scenario to evaluate LLM performance on identifying and annotating sourcing in news stories on a five-category schema inspired from journalism studies (Gans, 2004). We offer the use case, our dataset and metrics and as the first step towards systematic benchmarking. Our accuracy findings indicate LLM-based approaches have more catching to do in identifying all the sourced statements in a story, and equally, in matching the type of sources. An even harder task is spotting source justifications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00164v1,2024-12
Temporal reasoning for timeline summarisation in social media,"Jiayu Song, Mahmud Akhter, Dana Atzil Slonim, Maria Liakata","This paper explores whether enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the quality of timeline summarization, the task of summarising long texts containing sequences of events, particularly social media threads . We introduce \textit{NarrativeReason}, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarization through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarization. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on mental health-related timeline summarization tasks, which involve long social media threads with repetitions of events and a mix of emotions, highlighting the importance of leveraging temporal reasoning to improve timeline summarisation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00152v1,2024-12
A Data-Centric Approach to Detecting and Mitigating Demographic Bias in Pediatric Mental Health Text: A Case Study in Anxiety Detection,"Julia Ive, Paulina Bondaronek, Vishal Yadav, Daniel Santel, Tracy Glauser, Tina Cheng, Jeffrey R. Strawn, Greeshma Agasthya, Jordan Tschida, Sanghyun Choo, Mayanka Chandrashekar, Anuj J. Kapadia, John Pestian","Introduction: Healthcare AI models often inherit biases from their training data. While efforts have primarily targeted bias in structured data, mental health heavily depends on unstructured data. This study aims to detect and mitigate linguistic differences related to non-biological differences in the training data of AI models designed to assist in pediatric mental health screening. Our objectives are: (1) to assess the presence of bias by evaluating outcome parity across sex subgroups, (2) to identify bias sources through textual distribution analysis, and (3) to develop a de-biasing method for mental health text data. Methods: We examined classification parity across demographic groups and assessed how gendered language influences model predictions. A data-centric de-biasing method was applied, focusing on neutralizing biased terms while retaining salient clinical information. This methodology was tested on a model for automatic anxiety detection in pediatric patients. Results: Our findings revealed a systematic under-diagnosis of female adolescent patients, with a 4% lower accuracy and a 9% higher False Negative Rate (FNR) compared to male patients, likely due to disparities in information density and linguistic differences in patient notes. Notes for male patients were on average 500 words longer, and linguistic similarity metrics indicated distinct word distributions between genders. Implementing our de-biasing approach reduced diagnostic bias by up to 27%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing equity across demographic groups. Discussion: We developed a data-centric de-biasing framework to address gender-based content disparities within clinical text. By neutralizing biased language and enhancing focus on clinically essential information, our approach demonstrates an effective strategy for mitigating bias in AI healthcare models trained on text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00129v1,2024-12
CaseSumm: A Large-Scale Dataset for Long-Context Summarization from U.S. Supreme Court Opinions,"Mourad Heddaya, Kyle MacMillan, Anup Malani, Hongyuan Mei, Chenhao Tan","This paper introduces CaseSumm, a novel dataset for long-context summarization in the legal domain that addresses the need for longer and more complex datasets for summarization evaluation. We collect 25.6K U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) opinions and their official summaries, known as ""syllabuses."" Our dataset is the largest open legal case summarization dataset, and is the first to include summaries of SCOTUS decisions dating back to 1815.   We also present a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-generated summaries using both automatic metrics and expert human evaluation, revealing discrepancies between these assessment methods. Our evaluation shows Mistral 7b, a smaller open-source model, outperforms larger models on most automatic metrics and successfully generates syllabus-like summaries. In contrast, human expert annotators indicate that Mistral summaries contain hallucinations. The annotators consistently rank GPT-4 summaries as clearer and exhibiting greater sensitivity and specificity. Further, we find that LLM-based evaluations are not more correlated with human evaluations than traditional automatic metrics. Furthermore, our analysis identifies specific hallucinations in generated summaries, including precedent citation errors and misrepresentations of case facts. These findings demonstrate the limitations of current automatic evaluation methods for legal summarization and highlight the critical role of human evaluation in assessing summary quality, particularly in complex, high-stakes domains.

Distributed Mixture-of-Agents for Edge Inference with Large Language Models,"Purbesh Mitra, Priyanka Kaswan, Sennur Ulukus","Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference. This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power. These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21200v1,2024-12
HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro: Evaluating Large Language Models on Self-invoking Code Generation,"Zhaojian Yu, Yilun Zhao, Arman Cohan, Xiao-Ping Zhang","We introduce self-invoking code generation, a new task designed to evaluate the progressive reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. In this task, models are presented with a base problem and a related, more complex problem. They must solve the base problem and then utilize its solution to address the more complex one. This work features three key contributions. First, we propose a general recipe for generating more challenging versions of existing benchmarks, resulting in three new benchmarks: HumanEval Pro, MBPP Pro, and BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, specifically designed to assess LLMs on self-invoking code generation. Second, from the analysis of experimental results over twenty LLMs on our benchmarks, we have two important observations: (i) Most LLMs excel in traditional code generation benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP, but their performance declines on self-invoking tasks. For example, o1-mini achieves 96.2% pass@1 on HumanEval but only 76.2% on HumanEval Pro. (ii) On self-invoking code generation task, the instruction-tuned models demonstrate only marginal improvements compared to the base models. Third, we disclose the types of failure modes that exist in our evaluation results. All these results underscore the need for further advancements in self-invoking code generation tasks and provide a new direction for future research on enhancing LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21199v2,2024-12
Do NOT Think That Much for 2+3=? On the Overthinking of o1-Like LLMs,"Xingyu Chen, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Zhiwei He, Jianhui Pang, Dian Yu, Linfeng Song, Qiuzhi Liu, Mengfei Zhou, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu","The remarkable performance of models like the OpenAI o1 can be attributed to their ability to emulate human-like long-time thinking during inference. These models employ extended chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, exploring multiple strategies to enhance problem-solving capabilities. However, a critical question remains: How to intelligently and efficiently scale computational resources during testing. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the prevalent issue of overthinking in these models, where excessive computational resources are allocated for simple problems with minimal benefit. We introduce novel efficiency metrics from both outcome and process perspectives to evaluate the rational use of computational resources by o1-like models. Using a self-training paradigm, we propose strategies to mitigate overthinking, streamlining reasoning processes without compromising accuracy. Experimental results show that our approach successfully reduces computational overhead while preserving model performance across a range of testsets with varying difficulty levels, such as GSM8K, MATH500, GPQA, and AIME.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21187v1,2024-12
Two-component spatiotemporal template for activation-inhibition of speech in ECoG,Eric Easthope,"I compute the average trial-by-trial power of band-limited speech activity across epochs of multi-channel high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) recorded from multiple subjects during a consonant-vowel speaking task. I show that previously seen anti-correlations of average beta frequency activity (12-35 Hz) to high-frequency gamma activity (70-140 Hz) during speech movement are observable between individual ECoG channels in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC). With this I fit a variance-based model using principal component analysis to the band-powers of individual channels of session-averaged ECoG data in the SMC and project SMC channels onto their lower-dimensional principal components.   Spatiotemporal relationships between speech-related activity and principal components are identified by correlating the principal components of both frequency bands to individual ECoG channels over time using windowed correlation. Correlations of principal component areas to sensorimotor areas reveal a distinct two-component activation-inhibition-like representation for speech that resembles distinct local sensorimotor areas recently shown to have complex interplay in whole-body motor control, inhibition, and posture. Notably the third principal component shows insignificant correlations across all subjects, suggesting two components of ECoG are sufficient to represent SMC activity during speech movement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21178v1,2024-12
Aviary: training language agents on challenging scientific tasks,"Siddharth Narayanan, James D. Braza, Ryan-Rhys Griffiths, Manu Ponnapati, Albert Bou, Jon Laurent, Ori Kabeli, Geemi Wellawatte, Sam Cox, Samuel G. Rodriques, Andrew D. White","Solving complex real-world tasks requires cycles of actions and observations. This is particularly true in science, where tasks require many cycles of analysis, tool use, and experimentation. Language agents are promising for automating intellectual tasks in science because they can interact with tools via natural language or code. Yet their flexibility creates conceptual and practical challenges for software implementations, since agents may comprise non-standard components such as internal reasoning, planning, tool usage, as well as the inherent stochasticity of temperature-sampled language models. Here, we introduce Aviary, an extensible gymnasium for language agents. We formalize agents as policies solving language-grounded partially observable Markov decision processes, which we term language decision processes. We then implement five environments, including three challenging scientific environments: (1) manipulating DNA constructs for molecular cloning, (2) answering research questions by accessing scientific literature, and (3) engineering protein stability. These environments were selected for their focus on multi-step reasoning and their relevance to contemporary biology research. Finally, with online training and scaling inference-time compute, we show that language agents backed by open-source, non-frontier LLMs can match and exceed both frontier LLM agents and human experts on multiple tasks at up to 100x lower inference cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21154v1,2024-12
Facilitating large language model Russian adaptation with Learned Embedding Propagation,"Mikhail Tikhomirov, Daniil Chernyshev","Rapid advancements of large language model (LLM) technologies led to the introduction of powerful open-source instruction-tuned LLMs that have the same text generation quality as the state-of-the-art counterparts such as GPT-4. While the emergence of such models accelerates the adoption of LLM technologies in sensitive-information environments the authors of such models don not disclose the training data necessary for replication of the results thus making the achievements model-exclusive. Since those open-source models are also multilingual this in turn reduces the benefits of training a language specific LLMs as improved inference computation efficiency becomes the only guaranteed advantage of such costly procedure. More cost-efficient options such as vocabulary extension and subsequent continued pre-training are also inhibited by the lack of access to high-quality instruction-tuning data since it is the major factor behind the resulting LLM task-solving capabilities. To address the limitations and cut the costs of the language adaptation pipeline we propose Learned Embedding Propagation (LEP). Unlike existing approaches our method has lower training data size requirements due to minimal impact on existing LLM knowledge which we reinforce using novel ad-hoc embedding propagation procedure that allows to skip the instruction-tuning step and instead implant the new language knowledge directly into any existing instruct-tuned variant. We evaluated four Russian vocabulary adaptations for LLaMa-3-8B and Mistral-7B, showing that LEP is competitive with traditional instruction-tuning methods, achieving performance comparable to OpenChat 3.5 and LLaMa-3-8B-Instruct, with further improvements via self-calibration and continued tuning enhancing task-solving capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21140v1,2024-12
Training Software Engineering Agents and Verifiers with SWE-Gym,"Jiayi Pan, Xingyao Wang, Graham Neubig, Navdeep Jaitly, Heng Ji, Alane Suhr, Yizhe Zhang","We present SWE-Gym, the first environment for training real-world software engineering (SWE) agents. SWE-Gym contains 2,438 real-world Python task instances, each comprising a codebase with an executable runtime environment, unit tests, and a task specified in natural language. We use SWE-Gym to train language model based SWE agents , achieving up to 19% absolute gains in resolve rate on the popular SWE-Bench Verified and Lite test sets. We also experiment with inference-time scaling through verifiers trained on agent trajectories sampled from SWE-Gym. When combined with our fine-tuned SWE agents, we achieve 32.0% and 26.0% on SWE-Bench Verified and Lite, respectively, reflecting a new state-of-the-art for open-weight SWE agents. To facilitate further research, we publicly release SWE-Gym, models, and agent trajectories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21139v1,2024-12
Exploring and Controlling Diversity in LLM-Agent Conversation,"KuanChao Chu, Yi-Pei Chen, Hideki Nakayama","Diversity is a critical aspect of multi-agent communication. In this paper, we focus on controlling and exploring diversity in the context of open-domain multi-agent conversations, particularly for world simulation applications. We propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the content of the utterance generation prompt to control diversity using a single parameter, lambda. Through extensive experiments, we show that APP effectively controls the output diversity across models and datasets, with pruning more information leading to more diverse output. We comprehensively analyze the relationship between prompt content and conversational diversity. Our findings reveal that information from all components of the prompt generally constrains the diversity of the output, with the Memory block exerting the most significant influence. APP is compatible with established techniques like temperature sampling and top-p sampling, providing a versatile tool for diversity management. To address the trade-offs of increased diversity, such as inconsistencies with omitted information, we incorporate a post-generation correction step, which effectively balances diversity enhancement with output consistency. Additionally, we examine how prompt structure, including component order and length, impacts diversity. This study addresses key questions surrounding diversity in multi-agent world simulation, offering insights into its control, influencing factors, and associated trade-offs. Our contributions lay the foundation for systematically engineering diversity in LLM-based multi-agent collaborations, advancing their effectiveness in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21102v1,2024-12
Efficient Multi-Task Inferencing with a Shared Backbone and Lightweight Task-Specific Adapters for Automatic Scoring,"Ehsan Latif, Xiaoming Zhai","The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education requires scalable and efficient frameworks that balance performance, adaptability, and cost. This paper addresses these needs by proposing a shared backbone model architecture enhanced with lightweight LoRA adapters for task-specific fine-tuning, targeting the automated scoring of student responses across 27 mutually exclusive tasks. By achieving competitive performance (average QWK of 0.848 compared to 0.888 for fully fine-tuned models) while reducing GPU memory consumption by 60% and inference latency by 40%, the framework demonstrates significant efficiency gains. This approach aligns with the workshops' focus on improving language models for educational tasks, creating responsible innovations for cost-sensitive deployment, and supporting educators by streamlining assessment workflows. The findings underscore the potential of scalable AI to enhance learning outcomes while maintaining fairness and transparency in automated scoring systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21065v1,2024-12
TangoFlux: Super Fast and Faithful Text to Audio Generation with Flow Matching and Clap-Ranked Preference Optimization,"Chia-Yu Hung, Navonil Majumder, Zhifeng Kong, Ambuj Mehrish, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro, Soujanya Poria","We introduce TangoFlux, an efficient Text-to-Audio (TTA) generative model with 515M parameters, capable of generating up to 30 seconds of 44.1kHz audio in just 3.7 seconds on a single A40 GPU. A key challenge in aligning TTA models lies in the difficulty of creating preference pairs, as TTA lacks structured mechanisms like verifiable rewards or gold-standard answers available for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose CLAP-Ranked Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that iteratively generates and optimizes preference data to enhance TTA alignment. We demonstrate that the audio preference dataset generated using CRPO outperforms existing alternatives. With this framework, TangoFlux achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective benchmarks. We open source all code and models to support further research in TTA generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21037v1,2024-12
GePBench: Evaluating Fundamental Geometric Perception for Multimodal Large Language Models,"Shangyu Xing, Changhao Xiang, Yuteng Han, Yifan Yue, Zhen Wu, Xinyu Liu, Zhangtai Wu, Fei Zhao, Xinyu Dai","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advancements in integrating visual and linguistic understanding. While existing benchmarks evaluate these models in context-rich, real-life scenarios, they often overlook fundamental perceptual skills essential for environments deviating from everyday realism. In particular, geometric perception, the ability to interpret spatial relationships and abstract visual patterns, remains underexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce GePBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the geometric perception capabilities of MLLMs. Results from extensive evaluations reveal that current state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in such tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that models trained with data sourced from GePBench show notable improvements on a wide range of downstream tasks, underscoring the importance of geometric perception as a foundation for advanced multimodal applications.

Plancraft: an evaluation dataset for planning with LLM agents,"Gautier Dagan, Frank Keller, Alex Lascarides","We present Plancraft, a multi-modal evaluation dataset for LLM agents. Plancraft has both a text-only and multi-modal interface, based on the Minecraft crafting GUI. We include the Minecraft Wiki to evaluate tool use and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as an oracle planner and oracle RAG information extractor, to ablate the different components of a modern agent architecture. To evaluate decision-making, Plancraft also includes a subset of examples that are intentionally unsolvable, providing a realistic challenge that requires the agent not only to complete tasks but also to decide whether they are solvable at all. We benchmark both open-source and closed-source LLMs and strategies on our task and compare their performance to a handcrafted planner. We find that LLMs and VLMs struggle with the planning problems that Plancraft introduces, and we offer suggestions on how to improve their capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21033v1,2024-12
MapQaTor: A System for Efficient Annotation of Map Query Datasets,"Mahir Labib Dihan, Mohammed Eunus Ali, Md Rizwan Parvez","Mapping and navigation services like Google Maps, Apple Maps, Openstreet Maps, are essential for accessing various location-based data, yet they often struggle to handle natural language geospatial queries. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question answering (QA), but creating reliable geospatial QA datasets from map services remains challenging. We introduce MapQaTor, a web application that streamlines the creation of reproducible, traceable map-based QA datasets. With its plug-and-play architecture, MapQaTor enables seamless integration with any maps API, allowing users to gather and visualize data from diverse sources with minimal setup. By caching API responses, the platform ensures consistent ground truth, enhancing the reliability of the data even as real-world information evolves. MapQaTor centralizes data retrieval, annotation, and visualization within a single platform, offering a unique opportunity to evaluate the current state of LLM-based geospatial reasoning while advancing their capabilities for improved geospatial understanding. Evaluation metrics show that, MapQaTor speeds up the annotation process by at least 30 times compared to manual methods, underscoring its potential for developing geospatial resources, such as complex map reasoning datasets.

Verbosity-Aware Rationale Reduction: Effective Reduction of Redundant Rationale via Principled Criteria,"Joonwon Jang, Jaehee Kim, Wonbin Kweon, Hwanjo Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on generating extensive intermediate reasoning units (e.g., tokens, sentences) to enhance final answer quality across a wide range of complex tasks. While generating multiple reasoning paths or iteratively refining rationales proves effective for improving performance, these approaches inevitably result in significantly higher inference costs. In this work, we propose a novel sentence-level rationale reduction training framework that leverages likelihood-based criteria, verbosity, to identify and remove redundant reasoning sentences. Unlike previous approaches that utilize token-level reduction, our sentence-level reduction framework maintains model performance while reducing generation length. This preserves the original reasoning abilities of LLMs and achieves an average 17.15% reduction in generation costs across various models and tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21006v2,2024-12
Plug-and-Play Training Framework for Preference Optimization,"Jingyuan Ma, Rui Li, Zheng Li, Lei Sha, Zhifang Sui","Recently, preference optimization methods such as DPO have significantly enhanced large language models (LLMs) in wide tasks including dialogue and question-answering. However, current methods fail to account for the varying difficulty levels of training samples during preference optimization, leading to mediocre performance in tasks with high accuracy requirements, particularly in mathematical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel training framework, which employs multiple sampling to analyze output distributions, assign different weights to samples, and incorporate these weights into the preference optimization process. This plug-and-play approach enables LLMs to prioritize challenging examples during training, improving learning efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework integrates seamlessly with various preference optimization methods and achieves consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20996v1,2024-12
KARPA: A Training-free Method of Adapting Knowledge Graph as References for Large Language Model's Reasoning Path Aggregation,"Siyuan Fang, Kaijing Ma, Tianyu Zheng, Xinrun Du, Ningxuan Lu, Ge Zhang, Qingkun Tang","Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across a variety of tasks, yet they are often affected by hallucinations and the timeliness of knowledge. Leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) as external knowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution, but existing methods for LLM-based knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) are often limited by step-by-step decision-making on KGs, restricting the global planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, or they require fine-tuning or pre-training on specific KGs. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted Reasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global planning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA operates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM's global planning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding model, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers. Unlike existing KGQA methods, KARPA avoids stepwise traversal, requires no additional training, and is adaptable to various LLM architectures. Extensive experimental results show that KARPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in KGQA tasks, delivering both high efficiency and accuracy. Our code will be available on Github.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20995v1,2024-12
Efficiently Serving LLM Reasoning Programs with Certaindex,"Yichao Fu, Junda Chen, Siqi Zhu, Zheyu Fu, Zhongdongming Dai, Aurick Qiao, Hao Zhang","The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has unlocked their capabilities in advanced reasoning tasks like mathematical problem-solving, code generation, and legal analysis. Central to this progress are inference-time reasoning algorithms, which refine outputs by exploring multiple solution paths, at the cost of increasing compute demands and response latencies. Existing serving systems fail to adapt to the scaling behaviors of these algorithms or the varying difficulty of queries, leading to inefficient resource use and unmet latency targets.   We present Dynasor, a system that optimizes inference-time compute for LLM reasoning queries. Unlike traditional engines, Dynasor tracks and schedules requests within reasoning queries and uses Certaindex, a proxy that measures statistical reasoning progress based on model certainty, to guide compute allocation dynamically. Dynasor co-adapts scheduling with reasoning progress: it allocates more compute to hard queries, reduces compute for simpler ones, and terminates unpromising queries early, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost. On diverse datasets and algorithms, Dynasor reduces compute by up to 50% in batch processing and sustaining 3.3x higher query rates or 4.7x tighter latency SLOs in online serving.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20993v1,2024-12
GASLITEing the Retrieval: Exploring Vulnerabilities in Dense Embedding-based Search,"Matan Ben-Tov, Mahmood Sharif","Dense embedding-based text retrieval$\unicode{x2013}$retrieval of relevant passages from corpora via deep learning encodings$\unicode{x2013}$has emerged as a powerful method attaining state-of-the-art search results and popularizing the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Still, like other search methods, embedding-based retrieval may be susceptible to search-engine optimization (SEO) attacks, where adversaries promote malicious content by introducing adversarial passages to corpora. To faithfully assess and gain insights into the susceptibility of such systems to SEO, this work proposes the GASLITE attack, a mathematically principled gradient-based search method for generating adversarial passages without relying on the corpus content or modifying the model. Notably, GASLITE's passages (1) carry adversary-chosen information while (2) achieving high retrieval ranking for a selected query distribution when inserted to corpora. We use GASLITE to extensively evaluate retrievers' robustness, testing nine advanced models under varied threat models, while focusing on realistic adversaries targeting queries on a specific concept (e.g., a public figure). We found GASLITE consistently outperformed baselines by $\geq$140% success rate, in all settings. Particularly, adversaries using GASLITE require minimal effort to manipulate search results$\unicode{x2013}$by injecting a negligible amount of adversarial passages ($\leq$0.0001% of the corpus), they could make them visible in the top-10 results for 61-100% of unseen concept-specific queries against most evaluated models. Inspecting variance in retrievers' robustness, we identify key factors that may contribute to models' susceptibility to SEO, including specific properties in the embedding space's geometry.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20953v1,2024-12
DoTA: Weight-Decomposed Tensor Adaptation for Large Language Models,"Xiaolin Hu, Xiang Cheng, Peiyu Liu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Yong Liu","Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduces the computational and memory demands of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by approximating updates with low-rank matrices. However, low-rank approximation in two-dimensional space fails to capture high-dimensional structures within the target matrix. Recently, tensor decomposition methods have been explored for fine-tuning LLMs, leveraging their ability to extract structured information. Yet, these approaches primarily rely on random initialization, and the impact of initialization on tensor adaptation remains underexplored. In this paper, we reveal that random initialization significantly diverges from the validation loss achieved by full fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Weight-Decomposed Tensor Adaptation (DoTA), which leverages the Matrix Product Operator (MPO) decomposition of pre-trained weights for effective initialization in fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, we introduce QDoTA, a quantized version of DoTA designed for 4-bit quantization. Experiments on commonsense and arithmetic reasoning tasks show that DoTA outperforms random initialization methods with fewer parameters. QDoTA further reduces memory consumption and achieves comparable performance to DoTA on commonsense reasoning tasks. We will release our code to support future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20891v1,2024-12
Enhancing Annotated Bibliography Generation with LLM Ensembles,Sergio Bermejo,"This work proposes a novel approach to enhancing annotated bibliography generation through Large Language Model (LLM) ensembles. In particular, multiple LLMs in different roles -- controllable text generation, evaluation, and summarization -- are introduced and validated using a systematic methodology to enhance model performance in scholarly tasks. Output diversity among the ensemble that generates text is obtained using different LLM parameters, followed by an LLM acting as a judge to assess relevance, accuracy, and coherence. Responses selected by several combining strategies are then merged and refined through summarization and redundancy removal techniques. The preliminary experimental validation demonstrates that the combined outputs from the LLM ensemble improve coherence and relevance compared to individual responses, leading to a 38% improvement in annotation quality and a 51% reduction in content redundancy, thus highlighting the potential for automating complex scholarly tasks while maintaining high-quality standards.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20864v1,2024-12
Are LLMs Really Not Knowledgable? Mining the Submerged Knowledge in LLMs' Memory,"Xingjian Tao, Yiwei Wang, Yujun Cai, Zhicheng Yang, Jing Tang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as potential knowledge bases, yet they often struggle with question-answering tasks and are prone to hallucinations. While previous research attributes these issues to knowledge gaps in the model's parameters, our investigation reveals a different phenomenon: LLMs often retain correct knowledge even when generating incorrect answers. Through analysis of model's internal representations, we find that correct answers frequently appear among high-probability tokens despite not being selected as final outputs. Based on this observation, we introduce Hits@k, a new metric to assess knowledge retention independent of expression accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs store significantly more knowledge than their QA performance suggests. Building on these findings, we develop SkipUnsure, a method to improve answer accuracy by leveraging detected but unexpressed knowledge. Experiments on both open-domain and specific-domain datasets show consistent improvements, with accuracy gains of up to 11.8% on DBPedia and 6.3% on IMDB, without requiring model retraining.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20846v1,2024-12
Disentangling Preference Representation and Text Generation for Efficient Individual Preference Alignment,"Jianfei Zhang, Jun Bai, Bei Li, Yanmeng Wang, Rumei Li, Chenghua Lin, Wenge Rong","Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with general human preferences has been proved crucial in improving the interaction quality between LLMs and human. However, human values are inherently diverse among different individuals, making it insufficient to align LLMs solely with general preferences. To address this, personalizing LLMs according to individual feedback emerges as a promising solution. Nonetheless, this approach presents challenges in terms of the efficiency of alignment algorithms. In this work, we introduce a flexible paradigm for individual preference alignment. Our method fundamentally improves efficiency by disentangling preference representation from text generation in LLMs. We validate our approach across multiple text generation tasks and demonstrate that it can produce aligned quality as well as or better than PEFT-based methods, while reducing additional training time for each new individual preference by $80\%$ to $90\%$ in comparison with them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20834v1,2024-12
Enhancing Multimodal Emotion Recognition through Multi-Granularity Cross-Modal Alignment,"Xuechen Wang, Shiwan Zhao, Haoqin Sun, Hui Wang, Jiaming Zhou, Yong Qin","Multimodal emotion recognition (MER), leveraging speech and text, has emerged as a pivotal domain within human-computer interaction, demanding sophisticated methods for effective multimodal integration. The challenge of aligning features across these modalities is significant, with most existing approaches adopting a singular alignment strategy. Such a narrow focus not only limits model performance but also fails to address the complexity and ambiguity inherent in emotional expressions. In response, this paper introduces a Multi-Granularity Cross-Modal Alignment (MGCMA) framework, distinguished by its comprehensive approach encompassing distribution-based, instance-based, and token-based alignment modules. This framework enables a multi-level perception of emotional information across modalities. Our experiments on IEMOCAP demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20821v1,2024-12
Attributing Culture-Conditioned Generations to Pretraining Corpora,"Huihan Li, Arnav Goel, Keyu He, Xiang Ren","In open-ended generative tasks like narrative writing or dialogue, large language models often exhibit cultural biases, showing limited knowledge and generating templated outputs for less prevalent cultures. Recent works show that these biases may stem from uneven cultural representation in pretraining corpora. This work investigates how pretraining leads to biased culture-conditioned generations by analyzing how models associate entities with cultures based on pretraining data patterns. We propose the MEMOed framework (MEMOrization from pretraining document) to determine whether a generation for a culture arises from memorization. Using MEMOed on culture-conditioned generations about food and clothing for 110 cultures, we find that high-frequency cultures in pretraining data yield more generations with memorized symbols, while some low-frequency cultures produce none. Additionally, the model favors generating entities with extraordinarily high frequency regardless of the conditioned culture, reflecting biases toward frequent pretraining terms irrespective of relevance. We hope that the MEMOed framework and our insights will inspire more works on attributing model performance on pretraining data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20760v1,2024-12
Depression and Anxiety Prediction Using Deep Language Models and Transfer Learning,"Tomasz Rutowski, Elizabeth Shriberg, Amir Harati, Yang Lu, Piotr Chlebek, Ricardo Oliveira","Digital screening and monitoring applications can aid providers in the management of behavioral health conditions. We explore deep language models for detecting depression, anxiety, and their co-occurrence from conversational speech collected during 16k user interactions with an application. Labels come from PHQ-8 and GAD-7 results also collected by the application. We find that results for binary classification range from 0.86 to 0.79 AUC, depending on condition and co-occurrence. Best performance is achieved when a user has either both or neither condition, and we show that this result is not attributable to data skew. Finally, we find evidence suggesting that underlying word sequence cues may be more salient for depression than for anxiety.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20741v1,2024-12
HUNYUANPROVER: A Scalable Data Synthesis Framework and Guided Tree Search for Automated Theorem Proving,"Yang Li, Dong Du, Linfeng Song, Chen Li, Weikang Wang, Tao Yang, Haitao Mi","We introduce HunyuanProver, an language model finetuned from the Hunyuan 7B for interactive automatic theorem proving with LEAN4. To alleviate the data sparsity issue, we design a scalable framework to iterative synthesize data with low cost. Besides, guided tree search algorithms are designed to enable effective ``system 2 thinking`` of the prover. HunyuanProver achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances on major benchmarks. Specifically, it achieves a pass of 68.4% on the miniF2F-test compared to 65.9%, the current SOTA results. It proves 4 IMO statements (imo_1960_p2, imo_1962_p2}, imo_1964_p2 and imo_1983_p6) in miniF2F-test. To benefit the community, we will open-source a dataset of 30k synthesized instances, where each instance contains the original question in natural language, the converted statement by autoformalization, and the proof by HunyuanProver.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20735v2,2024-12
ChartAdapter: Large Vision-Language Model for Chart Summarization,"Peixin Xu, Yujuan Ding, Wenqi Fan","Chart summarization, which focuses on extracting key information from charts and interpreting it in natural language, is crucial for generating and delivering insights through effective and accessible data analysis. Traditional methods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stage pipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual and textual information. In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods are more dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, while ignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges. To address these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweight transformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textual summaries. ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicit semantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector to enhance vision-to-language generative learning. By integrating ChartAdapter with an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization. To further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchical training procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated for chart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples. Experimental results on the standard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generating high-quality chart summaries. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components in ChartAdapter. This work highlights the potential of tailored LLM-based approaches to advance chart understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20715v1,2024-12
UBER: Uncertainty-Based Evolution with Large Language Models for Automatic Heuristic Design,"Zijie Chen, Zhanchao Zhou, Yu Lu, Renjun Xu, Lili Pan, Zhenzhong Lan","NP-hard problem-solving traditionally relies on heuristics, but manually crafting effective heuristics for complex problems remains challenging. While recent work like FunSearch has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged for heuristic design in evolutionary algorithm (EA) frameworks, their potential is not fully realized due to its deficiency in exploitation and exploration. We present UBER (Uncertainty-Based Evolution for Refinement), a method that enhances LLM+EA methods for automatic heuristic design by integrating uncertainty on top of the FunSearch framework. UBER introduces two key innovations: an Uncertainty-Inclusive Evolution Process (UIEP) for adaptive exploration-exploitation balance, and a principled Uncertainty-Inclusive Island Reset (UIIS) strategy for maintaining population diversity. Through extensive experiments on challenging NP-complete problems, UBER demonstrates significant improvements over FunSearch. Our work provides a new direction for the synergy of LLMs and EA, advancing the field of automatic heuristic design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20694v1,2024-12
Position Information Emerges in Causal Transformers Without Positional Encodings via Similarity of Nearby Embeddings,"Chunsheng Zuo, Pavel Guerzhoy, Michael Guerzhoy","Transformers with causal attention can solve tasks that require positional information without using positional encodings. In this work, we propose and investigate a new hypothesis about how positional information can be stored without using explicit positional encoding. We observe that nearby embeddings are more similar to each other than faraway embeddings, allowing the transformer to potentially reconstruct the positions of tokens. We show that this pattern can occur in both the trained and the randomly initialized Transformer models with causal attention and no positional encodings over a common range of hyperparameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00073v1,2024-12
Align Attention Heads Before Merging Them: An Effective Way for Converting MHA to GQA,"Qingyun Jin, Xiaohui Song, Feng Zhou, Zengchang Qin","Large language models have been shown to perform well on a variety of natural language processing problems. However, as the model size and the input sequence's length increase, the rapid increase of KV Cache significantly slows down inference speed. Therefore GQA model, as an alternative to MHA model, has been widely introduced into LLMs. In this work, we propose a low-cost method for pruning MHA models into GQA models with any compression ratio of key-value heads. Our method is based on $\mathit{L_0}$ masks to gradually remove redundant parameters. In addition, we apply orthogonal transformations to attention heads without changing the model to increase similarity between attention heads before pruning training, in order to further improve performance of the model. Our method can be compatible with rotary position embedding (RoPE), which means the model after training can be fully adapted to the mainstream standard GQA framework. Experiments demonstrate that our strategy can compress up to 87.5% of key-value heads of the LLaMA2-7B model without too much performance degradation, just achieved through supervised fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20677v1,2024-12
Knowledge Editing for Large Language Model with Knowledge Neuronal Ensemble,"Yongchang Li, Yujin Zhu, Tao Yan, Shijian Fan, Gang Wu, Liang Xu","As real-world knowledge is constantly evolving, ensuring the timeliness and accuracy of a model's knowledge is crucial. This has made knowledge editing in large language models increasingly important. However, existing knowledge editing methods face several challenges, including parameter localization coupling, imprecise localization, and a lack of dynamic interaction across layers. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge editing method called Knowledge Neuronal Ensemble (KNE). A knowledge neuronal ensemble represents a group of neurons encoding specific knowledge, thus mitigating the issue of frequent parameter modification caused by coupling in parameter localization. The KNE method enhances the precision and accuracy of parameter localization by computing gradient attribution scores for each parameter at each layer. During the editing process, only the gradients and losses associated with the knowledge neuronal ensemble are computed, with error backpropagation performed accordingly, ensuring dynamic interaction and collaborative updates among parameters. Experimental results on three widely used knowledge editing datasets show that the KNE method significantly improves the accuracy of knowledge editing and achieves, or even exceeds, the performance of the best baseline methods in portability and locality metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20637v1,2024-12
NLP-based Regulatory Compliance -- Using GPT 4.0 to Decode Regulatory Documents,"Bimal Kumar, Dmitri Roussinov","Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4.0 have shown significant promise in addressing the semantic complexities of regulatory documents, particularly in detecting inconsistencies and contradictions. This study evaluates GPT-4.0's ability to identify conflicts within regulatory requirements by analyzing a curated corpus with artificially injected ambiguities and contradictions, designed in collaboration with architects and compliance engineers. Using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score, the experiment demonstrates GPT-4.0's effectiveness in detecting inconsistencies, with findings validated by human experts. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance regulatory compliance processes, though further testing with larger datasets and domain-specific fine-tuning is needed to maximize accuracy and practical applicability. Future work will explore automated conflict resolution and real-world implementation through pilot projects with industry partners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20602v1,2024-12
GliLem: Leveraging GliNER for Contextualized Lemmatization in Estonian,"Aleksei Dorkin, Kairit Sirts","We present GliLem -- a novel hybrid lemmatization system for Estonian that enhances the highly accurate rule-based morphological analyzer Vabamorf with an external disambiguation module based on GliNER -- an open vocabulary NER model that is able to match text spans with text labels in natural language. We leverage the flexibility of a pre-trained GliNER model to improve the lemmatization accuracy of Vabamorf by 10% compared to its original disambiguation module and achieve an improvement over the token classification-based baseline. To measure the impact of improvements in lemmatization accuracy on the information retrieval downstream task, we first created an information retrieval dataset for Estonian by automatically translating the DBpedia-Entity dataset from English. We benchmark several token normalization approaches, including lemmatization, on the created dataset using the BM25 algorithm. We observe a substantial improvement in IR metrics when using lemmatization over simplistic stemming. The benefits of improving lemma disambiguation accuracy manifest in small but consistent improvement in the IR recall measure, especially in the setting of high k.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20597v2,2024-12
Controlling Out-of-Domain Gaps in LLMs for Genre Classification and Generated Text Detection,"Dmitri Roussinov, Serge Sharoff, Nadezhda Puchnina","This study demonstrates that the modern generation of Large Language Models (LLMs, such as GPT-4) suffers from the same out-of-domain (OOD) performance gap observed in prior research on pre-trained Language Models (PLMs, such as BERT). We demonstrate this across two non-topical classification tasks: 1) genre classification and 2) generated text detection. Our results show that when demonstration examples for In-Context Learning (ICL) come from one domain (e.g., travel) and the system is tested on another domain (e.g., history), classification performance declines significantly.   To address this, we introduce a method that controls which predictive indicators are used and which are excluded during classification. For the two tasks studied here, this ensures that topical features are omitted, while the model is guided to focus on stylistic rather than content-based attributes. This approach reduces the OOD gap by up to 20 percentage points in a few-shot setup. Straightforward Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, used as the baseline, prove insufficient, while our approach consistently enhances domain transfer performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20595v1,2024-12
Towards Neural No-Resource Language Translation: A Comparative Evaluation of Approaches,Madhavendra Thakur,"No-resource languages - those with minimal or no digital representation - pose unique challenges for machine translation (MT). Unlike low-resource languages, which rely on limited but existent corpora, no-resource languages often have fewer than 100 sentences available for training. This work explores the problem of no-resource translation through three distinct workflows: fine-tuning of translation-specific models, in-context learning with large language models (LLMs) using chain-of-reasoning prompting, and direct prompting without reasoning. Using Owens Valley Paiute as a case study, we demonstrate that no-resource translation demands fundamentally different approaches from low-resource scenarios, as traditional approaches to machine translation, such as those that work for low-resource languages, fail. Empirical results reveal that, although traditional approaches fail, the in-context learning capabilities of general-purpose large language models enable no-resource language translation that outperforms low-resource translation approaches and rivals human translations (BLEU 0.45-0.6); specifically, chain-of-reasoning prompting outperforms other methods for larger corpora, while direct prompting exhibits advantages in smaller datasets. As these approaches are language-agnostic, they have potential to be generalized to translation tasks from a wide variety of no-resource languages without expert input. These findings establish no-resource translation as a distinct paradigm requiring innovative solutions, providing practical and theoretical insights for language preservation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20584v1,2024-12
Counterfactual Samples Constructing and Training for Commonsense Statements Estimation,"Chong Liu, Zaiwen Feng, Lin Liu, Zhenyun Deng, Jiuyong Li, Ruifang Zhai, Debo Cheng, Li Qin","Plausibility Estimation (PE) plays a crucial role for enabling language models to objectively comprehend the real world. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in PE tasks but sometimes produce trivial commonsense errors due to the complexity of commonsense knowledge. They lack two key traits of an ideal PE model: a) Language-explainable: relying on critical word segments for decisions, and b) Commonsense-sensitive: detecting subtle linguistic variations in commonsense. To address these issues, we propose a novel model-agnostic method, referred to as Commonsense Counterfactual Samples Generating (CCSG). By training PE models with CCSG, we encourage them to focus on critical words, thereby enhancing both their language-explainable and commonsense-sensitive capabilities. Specifically, CCSG generates counterfactual samples by strategically replacing key words and introducing low-level dropout within sentences. These counterfactual samples are then incorporated into a sentence-level contrastive training framework to further enhance the model's learning process. Experimental results across nine diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CCSG in addressing commonsense reasoning challenges, with our CCSG method showing 3.07% improvement against the SOTA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20563v1,2024-12
ICLR: In-Context Learning of Representations,"Core Francisco Park, Andrew Lee, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Yongyi Yang, Maya Okawa, Kento Nishi, Martin Wattenberg, Hidenori Tanaka","Recent work has demonstrated that semantics specified by pretraining data influence how representations of different concepts are organized in a large language model (LLM). However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy ""graph tracing"" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00070v1,2024-12
The Impact of Prompt Programming on Function-Level Code Generation,"Ranim Khojah, Francisco Gomes de Oliveira Neto, Mazen Mohamad, Philipp Leitner","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by software engineers for code generation. However, limitations of LLMs such as irrelevant or incorrect code have highlighted the need for prompt programming (or prompt engineering) where engineers apply specific prompt techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought or input-output examples) to improve the generated code. Despite this, the impact of different prompt techniques -- and their combinations -- on code generation remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce CodePromptEval, a dataset of 7072 prompts designed to evaluate five prompt techniques (few-shot, persona, chain-of-thought, function signature, list of packages) and their effect on the correctness, similarity, and quality of complete functions generated by three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama3, and Mistral). Our findings show that while certain prompt techniques significantly influence the generated code, combining multiple techniques does not necessarily improve the outcome. Additionally, we observed a trade-off between correctness and quality when using prompt techniques. Our dataset and replication package enable future research on improving LLM-generated code and evaluating new prompt techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20545v1,2024-12
Adversarial Negotiation Dynamics in Generative Language Models,"Arinbjörn Kolbeinsson, Benedikt Kolbeinsson","Generative language models are increasingly used for contract drafting and enhancement, creating a scenario where competing parties deploy different language models against each other. This introduces not only a game-theory challenge but also significant concerns related to AI safety and security, as the language model employed by the opposing party can be unknown. These competitive interactions can be seen as adversarial testing grounds, where models are effectively red-teamed to expose vulnerabilities such as generating biased, harmful or legally problematic text. Despite the importance of these challenges, the competitive robustness and safety of these models in adversarial settings remain poorly understood. In this small study, we approach this problem by evaluating the performance and vulnerabilities of major open-source language models in head-to-head competitions, simulating real-world contract negotiations. We further explore how these adversarial interactions can reveal potential risks, informing the development of more secure and reliable models. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on AI safety, offering insights into model selection and optimisation in competitive legal contexts and providing actionable strategies for mitigating risks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00069v1,2024-12
SAFE-MEME: Structured Reasoning Framework for Robust Hate Speech Detection in Memes,"Palash Nandi, Shivam Sharma, Tanmoy Chakraborty","Memes act as cryptic tools for sharing sensitive ideas, often requiring contextual knowledge to interpret. This makes moderating multimodal memes challenging, as existing works either lack high-quality datasets on nuanced hate categories or rely on low-quality social media visuals. Here, we curate two novel multimodal hate speech datasets, MHS and MHS-Con, that capture fine-grained hateful abstractions in regular and confounding scenarios, respectively. We benchmark these datasets against several competing baselines. Furthermore, we introduce SAFE-MEME (Structured reAsoning FramEwork), a novel multimodal Chain-of-Thought-based framework employing Q&A-style reasoning (SAFE-MEME-QA) and hierarchical categorization (SAFE-MEME-H) to enable robust hate speech detection in memes. SAFE-MEME-QA outperforms existing baselines, achieving an average improvement of approximately 5% and 4% on MHS and MHS-Con, respectively. In comparison, SAFE-MEME-H achieves an average improvement of 6% in MHS while outperforming only multimodal baselines in MHS-Con. We show that fine-tuning a single-layer adapter within SAFE-MEME-H outperforms fully fine-tuned models in regular fine-grained hateful meme detection. However, the fully fine-tuning approach with a Q&A setup is more effective for handling confounding cases. We also systematically examine the error cases, offering valuable insights into the robustness and limitations of the proposed structured reasoning framework for analyzing hateful memes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20541v1,2024-12
On Adversarial Robustness of Language Models in Transfer Learning,"Bohdan Turbal, Anastasiia Mazur, Jiaxu Zhao, Mykola Pechenizkiy","We investigate the adversarial robustness of LLMs in transfer learning scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (MBIB Hate Speech, MBIB Political Bias, MBIB Gender Bias) and various model architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, Gemma, Phi), we reveal that transfer learning, while improving standard performance metrics, often leads to increased vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Our findings demonstrate that larger models exhibit greater resilience to this phenomenon, suggesting a complex interplay between model size, architecture, and adaptation methods. Our work highlights the crucial need for considering adversarial robustness in transfer learning scenarios and provides insights into maintaining model security without compromising performance. These findings have significant implications for the development and deployment of LLMs in real-world applications where both performance and robustness are paramount.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00066v1,2024-12
ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video Understanding,"Xiao Wang, Qingyi Si, Jianlong Wu, Shiyu Zhu, Li Cao, Liqiang Nie","Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

Cut the Deadwood Out: Post-Training Model Purification with Selective Module Substitution,"Yao Tong, Weijun Li, Xuanli He, Haolan Zhan, Qiongkai Xu","The success of DNNs often depends on training with large-scale datasets, but building such datasets is both expensive and challenging. Consequently, public datasets from open-source platforms like HuggingFace have become popular, posing significant risks of data poisoning attacks. Existing backdoor defenses in NLP primarily focus on identifying and removing poisoned samples; however, purifying a backdoored model with these sample-cleaning approaches typically requires expensive retraining. Therefore, we propose Greedy Module Substitution (GMS), which identifies and substitutes ''deadwood'' modules (i.e., components critical to backdoor pathways) in a backdoored model to purify it. Our method relaxes the common dependency of prior model purification methods on clean datasets or clean auxiliary models. When applied to RoBERTa-large under backdoor attacks, GMS demonstrates strong effectiveness across various settings, particularly against widely recognized challenging attacks like LWS, achieving a post-purification attack success rate (ASR) of 9.7% on SST-2 compared to 58.8% for the best baseline approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20476v1,2024-12
Is Your Image a Good Storyteller?,"Xiujie Song, Xiaoyi Pang, Haifeng Tang, Mengyue Wu, Kenny Q. Zhu","Quantifying image complexity at the entity level is straightforward, but the assessment of semantic complexity has been largely overlooked. In fact, there are differences in semantic complexity across images. Images with richer semantics can tell vivid and engaging stories and offer a wide range of application scenarios. For example, the Cookie Theft picture is such a kind of image and is widely used to assess human language and cognitive abilities due to its higher semantic complexity. Additionally, semantically rich images can benefit the development of vision models, as images with limited semantics are becoming less challenging for them. However, such images are scarce, highlighting the need for a greater number of them. For instance, there is a need for more images like Cookie Theft to cater to people from different cultural backgrounds and eras. Assessing semantic complexity requires human experts and empirical evidence. Automatic evaluation of how semantically rich an image will be the first step of mining or generating more images with rich semantics, and benefit human cognitive assessment, Artificial Intelligence, and various other applications. In response, we propose the Image Semantic Assessment (ISA) task to address this problem. We introduce the first ISA dataset and a novel method that leverages language to solve this vision problem. Experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our data and code are available at: https://github.com/xiujiesong/ISA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01982v1,2024-12
Utilizing Multimodal Data for Edge Case Robust Call-sign Recognition and Understanding,"Alexander Blatt, Dietrich Klakow","Operational machine-learning based assistant systems must be robust in a wide range of scenarios. This hold especially true for the air-traffic control (ATC) domain. The robustness of an architecture is particularly evident in edge cases, such as high word error rate (WER) transcripts resulting from noisy ATC recordings or partial transcripts due to clipped recordings. To increase the edge-case robustness of call-sign recognition and understanding (CRU), a core tasks in ATC speech processing, we propose the multimodal call-sign-command recovery model (CCR). The CCR architecture leads to an increase in the edge case performance of up to 15%. We demonstrate this on our second proposed architecture, CallSBERT. A CRU model that has less parameters, can be fine-tuned noticeably faster and is more robust during fine-tuning than the state of the art for CRU. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing for edge cases leads to a significantly higher accuracy across a wide operational range.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20467v1,2024-12
"Enhancing Entertainment Translation for Indian Languages using Adaptive Context, Style and LLMs","Pratik Rakesh Singh, Mohammadi Zaki, Pankaj Wasnik","We address the challenging task of neural machine translation (NMT) in the entertainment domain, where the objective is to automatically translate a given dialogue from a source language content to a target language. This task has various applications, particularly in automatic dubbing, subtitling, and other content localization tasks, enabling source content to reach a wider audience. Traditional NMT systems typically translate individual sentences in isolation, without facilitating knowledge transfer of crucial elements such as the context and style from previously encountered sentences. In this work, we emphasize the significance of these fundamental aspects in producing pertinent and captivating translations. We demonstrate their significance through several examples and propose a novel framework for entertainment translation, which, to our knowledge, is the first of its kind. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm to estimate the context and style of the current session and use these estimations to generate a prompt that guides a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate high-quality translations. Our method is both language and LLM-agnostic, making it a general-purpose tool. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through various numerical studies and observe significant improvement in the COMET scores over various state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, our proposed method consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in terms of win-ratio.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20440v1,2024-12
Integrating Natural Language Processing Techniques of Text Mining Into Financial System: Applications and Limitations,"Denisa Millo, Blerina Vika, Nevila Baci","The financial sector, a pivotal force in economic development, increasingly uses the intelligent technologies such as natural language processing to enhance data processing and insight extraction. This research paper through a review process of the time span of 2018-2023 explores the use of text mining as natural language processing techniques in various components of the financial system including asset pricing, corporate finance, derivatives, risk management, and public finance and highlights the need to address the specific problems in the discussion section. We notice that most of the research materials combined probabilistic with vector-space models, and text-data with numerical ones. The most used technique regarding information processing is the information classification technique and the most used algorithms include the long-short term memory and bidirectional encoder models.

Multi-Objective Large Language Model Unlearning,"Zibin Pan, Shuwen Zhang, Yuesheng Zheng, Chi Li, Yuheng Cheng, Junhua Zhao","Machine unlearning in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has attracted great attention recently, which aims to effectively eliminate undesirable behaviors from LLMs without full retraining from scratch. In this paper, we explore the Gradient Ascent (GA) approach in LLM unlearning, which is a proactive way to decrease the prediction probability of the model on the target data in order to remove their influence. We analyze two challenges that render the process impractical: gradient explosion and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Objective Large Language Model Unlearning (MOLLM) algorithm. We first formulate LLM unlearning as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the cross-entropy loss is modified to the unlearning version to overcome the gradient explosion issue. A common descent update direction is then calculated, which enables the model to forget the target data while preserving the utility of the LLM. Our empirical results verify that MoLLM outperforms the SOTA GA-based LLM unlearning methods in terms of unlearning effect and model utility preservation.

To address this challenge, we employ a combination of neural network architectures and traditional machine learning algorithms. These methods are utilized to classify and identify potential cyber threats within the Telegram data. Additionally, sentiment analysis and entity recognition techniques are incorporated to provide deeper insights into the nature and context of the communicated information. The study evaluates the effectiveness of each method in detecting and categorizing cyber threats, comparing their performance and identifying areas for improvement.

Natural Language Fine-Tuning,"Jia Liu, Yue Wang, Zhiqi Lin, Min Chen, Yixue Hao, Long Hu","Large language model fine-tuning techniques typically depend on extensive labeled data, external guidance, and feedback, such as human alignment, scalar rewards, and demonstration. However, in practical application, the scarcity of specific knowledge poses unprecedented challenges to existing fine-tuning techniques. In this paper, focusing on fine-tuning tasks in specific domains with limited data, we introduce Natural Language Fine-Tuning (NLFT), which utilizes natural language for fine-tuning for the first time. By leveraging the strong language comprehension capability of the target LM, NLFT attaches the guidance of natural language to the token-level outputs. Then, saliency tokens are identified with calculated probabilities. Since linguistic information is effectively utilized in NLFT, our proposed method significantly reduces training costs. It markedly enhances training efficiency, comprehensively outperforming reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms in accuracy, time-saving, and resource conservation. Additionally, on the macro level, NLFT can be viewed as a token-level fine-grained optimization of SFT, thereby efficiently replacing the SFT process without the need for warm-up (as opposed to ReFT requiring multiple rounds of warm-up with SFT). Compared to SFT, NLFT does not increase the algorithmic complexity, maintaining O(n). Extensive experiments on the GSM8K dataset demonstrate that NLFT, with only 50 data instances, achieves an accuracy increase that exceeds SFT by 219%. Compared to ReFT, the time complexity and space complexity of NLFT are reduced by 78.27% and 92.24%, respectively. The superior technique of NLFT is paving the way for the deployment of various innovative LLM fine-tuning applications when resources are limited at network edges.

LLM2: Let Large Language Models Harness System 2 Reasoning,"Cheng Yang, Chufan Shi, Siheng Li, Bo Shui, Yujiu Yang, Wai Lam","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across a myriad of tasks, yet they occasionally yield undesirable outputs. We posit that these limitations are rooted in the foundational autoregressive architecture of LLMs, which inherently lacks mechanisms for differentiating between desirable and undesirable results. Drawing inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce LLM2, a novel framework that combines an LLM (System 1) with a process-based verifier (System 2). Within LLM2, the LLM is responsible for generating plausible candidates, while the verifier provides timely process-based feedback to distinguish desirable and undesirable outputs. The verifier is trained with a pairwise comparison loss on synthetic process-supervision data generated through our token quality exploration strategy. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks substantiate the efficacy of LLM2, exemplified by an accuracy enhancement from 50.3 to 57.8 (+7.5) for Llama3-1B on GSM8K. Furthermore, when combined with self-consistency, LLM2 achieves additional improvements, boosting major@20 accuracy from 56.2 to 70.2 (+14.0).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20372v1,2024-12

ELECTRA and GPT-4o: Cost-Effective Partners for Sentiment Analysis,James P. Beno,"Bidirectional transformers excel at sentiment analysis, and Large Language Models (LLM) are effective zero-shot learners. Might they perform better as a team? This paper explores collaborative approaches between ELECTRA and GPT-4o for three-way sentiment classification. We fine-tuned (FT) four models (ELECTRA Base/Large, GPT-4o/4o-mini) using a mix of reviews from Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) and DynaSent. We provided input from ELECTRA to GPT as: predicted label, probabilities, and retrieved examples. Sharing ELECTRA Base FT predictions with GPT-4o-mini significantly improved performance over either model alone (82.74 macro F1 vs. 79.29 ELECTRA Base FT, 79.52 GPT-4o-mini) and yielded the lowest cost/performance ratio (\$0.12/F1 point). However, when GPT models were fine-tuned, including predictions decreased performance. GPT-4o FT-M was the top performer (86.99), with GPT-4o-mini FT close behind (86.77) at much less cost (\$0.38 vs. \$1.59/F1 point). Our results show that augmenting prompts with predictions from fine-tuned encoders is an efficient way to boost performance, and a fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini is nearly as good as GPT-4o FT at 76% less cost. Both are affordable options for projects with limited resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00062v1,2024-12
HindiLLM: Large Language Model for Hindi,"Sanjay Chouhan, Shubha Brata Nath, Aparajita Dutta","The advancements in the Large Language Model (LLM) have helped in solving several problems related to language processing. Most of the researches have focused on the English language only, because of its popularity and abundance on the internet. However, a high-performance language model for Hindi and other Indic languages is lacking in the literature. In this work, we have pre-trained two autoregressive LLM models for the Hindi language, namely HindiLLM-Small and HindiLLM-Medium. We use a two-step process comprising unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. First, we create a large and high-quality text corpus for unsupervised pre-training. Next, we train a Byte-Pair Encoding, named HindiLLM tokenizer, using the pre-training text data. We then perform training on the unlabeled data, known as the pre-training step, to get the HindiLLM base models. Furthermore, we perform fine-tuning of the HindiLLM base models for different tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, natural language inference, and multiple choice question-answer on popular labeled datasets to measure the real-world performance. The evaluation shows that the HindiLLM-based fine-tuned models outperform several models in most of the language related tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20357v1,2024-12
Understanding the Impact of Confidence in Retrieval Augmented Generation: A Case Study in the Medical Domain,"Shintaro Ozaki, Yuta Kato, Siyuan Feng, Masayo Tomita, Kazuki Hayashi, Ryoma Obara, Masafumi Oyamada, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) complements the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external information to enhance response accuracy for queries. This approach is widely applied in several fields by taking its advantage of injecting the most up-to-date information, and researchers are focusing on understanding and improving this aspect to unlock the full potential of RAG in such high-stakes applications. However, despite the potential of RAG to address these needs, the mechanisms behind the confidence levels of its outputs remain underexplored, although the confidence of information is very critical in some domains, such as finance, healthcare, and medicine. Our study focuses the impact of RAG on confidence within the medical domain under various configurations and models. We evaluate confidence by treating the model's predicted probability as its output and calculating Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Adaptive Calibration Error (ACE) scores based on the probabilities and accuracy. In addition, we analyze whether the order of retrieved documents within prompts calibrates the confidence. Our findings reveal large variation in confidence and accuracy depending on the model, settings, and the format of input prompts.

No Preference Left Behind: Group Distributional Preference Optimization,"Binwei Yao, Zefan Cai, Yun-Shiuan Chuang, Shanglin Yang, Ming Jiang, Diyi Yang, Junjie Hu","Preferences within a group of people are not uniform but follow a distribution. While existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) attempt to steer models to reflect human preferences, they struggle to capture the distributional pluralistic preferences within a group. These methods often skew toward dominant preferences, overlooking the diversity of opinions, especially when conflicting preferences arise. To address this issue, we propose Group Distribution Preference Optimization (GDPO), a novel framework that aligns language models with the distribution of preferences within a group by incorporating the concept of beliefs that shape individual preferences. GDPO calibrates a language model using statistical estimation of the group's belief distribution and aligns the model with belief-conditioned preferences, offering a more inclusive alignment framework than traditional methods. In experiments using both synthetic controllable opinion generation and real-world movie review datasets, we show that DPO fails to align with the targeted belief distributions, while GDPO consistently reduces this alignment gap during training. Moreover, our evaluation metrics demonstrate that GDPO outperforms existing approaches in aligning with group distributional preferences, marking a significant advance in pluralistic alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20299v1,2024-12
Scoring with Large Language Models: A Study on Measuring Empathy of Responses in Dialogues,"Henry J. Xie, Jinghan Zhang, Xinhao Zhang, Kunpeng Liu","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly more powerful in their ability to complete complex tasks. One such task in which LLMs are often employed is scoring, i.e., assigning a numerical value from a certain scale to a subject. In this paper, we strive to understand how LLMs score, specifically in the context of empathy scoring. We develop a novel and comprehensive framework for investigating how effective LLMs are at measuring and scoring empathy of responses in dialogues, and what methods can be employed to deepen our understanding of LLM scoring. Our strategy is to approximate the performance of state-of-the-art and fine-tuned LLMs with explicit and explainable features. We train classifiers using various features of dialogues including embeddings, the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Code, a set of explicit subfactors of empathy as proposed by LLMs, and a combination of the MITI Code and the explicit subfactors. Our results show that when only using embeddings, it is possible to achieve performance close to that of generic LLMs, and when utilizing the MITI Code and explicit subfactors scored by an LLM, the trained classifiers can closely match the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We employ feature selection methods to derive the most crucial features in the process of empathy scoring. Our work provides a new perspective toward understanding LLM empathy scoring and helps the LLM community explore the potential of LLM scoring in social science studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20264v1,2024-12
Large Language Models for Mathematical Analysis,"Ziye Chen, Hao Qi","Mathematical problem-solving is a key field in artificial intelligence (AI) and a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

We developed the DEMI-MathAnalysis dataset, comprising proof-based problems from mathematical analysis topics such as Sequences and Limits, Infinite Series, and Convex Functions. We also designed a guiding framework to rigorously enhance LLMs' ability to solve these problems. Through fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset and employing our framework, we observed significant improvements in their capability to generate logical, complete, and elegant proofs.

ComparisonQA: Evaluating Factuality Robustness of LLMs Through Knowledge Frequency Control and Uncertainty,"Qing Zong, Zhaowei Wang, Tianshi Zheng, Xiyu Ren, Yangqiu Song","The rapid development of LLMs has sparked extensive research into their factual knowledge. Current works claim that LLMs fall short on questions requiring less frequent knowledge. However, their proof is incomplete since they only study the influence of entity frequency, which can not fully represent knowledge frequency. So we introduce ComparisonQA benchmark, containing 283K abstract questions, each instantiated by a pair of high-frequency and low-frequency entities. It ensures a controllable comparison because the difference of knowledge frequency between such a pair is only related to entity frequency. In addition, to avoid possible semantic shortcuts, which is a severe problem of current LLMs study, we design a two-round method for knowledge robustness measurement utilizing both correctness and uncertainty. Experiments reveal that LLMs exhibit particularly low robustness regarding low-frequency knowledge, and GPT-4o is even the worst under this measurement. Besides, we introduce an automatic method to filter out questions with low-quality and shortcuts to form ComparisonQA-Hard. We find that uncertainty effectively identifies such questions while maintaining the data size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20251v1,2024-12

PANAS and PHQ-9 were used to assess current mood and depression, respectively. Participants' emotional reactivity was recorded on a valence and arousal scale against the affective speech audio presented in a sequence. No significant differences between the depression and no-depression groups were observed for any of the emotional stimuli, except the audio file depicting neutral emotion. Significantly higher PANAS scores by the depression than the no-depression group indicate the impact of pre-disposed mood on the current mood status.

Efficient Multi-Agent Collaboration with Tool Use for Online Planning in Complex Table Question Answering,"Wei Zhou, Mohsen Mesgar, Annemarie Friedrich, Heike Adel","Complex table question answering (TQA) aims to answer questions that require complex reasoning, such as multi-step or multi-category reasoning, over data represented in tabular form. Previous approaches demonstrated notable performance by leveraging either closed-source large language models (LLMs) or fine-tuned open-weight LLMs. However, fine-tuning LLMs requires high-quality training data, which is costly to obtain, and utilizing closed-source LLMs poses accessibility challenges and leads to reproducibility issues. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent Collaboration with Tool use (MACT), a framework that requires neither closed-source models nor fine-tuning. In MACT, a planning agent and a coding agent that also make use of tools collaborate to answer questions. Our experiments on four TQA benchmarks show that MACT outperforms previous SoTA systems on three out of four benchmarks and that it performs comparably to the larger and more expensive closed-source model GPT-4 on two benchmarks, even when using only open-weight models without any fine-tuning.

However, in the field of machine translation (MT) evaluation, current LLM-as-a-judge methods fall short of learned automatic metrics. In this paper, we propose Multidimensional Multi-Agent Debate (M-MAD), a systematic LLM-based multi-agent framework for advanced LLM-as-a-judge MT evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that M-MAD achieves significant advancements by (1) decoupling heuristic MQM criteria into distinct evaluation dimensions for fine-grained assessments; (2) employing multi-agent debates to harness the collaborative reasoning capabilities of LLMs; (3) synthesizing dimension-specific results into a final evaluation judgment to ensure robust and reliable outcomes.

Extract Information from Hybrid Long Documents Leveraging LLMs: A Framework and Dataset,"Chongjian Yue, Xinrun Xu, Xiaojun Ma, Lun Du, Zhiming Ding, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in textual understanding and tabular reasoning tasks. However, their ability to comprehend and analyze hybrid text, containing textual and tabular data, remains unexplored. The hybrid text often appears in the form of hybrid long documents (HLDs), which far exceed the token limit of LLMs. Consequently, we apply an Automated Information Extraction framework (AIE) to enable LLMs to process the HLDs and carry out experiments to analyse four important aspects of information extraction from HLDs. Given the findings: 1) The effective way to select and summarize the useful part of a HLD. 2) An easy table serialization way is enough for LLMs to understand tables. 3) The naive AIE has adaptability in many complex scenarios. 4) The useful prompt engineering to enhance LLMs on HLDs.

On the Compositional Generalization of Multimodal LLMs for Medical Imaging,"Zhenyang Cai, Junying Chen, Rongsheng Wang, Weihong Wang, Yonglin Deng, Dingjie Song, Yize Chen, Zixu Zhang, Benyou Wang","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in the medical field, but their capabilities are often limited by insufficient data in certain medical domains, highlighting the need for understanding what kinds of images can be used by MLLMs for generalization. Current research suggests that multi-task training outperforms single-task as different tasks can benefit each other, but they often overlook the internal relationships within these tasks, providing limited guidance on selecting datasets to enhance specific tasks. To analyze this phenomenon, we attempted to employ compositional generalization (CG)-the ability of models to understand novel combinations by recombining learned elements-as a guiding framework. Since medical images can be precisely defined by Modality, Anatomical area, and Task, naturally providing an environment for exploring CG. Therefore, we assembled 106 medical datasets to create Med-MAT for comprehensive experiments. The experiments confirmed that MLLMs can use CG to understand unseen medical images and identified CG as one of the main drivers of the generalization observed in multi-task training.

LLM-Virus: Evolutionary Jailbreak Attack on Large Language Models,"Miao Yu, Junfeng Fang, Yingjie Zhou, Xing Fan, Kun Wang, Shirui Pan, Qingsong Wen","While safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as the cornerstone for powerful systems such as multi-agent frameworks to solve complex real-world problems, they still suffer from potential adversarial queries, such as jailbreak attacks, which attempt to induce harmful content. Researching attack methods allows us to better understand the limitations of LLM and make trade-offs between helpfulness and safety. However, existing jailbreak attacks are primarily based on opaque optimization techniques (e.g. token-level gradient descent) and heuristic search methods like LLM refinement, which fall short in terms of transparency, transferability, and computational cost. In light of these limitations, we draw inspiration from the evolution and infection processes of biological viruses and propose LLM-Virus, a jailbreak attack method based on evolutionary algorithm, termed evolutionary jailbreak. LLM-Virus treats jailbreak attacks as both an evolutionary and transfer learning problem, utilizing LLMs as heuristic evolutionary operators to ensure high attack efficiency, transferability, and low time cost.

Given that the selection of in-context examples can significantly impact performance, it is crucial to design a proper method to sample the efficient ones. In this paper, we propose STAYKATE, a static-dynamic hybrid selection method that combines the principles of representativeness sampling from active learning with the prevalent retrieval-based approach. The results across three domain-specific datasets indicate that STAYKATE outperforms both the traditional supervised methods and existing selection methods. The enhancement in performance is particularly pronounced for entity types that other methods pose challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20043v1,2024-12
Children's Acquisition of Tail-recursion Sequences: A Review of Locative Recursion and Possessive Recursion as Examples,"Xiaoyi Wang, Chenxi Fu, Caimei Yang, Ziman Zhuang","Recursion is the nature of human natural language. Since Chomsky proposed generative grammar, many scholars have studied recursion either theoretically or empirically. However, by observing children's acquisition of tail recursion sequences, we can verify the nativism of language supported by universal grammar and reveal the cognitive mechanism of human brain. To date, our understanding of children's acquisition path of recursion and influencing factors still remain controversial. This systematic review summarizes the research of tail recursive sequence by taking possessive recursion and locative recursion as examples, focusing on the experimental methods, acquisition paths, and influencing factors of tail recursive sequence. The current behavioural experiments reveal that, the debate about children's performance revolves around: 1) Gradual acquisition or synchronous acquisition. 2) symmetry or asymmetry between the acquisition of locative recursion sequences and possessive recursion sequences. We presume that children can acquire recursion quickly in a short period of time thanks to the language acquisition device, though there are also scholars who believe that a third factor also plays a role.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20033v1,2024-12
BaiJia: A Large-Scale Role-Playing Agent Corpus of Chinese Historical Characters,"Ting Bai, Jiazheng Kang, Jiayang Fan","We introduce a comprehensive large-scale role-playing agent corpus, termed BaiJia, that comprises various Chinese historical characters. This corpus is noteworthy for being the pioneering compilation of low-resource data that can be utilized in large language models (LLMs) to engage in AI-driven historical role-playing agents. BaiJia addresses the challenges in terms of fragmented historical textual records in different forms and modalities, integrating various characters' information, including their biographical, literary, family relations, historical events, and so on. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our BaiJia agent corpus in bolstering the role-playing abilities of various foundational LLMs, and promoting the development and assessment of LLMs in the context of historical role-playing tasks.

AdvAnchor: Enhancing Diffusion Model Unlearning with Adversarial Anchors,"Mengnan Zhao, Lihe Zhang, Xingyi Yang, Tianhang Zheng, Baocai Yin","Security concerns surrounding text-to-image diffusion models have driven researchers to unlearn inappropriate concepts through fine-tuning. Recent fine-tuning methods typically align the prediction distributions of unsafe prompts with those of predefined text anchors. However, these techniques exhibit a considerable performance trade-off between eliminating undesirable concepts and preserving other concepts. In this paper, we systematically analyze the impact of diverse text anchors on unlearning performance. Guided by this analysis, we propose AdvAnchor, a novel approach that generates adversarial anchors to alleviate the trade-off issue. These adversarial anchors are crafted to closely resemble the embeddings of undesirable concepts to maintain overall model performance, while selectively excluding defining attributes of these concepts for effective erasure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdvAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

From Generalist to Specialist: A Survey of Large Language Models for Chemistry,"Yang Han, Ziping Wan, Lu Chen, Kai Yu, Xin Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly transformed our daily life and established a new paradigm in natural language processing (NLP). However, the predominant pretraining of LLMs on extensive web-based texts remains insufficient for advanced scientific discovery, particularly in chemistry. The scarcity of specialized chemistry data, coupled with the complexity of multi-modal data such as 2D graph, 3D structure and spectrum, present distinct challenges. Although several studies have reviewed Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) in chemistry, there is a conspicuous absence of a systematic survey specifically focused on chemistry-oriented LLMs. In this paper, we outline methodologies for incorporating domain-specific chemistry knowledge and multi-modal information into LLMs, we also conceptualize chemistry LLMs as agents using chemistry tools and investigate their potential to accelerate scientific research. Additionally, we conclude the existing benchmarks to evaluate chemistry ability of LLMs. Finally, we critically examine the current challenges and identify promising directions for future research. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to assist researchers in staying at the forefront of developments in chemistry LLMs and to inspire innovative applications in the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19994v1,2024-12
Bridging Context Gaps: Enhancing Comprehension in Long-Form Social Conversations Through Contextualized Excerpts,"Shrestha Mohanty, Sarah Xuan, Jacob Jobraeel, Anurag Kumar, Deb Roy, Jad Kabbara","We focus on enhancing comprehension in small-group recorded conversations, which serve as a medium to bring people together and provide a space for sharing personal stories and experiences on crucial social matters. One way to parse and convey information from these conversations is by sharing highlighted excerpts in subsequent conversations. This can help promote a collective understanding of relevant issues, by highlighting perspectives and experiences to other groups of people who might otherwise be unfamiliar with and thus unable to relate to these experiences. The primary challenge that arises then is that excerpts taken from one conversation and shared in another setting might be missing crucial context or key elements that were previously introduced in the original conversation. This problem is exacerbated when conversations become lengthier and richer in themes and shared experiences. To address this, we explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enrich these excerpts by providing socially relevant context. We present approaches for effective contextualization to improve comprehension, readability, and empathy. We show significant improvements in understanding, as assessed through subjective and objective evaluations. While LLMs can offer valuable context, they struggle with capturing key social aspects. We release the Human-annotated Salient Excerpts (HSE) dataset to support future work. Additionally, we show how context-enriched excerpts can provide more focused and comprehensive conversation summaries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19966v1,2024-12
Seq2Seq Model-Based Chatbot with LSTM and Attention Mechanism for Enhanced User Interaction,"Lamya Benaddi, Charaf Ouaddi, Adnane Souha, Abdeslam Jakimi, Mohamed Rahouti, Mohammed Aledhari, Diogo Oliveira, Brahim Ouchao","A chatbot is an intelligent software application that automates conversations and engages users in natural language through messaging platforms. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots serve various functions, including customer service, information gathering, and casual conversation. Existing virtual assistant chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, demonstrate the potential of AI in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, many current solutions rely on predefined APIs, which can result in vendor lock-in and high costs. To address these challenges, this work proposes a chatbot developed using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an encoder-decoder architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. By avoiding predefined APIs, this approach ensures flexibility and cost-effectiveness. The chatbot is trained, validated, and tested on a dataset specifically curated for the tourism sector in Draa-Tafilalet, Morocco. Key evaluation findings indicate that the proposed Seq2Seq model-based chatbot achieved high accuracies: approximately 99.58% in training, 98.03% in validation, and 94.12% in testing. These results demonstrate the chatbot's effectiveness in providing relevant and coherent responses within the tourism domain, highlighting the potential of specialized AI applications to enhance user experience and satisfaction in niche markets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00049v1,2024-12
Assessing Text Classification Methods for Cyberbullying Detection on Social Media Platforms,"Adamu Gaston Philipo, Doreen Sebastian Sarwatt, Jianguo Ding, Mahmoud Daneshmand, Huansheng Ning","Cyberbullying significantly contributes to mental health issues in communities by negatively impacting the psychology of victims. It is a prevalent problem on social media platforms, necessitating effective, real-time detection and monitoring systems to identify harmful messages. However, current cyberbullying detection systems face challenges related to performance, dataset quality, time efficiency, and computational costs. This research aims to conduct a comparative study by adapting and evaluating existing text classification techniques within the cyberbullying detection domain. The study specifically evaluates the effectiveness and performance of these techniques in identifying cyberbullying instances on social media platforms. It focuses on leveraging and assessing large language models, including BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, DistilBERT, and GPT-2.0, for their suitability in this domain. The results show that BERT strikes a balance between performance, time efficiency, and computational resources: Accuracy of 95%, Precision of 95%, Recall of 95%, F1 Score of 95%, Error Rate of 5%, Inference Time of 0.053 seconds, RAM Usage of 35.28 MB, CPU/GPU Usage of 0.4%, and Energy Consumption of 0.000263 kWh.

Right vs. Right: Can LLMs Make Tough Choices?,"Jiaqing Yuan, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah, Munindar P. Singh","An ethical dilemma describes a choice between two ""right"" options involving conflicting moral values. We present a comprehensive evaluation of how LLMs navigate ethical dilemmas. Specifically, we investigate LLMs on their (1) sensitivity in comprehending ethical dilemmas, (2) consistency in moral value choice, (3) consideration of consequences, and (4) ability to align their responses to a moral value preference explicitly or implicitly specified in a prompt. Drawing inspiration from a leading ethical framework, we construct a dataset comprising 1,730 ethical dilemmas involving four pairs of conflicting values. We evaluate 20 well-known LLMs from six families. Our experiments reveal that: (1) LLMs exhibit pronounced preferences between major value pairs, and prioritize truth over loyalty, community over individual, and long-term over short-term considerations. (2) The larger LLMs tend to support a deontological perspective, maintaining their choices of actions even when negative consequences are specified. (3) Explicit guidelines are more effective in guiding LLMs' moral choice than in-context examples. Lastly, our experiments highlight the limitation of LLMs in comprehending different formulations of ethical dilemmas.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19926v1,2024-12

Evaluate Summarization in Fine-Granularity: Auto Evaluation with LLM,"Dong Yuan, Eti Rastogi, Fen Zhao, Sagar Goyal, Gautam Naik, Sree Prasanna Rajagopal","Due to the exponential growth of information and the need for efficient information consumption the task of summarization has gained paramount importance. Evaluating summarization accurately and objectively presents significant challenges, particularly when dealing with long and unstructured texts rich in content. Existing methods, such as ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and embedding similarities, often yield scores that have low correlation with human judgements and are also not intuitively understandable, making it difficult to gauge the true quality of the summaries. LLMs can mimic human in giving subjective reviews but subjective scores are hard to interpret and justify. They can be easily manipulated by altering the models and the tones of the prompts. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation methodology and tooling designed to address these challenges, providing a more comprehensive, accurate and interpretable assessment of summarization outputs. Our method (SumAutoEval) proposes and evaluates metrics at varying granularity levels, giving objective scores on 4 key dimensions such as completeness, correctness, Alignment and readability. We empirically demonstrate, that SumAutoEval enhances the understanding of output quality with better human correlation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19906v1,2024-12
InfAlign: Inference-aware language model alignment,"Ananth Balashankar, Ziteng Sun, Jonathan Berant, Jacob Eisenstein, Michael Collins, Adrian Hutter, Jong Lee, Chirag Nagpal, Flavien Prost, Aradhana Sinha, Ananda Theertha Suresh, Ahmad Beirami","Language model alignment has become a critical step in training modern generative language models. The goal of alignment is to finetune a reference model such that the win rate of a sample from the aligned model over a sample from the reference model is high, subject to a KL divergence constraint. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. However, the alignment objective does not capture such inference-time decoding procedures. We show that the existing alignment framework is sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. We then modify the alignment objective and propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (IAPO). We prove that for any inference-time decoding algorithm, the optimal solution that optimizes the inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the reference policy is the solution to the typical RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the KL-regularized calibrate-and-transform RL (CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. We particularize our study to two important inference-time strategies: best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, where N responses are sampled from the model and the one with the highest or lowest reward is selected. We propose specific transformations for these strategies and demonstrate that our framework offers significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for language model alignment. Empirically, we outperform baselines that are designed without taking inference-time decoding into consideration by 8-12% and 4-9% on inference-time win rates over the Anthropic helpfulness and harmlessness dialog benchmark datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19792v2,2024-12
Enhancing Whisper's Accuracy and Speed for Indian Languages through Prompt-Tuning and Tokenization,"Kumud Tripathi, Raj Gothi, Pankaj Wasnik","Automatic speech recognition has recently seen a significant advancement with large foundational models such as Whisper. However, these models often struggle to perform well in low-resource languages, such as Indian languages. This paper explores two novel approaches to enhance Whisper's multilingual speech recognition performance in Indian languages. First, we propose prompt-tuning with language family information, which enhances Whisper's accuracy in linguistically similar languages. Second, we introduce a novel tokenizer that reduces the number of generated tokens, thereby accelerating Whisper's inference speed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the tokenizer significantly reduces inference time, while prompt-tuning enhances accuracy across various Whisper model sizes, including Small, Medium, and Large. Together, these techniques achieve a balance between optimal WER and inference speed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19785v1,2024-12

Cross-Linguistic Examination of Machine Translation Transfer Learning,Saughmon Boujkian,"This study investigates the effectiveness of transfer learning in machine translation across diverse linguistic families by evaluating five distinct language pairs. Leveraging pre-trained models on high-resource languages, these models were fine-tuned on low-resource languages, examining variations in hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and weight decay. The research encompasses language pairs from different linguistic backgrounds: Semitic (Modern Standard Arabic - Levantine Arabic), Bantu (Hausa - Zulu), Romance (Spanish - Catalan), Slavic (Slovakian - Macedonian), and language isolates (Eastern Armenian - Western Armenian). Results demonstrate that transfer learning is effective across different language families, although the impact of hyperparameters varies. A moderate batch size (e.g., 32) is generally more effective, while very high learning rates can disrupt model training. The study highlights the universality of transfer learning in multilingual contexts and suggests that consistent hyperparameter settings can simplify and enhance the efficiency of multilingual model training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00045v1,2024-12
OS-Genesis: Automating GUI Agent Trajectory Construction via Reverse Task Synthesis,"Qiushi Sun, Kanzhi Cheng, Zichen Ding, Chuanyang Jin, Yian Wang, Fangzhi Xu, Zhenyu Wu, Chengyou Jia, Liheng Chen, Zhoumianze Liu, Ben Kao, Guohao Li, Junxian He, Yu Qiao, Zhiyong Wu","Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods.

Toward Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models with Thought Rollback,"Sijia Chen, Baochun Li","Large language models (LLMs) have been routinely used to solve various tasks using step-by-step reasoning. However, the structure of intermediate reasoning steps, or thoughts, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or acyclic-directed graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and forward-only reasoning may not address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM frequently gives false responses, i.e., ``hallucinations''. This paper proposes a new reasoning framework, called Thought Rollback (TR), allowing LLMs to adaptively build thought structure while maintaining effective reasoning toward problem-solving under ``hallucinations''. The core mechanism of TR is rolling back thoughts, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis on thoughts, and thus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision. Subsequently, by including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM, each rollback leads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with a simple prompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually explores thoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical problems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost. For instance, the solving rate of GPT-4 with TR outperforms the current best by $9\%$ on the MATH dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19707v1,2024-12
Long Context vs. RAG for LLMs: An Evaluation and Revisits,"Xinze Li, Yixin Cao, Yubo Ma, Aixin Sun","Extending context windows (i.e., Long Context, LC) and using retrievers to selectively access relevant information (i.e., Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG) are the two main strategies to enable LLMs to incorporate extremely long external contexts. This paper revisits recent studies on this topic, highlighting their key insights and discrepancies. We then provide a more comprehensive evaluation by filtering out questions answerable without external context, identifying the most effective retrieval methods, and expanding the datasets. We show that LC generally outperforms RAG in question-answering benchmarks, especially for Wikipedia-based questions. Summarization-based retrieval performs comparably to LC, while chunk-based retrieval lags behind. However, RAG has advantages in dialogue-based and general question queries. These insights underscore the trade-offs between RAG and LC strategies, offering guidance for future optimization of LLMs with external knowledge sources. We also provide an in-depth discussion on this topic, highlighting the overlooked importance of context relevance in existing studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01880v1,2024-12

Our evaluation metrics include sentiment, readability, persuasiveness, Search Engine Optimization(SEO), clarity, emotional appeal, and call-to-action effectiveness. The results indicate that ChatGPT 4 performs the best. In contrast, other models demonstrate significant shortcomings, producing incoherent and illogical output that lacks logical structure and contextual relevance.

TARGA: Targeted Synthetic Data Generation for Practical Reasoning over Structured Data,"Xiang Huang, Jiayu Shen, Shanshan Huang, Sitao Cheng, Xiaxia Wang, Yuzhong Qu","Semantic parsing, which converts natural language questions into logic forms, plays a crucial role in reasoning within structured environments. However, existing methods encounter two significant challenges: reliance on extensive manually annotated datasets and limited generalization capability to unseen examples. To tackle these issues, we propose Targeted Synthetic Data Generation (TARGA), a practical framework that dynamically generates high-relevance synthetic data without manual annotation. Starting from the pertinent entities and relations of a given question, we probe for the potential relevant queries through layer-wise expansion and cross-layer combination. Then we generate corresponding natural language questions for these constructed queries to jointly serve as the synthetic demonstrations for in-context learning. Experiments on multiple knowledge base question answering (KBQA) datasets demonstrate that TARGA, using only a 7B-parameter model, substantially outperforms existing non-fine-tuned methods that utilize close-sourced model, achieving notable improvements in F1 scores on GrailQA(+7.7) and KBQA-Agent(+12.2).

As a solution, parallel data from auxiliary domains can be used either to fine-tune or to further pre-train the msLM.

Confidence v.s. Critique: A Decomposition of Self-Correction Capability for LLMs,"Zhe Yang, Yichang Zhang, Yudong Wang, Ziyao Xu, Junyang Lin, Zhifang Sui","Large Language Models (LLMs) can correct their self-generated responses, but a decline in accuracy after self-correction is also witnessed. To have a deeper understanding of self-correction, we endeavor to decompose, evaluate, and analyze the self-correction behaviors of LLMs. By enumerating and analyzing answer correctness before and after self-correction, we decompose the self-correction capability into confidence (being confident to correct answers) and critique (turning wrong answers to correct) capabilities, and propose two metrics from a probabilistic perspective to measure these 2 capabilities, along with another metric for overall self-correction capability evaluation. Based on our decomposition and evaluation metrics, we conduct extensive experiments and draw some empirical conclusions. For example, we find different models can exhibit distinct behaviors: some models are confident while others are more critical. We also find the trade-off between the two capabilities (i.e. improving one can lead to a decline in the other) when manipulating model self-correction behavior by prompts or in-context learning. Further, we find a simple yet efficient strategy to improve self-correction capability by transforming Supervision Fine-Tuning (SFT) data format, and our strategy outperforms vanilla SFT in both capabilities and achieves much higher accuracy after self-correction.

In this paper, we address the question: How can we improve downstream task performance while preserving safety in LLMs without relying on additional safety data? We propose a simple and effective method that maintains the inherent safety of LLMs while enhancing their downstream task performance: merging the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned safety-aligned models. Experimental results across various downstream tasks, models, and merging methods demonstrate that this approach effectively mitigates safety degradation while improving downstream task performance, offering a practical solution for adapting safety-aligned LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19512v1,2024-12
User Willingness-aware Sales Talk Dataset,"Asahi Hentona, Jun Baba, Shiki Sato, Reina Akama","User willingness is a crucial element in the sales talk process that affects the achievement of the salesperson's or sales system's objectives. Despite the importance of user willingness, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has addressed the development of automated sales talk dialogue systems that explicitly consider user willingness. A major barrier is the lack of sales talk datasets with reliable user willingness data. Thus, in this study, we developed a user willingness-aware sales talk collection by leveraging the ecological validity concept, which is discussed in the field of human-computer interaction. Our approach focused on three types of user willingness essential in real sales interactions. We created a dialogue environment that closely resembles real-world scenarios to elicit natural user willingness, with participants evaluating their willingness at the utterance level from multiple perspectives. We analyzed the collected data to gain insights into practical user willingness-aware sales talk strategies.

"Pre-training, Fine-tuning and Re-ranking: A Three-Stage Framework for Legal Question Answering","Shiwen Ni, Hao Cheng, Min Yang","Legal question answering (QA) has attracted increasing attention from people seeking legal advice, which aims to retrieve the most applicable answers from a large-scale database of question-answer pairs. Previous methods mainly use a dual-encoder architecture to learn dense representations of both questions and answers. However, these methods could suffer from lacking domain knowledge and sufficient labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a three-stage (\underline{p}re-training, \underline{f}ine-tuning and \underline{r}e-ranking) framework for \underline{l}egal \underline{QA} (called PFR-LQA), which promotes the fine-grained text representation learning and boosts the performance of dense retrieval with the dual-encoder architecture. Concretely, we first conduct domain-specific pre-training on legal questions and answers through a self-supervised training objective, allowing the pre-trained model to be adapted to the legal domain. Then, we perform task-specific fine-tuning of the dual-encoder on legal question-answer pairs by using the supervised learning objective, leading to a high-quality dual-encoder for the specific downstream QA task. Finally, we employ a contextual re-ranking objective to further refine the output representations of questions produced by the document encoder, which uses contextual similarity to increase the discrepancy between the anchor and hard negative samples for better question re-ranking. We conduct extensive experiments on a manually annotated legal QA dataset. Experimental results show that our PFR-LQA method achieves better performance than the strong competitors for legal question answering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19482v1,2024-12
Feature Alignment-Based Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Compression of Large Language Models,"Shuo Wang, Chihang Wang, Jia Gao, Zhen Qi, Hongye Zheng, Xiaoxuan Liao","This study proposes a knowledge distillation algorithm based on large language models and feature alignment, aiming to effectively transfer the knowledge of large pre-trained models into lightweight student models, thereby reducing computational costs while maintaining high model performance. Different from the traditional soft label distillation method, this method introduces a multi-layer feature alignment strategy to deeply align the intermediate features and attention mechanisms of the teacher model and the student model, maximally retaining the semantic expression ability and context modeling ability of the teacher model. In terms of method design, a multi-task loss function is constructed, including feature matching loss, attention alignment loss, and output distribution matching loss, to ensure multi-level information transfer through joint optimization. The experiments were comprehensively evaluated on the GLUE data set and various natural language processing tasks. The results show that the proposed model performs very close to the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model in terms of evaluation indicators such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and CER. At the same time, it far exceeds baseline models such as DeBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-3, showing significant performance improvements and computing efficiency advantages. Research results show that the feature alignment distillation strategy is an effective model compression method that can significantly reduce computational overhead and storage requirements while maintaining model capabilities. Future research can be further expanded in the directions of self-supervised learning, cross-modal feature alignment, and multi-task transfer learning to provide more flexible and efficient solutions for the deployment and optimization of deep learning models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19449v1,2024-12

Dynamic Skill Adaptation for Large Language Models,"Jiaao Chen, Diyi Yang","We present Dynamic Skill Adaptation (DSA), an adaptive and dynamic framework to adapt novel and complex skills to Large Language Models (LLMs). Compared with previous work which learns from human-curated and static data in random orders, we propose to first automatically generate and organize the training data by mimicking the learning pathways of human and then dynamically tailor the training data based on the training dynamics. Specifically, inspired by the learning structures and teaching strategies in the human education system, we first construct a skill graph by decomposing complex skills into sub-skills and arranging them based on their dependencies in human syllables. For every skill, we utilize LLMs to generate both textbook-like data which contains detailed descriptions of skills for pre-training and exercise-like data which targets at explicitly utilizing the skills to solve problems for instruction-tuning. Furthermore, during the instruction-tuning, we dynamically update the training data which down-weight easy-to-learn examples, generate more complex examples, and filter out data with errors. Experiments on large language models such as LLAMA and Mistral demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in adapting math reasoning skills and social study skills.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19361v1,2024-12
ETTA: Elucidating the Design Space of Text-to-Audio Models,"Sang-gil Lee, Zhifeng Kong, Arushi Goel, Sungwon Kim, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro","Recent years have seen significant progress in Text-To-Audio (TTA) synthesis, enabling users to enrich their creative workflows with synthetic audio generated from natural language prompts. Despite this progress, the effects of data, model architecture, training objective functions, and sampling strategies on target benchmarks are not well understood. With the purpose of providing a holistic understanding of the design space of TTA models, we set up a large-scale empirical experiment focused on diffusion and flow matching models. Our contributions include: 1) AF-Synthetic, a large dataset of high quality synthetic captions obtained from an audio understanding model; 2) a systematic comparison of different architectural, training, and inference design choices for TTA models; 3) an analysis of sampling methods and their Pareto curves with respect to generation quality and inference speed. We leverage the knowledge obtained from this extensive analysis to propose our best model dubbed Elucidated Text-To-Audio (ETTA). When evaluated on AudioCaps and MusicCaps, ETTA provides improvements over the baselines trained on publicly available data, while being competitive with models trained on proprietary data. Finally, we show ETTA's improved ability to generate creative audio following complex and imaginative captions -- a task that is more challenging than current benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19351v1,2024-12
On the Expressiveness and Length Generalization of Selective State-Space Models on Regular Languages,"Aleksandar Terzić, Michael Hersche, Giacomo Camposampiero, Thomas Hofmann, Abu Sebastian, Abbas Rahimi","Selective state-space models (SSMs) are an emerging alternative to the Transformer, offering the unique advantage of parallel training and sequential inference. Although these models have shown promising performance on a variety of tasks, their formal expressiveness and length generalization properties remain underexplored. In this work, we provide insight into the workings of selective SSMs by analyzing their expressiveness and length generalization performance on regular language tasks, i.e., finite-state automaton (FSA) emulation. We address certain limitations of modern SSM-based architectures by introducing the Selective Dense State-Space Model (SD-SSM), the first selective SSM that exhibits perfect length generalization on a set of various regular language tasks using a single layer. It utilizes a dictionary of dense transition matrices, a softmax selection mechanism that creates a convex combination of dictionary matrices at each time step, and a readout consisting of layer normalization followed by a linear map. We then proceed to evaluate variants of diagonal selective SSMs by considering their empirical performance on commutative and non-commutative automata. We explain the experimental results with theoretical considerations. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/selective-dense-state-space-model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19350v1,2024-12
Semi-Supervised Learning from Small Annotated Data and Large Unlabeled Data for Fine-grained PICO Entity Recognition,"Fangyi Chen, Gongbo Zhang, Yilu Fang, Yifan Peng, Chunhua Weng","Objective: Extracting PICO elements -- Participants, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes -- from clinical trial literature is essential for clinical evidence retrieval, appraisal, and synthesis. Existing approaches do not distinguish the attributes of PICO entities. This study aims to develop a named entity recognition (NER) model to extract PICO entities with fine granularities.   Materials and Methods: Using a corpus of 2,511 abstracts with PICO mentions from 4 public datasets, we developed a semi-supervised method to facilitate the training of a NER model, FinePICO, by combining limited annotated data of PICO entities and abundant unlabeled data. For evaluation, we divided the entire dataset into two subsets: a smaller group with annotations and a larger group without annotations. We then established the theoretical lower and upper performance bounds based on the performance of supervised learning models trained solely on the small, annotated subset and on the entire set with complete annotations, respectively. Finally, we evaluated FinePICO on both the smaller annotated subset and the larger, initially unannotated subset. We measured the performance of FinePICO using precision, recall, and F1.   Results: Our method achieved precision/recall/F1 of 0.567/0.636/0.60, respectively, using a small set of annotated samples, outperforming the baseline model (F1: 0.437) by more than 16\%. The model demonstrates generalizability to a different PICO framework and to another corpus, which consistently outperforms the benchmark in diverse experimental settings (p-value \textless0.001).   Conclusion: This study contributes a generalizable and effective semi-supervised approach to named entity recognition leveraging large unlabeled data together with small, annotated data. It also initially supports fine-grained PICO extraction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19346v1,2024-12
ViPCap: Retrieval Text-Based Visual Prompts for Lightweight Image Captioning,"Taewhan Kim, Soeun Lee, Si-Woo Kim, Dong-Jin Kim","Recent lightweight image captioning models using retrieved data mainly focus on text prompts. However, previous works only utilize the retrieved text as text prompts, and the visual information relies only on the CLIP visual embedding. Because of this issue, there is a limitation that the image descriptions inherent in the prompt are not sufficiently reflected in the visual embedding space. To tackle this issue, we propose ViPCap, a novel retrieval text-based visual prompt for lightweight image captioning. ViPCap leverages the retrieved text with image information as visual prompts to enhance the ability of the model to capture relevant visual information. By mapping text prompts into the CLIP space and generating multiple randomized Gaussian distributions, our method leverages sampling to explore randomly augmented distributions and effectively retrieves the semantic features that contain image information. These retrieved features are integrated into the image and designated as the visual prompt, leading to performance improvements on the datasets such as COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps. Experimental results demonstrate that ViPCap significantly outperforms prior lightweight captioning models in efficiency and effectiveness, demonstrating the potential for a plug-and-play solution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19289v2,2024-12
Optimizing Multi-Stage Language Models for Effective Text Retrieval,"Quang Hoang Trung, Le Trung Hoang, Nguyen Van Hoang Phuc","Efficient text retrieval is critical for applications such as legal document analysis, particularly in specialized contexts like Japanese legal systems.

In this paper, we introduce a novel two-phase text retrieval pipeline optimized for Japanese legal datasets. Our method leverages advanced language models to achieve state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance robustness and adaptability, we incorporate an ensemble model that integrates multiple retrieval strategies, resulting in superior outcomes across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating strong performance on both Japanese legal datasets and widely recognized benchmarks like MS-MARCO. Our work establishes new standards for text retrieval in domain-specific and general contexts, providing a comprehensive solution for addressing complex queries in legal and multilingual environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19265v1,2024-12
MEDEC: A Benchmark for Medical Error Detection and Correction in Clinical Notes,"Asma Ben Abacha, Wen-wai Yim, Yujuan Fu, Zhaoyi Sun, Meliha Yetisgen, Fei Xia, Thomas Lin","Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (https://github.com/abachaa/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the data creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors performed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also found that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and correction, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks. We discuss the potential factors behind this gap, the insights from our experiments, the limitations of current evaluation metrics, and share potential pointers for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19260v2,2024-12
Multi-matrix Factorization Attention,"Jingcheng Hu, Houyi Li, Yinmin Zhang, Zili Wang, Shuigeng Zhou, Xiangyu Zhang, Heung-Yeung Shum","We propose novel attention architectures, Multi-matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) and MFA-Key-Reuse (MFA-KR). Existing variants for standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA), including SOTA methods like MLA, fail to maintain as strong performance under stringent Key-Value cache (KV cache) constraints. MFA enhances model capacity by efficiently scaling up both the number and dimension of attention heads through low-rank matrix factorization in the Query-Key (QK) circuit. Extending MFA, MFA-KR further reduces memory requirements by repurposing the key cache as value through value projection re-parameterization. MFA's design enables strong model capacity when working under tight KV cache budget, while MFA-KR is suitable for even harsher KV cache limits with minor performance trade-off. Notably, in our extensive and large-scale experiments, the proposed architecture outperforms MLA and performs comparably to MHA, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 56% and 93.7%, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19255v1,2024-12
Multi-Head Attention Driven Dynamic Visual-Semantic Embedding for Enhanced Image-Text Matching,Wenjing Chen,"With the rapid development of multimodal learning, the image-text matching task, as a bridge connecting vision and language, has become increasingly important. Based on existing research, this study proposes an innovative visual semantic embedding model, Multi-Headed Consensus-Aware Visual-Semantic Embedding (MH-CVSE). This model introduces a multi-head self-attention mechanism based on the consensus-aware visual semantic embedding model (CVSE) to capture information in multiple subspaces in parallel, significantly enhancing the model's ability to understand and represent the complex relationship between images and texts. In addition, we adopt a parameterized feature fusion strategy to flexibly integrate feature information at different levels, further improving the model's expressive power. In terms of loss function design, the MH-CVSE model adopts a dynamic weight adjustment strategy to dynamically adjust the weight according to the loss value itself, so that the model can better balance the contribution of different loss terms during training. At the same time, we introduce a cosine annealing learning rate strategy to help the model converge more stably in the later stages of training. Extensive experimental verification on the Flickr30k dataset shows that the MH-CVSE model achieves better performance than previous methods in both bidirectional image and text retrieval tasks, fully demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19184v1,2024-12
Reversed in Time: A Novel Temporal-Emphasized Benchmark for Cross-Modal Video-Text Retrieval,"Yang Du, Yuqi Liu, Qin Jin","Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset\footnote{\url{https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time}} to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19178v1,2024-12
GFG -- Gender-Fair Generation: A CALAMITA Challenge,"Simona Frenda, Andrea Piergentili, Beatrice Savoldi, Marco Madeddu, Martina Rosola, Silvia Casola, Chiara Ferrando, Viviana Patti, Matteo Negri, Luisa Bentivogli","Gender-fair language aims at promoting gender equality by using terms and expressions that include all identities and avoid reinforcing gender stereotypes. Implementing gender-fair strategies is particularly challenging in heavily gender-marked languages, such as Italian. To address this, the Gender-Fair Generation challenge intends to help shift toward gender-fair language in written communication. The challenge, designed to assess and monitor the recognition and generation of gender-fair language in both mono- and cross-lingual scenarios, includes three tasks: (1) the detection of gendered expressions in Italian sentences, (2) the reformulation of gendered expressions into gender-fair alternatives, and (3) the generation of gender-fair language in automatic translation from English to Italian. The challenge relies on three different annotated datasets: the GFL-it corpus, which contains Italian texts extracted from administrative documents provided by the University of Brescia; GeNTE, a bilingual test set for gender-neutral rewriting and translation built upon a subset of the Europarl dataset; and Neo-GATE, a bilingual test set designed to assess the use of non-binary neomorphemes in Italian for both fair formulation and translation tasks. Finally, each task is evaluated with specific metrics: average of F1-score obtained by means of BERTScore computed on each entry of the datasets for task 1, an accuracy measured with a gender-neutral classifier, and a coverage-weighted accuracy for tasks 2 and 3.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19168v2,2024-12
Referencing Where to Focus: Improving VisualGrounding with Referential Query,"Yabing Wang, Zhuotao Tian, Qingpei Guo, Zheng Qin, Sanping Zhou, Ming Yang, Le Wang","Visual Grounding aims to localize the referring object in an image given a natural language expression. Recent advancements in DETR-based visual grounding methods have attracted considerable attention, as they directly predict the coordinates of the target object without relying on additional efforts, such as pre-generated proposal candidates or pre-defined anchor boxes. However, existing research primarily focuses on designing stronger multi-modal decoder, which typically generates learnable queries by random initialization or by using linguistic embeddings. This vanilla query generation approach inevitably increases the learning difficulty for the model, as it does not involve any target-related information at the beginning of decoding. Furthermore, they only use the deepest image feature during the query learning process, overlooking the importance of features from other levels. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach, called RefFormer. It consists of the query adaption module that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP and generate the referential query to provide the prior context for decoder, along with a task-specific decoder. By incorporating the referential query into the decoder, we can effectively mitigate the learning difficulty of the decoder, and accurately concentrate on the target object. Additionally, our proposed query adaption module can also act as an adapter, preserving the rich knowledge within CLIP without the need to tune the parameters of the backbone network. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on five visual grounding benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19155v1,2024-12
SILC-EFSA: Self-aware In-context Learning Correction for Entity-level Financial Sentiment Analysis,"Senbin Zhu, Chenyuan He, Hongde Liu, Pengcheng Dong, Hanjie Zhao, Yuchen Yan, Yuxiang Jia, Hongying Zan, Min Peng","In recent years, fine-grained sentiment analysis in finance has gained significant attention, but the scarcity of entity-level datasets remains a key challenge. To address this, we have constructed the largest English and Chinese financial entity-level sentiment analysis datasets to date. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel two-stage sentiment analysis approach called Self-aware In-context Learning Correction (SILC). The first stage involves fine-tuning a base large language model to generate pseudo-labeled data specific to our task. In the second stage, we train a correction model using a GNN-based example retriever, which is informed by the pseudo-labeled data. This two-stage strategy has allowed us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the newly constructed datasets, advancing the field of financial sentiment analysis. In a case study, we demonstrate the enhanced practical utility of our data and methods in monitoring the cryptocurrency market.

SketchFill: Sketch-Guided Code Generation for Imputing Derived Missing Values,"Yunfan Zhang, Changlun Li, Yuyu Luo, Nan Tang","Missing value is a critical issue in data science, significantly impacting the reliability of analyses and predictions. Missing value imputation (MVI) is a longstanding problem because it highly relies on domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for data cleaning, including MVI for tabular data, offering advanced capabilities for understanding and generating content. However, despite their promise, existing LLM techniques such as in-context learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) often fall short in guiding LLMs to perform complex reasoning for MVI, particularly when imputing derived missing values, which require mathematical formulas and data relationships across rows and columns. This gap underscores the need for further advancements in LLM methodologies to enhance their reasoning capabilities for more reliable imputation outcomes. To fill this gap, we propose SketchFill, a novel sketch-based method to guide LLMs in generating accurate formulas to impute missing numerical values. Our experimental results demonstrate that SketchFill significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 56.2% higher accuracy than CoT-based methods and 78.8% higher accuracy than MetaGPT. This sets a new standard for automated data cleaning and advances the field of MVI for numerical values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19113v1,2024-12
"""I've Heard of You!"": Generate Spoken Named Entity Recognition Data for Unseen Entities","Jiawei Yu, Xiang Geng, Yuang Li, Mengxin Ren, Wei Tang, Jiahuan Li, Zhibin Lan, Min Zhang, Hao Yang, Shujian Huang, Jinsong Su","Spoken named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify named entities from speech, playing an important role in speech processing. New named entities appear every day, however, annotating their Spoken NER data is costly. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing Spoken NER systems perform poorly when dealing with previously unseen named entities. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method for generating Spoken NER data based on a named entity dictionary (NED) to reduce costs. Specifically, we first use a large language model (LLM) to generate sentences from the sampled named entities and then use a text-to-speech (TTS) system to generate the speech. Furthermore, we introduce a noise metric to filter out noisy data. To evaluate our approach, we release a novel Spoken NER benchmark along with a corresponding NED containing 8,853 entities. Experiment results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the in-domain, zero-shot domain adaptation, and fully zero-shot settings.

MoPD: Mixture-of-Prompts Distillation for Vision-Language Models,"Yang Chen, Shuai Fu, Yu Zhang","Soft prompt learning methods are effective for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. Nevertheless, empirical evidence reveals a tendency of existing methods that they overfit seen classes and exhibit degraded performance on unseen classes. This limitation is due to the inherent bias in the training data towards the seen classes. To address this issue, we propose a novel soft prompt learning method, named Mixture-of-Prompts Distillation (MoPD), which can effectively transfer useful knowledge from hard prompts manually hand-crafted (a.k.a. teacher prompts) to the learnable soft prompt (a.k.a. student prompt), thereby enhancing the generalization ability of soft prompts on unseen classes. Moreover, the proposed MoPD method utilizes a gating network that learns to select hard prompts used for prompt distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MoPD method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines especially on on unseen classes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19087v1,2024-12

Robust Speech and Natural Language Processing Models for Depression Screening,"Y. Lu, A. Harati, T. Rutowski, R. Oliveira, P. Chlebek, E. Shriberg","Depression is a global health concern with a critical need for increased patient screening. Speech technology offers advantages for remote screening but must perform robustly across patients. We have described two deep learning models developed for this purpose. One model is based on acoustics; the other is based on natural language processing. Both models employ transfer learning. Data from a depression-labeled corpus in which 11,000 unique users interacted with a human-machine application using conversational speech is used. Results on binary depression classification have shown that both models perform at or above AUC=0.80 on unseen data with no speaker overlap. Performance is further analyzed as a function of test subset characteristics, finding that the models are generally robust over speaker and session variables. We conclude that models based on these approaches offer promise for generalized automated depression screening.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19072v1,2024-12
Cross-Demographic Portability of Deep NLP-Based Depression Models,"Tomek Rutowski, Elizabeth Shriberg, Amir Harati, Yang Lu, Ricardo Oliveira, Piotr Chlebek","Deep learning models are rapidly gaining interest for real-world applications in behavioral health. An important gap in current literature is how well such models generalize over different populations. We study Natural Language Processing (NLP) based models to explore portability over two different corpora highly mismatched in age. The first and larger corpus contains younger speakers. It is used to train an NLP model to predict depression. When testing on unseen speakers from the same age distribution, this model performs at AUC=0.82. We then test this model on the second corpus, which comprises seniors from a retirement community. Despite the large demographic differences in the two corpora, we saw only modest degradation in performance for the senior-corpus data, achieving AUC=0.76. Interestingly, in the senior population, we find AUC=0.81 for the subset of patients whose health state is consistent over time. Implications for demographic portability of speech-based applications are discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19070v1,2024-12
Indonesian-English Code-Switching Speech Synthesizer Utilizing Multilingual STEN-TTS and Bert LID,"Ahmad Alfani Handoyo, Chung Tran, Dessi Puji Lestari, Sakriani Sakti","Multilingual text-to-speech systems convert text into speech across multiple languages. In many cases, text sentences may contain segments in different languages, a phenomenon known as code-switching. This is particularly common in Indonesia, especially between Indonesian and English. Despite its significance, no research has yet developed a multilingual TTS system capable of handling code-switching between these two languages. This study addresses Indonesian-English code-switching in STEN-TTS. Key modifications include adding a language identification component to the text-to-phoneme conversion using finetuned BERT for per-word language identification, as well as removing language embedding from the base model. Experimental results demonstrate that the code-switching model achieves superior naturalness and improved speech intelligibility compared to the Indonesian and English baseline STEN-TTS models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19043v1,2024-12
Let the Rule Speak: Enhancing In-context Learning Debiasing with Interpretability,"Ruixi Lin, Yang You","In-context learning, which allows large language models to perform diverse tasks with a few demonstrations, is found to have imbalanced per-class prediction accuracy on multi-class text classification. Although notable output correction methods have been developed to tackle the issue and simultaneously improve downstream prediction accuracy, they may fail to answer the core interpretability challenges: why and which certain classes need corrections, and more importantly, a tailored correction for per-sample, per-class's probability. To address such interpretability gaps, we first find that the imbalance arises from certain classes consistently receiving high ICL output probabilities, whereas others receiving lower or mixed ranges, so the former is more frequently chosen, resulting in higher accuracy; more crucially, we find that these ranges have significantly varying degrees of influence on the accuracy bias, highlighting the need for precise, interpretable probability corrections by range. Motivated by this, we propose FuRud, a Fuzzy Rule Optimization based Debiasing method, that (1) detects which classes need corrections, and (2) for each correction-needed class, detects its probability ranges and applies asymmetric amplifications or reductions to correct them interpretably. Notably, across seven benchmark datasets, FuRud reduces the pairwise class accuracy bias (COBias) by more than half (56%), while achieving a relative increase of 21% in accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art debiasing methods. Moreover, FuRud can optimize downstream tasks with as few as 10 optimization examples. Furthermore, FuRud can work for prompt formats that lead to highly skewed predictions. For example, FuRud greatly improves ICL outputs which use letter options, with 44% relative accuracy increase and 54% relative COBias reduction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19018v1,2024-12
MedHallBench: A New Benchmark for Assessing Hallucination in Medical Large Language Models,"Kaiwen Zuo, Yirui Jiang","Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated potential in healthcare applications, yet their propensity for hallucinations -- generating medically implausible or inaccurate information -- presents substantial risks to patient care.

The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18947v2,2024-12
Dovetail: A CPU/GPU Heterogeneous Speculative Decoding for LLM inference,"Libo Zhang, Zhaoning Zhang, Baizhou Xu, Songzhu Mei, Dongsheng Li","Due to the high resource demands of Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving widespread deployment on consumer-grade devices presents significant challenges. Typically, personal or consumer-grade devices, including servers configured prior to the era of large-scale models, generally have relatively weak GPUs and relatively strong CPUs. However, most current methods primarily depend on GPUs for computation. Therefore, we propose Dovetail, an approach that deploys the draft model on the GPU to generate draft tokens while allowing the target model to perform parallel verification on the CPU, thereby improving the utilization of all available hardware resources and occupying less inter-device communication bandwidth. Accordingly, we have redesigned the draft model to better align with heterogeneous hardware characteristics. To this end, we implemented several optimizations: reducing the number of draft tokens to mitigate latency in parallel verification, increasing the depth of the draft model to enhance its predictive capacity, and introducing DGF (Dynamic Gating Fusion) to improve the integration of features and token embeddings. In the HumanEval benchmark, Dovetail achieved an inference speed of 5.86 tokens per second for LLaMA2-Chat-7B using 3GB of VRAM, representing an approximately 2.77x improvement over CPU-only inference. Furthermore, the inference speed was increased to 8 tokens per second when utilizing 7GB of VRAM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18934v1,2024-12
"HuatuoGPT-o1, Towards Medical Complex Reasoning with LLMs","Junying Chen, Zhenyang Cai, Ke Ji, Xidong Wang, Wanlong Liu, Rongsheng Wang, Jianye Hou, Benyou Wang","The breakthrough of OpenAI o1 highlights the potential of enhancing reasoning to improve LLM. Yet, most research in reasoning has focused on mathematical tasks, leaving domains like medicine underexplored. The medical domain, though distinct from mathematics, also demands robust reasoning to provide reliable answers, given the high standards of healthcare. However, verifying medical reasoning is challenging, unlike those in mathematics. To address this, we propose verifiable medical problems with a medical verifier to check the correctness of model outputs. This verifiable nature enables advancements in medical reasoning through a two-stage approach: (1) using the verifier to guide the search for a complex reasoning trajectory for fine-tuning LLMs, (2) applying reinforcement learning (RL) with verifier-based rewards to enhance complex reasoning further. Finally, we introduce HuatuoGPT-o1, a medical LLM capable of complex reasoning, which outperforms general and medical-specific baselines using only 40K verifiable problems. Experiments show complex reasoning improves medical problem-solving and benefits more from RL. We hope our approach inspires advancements in reasoning across medical and other specialized domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18925v1,2024-12
AdaEAGLE: Optimizing Speculative Decoding via Explicit Modeling of Adaptive Draft Structures,"Situo Zhang, Hankun Wang, Da Ma, Zichen Zhu, Lu Chen, Kunyao Lan, Kai Yu","Speculative Decoding (SD) is a popular lossless technique for accelerating the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs). We show that the decoding speed of SD frameworks with static draft structures can be significantly improved by incorporating context-aware adaptive draft structures. However, current studies on adaptive draft structures are limited by their performance, modeling approaches, and applicability. In this paper, we introduce AdaEAGLE, the first SD framework that explicitly models adaptive draft structures. AdaEAGLE leverages the Lightweight Draft Length Predictor (LDLP) module to explicitly predict the optimal number of draft tokens during inference to guide the draft model. It achieves comparable speedup results without manual thresholds and allows for deeper, more specialized optimizations. Moreover, together with threshold-based strategies, AdaEAGLE achieves a $1.62\times$ speedup over the vanilla AR decoding and outperforms fixed-length SotA baseline while maintaining output quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18910v1,2024-12

Whose Morality Do They Speak? Unraveling Cultural Bias in Multilingual Language Models,Meltem Aksoy,"Large language models (LLMs) have become integral tools in diverse domains, yet their moral reasoning capabilities across cultural and linguistic contexts remain underexplored. This study investigates whether multilingual LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, Llama 3.1, and MistralNeMo, reflect culturally specific moral values or impose dominant moral norms, particularly those rooted in English. Using the updated Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ-2) in eight languages, Arabic, Farsi, English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, French, and Russian, the study analyzes the models' adherence to six core moral foundations: care, equality, proportionality, loyalty, authority, and purity. The results reveal significant cultural and linguistic variability, challenging the assumption of universal moral consistency in LLMs. Although some models demonstrate adaptability to diverse contexts, others exhibit biases influenced by the composition of the training data. These findings underscore the need for culturally inclusive model development to improve fairness and trust in multilingual AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18863v1,2024-12
Bootstrap Your Own Context Length,"Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Xingxing Zhang, Xiaolong Huang, Furu Wei","We introduce a bootstrapping approach to train long-context language models by exploiting their short-context capabilities only. Our method utilizes a simple agent workflow to synthesize diverse long-context instruction tuning data, thereby eliminating the necessity for manual data collection and annotation. The proposed data synthesis workflow requires only a short-context language model, a text retriever, and a document collection, all of which are readily accessible within the open-source ecosystem. Subsequently, language models are fine-tuned using the synthesized data to extend their context lengths. In this manner, we effectively transfer the short-context capabilities of language models to long-context scenarios through a bootstrapping process. We conduct experiments with the open-source Llama-3 family of models and demonstrate that our method can successfully extend the context length to up to 1M tokens, achieving superior performance across various benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18860v1,2024-12
RapGuard: Safeguarding Multimodal Large Language Models via Rationale-aware Defensive Prompting,"Yilei Jiang, Yingshui Tan, Xiangyu Yue","While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, they are also more susceptible to producing harmful content compared to models that focus solely on text. Existing defensive prompting techniques rely on a static, unified safety guideline that fails to account for the specific risks inherent in different multimodal contexts. To address these limitations, we propose RapGuard, a novel framework that uses multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically generate scenario-specific safety prompts. RapGuard enhances safety by adapting its prompts to the unique risks of each input, effectively mitigating harmful outputs while maintaining high performance on benign tasks. Our experimental results across multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that RapGuard achieves state-of-the-art safety performance, significantly reducing harmful content without degrading the quality of responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18826v1,2024-12
DCIS: Efficient Length Extrapolation of LLMs via Divide-and-Conquer Scaling Factor Search,"Lei Yang, Shaoyang Xu, Deyi Xiong","Large language models (LLMs) based on the Transformer architecture usually have their context length limited due to the high training cost. Recent advancements extend the context window by adjusting the scaling factors of RoPE and fine-tuning. However, suboptimal initialization of these factors results in increased fine-tuning costs and reduced performance at target length. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative RoPE-based fine-tuning framework that diverges from conventional scaling factors search. Specifically, we present a Divide-and-Conquer Incremental Search (DCIS) algorithm that strategically determines the better scaling factors. Further fine-tuning with the identified scaling factors effectively extends the context window of LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our methodology not only mitigates performance decay at extended target lengths but also allows the model to fine-tune on short contexts and generalize to long contexts, thereby reducing the cost of fine-tuning. The scaling factors obtained through DCIS can even perform effectively without fine-tuning. Further analysis of the search space reveals that DCIS achieves twice the search efficiency compared to other methods. We also examine the impact of the non-strictly increasing scaling factors utilized in DCIS and evaluate the general capabilities of LLMs across various context lengths.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18811v1,2024-12
Improving Generated and Retrieved Knowledge Combination Through Zero-shot Generation,"Xinkai Du, Quanjie Han, Chao Lv, Yan Liu, Yalin Sun, Hao Shu, Hongbo Shan, Maosong Sun","Open-domain Question Answering (QA) has garnered substantial interest by combining the advantages of faithfully retrieved passages and relevant passages generated through Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is a lack of definitive labels available to pair these sources of knowledge. In order to address this issue, we propose an unsupervised and simple framework called Bi-Reranking for Merging Generated and Retrieved Knowledge (BRMGR), which utilizes re-ranking methods for both retrieved passages and LLM-generated passages. We pair the two types of passages using two separate re-ranking methods and then combine them through greedy matching. We demonstrate that BRMGR is equivalent to employing a bipartite matching loss when assigning each retrieved passage with a corresponding LLM-generated passage. The application of our model yielded experimental results from three datasets, improving their performance by +1.7 and +1.6 on NQ and WebQ datasets, respectively, and obtaining comparable result on TriviaQA dataset when compared to competitive baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18800v1,2024-12
Towards Expressive Video Dubbing with Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction,"Yuan Zhao, Rui Liu, Gaoxiang Cong","Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) generates speech aligned with lip motion and facial emotion from scripts. Recent research focuses on modeling multimodal context to enhance prosody expressiveness but overlooks two key issues: 1) Multiscale prosody expression attributes in the context influence the current sentence's prosody. 2) Prosody cues in context interact with the current sentence, impacting the final prosody expressiveness. To tackle these challenges, we propose M2CI-Dubber, a Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction scheme for AVD. This scheme includes two shared M2CI encoders to model the multiscale multimodal context and facilitate its deep interaction with the current sentence. By extracting global and local features for each modality in the context, utilizing attention-based mechanisms for aggregation and interaction, and employing an interaction-based graph attention network for fusion, the proposed approach enhances the prosody expressiveness of synthesized speech for the current sentence. Experiments on the Chem dataset show our model outperforms baselines in dubbing expressiveness. The code and demos are available at \textcolor[rgb]{0.93,0.0,0.47}{https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/M2CI-Dubber}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18748v2,2024-12
Intra- and Inter-modal Context Interaction Modeling for Conversational Speech Synthesis,"Zhenqi Jia, Rui Liu","Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to effectively take the multimodal dialogue history (MDH) to generate speech with appropriate conversational prosody for target utterance. The key challenge of CSS is to model the interaction between the MDH and the target utterance. Note that text and speech modalities in MDH have their own unique influences, and they complement each other to produce a comprehensive impact on the target utterance. Previous works did not explicitly model such intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a new intra-modal and inter-modal context interaction scheme-based CSS system, termed III-CSS. Specifically, in the training phase, we combine the MDH with the text and speech modalities in the target utterance to obtain four modal combinations, including Historical Text-Next Text, Historical Speech-Next Speech, Historical Text-Next Speech, and Historical Speech-Next Text. Then, we design two contrastive learning-based intra-modal and two inter-modal interaction modules to deeply learn the intra-modal and inter-modal context interaction. In the inference phase, we take MDH and adopt trained interaction modules to fully infer the speech prosody of the target utterance's text content. Subjective and objective experiments on the DailyTalk dataset show that III-CSS outperforms the advanced baselines in terms of prosody expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/I3CSS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18733v1,2024-12
Optimizing Large Language Models with an Enhanced LoRA Fine-Tuning Algorithm for Efficiency and Robustness in NLP Tasks,"Jiacheng Hu, Xiaoxuan Liao, Jia Gao, Zhen Qi, Hongye Zheng, Chihang Wang","This study proposes a large language model optimization method based on the improved LoRA fine-tuning algorithm, aiming to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of the model in natural language processing tasks. We fine-tune the large language model through a low-rank adaptation strategy, which significantly reduces the consumption of computing resources while maintaining the powerful capabilities of the pre-trained model. The experiment uses the QQP task as the evaluation scenario. The results show that the improved LoRA algorithm shows significant improvements in accuracy, F1 score, and MCC compared with traditional models such as BERT, Roberta, T5, and GPT-4. In particular, in terms of F1 score and MCC, our model shows stronger robustness and discrimination ability, which proves the potential of the improved LoRA algorithm in fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. In addition, this paper also discusses the application prospects of the improved LoRA algorithm in other natural language processing tasks, emphasizing its advantages in multi-task learning and scenarios with limited computing resources. Future research can further optimize the LoRA fine-tuning strategy and expand its application in larger-scale pre-trained models to improve the generalization ability and task adaptability of the model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18729v1,2024-12
Using Large Language Models for Automated Grading of Student Writing about Science,"Chris Impey, Matthew Wenger, Nikhil Garuda, Shahriar Golchin, Sarah Stamer","Assessing writing in large classes for formal or informal learners presents a significant challenge. Consequently, most large classes, particularly in science, rely on objective assessment tools such as multiple-choice quizzes, which have a single correct answer. The rapid development of AI has introduced the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate student writing. An experiment was conducted using GPT-4 to determine if machine learning methods based on LLMs can match or exceed the reliability of instructor grading in evaluating short writing assignments on topics in astronomy. The audience consisted of adult learners in three massive open online courses (MOOCs) offered through Coursera. One course was on astronomy, the second was on astrobiology, and the third was on the history and philosophy of astronomy. The results should also be applicable to non-science majors in university settings, where the content and modes of evaluation are similar. The data comprised answers from 120 students to 12 questions across the three courses. GPT-4 was provided with total grades, model answers, and rubrics from an instructor for all three courses. In addition to evaluating how reliably the LLM reproduced instructor grades, the LLM was also tasked with generating its own rubrics. Overall, the LLM was more reliable than peer grading, both in aggregate and by individual student, and approximately matched instructor grades for all three online courses. The implication is that LLMs may soon be used for automated, reliable, and scalable grading of student science writing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18719v1,2024-12
Speech Recognition With LLMs Adapted to Disordered Speech Using Reinforcement Learning,"Chirag Nagpal, Subhashini Venugopalan, Jimmy Tobin, Marilyn Ladewig, Katherine Heller, Katrin Tomanek","We introduce a large language model (LLM) capable of processing speech inputs and show that tuning it further with reinforcement learning on human preference (RLHF) enables it to adapt better to disordered speech than traditional fine-tuning. Our method replaces low-frequency text tokens in an LLM's vocabulary with audio tokens and enables the model to recognize speech by fine-tuning it on speech with transcripts. We then use RL with rewards based on syntactic and semantic accuracy measures generalizing the LLM further to recognize disordered speech. While the resulting LLM does not outperform existing systems for speech recognition, we find that tuning with reinforcement learning using custom rewards leads to substantially better performance than supervised fine-tuning of the language model, specifically when adapting to speech in a different setting. This presents a compelling alternative tuning strategy for speech recognition using large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00039v1,2024-12
Multiple References with Meaningful Variations Improve Literary Machine Translation,"Si Wu, John Wieting, David A. Smith","While a source sentence can be translated in many ways, most machine translation (MT) models are trained with only a single reference. Previous work has shown that using synthetic paraphrases can improve MT. This paper investigates best practices for employing multiple references by analyzing the semantic similarity among different English translations of world literature in the Par3 dataset. We classify the semantic similarity between paraphrases into three groups: low, medium, and high, and fine-tune two different LLMs (mT5-large and LLaMA-2-7B) for downstream MT tasks. Across different models, holding the total training instances constant, single-reference but more source texts only marginally outperforms multiple-reference with half of the source texts. Moreover, using paraphrases of medium and high semantic similarity outperforms an unfiltered dataset (+BLEU 0.3-0.5, +COMET 0.2-0.9, +chrF++ 0.25-0.32). Our code is publicly available on GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18707v1,2024-12
CypherBench: Towards Precise Retrieval over Full-scale Modern Knowledge Graphs in the LLM Era,"Yanlin Feng, Simone Papicchio, Sajjadur Rahman","Retrieval from graph data is crucial for augmenting large language models (LLM) with both open-domain knowledge and private enterprise data, and it is also a key component in the recent GraphRAG system (edge et al., 2024). Despite decades of research on knowledge graphs and knowledge base question answering, leading LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain and LlamaIndex) have only minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata. In this paper, we analyze the root cause and suggest that modern RDF knowledge graphs (e.g. Wikidata, Freebase) are less efficient for LLMs due to overly large schemas that far exceed the typical LLM context window, use of resource identifiers, overlapping relation types and lack of normalization. As a solution, we propose property graph views on top of the underlying RDF graph that can be efficiently queried by LLMs using Cypher. We instantiated this idea on Wikidata and introduced CypherBench, the first benchmark with 11 large-scale, multi-domain property graphs with 7.8 million entities and over 10,000 questions. To achieve this, we tackled several key challenges, including developing an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine, creating a systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation, and designing new evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18702v1,2024-12
Diverse and Effective Red Teaming with Auto-generated Rewards and Multi-step Reinforcement Learning,"Alex Beutel, Kai Xiao, Johannes Heidecke, Lilian Weng","Automated red teaming can discover rare model failures and generate challenging examples that can be used for training or evaluation. However, a core challenge in automated red teaming is ensuring that the attacks are both diverse and effective. Prior methods typically succeed in optimizing either for diversity or for effectiveness, but rarely both. In this paper, we provide methods that enable automated red teaming to generate a large number of diverse and successful attacks.   Our approach decomposes the task into two steps: (1) automated methods for generating diverse attack goals and (2) generating effective attacks for those goals. While we provide multiple straightforward methods for generating diverse goals, our key contributions are to train an RL attacker that both follows those goals and generates diverse attacks for those goals. First, we demonstrate that it is easy to use a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse attacker goals with per-goal prompts and rewards, including rule-based rewards (RBRs) to grade whether the attacks are successful for the particular goal. Second, we demonstrate how training the attacker model with multi-step RL, where the model is rewarded for generating attacks that are different from past attempts further increases diversity while remaining effective. We use our approach to generate both prompt injection attacks and prompts that elicit unsafe responses. In both cases, we find that our approach is able to generate highly-effective and considerably more diverse attacks than past general red-teaming approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18693v1,2024-12
AgreeMate: Teaching LLMs to Haggle,"Ainesh Chatterjee, Samuel Miller, Nithin Parepally","We introduce AgreeMate, a framework for training Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform strategic price negotiations through natural language. We apply recent advances to a negotiation setting where two agents (i.e. buyer or seller) use natural language to bargain on goods using coarse actions. Specifically, we present the performance of Large Language Models when used as agents within a decoupled (modular) bargaining architecture. We demonstrate that using prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and chain-of-thought prompting enhances model performance, as defined by novel metrics. We use attention probing to show model attention to semantic relationships between tokens during negotiations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18690v1,2024-12
From Hallucinations to Facts: Enhancing Language Models with Curated Knowledge Graphs,"Ratnesh Kumar Joshi, Sagnik Sengupta, Asif Ekbal","Hallucination, a persistent challenge plaguing language models, undermines their efficacy and trustworthiness in various natural language processing endeavors by generating responses that deviate from factual accuracy or coherence. This paper addresses language model hallucination by integrating curated knowledge graph (KG) triples to anchor responses in empirical data. We meticulously select and integrate relevant KG triples tailored to specific contexts, enhancing factual grounding and alignment with input. Our contribution involves constructing a comprehensive KG repository from Wikipedia and refining data to spotlight essential information for model training. By imbuing language models with access to this curated knowledge, we aim to generate both linguistically fluent responses and deeply rooted in factual accuracy and context relevance. This integration mitigates hallucinations by providing a robust foundation of information, enabling models to draw upon a rich reservoir of factual data during response generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of multiple approaches in reducing hallucinatory responses, underscoring the role of curated knowledge graphs in improving the reliability and trustworthiness of language model outputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18672v1,2024-12
Advancing Explainability in Neural Machine Translation: Analytical Metrics for Attention and Alignment Consistency,Anurag Mishra,"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have shown remarkable performance but remain largely opaque in their decision making processes. The interpretability of these models, especially their internal attention mechanisms, is critical for building trust and verifying that these systems behave as intended. In this work, we introduce a systematic framework to quantitatively evaluate the explainability of an NMT model attention patterns by comparing them against statistical alignments and correlating them with standard machine translation quality metrics. We present a set of metrics attention entropy and alignment agreement and validate them on an English-German test subset from WMT14 using a pre trained mT5 model. Our results indicate that sharper attention distributions correlate with improved interpretability but do not always guarantee better translation quality. These findings advance our understanding of NMT explainability and guide future efforts toward building more transparent and reliable machine translation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18669v1,2024-12
Simple is not Enough: Document-level Text Simplification using Readability and Coherence,"Laura Vásquez-Rodríguez, Nhung T. H.

In the past decade, the progress of the Text Simplification (TS) field has been mostly shown at a sentence level, rather than considering paragraphs or documents, a setting from which most TS audiences would benefit. We propose a simplification system that is initially fine-tuned with professionally created corpora. Further, we include multiple objectives during training, considering simplicity, readability, and coherence altogether. Our contributions include the extension of professionally annotated simplification corpora by the association of existing annotations into (complex text, simple text, readability label) triples to benefit from readability during training. Also, we present a comparative analysis in which we evaluate our proposed models in a zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning setting using document-level TS corpora, demonstrating novel methods for simplification.

Long-Form Speech Generation with Spoken Language Models,"Se Jin Park, Julian Salazar, Aren Jansen, Keisuke Kinoshita, Yong Man Ro, RJ Skerry-Ryan","We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants. However, current spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, from high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, to architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, to memory costs at inference time. With these considerations we propose SpeechSSM, the first speech language model to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates, based on recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling. Furthermore, to address growing challenges in spoken language evaluation, especially in this new long-form setting, we propose: new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; quality measurements over length and time; and a new benchmark for long-form speech processing and generation, LibriSpeech-Long. Speech samples and the dataset are released at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18603v1,2024-12
Exploring Embedding Priors in Prompt-Tuning for Improved Interpretability and Control,"Sergey Sedov, Sumanth Bharadwaj Hachalli Karanam, Venu Gopal Kadamba","Prompt-Tuning is an efficient method for adapting pre-trained language models to new tasks with minimal computational overhead by modifying prompt embeddings. In this work, we investigate how crucial the phenomenon of embedding collapse, frequently observed in Prompt-Tuning, is for the final performance of the model. To address this question, we designed embedding priors and compared them with posteriors of the converged Soft and Deep Prompt-Tuning methods. Our findings suggest that priors strongly affect the position of the tuned embeddings, and models can effectively work with embeddings from different parts of activation spaces, including completely new regions. As the final Prompt-Tuning capabilities are limited, we hypothesize that controllable Prompt-Tuning posteriors may serve as a good starting point for tasks such as chain-of-thought (COT) distillation. Our experiments also show that generated trajectories are not localized in the activation space of the models. However, there are distinct clusters of activations for distant tasks (e.g., NLP and arithmetic), while activations between NLP tasks (e.g., Question-Answering and MLM) lie in the same cluster. These observations raise questions about the importance of a single activation cluster for the generalization abilities of large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18582v1,2024-12
How Well Do LLMs Generate Code for Different Application Domains? Benchmark and Evaluation,"Dewu Zheng, Yanlin Wang, Ensheng Shi, Hongyu Zhang, Zibin Zheng","Recently, an increasing number of AI-driven programming assistants powered by code LLMs have been integrated into various real-world software development environments, significantly boosting developer productivity. However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily focus on general-purpose scenarios, leaving the code generation performance of LLMs for specific application domains largely unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark, MultiCodeBench, to fill this gap. MultiCodeBench comprises 2,400 programming tasks, covering 12 popular software development domains and 15 programming languages. Specifically, we perform in-depth research to identify these 12 application domains. Given that each domain may involve multiple technical frameworks, and that different frameworks present distinct challenges in the coding process, we categorize the commonly used frameworks and platforms within each domain. We then sample programming problems from GitHub repositories related to these subdomains. To ensure the quality of the tasks and mitigate data leakage issues, we invite annotators to rewrite the docstrings for each task in MultiCodeBench. Additionally, we build a static analysis-based dependency parsing tool to extract the dependencies in the ground truth for each task, enabling deeper performance analysis. Through extensive experiments on MultiCodeBench with eleven representative mainstream LLMs, we reveal the code generation performance of the LLMs across different application domains, providing practical insights for developers in downstream fields when selecting LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the reasons behind the models' failures in completing software application development tasks, offering guidance for model developers to enhance domain-specific code generation capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18573v1,2024-12

In this work, we propose to leverage a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to perform ST and ASR in languages for which the model has never seen paired audio-text data. We achieve this by using a pre-trained multilingual speech encoder, a multilingual LLM, and a lightweight adaptation module that maps the audio representations to the token embedding space of the LLM. We perform several experiments both in ST and ASR to understand how to best train the model and what data has the most impact on performance in previously unseen languages. In ST, our best model is capable to achieve BLEU scores over 23 in CoVoST2 for two previously unseen languages, while in ASR, we achieve WERs of up to 28.2\%. We finally show that the performance of our system is bounded by the ability of the LLM to output text in the desired language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18566v2,2024-12
Distilling Fine-grained Sentiment Understanding from Large Language Models,"Yice Zhang, Guangyu Xie, Hongling Xu, Kaiheng Hou, Jianzhu Bao, Qianlong Wang, Shiwei Chen, Ruifeng Xu","Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) aims to extract and summarize user opinions from vast opinionated text. Recent studies demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding capabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high inference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of fine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models (SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews and then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly enhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\% improvement in $F_1$-score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only 220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot sentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed their teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a highly promising direction for FSA. We will release our code, data, and pretrained model weights at https://github.com/HITSZ-HLT/FSA-Distillation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18552v2,2024-12

Combining a dynamic leaderboard with an interactive LLM arena, Libra-Leaderboard encourages the joint optimization of capability and safety. Unlike traditional approaches that average performance and safety metrics, Libra-Leaderboard uses a distance-to-optimal-score method to calculate the overall rankings. This approach incentivizes models to achieve a balance rather than excelling in one dimension at the expense of some other ones. In the first release, Libra-Leaderboard evaluates 26 mainstream LLMs from 14 leading organizations, identifying critical safety challenges even in state-of-the-art models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18551v1,2024-12
Token-Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning,"Tingxu Han, Zhenting Wang, Chunrong Fang, Shiyu Zhao, Shiqing Ma, Zhenyu Chen","Reasoning is critical for large language models (LLMs) to excel in a wide range of tasks. While methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhance LLM performance by decomposing problems into intermediate steps, they also incur significant overhead in token usage, leading to increased costs. We find that the reasoning process of current LLMs is unnecessarily lengthy and it can be compressed by including a reasonable token budget in the prompt, but the choice of token budget plays a crucial role in the actual compression effectiveness. We then propose a token-budget-aware LLM reasoning framework, which dynamically estimates token budgets for different problems based on reasoning complexity and uses the estimated token budgets to guide the reasoning process. Experiments show that our method effectively reduces token costs in CoT reasoning with only a slight performance reduction, offering a practical solution to balance efficiency and accuracy in LLM reasoning.

Consistency Checks for Language Model Forecasters,"Daniel Paleka, Abhimanyu Pallavi Sudhir, Alejandro Alvarez, Vineeth Bhat, Adam Shen, Evan Wang, Florian Tramèr","Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters instantaneously? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on arbitrage: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur can trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18544v1,2024-12
Harnessing Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Question Answering via Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-Augmentation,"Derong Xu, Xinhang Li, Ziheng Zhang, Zhenxi Lin, Zhihong Zhu, Zhi Zheng, Xian Wu, Xiangyu Zhao, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of answers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge aspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question and relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of retrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even filtered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18537v2,2024-12
Characterizations of Language Generation With Breadth,"Alkis Kalavasis, Anay Mehrotra, Grigoris Velegkas","We study language generation in the limit, introduced by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24], building on classical works of Gold [Gol67] and Angluin [Ang79]. [KM24] proposed an algorithm that generates strings from any countable language collection in the limit. While their algorithm eventually outputs strings from the target language $K$, it sacrifices breadth, i.e., the ability to generate all strings in $K$. A key open question in [KM24] is whether this trade-off between consistency and breadth is inherrent.   Recent works proposed different notions of consistent generation with breadth. Kalavasis, Mehrotra, and Velegkas [KVM24] introduced three definitions: generation with exact breadth, approximate breadth, and unambiguous generation. Concurrently and independently, Charikar and Pabbaraju [CP24a] proposed exhaustive generation. Both works examined when generation with these notions of breadth is possible.   Building on [CP24a, KVM24], we fully characterize language generation for these notions and their natural combinations. For exact breadth, we provide an unconditional lower bound, removing a technical condition from [KVM24] and extending the result of [CP24a] that holds for specific collections of languages. We show that generation with exact breadth is characterized by Angluin's condition for identification. We further introduce a weaker version of Angluin's condition that tightly characterizes both approximate breadth and exhaustive generation, proving their equivalence. Additionally, we show that unambiguous generation is also characterized by Angluin's condition as a special case of a broader result. Finally, we strengthen [KVM24] by giving unconditional lower bounds for stable generators, showing that Angluin's condition characterizes the previous breadth notions for stable generators. This shows a separation between stable and unstable generation with approximate breadth.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18530v1,2024-12
DynaGRAG: Improving Language Understanding and Generation through Dynamic Subgraph Representation in Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation,Karishma Thakrar,"Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG or Graph RAG) architectures aim to enhance language understanding and generation by leveraging external knowledge. However, effectively capturing and integrating the rich semantic information present in textual and structured data remains a challenge. To address this, a novel GRAG framework is proposed to focus on enhancing subgraph representation and diversity within the knowledge graph. By improving graph density, capturing entity and relation information more effectively, and dynamically prioritizing relevant and diverse subgraphs, the proposed approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying semantic structure. This is achieved through a combination of de-duplication processes, two-step mean pooling of embeddings, query-aware retrieval considering unique nodes, and a Dynamic Similarity-Aware BFS (DSA-BFS) traversal algorithm. Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) through hard prompting further enhances the learning of rich node and edge representations while preserving the hierarchical subgraph structure. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GRAG framework, showcasing the significance of enhanced subgraph representation and diversity for improved language understanding and generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18644v1,2024-12

Our investigation serves as a case study leveraging specially designed datasets and experimental-scale LLMs to lay the groundwork for understanding these behaviors. Specifically, we aim to first enable LLMs to exhibit both memorization and generalization by training with the designed dataset, then (a) examine whether LLMs exhibit neuron-level spatial differentiation for memorization and generalization, (b) predict these behaviors using model internal representations, and (c) steer the behaviors through inference-time interventions. Our findings reveal that neuron-wise differentiation of memorization and generalization is observable in LLMs, and targeted interventions can successfully direct their behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18497v1,2024-12
Generating event descriptions under syntactic and semantic constraints,"Angela Cao, Faye Holt, Jonas Chan, Stephanie Richter, Lelia Glass, Aaron Steven White","With the goal of supporting scalable lexical semantic annotation, analysis, and theorizing, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different methods for generating event descriptions under both syntactic constraints -- e.g. desired clause structure -- and semantic constraints -- e.g. desired verb sense. We compare three different methods -- (i) manual generation by experts; (ii) sampling from a corpus annotated for syntactic and semantic information; and (iii) sampling from a language model (LM) conditioned on syntactic and semantic information -- along three dimensions of the generated event descriptions: (a) naturalness, (b) typicality, and (c) distinctiveness. We find that all methods reliably produce natural, typical, and distinctive event descriptions, but that manual generation continues to produce event descriptions that are more natural, typical, and distinctive than the automated generation methods. We conclude that the automated methods we consider produce event descriptions of sufficient quality for use in downstream annotation and analysis insofar as the methods used for this annotation and analysis are robust to a small amount of degradation in the resulting event descriptions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18496v1,2024-12
"How ""Real"" is Your Real-Time Simultaneous Speech-to-Text Translation System?","Sara Papi, Peter Polak, Ondřej Bojar, Dominik Macháček","Simultaneous speech-to-text translation (SimulST) translates source-language speech into target-language text concurrently with the speaker's speech, ensuring low latency for better user comprehension. Despite its intended application to unbounded speech, most research has focused on human pre-segmented speech, simplifying the task and overlooking significant challenges. This narrow focus, coupled with widespread terminological inconsistencies, is limiting the applicability of research outcomes to real-world applications, ultimately hindering progress in the field. Our extensive literature review of 110 papers not only reveals these critical issues in current research but also serves as the foundation for our key contributions. We 1) define the steps and core components of a SimulST system, proposing a standardized terminology and taxonomy; 2) conduct a thorough analysis of community trends, and 3) offer concrete recommendations and future directions to bridge the gaps in existing literature, from evaluation frameworks to system architectures, for advancing the field towards more realistic and effective SimulST solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18495v1,2024-12
Segment-Based Attention Masking for GPTs,"Shahar Katz, Liran Ringel, Yaniv Romano, Lior Wolf","Modern Language Models (LMs) owe much of their success to masked causal attention, the backbone of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models. Although GPTs can process the entire user prompt at once, the causal masking is applied to all input tokens step-by-step, mimicking the generation process. This imposes an unnecessary constraint during the initial ""prefill"" phase when the model processes the input prompt and generates the internal representations before producing any output tokens. In this work, attention is masked based on the known block structure at the prefill phase, followed by the conventional token-by-token autoregressive process after that. For example, in a typical chat prompt, the system prompt is treated as one block, and the user prompt as the next one. Each of these is treated as a unit for the purpose of masking, such that the first tokens in each block can access the subsequent tokens in a non-causal manner. Then, the model answer is generated in the conventional causal manner. This Segment-by-Segment scheme entails no additional computational overhead. When integrating it into models such as Llama and Qwen, state-of-the-art performance is consistently achieved.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18487v1,2024-12
Is Large Language Model Good at Triple Set Prediction? An Empirical Study,"Yuan Yuan, Yajing Xu, Wen Zhang","The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG. Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple. In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task. It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks. However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated. Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task. Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction. The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules. This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules. For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples. Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG. Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18443v1,2024-12

This study investigates the capability of state-of-the-art language models-RoBERTa Base, Bangla-BERT, and BERT Base-in automatically assessing Bangla passage-based question-answering from the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) textbooks for classes 6-10. A dataset of approximately 3,000 Bangla passage-based question-answering instances was compiled, and the models were evaluated using F1 Score and Exact Match (EM) metrics across various hyperparameter configurations. Our findings revealed that Bangla-BERT consistently outperformed the other models, achieving the highest F1 (0.75) and EM (0.53) scores, particularly with smaller batch sizes, the inclusion of stop words, and a moderate learning rate. In contrast, RoBERTa Base demonstrated the weakest performance, with the lowest F1 (0.19) and EM (0.27) scores under certain configurations. The results underscore the importance of fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimizing model performance and highlight the potential of machine learning models in evaluating text comprehension in educational contexts. However, limitations such as dataset size, spelling inconsistencies, and computational constraints emphasize the need for further research to enhance the robustness and applicability of these models.

Extracting triples from dialogues for conversational social agents,"Piek Vossen, Selene Báez Santamaría, Lenka Bajčetić, Thomas Belluci","Obtaining an explicit understanding of communication within a Hybrid Intelligence collaboration is essential to create controllable and transparent agents. In this paper, we describe a number of Natural Language Understanding models that extract explicit symbolic triples from social conversation. Triple extraction has mostly been developed and tested for Knowledge Base Completion using Wikipedia text and data for training and testing. However, social conversation is very different as a genre in which interlocutors exchange information in sequences of utterances that involve statements, questions, and answers. Phenomena such as co-reference, ellipsis, coordination, and implicit and explicit negation or confirmation are more prominent in conversation than in Wikipedia text. We therefore describe an attempt to fill this gap by releasing data sets for training and testing triple extraction from social conversation. We also created five triple extraction models and tested them in our evaluation data. The highest precision is 51.14 for complete triples and 69.32 for triple elements when tested on single utterances.

Multi-Agents Based on Large Language Models for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering,"Zhongjian Hu, Peng Yang, Bing Li, Zhenqi Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers. Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer.

This paper presents a novel multi-prompt ensemble decoding approach designed to bolster the generation quality of LLMs by leveraging the aggregation of outcomes from multiple prompts. Given a unique input $X$, we submit $n$ variations of prompts with $X$ to LLMs in batch mode to decode and derive probability distributions. For each token prediction, we calculate the ensemble probability by averaging the $n$ probability distributions within the batch, utilizing this aggregated probability to generate the token. This technique is dubbed Inner-Batch Ensemble. To facilitate efficient batch inference, we implement a Left-Padding strategy to maintain uniform input lengths across the n prompts.

Traditional evaluation methods for these comments, primarily based on text similarity, face two major challenges: inconsistent reliability of human-authored comments in open-source projects and the weak correlation of text similarity with objectives like enhancing code quality and detecting defects.   This study empirically analyzes benchmark comments using a novel set of criteria informed by prior research and developer interviews. We then similarly revisit the evaluation of existing methodologies. Our evaluation framework, DeepCRCEval, integrates human evaluators and Large Language Models (LLMs) for a comprehensive reassessment of current techniques based on the criteria set. Besides, we also introduce an innovative and efficient baseline, LLM-Reviewer, leveraging the few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs for a target-oriented comparison.   Our research highlights the limitations of text similarity metrics, finding that less than 10% of benchmark comments are high quality for automation. In contrast, DeepCRCEval effectively distinguishes between high and low-quality comments, proving to be a more reliable evaluation mechanism. Incorporating LLM evaluators into DeepCRCEval significantly boosts efficiency, reducing time and cost by 88.78% and 90.32%, respectively.

Recent advancements in large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in various code intelligence tasks including code understanding and generation. However, the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting code vulnerabilities is largely under-explored. This work aims to investigate the gap by fine-tuning LLMs for the CVD task, involving four widely-used open-source LLMs. We also implement other five previous graph-based or medium-size sequence models for comparison. Experiments are conducted on five commonly-used CVD datasets, including both the part of short samples and long samples. In addition, we conduct quantitative experiments to investigate the class imbalance issue and the model's performance on samples of different lengths, which are rarely studied in previous works. To better facilitate communities, we open-source all codes and resources of this study in https://github.com/SakiRinn/LLM4CVD and https://huggingface.co/datasets/xuefen/VulResource.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18260v2,2024-12
ICM-Assistant: Instruction-tuning Multimodal Large Language Models for Rule-based Explainable Image Content Moderation,"Mengyang Wu, Yuzhi Zhao, Jialun Cao, Mingjie Xu, Zhongming Jiang, Xuehui Wang, Qinbin Li, Guangneng Hu, Shengchao Qin, Chi-Wing Fu","Controversial contents largely inundate the Internet, infringing various cultural norms and child protection standards. Traditional Image Content Moderation (ICM) models fall short in producing precise moderation decisions for diverse standards, while recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), when adopted to general rule-based ICM, often produce classification and explanation results that are inconsistent with human moderators. Aiming at flexible, explainable, and accurate ICM, we design a novel rule-based dataset generation pipeline, decomposing concise human-defined rules and leveraging well-designed multi-stage prompts to enrich short explicit image annotations. Our ICM-Instruct dataset includes detailed moderation explanation and moderation Q-A pairs. Built upon it, we create our ICM-Assistant model in the framework of rule-based ICM, making it readily applicable in real practice. Our ICM-Assistant model demonstrates exceptional performance and flexibility. Specifically, it significantly outperforms existing approaches on various sources, improving both the moderation classification (36.8\% on average) and moderation explanation quality (26.6\% on average) consistently over existing MLLMs. Code/Data is available at https://github.com/zhaoyuzhi/ICM-Assistant.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18216v1,2024-12
Robustness-aware Automatic Prompt Optimization,"Zeru Shi, Zhenting Wang, Yongye Su, Weidi Luo, Fan Yang, Yongfeng Zhang","The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is based on the quality of the prompts and the semantic and structural integrity information of the input data. However, current prompt generation methods primarily focus on generating prompts for clean input data, often overlooking the impact of perturbed inputs on prompt performance. To address this limitation, we propose BATprompt (By Adversarial Training prompt), a novel method for prompt generation designed to withstand input perturbations (such as typos in the input). Inspired by adversarial training techniques, BATprompt demonstrates strong performance on a variety of perturbed tasks through a two-step process: adversarial perturbation and iterative optimization on unperturbed input via LLM. Unlike conventional adversarial attack methods, BATprompt avoids reliance on real gradients or model parameters. Instead, it leverages the advanced reasoning, language understanding and self reflection capabilities of LLMs to simulate gradients, guiding the generation of adversarial perturbations and optimizing prompt performance. In our experiments, we evaluate BATprompt on multiple datasets across both language understanding and generation tasks. The results indicate that BATprompt outperforms existing prompt generation methods, delivering superior robustness and performance under diverse perturbation scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18196v1,2024-12
VLABench: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Language-Conditioned Robotics Manipulation with Long-Horizon Reasoning Tasks,"Shiduo Zhang, Zhe Xu, Peiju Liu, Xiaopeng Yu, Yuan Li, Qinghui Gao, Zhaoye Fei, Zhangyue Yin, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang, Xipeng Qiu","General-purposed embodied agents are designed to understand the users' natural instructions or intentions and act precisely to complete universal tasks. Recently, methods based on foundation models especially Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have shown a substantial potential to solve language-conditioned manipulation (LCM) tasks well. However, existing benchmarks do not adequately meet the needs of VLAs and relative algorithms. To better define such general-purpose tasks in the context of LLMs and advance the research in VLAs, we present VLABench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating universal LCM task learning. VLABench provides 100 carefully designed categories of tasks, with strong randomization in each category of task and a total of 2000+ objects. VLABench stands out from previous benchmarks in four key aspects: 1) tasks requiring world knowledge and common sense transfer, 2) natural language instructions with implicit human intentions rather than templates, 3) long-horizon tasks demanding multi-step reasoning, and 4) evaluation of both action policies and language model capabilities. The benchmark assesses multiple competencies including understanding of mesh\&texture, spatial relationship, semantic instruction, physical laws, knowledge transfer and reasoning, etc. To support the downstream finetuning, we provide high-quality training data collected via an automated framework incorporating heuristic skills and prior information. The experimental results indicate that both the current state-of-the-art pretrained VLAs and the workflow based on VLMs face challenges in our tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18194v1,2024-12
An Analysis on Automated Metrics for Evaluating Japanese-English Chat Translation,"Andre Rusli, Makoto Shishido","This paper analyses how traditional baseline metrics, such as BLEU and TER, and neural-based methods, such as BERTScore and COMET, score several NMT models performance on chat translation and how these metrics perform when compared to human-annotated scores. The results show that for ranking NMT models in chat translations, all metrics seem consistent in deciding which model outperforms the others. This implies that traditional baseline metrics, which are faster and simpler to use, can still be helpful. On the other hand, when it comes to better correlation with human judgment, neural-based metrics outperform traditional metrics, with COMET achieving the highest correlation with the human-annotated score on a chat translation. However, we show that even the best metric struggles when scoring English translations from sentences with anaphoric zero-pronoun in Japanese.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18190v1,2024-12

The results are compared with several previous works, either by models using a similar zero-shot approach or a fully-supervised approach, to provide an overview of the zero-shot transfer learning approach's capability using XLM-R in comparison with existing models. Our models achieve the best result in one Japanese dataset and comparable results in other datasets in Japanese and Indonesian languages without being trained using the target language. Furthermore, the results suggest that it is possible to train a multi-lingual model, instead of one model for each language, and achieve promising results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18188v1,2024-12

scReader: Prompting Large Language Models to Interpret scRNA-seq Data,"Cong Li, Qingqing Long, Yuanchun Zhou, Meng Xiao","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements, primarily due to their capabilities in modeling the hidden relationships within text sequences. This innovation presents a unique opportunity in the field of life sciences, where vast collections of single-cell omics data from multiple species provide a foundation for training foundational models. However, the challenge lies in the disparity of data scales across different species, hindering the development of a comprehensive model for interpreting genetic data across diverse organisms. In this study, we propose an innovative hybrid approach that integrates the general knowledge capabilities of LLMs with domain-specific representation models for single-cell omics data interpretation. We begin by focusing on genes as the fundamental unit of representation. Gene representations are initialized using functional descriptions, leveraging the strengths of mature language models such as LLaMA-2. By inputting single-cell gene-level expression data with prompts, we effectively model cellular representations based on the differential expression levels of genes across various species and cell types. In the experiments, we constructed developmental cells from humans and mice, specifically targeting cells that are challenging to annotate. We evaluated our methodology through basic tasks such as cell annotation and visualization analysis. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach compared to other methods using LLMs, highlighting significant improvements in accuracy and interoperability. Our hybrid approach enhances the representation of single-cell data and offers a robust framework for future research in cross-species genetic analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18156v1,2024-12
GeneSUM: Large Language Model-based Gene Summary Extraction,"Zhijian Chen, Chuan Hu, Min Wu, Qingqing Long, Xuezhi Wang, Yuanchun Zhou, Meng Xiao","Emerging topics in biomedical research are continuously expanding, providing a wealth of information about genes and their function. This rapid proliferation of knowledge presents unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery and formidable challenges for researchers striving to keep abreast of the latest advancements. One significant challenge is navigating the vast corpus of literature to extract vital gene-related information, a time-consuming and cumbersome task. To enhance the efficiency of this process, it is crucial to address several key challenges: (1) the overwhelming volume of literature, (2) the complexity of gene functions, and (3) the automated integration and generation. In response, we propose GeneSUM, a two-stage automated gene summary extractor utilizing a large language model (LLM). Our approach retrieves and eliminates redundancy of target gene literature and then fine-tunes the LLM to refine and streamline the summarization process. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of our proposed framework. The results demonstrate that LLM significantly enhances the integration of gene-specific information, allowing more efficient decision-making in ongoing research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18154v1,2024-12
CoAM: Corpus of All-Type Multiword Expressions,"Yusuke Ide, Joshua Tanner, Adam Nohejl, Jacob Hoffman, Justin Vasselli, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe","Multiword expressions (MWEs) refer to idiomatic sequences of multiple words. MWE identification, i.e., detecting MWEs in text, can play a key role in downstream tasks such as machine translation. Existing datasets for MWE identification are inconsistently annotated, limited to a single type of MWE, or limited in size. To enable reliable and comprehensive evaluation, we created CoAM: Corpus of All-Type Multiword Expressions, a dataset of 1.3K sentences constructed through a multi-step process to enhance data quality consisting of human annotation, human review, and automated consistency checking. MWEs in CoAM are tagged with MWE types, such as Noun and Verb, to enable fine-grained error analysis. Annotations for CoAM were collected using a new interface created with our interface generator, which allows easy and flexible annotation of MWEs in any form, including discontinuous ones. Through experiments using CoAM, we find that a fine-tuned large language model outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach for MWE identification. Furthermore, analysis using our MWE type tagged data reveals that Verb MWEs are easier than Noun MWEs to identify across approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18151v1,2024-12
Are We in the AI-Generated Text World Already? Quantifying and Monitoring AIGT on Social Media,"Zhen Sun, Zongmin Zhang, Xinyue Shen, Ziyi Zhang, Yule Liu, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang, Xinlei He","Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, a systematic study to assess the prevalence of AIGTs on social media is still lacking. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify, monitor, and analyze the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs over time and observe different trends of AI Attribution Rate (AAR) across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18148v1,2024-12
Ensuring Consistency for In-Image Translation,"Chengpeng Fu, Xiaocheng Feng, Yichong Huang, Wenshuai Huo, Baohang Li, Zhirui Zhang, Yunfei Lu, Dandan Tu, Duyu Tang, Hui Wang, Bing Qin, Ting Liu","The in-image machine translation task involves translating text embedded within images, with the translated results presented in image format. While this task has numerous applications in various scenarios such as film poster translation and everyday scene image translation, existing methods frequently neglect the aspect of consistency throughout this process. We propose the need to uphold two types of consistency in this task: translation consistency and image generation consistency. The former entails incorporating image information during translation, while the latter involves maintaining consistency between the style of the text-image and the original image, ensuring background integrity. To address these consistency requirements, we introduce a novel two-stage framework named HCIIT (High-Consistency In-Image Translation) which involves text-image translation using a multimodal multilingual large language model in the first stage and image backfilling with a diffusion model in the second stage. Chain of thought learning is utilized in the first stage to enhance the model's ability to leverage image information during translation. Subsequently, a diffusion model trained for style-consistent text-image generation ensures uniformity in text style within images and preserves background details. A dataset comprising 400,000 style-consistent pseudo text-image pairs is curated for model training. Results obtained on both curated test sets and authentic image test sets validate the effectiveness of our framework in ensuring consistency and producing high-quality translated images.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18139v1,2024-12
LSAQ: Layer-Specific Adaptive Quantization for Large Language Model Deployment,"Binrui Zeng, Bin Ji, Xiaodong Liu, Jie Yu, Shasha Li, Jun Ma, Xiaopeng Li, Shangwen Wang, Xinran Hong","As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across various domains, the deployment of these models on edge devices has emerged as a new trend. Quantization techniques, which reduce the size and memory footprint of LLMs, are effective for enabling deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. However, existing one-size-fits-all quantization methods often fail to dynamically adjust the memory consumption of LLMs based on specific hardware characteristics and usage scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose LSAQ (Layer-Specific Adaptive Quantization), a system for adaptive quantization and dynamic deployment of LLMs based on layer importance. LSAQ evaluates layer importance by constructing top-k token sets from the inputs and outputs of each layer and calculating their Jaccard coefficient. Using this evaluation, the system adaptively adjusts quantization strategies in real time according to the resource availability of edge devices, assigning different precision levels to layers of varying importance. This approach significantly reduces the storage requirements of LLMs while maintaining model performance, enabling efficient deployment across diverse hardware platforms and usage scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18135v1,2024-12
AEIOU: A Unified Defense Framework against NSFW Prompts in Text-to-Image Models,"Yiming Wang, Jiahao Chen, Qingming Li, Xing Yang, Shouling Ji","As text-to-image (T2I) models continue to advance and gain widespread adoption, their associated safety issues are becoming increasingly prominent. Malicious users often exploit these models to generate Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) images using harmful or adversarial prompts, highlighting the critical need for robust safeguards to ensure the integrity and compliance of model outputs. Current internal safeguards frequently degrade image quality, while external detection methods often suffer from low accuracy and inefficiency.   In this paper, we introduce AEIOU, a defense framework that is Adaptable, Efficient, Interpretable, Optimizable, and Unified against NSFW prompts in T2I models. AEIOU extracts NSFW features from the hidden states of the model's text encoder, utilizing the separable nature of these features to detect NSFW prompts. The detection process is efficient, requiring minimal inference time. AEIOU also offers real-time interpretation of results and supports optimization through data augmentation techniques. The framework is versatile, accommodating various T2I architectures. Our extensive experiments show that AEIOU significantly outperforms both commercial and open-source moderation tools, achieving over 95% accuracy across all datasets and improving efficiency by at least tenfold. It effectively counters adaptive attacks and excels in few-shot and multi-label scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18123v1,2024-12
Do Language Models Understand the Cognitive Tasks Given to Them? Investigations with the N-Back Paradigm,"Xiaoyang Hu, Richard L. Lewis","Cognitive tasks originally developed for humans are now increasingly used to study language models. While applying these tasks is often straightforward, interpreting their results can be challenging. In particular, when a model underperforms, it is often unclear whether this results from a limitation in the cognitive ability being tested or a failure to understand the task itself. A recent study argues that GPT 3.5's declining performance on 2-back and 3-back tasks reflects a working memory capacity limit similar to humans (Gong et al., 2024). By analyzing a range of open-source language models of varying performance levels on these tasks, we show that the poor performance instead reflects a limitation in task comprehension and task set maintenance. In addition, we challenge the best-performing model with progressively harder versions of the task (up to 10-back) and experiment with alternative prompting strategies, before analyzing model attentions. Our larger aim is to contribute to the ongoing conversation around refining methodologies for the cognitive evaluation of language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18120v2,2024-12
Molly: Making Large Language Model Agents Solve Python Problem More Logically,"Rui Xiao, Jiong Wang, Lu Han, Na Zong, Han Wu","Applying large language models (LLMs) as teaching assists has attracted much attention as an integral part of intelligent education, particularly in computing courses. To reduce the gap between the LLMs and the computer programming education expert, fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) are the two mainstream methods in existing researches. However, fine-tuning for specific tasks is resource-intensive and may diminish the model`s generalization capabilities. RAG can perform well on reducing the illusion of LLMs, but the generation of irrelevant factual content during reasoning can cause significant confusion for learners. To address these problems, we introduce the Molly agent, focusing on solving the proposed problem encountered by learners when learning Python programming language. Our agent automatically parse the learners' questioning intent through a scenario-based interaction, enabling precise retrieval of relevant documents from the constructed knowledge base. At generation stage, the agent reflect on the generated responses to ensure that they not only align with factual content but also effectively answer the user's queries. Extensive experimentation on a constructed Chinese Python QA dataset shows the effectiveness of the Molly agent, indicating an enhancement in its performance for providing useful responses to Python questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18093v1,2024-12
Generating Traffic Scenarios via In-Context Learning to Learn Better Motion Planner,Aizierjiang Aiersilan,"Motion planning is a crucial component in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art motion planners are trained on meticulously curated datasets, which are not only expensive to annotate but also insufficient in capturing rarely seen critical scenarios. Failing to account for such scenarios poses a significant risk to motion planners and may lead to incidents during testing. An intuitive solution is to manually compose such scenarios by programming and executing a simulator (e.g., CARLA). However, this approach incurs substantial human costs. Motivated by this, we propose an inexpensive method for generating diverse critical traffic scenarios to train more robust motion planners. First, we represent traffic scenarios as scripts, which are then used by the simulator to generate traffic scenarios. Next, we develop a method that accepts user-specified text descriptions, which a Large Language Model (LLM) translates into scripts using in-context learning. The output scripts are sent to the simulator that produces the corresponding traffic scenarios. As our method can generate abundant safety-critical traffic scenarios, we use them as synthetic training data for motion planners. To demonstrate the value of generated scenarios, we train existing motion planners on our synthetic data, real-world datasets, and a combination of both. Our experiments show that motion planners trained with our data significantly outperform those trained solely on real-world data, showing the usefulness of our synthetic data and the effectiveness of our data generation method.

MMFactory: A Universal Solution Search Engine for Vision-Language Tasks,"Wan-Cyuan Fan, Tanzila Rahman, Leonid Sigal","With advances in foundational and vision-language models, and effective fine-tuning techniques, a large number of both general and special-purpose models have been developed for a variety of visual tasks. Despite the flexibility and accessibility of these models, no single model is able to handle all tasks and/or applications that may be envisioned by potential users. Recent approaches, such as visual programming and multimodal LLMs with integrated tools aim to tackle complex visual tasks, by way of program synthesis. However, such approaches overlook user constraints (e.g., performance / computational needs), produce test-time sample-specific solutions that are difficult to deploy, and, sometimes, require low-level instructions that maybe beyond the abilities of a naive user. To address these limitations, we introduce MMFactory, a universal framework that includes model and metrics routing components, acting like a solution search engine across various available models. Based on a task description and few sample input-output pairs and (optionally) resource and/or performance constraints, MMFactory can suggest a diverse pool of programmatic solutions by instantiating and combining visio-lingual tools from its model repository. In addition to synthesizing these solutions, MMFactory also proposes metrics and benchmarks performance / resource characteristics, allowing users to pick a solution that meets their unique design constraints. From the technical perspective, we also introduced a committee-based solution proposer that leverages multi-agent LLM conversation to generate executable, diverse, universal, and robust solutions for the user. Experimental results show that MMFactory outperforms existing methods by delivering state-of-the-art solutions tailored to user problem specifications.

Improving Factuality with Explicit Working Memory,"Mingda Chen, Yang Li, Karthik Padthe, Rulin Shao, Alicia Sun, Luke Zettlemoyer, Gargi Gosh, Wen-tau Yih","Large language models can generate factually inaccurate content, a problem known as hallucination. Recent works have built upon retrieved-augmented generation to improve factuality through iterative prompting but these methods are limited by the traditional RAG design. To address these challenges, we introduce EWE (Explicit Working Memory), a novel approach that enhances factuality in long-form text generation by integrating a working memory that receives real-time feedback from external resources. The memory is refreshed based on online fact-checking and retrieval feedback, allowing EWE to rectify false claims during the generation process and ensure more accurate and reliable outputs. Our experiments demonstrate that Ewe outperforms strong baselines on four fact-seeking long-form generation datasets, increasing the factuality metric, VeriScore, by 2 to 10 points absolute without sacrificing the helpfulness of the responses. Further analysis reveals that the design of rules for memory updates, configurations of memory units, and the quality of the retrieval datastore are crucial factors for influencing model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18069v1,2024-12

Neuron Empirical Gradient: Connecting Neurons' Linear Controllability and Representational Capacity,"Xin Zhao, Zehui Jiang, Naoki Yoshinaga","Although neurons in the feed-forward layers of pre-trained language models (PLMs) can store factual knowledge, most prior analyses remain qualitative, leaving the quantitative relationship among knowledge representation, neuron activations, and model output poorly understood. In this study, by performing neuron-wise interventions using factual probing datasets, we first reveal the linear relationship between neuron activations and output token probabilities. We refer to the gradient of this linear relationship as ``neuron empirical gradients.'' and propose NeurGrad, an efficient method for their calculation to facilitate quantitative neuron analysis. We next investigate whether neuron empirical gradients in PLMs encode general task knowledge by probing skill neurons. To this end, we introduce MCEval8k, a multi-choice knowledge evaluation benchmark spanning six genres and 22 tasks. Our experiments confirm that neuron empirical gradients effectively capture knowledge, while skill neurons exhibit efficiency, generality, inclusivity, and interdependency. These findings link knowledge to PLM outputs via neuron empirical gradients, shedding light on how PLMs store knowledge. The code and dataset are released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18053v1,2024-12
Factuality or Fiction? Benchmarking Modern LLMs on Ambiguous QA with Citations,"Maya Patel, Aditi Anand","Benchmarking modern large language models (LLMs) on complex and realistic tasks is critical to advancing their development. In this work, we evaluate the factual accuracy and citation performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on the task of Question Answering (QA) in ambiguous settings with source citations. Using three recently published datasets-DisentQA-DupliCite, DisentQA-ParaCite, and AmbigQA-Cite-featuring a range of real-world ambiguities, we analyze the performance of two leading LLMs, GPT-4o-mini and Claude-3.5. Our results show that larger, recent models consistently predict at least one correct answer in ambiguous contexts but fail to handle cases with multiple valid answers. Additionally, all models perform equally poorly in citation generation, with citation accuracy consistently at 0. However, introducing conflict-aware prompting leads to large improvements, enabling models to better address multiple valid answers and improve citation accuracy, while maintaining their ability to predict correct answers. These findings highlight the challenges and opportunities in developing LLMs that can handle ambiguity and provide reliable source citations. Our benchmarking study provides critical insights and sets a foundation for future improvements in trustworthy and interpretable QA systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18051v1,2024-12
Emoji Retrieval from Gibberish or Garbled Social Media Text: A Novel Methodology and A Case Study,"Shuqi Cui, Nirmalya Thakur, Audrey Poon","Emojis are widely used across social media platforms but are often lost in noisy or garbled text, posing challenges for data analysis and machine learning. Conventional preprocessing approaches recommend removing such text, risking the loss of emojis and their contextual meaning. This paper proposes a three-step reverse-engineering methodology to retrieve emojis from garbled text in social media posts. The methodology also identifies reasons for the generation of such text during social media data mining. To evaluate its effectiveness, the approach was applied to 509,248 Tweets about the Mpox outbreak, a dataset referenced in about 30 prior works that failed to retrieve emojis from garbled text. Our method retrieved 157,748 emojis from 76,914 Tweets. Improvements in text readability and coherence were demonstrated through metrics such as Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Coleman-Liau Index, Automated Readability Index, Dale-Chall Readability Score, Text Standard, and Reading Time.

For example, evaluations that focus on the top 50 most common codes are an oversimplification, as there are thousands of codes used in practice. This position paper aims to align AI coding research more closely with practical challenges of clinical coding.

Theoretical Constraints on the Expressive Power of $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Tensor Attention Transformers,"Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Mingda Wan","Tensor Attention extends traditional attention mechanisms by capturing high-order correlations across multiple modalities, addressing the limitations of classical matrix-based attention. Meanwhile, Rotary Position Embedding ($\mathsf{RoPE}$) has shown superior performance in encoding positional information in long-context scenarios, significantly enhancing transformer models' expressiveness. Despite these empirical successes, the theoretical limitations of these technologies remain underexplored. In this study, we analyze the circuit complexity of Tensor Attention and $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Tensor Attention, showing that with polynomial precision, constant-depth layers, and linear or sublinear hidden dimension, they cannot solve fixed membership problems or $(A_{F,r})^*$ closure problems, under the assumption that $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$. These findings highlight a gap between the empirical performance and theoretical constraints of Tensor Attention and $\mathsf{RoPE}$-based Tensor Attention Transformers, offering insights that could guide the development of more theoretically grounded approaches to Transformer model design and scaling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18040v1,2024-12
Explainability in Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing Tasks,"Melkamu Mersha, Mingiziem Bitewa, Tsion Abay, Jugal Kalita","Neural networks are widely regarded as black-box models, creating significant challenges in understanding their inner workings, especially in natural language processing (NLP) applications.

This study leverages LIME to interpret a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network trained on a text classification task. By analyzing the contribution of individual features to model predictions, the LIME approach enhances interpretability and supports informed decision-making.

Unlike established benchmarks, where each ticker has only around two earnings, DEC provides 20 earnings records per ticker. Using DEC, we reveal that post-earnings volatility undergoes significant shifts, with each ticker displaying a distinct volatility distribution. To leverage historical post-earnings volatility and capture ticker-specific patterns, we propose two training-free baselines: Post-earnings Volatility (PEV) and Same-ticker Post-earnings Volatility (STPEV). These baselines surpass all transcripts-based models on DEC as well as on established benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate that current transcript representations predominantly capture ticker identity rather than offering financially meaningful insights specific to each earnings. This is evidenced by two key observations: earnings representations from the same ticker exhibit significantly higher similarity compared to those from different tickers, and predictions from transcript-based models show strong correlations with prior post-earnings volatility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18029v1,2024-12
StructTest: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning through Compositional Structured Outputs,"Hailin Chen, Fangkai Jiao, Mathieu Ravaut, Nawshad Farruque, Xuan Phi Nguyen, Chengwei Qin, Manan Dey, Bosheng Ding, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty, Yingbo Zhou","The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) necessitates robust, unbiased, and scalable methods for evaluating their capabilities. However, human annotations are expensive to scale, model-based evaluations are prone to biases in answer style, while target-answer-based benchmarks are vulnerable to data contamination and cheating. To address these limitations, we propose StructTest, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability to produce compositionally specified structured outputs as an unbiased, cheap-to-run and difficult-to-cheat measure. The evaluation is done deterministically by a rule-based evaluator, which can be easily extended to new tasks. By testing structured outputs across diverse task domains -- including Summarization, Code, HTML and Math -- we demonstrate that StructTest serves as a good proxy for general reasoning abilities, as producing structured outputs often requires internal logical reasoning. We believe that StructTest offers a critical, complementary approach to objective and robust model evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18011v1,2024-12
Correctness is not Faithfulness in RAG Attributions,"Jonas Wallat, Maria Heuss, Maarten de Rijke, Avishek Anand","Retrieving relevant context is a common approach to reduce hallucinations and enhance answer reliability. Explicitly citing source documents allows users to verify generated responses and increases trust. Prior work largely evaluates citation correctness - whether cited documents support the corresponding statements. But citation correctness alone is insufficient. To establish trust in attributed answers, we must examine both citation correctness and citation faithfulness. In this work, we first disentangle the notions of citation correctness and faithfulness, which have been applied inconsistently in previous studies. Faithfulness ensures that the model's reliance on cited documents is genuine, reflecting actual reference use rather than superficial alignment with prior beliefs, which we call post-rationalization. We design an experiment that reveals the prevalent issue of post-rationalization, which undermines reliable attribution and may result in misplaced trust. Our findings suggest that current attributed answers often lack citation faithfulness (up to 57 percent of the citations), highlighting the need to evaluate correctness and faithfulness for trustworthy attribution in language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18004v1,2024-12
CARL-GT: Evaluating Causal Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models,"Ruibo Tu, Hedvig Kjellström, Gustav Eje Henter, Cheng Zhang","Causal reasoning capabilities are essential for large language models (LLMs) in a wide range of applications, such as education and healthcare. But there is still a lack of benchmarks for a better understanding of such capabilities. Current LLM benchmarks are mainly based on conversational tasks, academic math tests, and coding tests. Such benchmarks evaluate LLMs in well-regularized settings, but they are limited in assessing the skills and abilities to solve real-world problems. In this work, we provide a benchmark, named by CARL-GT, which evaluates CAusal Reasoning capabilities of large Language models using Graphs and Tabular data. The benchmark has a diverse range of tasks for evaluating LLMs from causal graph reasoning, knowledge discovery, and decision-making aspects. In addition, effective zero-shot learning prompts are developed for the tasks. In our experiments, we leverage the benchmark for evaluating open-source LLMs and provide a detailed comparison of LLMs for causal reasoning abilities. We found that LLMs are still weak in casual reasoning, especially with tabular data to discover new insights. Furthermore, we investigate and discuss the relationships of different benchmark tasks by analyzing the performance of LLMs. The experimental results show that LLMs have different strength over different tasks and that their performance on tasks in different categories, i.e., causal graph reasoning, knowledge discovery, and decision-making, shows stronger correlation than tasks in the same category.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17970v1,2024-12
Path-of-Thoughts: Extracting and Following Paths for Robust Relational Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Ge Zhang, Mohammad Ali Alomrani, Hongjian Gu, Jiaming Zhou, Yaochen Hu, Bin Wang, Qun Liu, Mark Coates, Yingxue Zhang, Jianye Hao","Large language models (LLMs) possess vast semantic knowledge but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks, particularly in relational reasoning problems such as kinship or spatial reasoning. In this paper, we present Path-of-Thoughts (PoT), a novel framework designed to tackle relation reasoning by decomposing the task into three key stages: graph extraction, path identification, and reasoning. Unlike previous approaches, PoT efficiently extracts a task-agnostic graph that identifies crucial entities, relations, and attributes within the problem context. Subsequently, PoT identifies relevant reasoning chains within the graph corresponding to the posed question, facilitating inference of potential answers. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets, demanding long reasoning chains, demonstrate that PoT surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin (maximum 21.3%) without necessitating fine-tuning or extensive LLM calls. Furthermore, as opposed to prior neuro-symbolic methods, PoT exhibits improved resilience against LLM errors by leveraging the compositional nature of graphs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17963v1,2024-12

VITRO: Vocabulary Inversion for Time-series Representation Optimization,"Filippos Bellos, Nam H. Nguyen, Jason J. Corso","Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and generating textual data, their pre-trained vocabularies are ill-suited for capturing the nuanced temporal dynamics and patterns inherent in time series. The discrete, symbolic nature of natural language tokens, which these vocabularies are designed to represent, does not align well with the continuous, numerical nature of time series data. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose VITRO. Our method adapts textual inversion optimization from the vision-language domain in order to learn a new time series per-dataset vocabulary that bridges the gap between the discrete, semantic nature of natural language and the continuous, numerical nature of time series data. We show that learnable time series-specific pseudo-word embeddings represent time series data better than existing general language model vocabularies, with VITRO-enhanced methods achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across most datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17921v1,2024-12
"A Multimodal Emotion Recognition System: Integrating Facial Expressions, Body Movement, Speech, and Spoken Language",Kris Kraack,"Traditional psychological evaluations rely heavily on human observation and interpretation, which are prone to subjectivity, bias, fatigue, and inconsistency. To address these limitations, this work presents a multimodal emotion recognition system that provides a standardised, objective, and data-driven tool to support evaluators, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, and clinicians. The system integrates recognition of facial expressions, speech, spoken language, and body movement analysis to capture subtle emotional cues that are often overlooked in human evaluations. By combining these modalities, the system provides more robust and comprehensive emotional state assessment, reducing the risk of mis- and overdiagnosis. Preliminary testing in a simulated real-world condition demonstrates the system's potential to provide reliable emotional insights to improve the diagnostic accuracy. This work highlights the promise of automated multimodal analysis as a valuable complement to traditional psychological evaluation practices, with applications in clinical and therapeutic settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17907v1,2024-12
Cross-Lingual Text-Rich Visual Comprehension: An Information Theory Perspective,"Xinmiao Yu, Xiaocheng Feng, Yun Li, Minghui Liao, Ya-Qi Yu, Xiachong Feng, Weihong Zhong, Ruihan Chen, Mengkang Hu, Jihao Wu, Dandan Tu, Duyu Tang, Bing Qin","Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promising reasoning capabilities on text-rich images from charts, tables, and documents. However, the abundant text within such images may increase the model's sensitivity to language. This raises the need to evaluate LVLM performance on cross-lingual text-rich visual inputs, where the language in the image differs from the language of the instructions. To address this, we introduce XT-VQA (Cross-Lingual Text-Rich Visual Question Answering), a benchmark designed to assess how LVLMs handle language inconsistency between image text and questions. XT-VQA integrates five existing text-rich VQA datasets and a newly collected dataset, XPaperQA, covering diverse scenarios that require faithful recognition and comprehension of visual information despite language inconsistency. Our evaluation of prominent LVLMs on XT-VQA reveals a significant drop in performance for cross-lingual scenarios, even for models with multilingual capabilities. A mutual information analysis suggests that this performance gap stems from cross-lingual questions failing to adequately activate relevant visual information. To mitigate this issue, we propose MVCL-MI (Maximization of Vision-Language Cross-Lingual Mutual Information), where a visual-text cross-lingual alignment is built by maximizing mutual information between the model's outputs and visual information. This is achieved by distilling knowledge from monolingual to cross-lingual settings through KL divergence minimization, where monolingual output logits serve as a teacher. Experimental results on the XT-VQA demonstrate that MVCL-MI effectively reduces the visual-text cross-lingual performance disparity while preserving the inherent capabilities of LVLMs, shedding new light on the potential practice for improving LVLMs. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Stardust-y/XTVQA.git",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17787v1,2024-12
ResearchTown: Simulator of Human Research Community,"Haofei Yu, Zhaochen Hong, Zirui Cheng, Kunlun Zhu, Keyang Xuan, Jinwei Yao, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in scientific domains, yet a fundamental question remains unanswered: Can we simulate human research communities with LLMs? Addressing this question can deepen our understanding of the processes behind idea brainstorming and inspire the automatic discovery of novel scientific insights. In this work, we propose ResearchTown, a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within this framework, the human research community is simplified and modeled as an agent-data graph, where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration relationships. We also introduce TextGNN, a text-based inference framework that models various research activities (e.g., paper reading, paper writing, and review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research simulation, we present ResearchBench, a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) ResearchTown can provide a realistic simulation of collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing; (2) ResearchTown can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and diverse papers; (3) ResearchTown can generate interdisciplinary research ideas that potentially inspire novel research directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17767v1,2024-12
In Case You Missed It: ARC 'Challenge' Is Not That Challenging,Łukasz Borchmann,"ARC Challenge appears more difficult than ARC Easy for modern LLMs primarily due to an evaluation setup that prevents direct comparison of answer choices rather than inherent complexity. Although some researchers have quietly shifted to a more appropriate scheme over the last year, the implications of this change have yet to be widely acknowledged. We highlight this overlooked shift, show how similar evaluation practices falsely imply reasoning deficits in other benchmarks, and demonstrate that fairer methods dramatically reduce performance gaps (e.g. on SIQA) and even yield superhuman results (OpenBookQA). In doing so, we reveal how evaluation shapes perceived difficulty and offer guidelines to ensure that multiple-choice evaluations accurately reflect actual model capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17758v1,2024-12
Deliberation in Latent Space via Differentiable Cache Augmentation,"Luyang Liu, Jonas Pfeiffer, Jiaxing Wu, Jun Xie, Arthur Szlam","Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to ""think more"" by generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17747v1,2024-12
RepoTransBench: A Real-World Benchmark for Repository-Level Code Translation,"Yanli Wang, Yanlin Wang, Suiquan Wang, Daya Guo, Jiachi Chen, John Grundy, Xilin Liu, Yuchi Ma, Mingzhi Mao, Hongyu Zhang, Zibin Zheng","Repository-level code translation refers to translating an entire code repository from one programming language to another while preserving the functionality of the source repository. Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world repository-level code translation benchmark with an automatically executable test suite. We conduct experiments on RepoTransBench to evaluate the translation performance of 11 advanced LLMs. We find that the Success@1 score (test success in one attempt) of the best-performing LLM is only 7.33%. To further explore the potential of LLMs for repository-level code translation, we provide LLMs with error-related feedback to perform iterative debugging and observe an average 7.09% improvement on Success@1. However, even with this improvement, the Success@1 score of the best-performing LLM is only 21%, which may not meet the need for reliable automatic repository-level code translation. Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17744v1,2024-12

Our pre-training approach focuses on enhancing training efficacy through three key technical contributions: an elaborate data pipeline combines data cleaning with data schedule strategies, a robust optimization method to mitigate training instability, and an effective annealing approach that incorporates targeted data selection and long context training. Remarkably, YuLan-Mini, trained on 1.08T tokens, achieves performance comparable to industry-leading models that require significantly more data.

Fourier Position Embedding: Enhancing Attention's Periodic Extension for Length Generalization,"Ermo Hua, Che Jiang, Xingtai Lv, Kaiyan Zhang, Ning Ding, Youbang Sun, Biqing Qi, Yuchen Fan, Xuekai Zhu, Bowen Zhou","Extending the context length of Language Models (LMs) by improving Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has become a trend. While existing works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention mechanism, this paper provides an analysis across nearly all parts of LMs, uncovering their adverse effects on length generalization for RoPE-based attention. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectral damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions outside of attention; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs Fourier Series and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales show that, within varying context windows, FoPE can maintain a more stable perplexity and a more consistent accuracy in a needle-in-haystack task compared to RoPE and ALiBi. Several analyses and ablations bring further support to our method and theoretical modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17739v2,2024-12

Chumor is sourced from Ruo Zhi Ba, a Chinese Reddit-like platform known for sharing intellectually challenging and culturally specific jokes. We test ten LLMs through direct and chain-of-thought prompting, revealing that Chumor poses significant challenges to existing LLMs, with their accuracy slightly above random and far below human.

Knowledge Editing through Chain-of-Thought,"Changyue Wang, Weihang Su, Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, keeping these models up-to-date with evolving world knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the high costs of frequent retraining. To address this challenge, knowledge editing techniques have emerged to update LLMs with new information without rebuilding the model from scratch. Among these, the in-context editing paradigm stands out for its effectiveness in integrating new knowledge while preserving the model's original capabilities. Despite its potential, existing in-context knowledge editing methods are often task-specific, focusing primarily on multi-hop QA tasks using structured knowledge triples. Moreover, their reliance on few-shot prompting for task decomposition makes them unstable and less effective in generalizing across diverse tasks.   In response to these limitations, we propose EditCoT, a novel knowledge editing framework that flexibly and efficiently updates LLMs across various tasks without retraining. EditCoT works by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) for a given input and then iteratively refining this CoT process using a CoT editor based on updated knowledge. We evaluate EditCoT across a diverse range of benchmarks, covering multiple languages and tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering superior generalization, effectiveness, and stability compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of knowledge updating.

From Models to Microtheories: Distilling a Model's Topical Knowledge for Grounded Question Answering,"Nathaniel Weir, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Orion Weller, Oyvind Tafjord, Sam Hornstein, Alexander Sabol, Peter Jansen, Benjamin Van Durme, Peter Clark","Recent reasoning methods (e.g., chain-of-thought, entailment reasoning) help users understand how language models (LMs) answer a single question, but they do little to reveal the LM's overall understanding, or ""theory,"" about the question's topic, making it still hard to trust the model. Our goal is to materialize such theories - here called microtheories (a linguistic analog of logical microtheories) - as a set of sentences encapsulating an LM's core knowledge about a topic. These statements systematically work together to entail answers to a set of questions to both engender trust and improve performance. Our approach is to first populate a knowledge store with (model-generated) sentences that entail answers to training questions and then distill those down to a core microtheory that is concise, general, and non-redundant. We show that, when added to a general corpus (e.g., Wikipedia), microtheories can supply critical, topical information not necessarily present in the corpus, improving both a model's ability to ground its answers to verifiable knowledge (i.e., show how answers are systematically entailed by documents in the corpus, fully grounding up to +8% more answers), and the accuracy of those grounded answers (up to +8% absolute). We also show that, in a human evaluation in the medical domain, our distilled microtheories contain a significantly higher concentration of topically critical facts than the non-distilled knowledge store. Finally, we show we can quantify the coverage of a microtheory for a topic (characterized by a dataset) using a notion of $p$-relevance. Together, these suggest that microtheories are an efficient distillation of an LM's topic-relevant knowledge, that they can usefully augment existing corpora, and can provide both performance gains and an interpretable, verifiable window into the model's knowledge of a topic.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17701v2,2024-12
Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic,"Kyle Richardson, Vivek Srikumar, Ashish Sabharwal","Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic expression that characterizes its semantics? How do the semantics of two losses relate to each other? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful guidance to those working on human AI alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17696v1,2024-12
RAGONITE: Iterative Retrieval on Induced Databases and Verbalized RDF for Conversational QA over KGs with RAG,"Rishiraj Saha Roy, Chris Hinze, Joel Schlotthauer, Farzad Naderi, Viktor Hangya, Andreas Foltyn, Luzian Hahn, Fabian Kuech","Conversational question answering (ConvQA) is a convenient means of searching over RDF knowledge graphs (KGs), where a prevalent approach is to translate natural language questions to SPARQL queries. However, SPARQL has certain shortcomings: (i) it is brittle for complex intents and conversational questions, and (ii) it is not suitable for more abstract needs. Instead, we propose a novel two-pronged system where we fuse: (i) SQL-query results over a database automatically derived from the KG, and (ii) text-search results over verbalizations of KG facts. Our pipeline supports iterative retrieval: when the results of any branch are found to be unsatisfactory, the system can automatically opt for further rounds. We put everything together in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setup, where an LLM generates a coherent response from accumulated search results. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over several baselines on a knowledge graph of BMW automobiles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17690v3,2024-12

Generating Completions for Fragmented Broca's Aphasic Sentences Using Large Language Models,"Sijbren van Vaals, Yevgen Matusevych, Frank Tsiwah","Broca's aphasia is a type of aphasia characterized by non-fluent, effortful and fragmented speech production with relatively good comprehension. Since traditional aphasia treatment methods are often time-consuming, labour-intensive, and do not reflect real-world conversations, applying natural language processing based approaches such as Large Language Models (LLMs) could potentially contribute to improving existing treatment approaches. To address this issue, we explore the use of sequence-to-sequence LLMs for completing fragmented Broca's aphasic sentences. We first generate synthetic Broca's aphasic data using a rule-based system designed to mirror the linguistic characteristics of Broca's aphasic speech. Using this synthetic data, we then fine-tune four pre-trained LLMs on the task of completing fragmented sentences. We evaluate our fine-tuned models on both synthetic and authentic Broca's aphasic data. We demonstrate LLMs' capability for reconstructing fragmented sentences, with the models showing improved performance with longer input utterances. Our result highlights the LLMs' potential in advancing communication aids for individuals with Broca's aphasia and possibly other clinical populations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17669v1,2024-12
The Power of Adaptation: Boosting In-Context Learning through Adaptive Prompting,"Shuzhang Cai, Twumasi Mensah-Boateng, Xander Kuksov, Jing Yuan, Shaojie Tang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities across a broad range of language-related tasks, including generating solutions to complex reasoning problems. An effective technique to enhance LLM performance is in-context learning, which encourages a step-by-step reasoning process by including explanatory examples to guide the model's responses. However, selecting appropriate exemplars for the model poses a challenge, as each dataset demands a distinct set of exemplars to enable the LLM to learn effectively and perform well on the test set. Current studies often rely on uncertainty- or diversity-based selection strategies to select exemplars for annotation and to improve model learning. However, these studies typically employ a non-adaptive approach, selecting a set of exemplars all at once. We argue that this non-adaptive strategy may result in a set of exemplars with high redundancy in terms of the knowledge covered, ultimately reducing their overall informativeness. To address this limitation, we propose \textsc{Adaptive-Prompt}, a novel method that adaptively selects exemplars by leveraging model feedback from previously chosen exemplars. Experimental results show that \textsc{Adaptive-Prompt} significantly enhances LLM performance across a variety of reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17891v1,2024-12

We introduce LiveIdeaBench, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates LLMs' scientific creativity and divergent thinking capabilities using single-keyword prompts. Drawing from Guilford's creativity theory, our framework employs a dynamic panel of state-of-the-art LLMs to assess generated ideas across four key dimensions: originality, feasibility, fluency, and flexibility. Through extensive experimentation with 20 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 18 scientific domains, we reveal that scientific creative ability shows distinct patterns from general intelligence metrics. Notably, our results demonstrate that models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve comparable creative performance to top-tier models like o1-preview, despite significant gaps in their general intelligence scores. These findings highlight the importance of specialized evaluation frameworks for scientific creativity and suggest that the development of creative capabilities in LLMs may follow different trajectories than traditional problem-solving abilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17596v1,2024-12
Investigating Length Issues in Document-level Machine Translation,"Ziqian Peng, Rachel Bawden, François Yvon","Transformer architectures are increasingly effective at processing and generating very long chunks of texts, opening new perspectives for document-level machine translation (MT). In this work, we challenge the ability of MT systems to handle texts comprising up to several thousands of tokens. We design and implement a new approach designed to precisely measure the effect of length increments on MT outputs. Our experiments with two representative architectures unambiguously show that (a)~translation performance decreases with the length of the input text; (b)~the position of sentences within the document matters and translation quality is higher for sentences occurring earlier in a document. We further show that manipulating the distribution of document lengths and of positional embeddings only marginally mitigates such problems. Our results suggest that even though document-level MT is computationally feasible, it does not yet match the performance of sentence-based MT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17592v1,2024-12
ERUPD -- English to Roman Urdu Parallel Dataset,"Mohammed Furqan, Raahid Bin Khaja, Rayyan Habeeb","Bridging linguistic gaps fosters global growth and cultural exchange. This study addresses the challenges of Roman Urdu -- a Latin-script adaptation of Urdu widely used in digital communication -- by creating a novel parallel dataset comprising 75,146 sentence pairs. Roman Urdu's lack of standardization, phonetic variability, and code-switching with English complicates language processing. We tackled this by employing a hybrid approach that combines synthetic data generated via advanced prompt engineering with real-world conversational data from personal messaging groups. We further refined the dataset through a human evaluation phase, addressing linguistic inconsistencies and ensuring accuracy in code-switching, phonetic representations, and synonym variability. The resulting dataset captures Roman Urdu's diverse linguistic features and serves as a critical resource for machine translation, sentiment analysis, and multilingual education.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17562v1,2024-12
A Survey of Query Optimization in Large Language Models,"Mingyang Song, Mao Zheng","\textit{Query Optimization} (QO) refers to techniques aimed at enhancing the efficiency and quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and answering queries, especially complex ones in scenarios like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, RAG mitigates the limitations of LLMs by dynamically retrieving and leveraging up-to-date relevant information, which provides a cost-effective solution to the challenge of LLMs producing plausible but potentially inaccurate responses. Recently, as RAG evolves and incorporates multiple components that influence its performance, QO has emerged as a critical element, playing a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness of RAG's retrieval stage in accurately sourcing the necessary multiple pieces of evidence to answer queries correctly. In this paper, we trace the evolution of QO techniques by summarizing and analyzing significant studies. Through an organized framework and categorization, we aim to consolidate existing QO techniques in RAG, elucidate their technological foundations, and highlight their potential to enhance the versatility and applications of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17558v1,2024-12

By analysing cosine similarity scores, the methods' strengths and limitations are highlighted. The findings underscore TF-IDF's reliance on lexical overlap and Word2Vec's superior semantic generalisation, particularly in cross-domain comparisons. BERT demonstrates lower performance in challenging domains, likely due to insufficient domainspecific fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17552v1,2024-12
"Resource-Aware Arabic LLM Creation: Model Adaptation, Integration, and Multi-Domain Testing",Prakash Aryan,"This paper presents a novel approach to fine-tuning the Qwen2-1.5B model for Arabic language processing using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on a system with only 4GB VRAM. We detail the process of adapting this large language model to the Arabic domain, using diverse datasets including Bactrian, OpenAssistant, and Wikipedia Arabic corpora. Our methodology involves custom data preprocessing, model configuration, and training optimization techniques such as gradient accumulation and mixed-precision training. We address specific challenges in Arabic NLP, including morphological complexity, dialectal variations, and diacritical mark handling. Experimental results over 10,000 training steps show significant performance improvements, with the final loss converging to 0.1083. We provide comprehensive analysis of GPU memory usage, training dynamics, and model evaluation across various Arabic language tasks, including text classification, question answering, and dialect identification. The fine-tuned model demonstrates robustness to input perturbations and improved handling of Arabic-specific linguistic phenomena.

Domain adapted machine translation: What does catastrophic forgetting forget and why?,"Danielle Saunders, Steve DeNeefe","Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models can be specialized by domain adaptation, often involving fine-tuning on a dataset of interest. This process risks catastrophic forgetting: rapid loss of generic translation quality. Forgetting has been widely observed, with many mitigation methods proposed. However, the causes of forgetting and the relationship between forgetting and adaptation data are under-explored.   This paper takes a novel approach to understanding catastrophic forgetting during NMT adaptation by investigating the impact of the data. We provide a first investigation of what is forgotten, and why. We examine the relationship between forgetting and the in-domain data, and show that the amount and type of forgetting is linked to that data's target vocabulary coverage. Our findings pave the way toward better informed NMT domain adaptation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17537v1,2024-12
CiteBART: Learning to Generate Citations for Local Citation Recommendation,"Ege Yiğit Çelik, Selma Tekir","Citations are essential building blocks in scientific writing. The scientific community is longing for support in their generation. Citation generation involves two complementary subtasks: Determining the citation worthiness of a context and, if it's worth it, proposing the best candidate papers for the citation placeholder. The latter subtask is called local citation recommendation (LCR). This paper proposes CiteBART, a custom BART pre-training based on citation token masking to generate citations to achieve LCR. In the base scheme, we mask the citation token in the local citation context to make the citation prediction. In the global one, we concatenate the citing paper's title and abstract to the local citation context to learn to reconstruct the citation token. CiteBART outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the citation recommendation benchmarks except for the smallest FullTextPeerRead dataset. The effect is significant in the larger benchmarks, e.g., Refseer and ArXiv. We present a qualitative analysis and an ablation study to provide insights into the workings of CiteBART. Our analyses confirm that its generative nature brings about a zero-shot capability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17534v1,2024-12

Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that specialized Polish language models achieve superior performance compared to multilingual alternatives, with transformer-based architectures showing particular strength in handling imbalanced categories.

DiffusionAttacker: Diffusion-Driven Prompt Manipulation for LLM Jailbreak,"Hao Wang, Hao Li, Junda Zhu, Xinyuan Wang, Chengwei Pan, MinLie Huang, Lei Sha","Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating harmful content when prompted with carefully crafted inputs, a vulnerability known as LLM jailbreaking. As LLMs become more powerful, studying jailbreak methods is critical to enhancing security and aligning models with human values. Traditionally, jailbreak techniques have relied on suffix addition or prompt templates, but these methods suffer from limited attack diversity. This paper introduces DiffusionAttacker, an end-to-end generative approach for jailbreak rewriting inspired by diffusion models. Our method employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) text diffusion model as a generator, conditioning on the original prompt and guiding the denoising process with a novel attack loss. Unlike previous approaches that use autoregressive LLMs to generate jailbreak prompts, which limit the modification of already generated tokens and restrict the rewriting space, DiffusionAttacker utilizes a seq2seq diffusion model, allowing more flexible token modifications. This approach preserves the semantic content of the original prompt while producing harmful content. Additionally, we leverage the Gumbel-Softmax technique to make the sampling process from the diffusion model's output distribution differentiable, eliminating the need for iterative token search. Extensive experiments on Advbench and Harmbench demonstrate that DiffusionAttacker outperforms previous methods across various evaluation metrics, including attack success rate (ASR), fluency, and diversity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17522v2,2024-12
DRT-o1: Optimized Deep Reasoning Translation via Long Chain-of-Thought,"Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Yunlong Liang, Jie Zhou","Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to quantify the translation in each round. In this way, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1. Using Qwen2.5 and LLama-3.1 as the backbones, DRT-o1 models can learn the thought process during machine translation, and outperform vanilla LLMs as well as existing O1-like LLMs, showing their effectiveness The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17498v2,2024-12
A Silver Bullet or a Compromise for Full Attention? A Comprehensive Study of Gist Token-based Context Compression,"Chenlong Deng, Zhisong Zhang, Kelong Mao, Shuaiyi Li, Xinting Huang, Dong Yu, Zhicheng Dou","In this work, we provide a thorough investigation of gist-based context compression methods to improve long-context processing in large language models. We focus on two key questions: (1) How well can these methods replace full attention models? and (2) What potential failure patterns arise due to compression? Through extensive experiments, we show that while gist-based compression can achieve near-lossless performance on tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and long-document QA, it faces challenges in tasks like synthetic recall. Furthermore, we identify three key failure patterns: lost by the boundary, lost if surprise, and lost along the way. To mitigate these issues, we propose two effective strategies: fine-grained autoencoding, which enhances the reconstruction of original token information, and segment-wise token importance estimation, which adjusts optimization based on token dependencies. Our work provides valuable insights into the understanding of gist token-based context compression and offers practical strategies for improving compression capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17483v1,2024-12

Developmental Predictive Coding Model for Early Infancy Mono and Bilingual Vocal Continual Learning,"Xiaodan Chen, Alexandre Pitti, Mathias Quoy, Nancy F Chen","Understanding how infants perceive speech sounds and language structures is still an open problem. Previous research in artificial neural networks has mainly focused on large dataset-dependent generative models, aiming to replicate language-related phenomena such as ''perceptual narrowing''. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using a small-sized generative neural network equipped with a continual learning mechanism based on predictive coding for mono-and bilingual speech sound learning (referred to as language sound acquisition during ''critical period'') and a compositional optimization mechanism for generation where no learning is involved (later infancy sound imitation). Our model prioritizes interpretability and demonstrates the advantages of online learning: Unlike deep networks requiring substantial offline training, our model continuously updates with new data, making it adaptable and responsive to changing inputs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that if second language acquisition occurs during later infancy, the challenges associated with learning a foreign language after the critical period amplify, replicating the perceptual narrowing effect.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17456v1,2024-12
Diving into Self-Evolving Training for Multimodal Reasoning,"Wei Liu, Junlong Li, Xiwen Zhang, Fan Zhou, Yu Cheng, Junxian He","Reasoning ability is essential for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In the absence of multimodal chain-of-thought annotated data, self-evolving training, where the model learns from its own outputs, has emerged as an effective and scalable approach for enhancing reasoning abilities. Despite its growing usage, a comprehensive understanding of self-evolving training, particularly in the context of multimodal reasoning, remains limited. In this paper, we delve into the intricacies of self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning, pinpointing three key factors: Training Method, Reward Model, and Prompt Variation. We systematically examine each factor and explore how various configurations affect the training's effectiveness. Our analysis leads to a set of best practices for each factor, aimed at optimizing multimodal reasoning. Furthermore, we explore the Self-Evolution Dynamics during training and the impact of automatic balancing mechanisms in boosting performance. After all the investigations, we present a final recipe for self-evolving training in multimodal reasoning, encapsulating these design choices into a framework we call MSTaR (Multimodal Self-evolving Training for Reasoning), which is universally effective for models with different sizes on various benchmarks, e.g., surpassing the pre-evolved model significantly on 5 multimodal reasoning benchmarks without using additional human annotations, as demonstrated on MiniCPM-V-2.5 (8B), Phi-3.5-Vision (4B) and InternVL2 (2B). We believe this study fills a significant gap in the understanding of self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning and offers a robust framework for future research. Our policy and reward models, as well as the collected data, is released to facilitate further investigation in multimodal reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17451v1,2024-12
Measuring Contextual Informativeness in Child-Directed Text,"Maria Valentini, Téa Wright, Ali Marashian, Jennifer Weber, Eliana Colunga, Katharina von der Wense","To address an important gap in creating children's stories for vocabulary enrichment, we investigate the automatic evaluation of how well stories convey the semantics of target vocabulary words, a task with substantial implications for generating educational content. We motivate this task, which we call measuring contextual informativeness in children's stories, and provide a formal task definition as well as a dataset for the task. We further propose a method for automating the task using a large language model (LLM). Our experiments show that our approach reaches a Spearman correlation of 0.4983 with human judgments of informativeness, while the strongest baseline only obtains a correlation of 0.3534. An additional analysis shows that the LLM-based approach is able to generalize to measuring contextual informativeness in adult-directed text, on which it also outperforms all baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17427v1,2024-12
Just What You Desire: Constrained Timeline Summarization with Self-Reflection for Enhanced Relevance,"Muhammad Reza Qorib, Qisheng Hu, Hwee Tou Ng","Given news articles about an entity, such as a public figure or organization, timeline summarization (TLS) involves generating a timeline that summarizes the key events about the entity. However, the TLS task is too underspecified, since what is of interest to each reader may vary, and hence there is not a single ideal or optimal timeline. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, called Constrained Timeline Summarization (CTLS), where a timeline is generated in which all events in the timeline meet some constraint. An example of a constrained timeline concerns the legal battles of Tiger Woods, where only events related to his legal problems are selected to appear in the timeline. We collected a new human-verified dataset of constrained timelines involving 47 entities and 5 constraints per entity. We propose an approach that employs a large language model (LLM) to summarize news articles according to a specified constraint and cluster them to identify key events to include in a constrained timeline. In addition, we propose a novel self-reflection method during summary generation, demonstrating that this approach successfully leads to improved performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17408v1,2024-12
WarriorCoder: Learning from Expert Battles to Augment Code Large Language Models,"Huawen Feng, Pu Zhao, Qingfeng Sun, Can Xu, Fangkai Yang, Lu Wang, Qianli Ma, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang","Despite recent progress achieved by code large language models (LLMs), their remarkable abilities are largely dependent on fine-tuning on the high-quality data, posing challenges for data collection and annotation. To address this, current methods often design various data flywheels to gather complex code instructions, enabling models to handle more intricate tasks. However, these approaches typically rely on off-the-shelf datasets and data augmentation from the limited pool of proprietary LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT4, and so on), which limits the diversity of the constructed data and makes it prone to systemic biases. In this paper, we propose WarriorCoder which learns from expert battles to address these limitations. Specifically, we create an arena for current expert code LLMs, where each model challenges and responds to others' challenges, with evaluations conducted by uninvolved judge models. This competitive framework generates novel training data constructed from scratch, harnessing the strengths of all participants. Experimental results demonstrate that WarriorCoder achieves competitive performance compared to previous methods, even without relying on proprietary LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17395v1,2024-12
Interweaving Memories of a Siamese Large Language Model,"Xin Song, Zhikai Xue, Guoxiu He, Jiawei Liu, Wei Lu","Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods optimize large language models (LLMs) by modifying or introducing a small number of parameters to enhance alignment with downstream tasks. However, they can result in catastrophic forgetting, where LLMs prioritize new knowledge at the expense of comprehensive world knowledge. A promising approach to mitigate this issue is to recall prior memories based on the original knowledge. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic PEFT framework, IMSM, which Interweaves Memories of a Siamese Large Language Model. Specifically, our siamese LLM is equipped with an existing PEFT method. Given an incoming query, it generates two distinct memories based on the pre-trained and fine-tuned parameters. IMSM then incorporates an interweaving mechanism that regulates the contributions of both original and enhanced memories when generating the next token. This framework is theoretically applicable to all open-source LLMs and existing PEFT methods. We conduct extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets, evaluating the performance of popular open-source LLMs using the proposed IMSM, in comparison to both classical and leading PEFT methods. Our findings indicate that IMSM maintains comparable time and space efficiency to backbone PEFT methods while significantly improving performance and effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17383v1,2024-12
Boosting LLM via Learning from Data Iteratively and Selectively,"Qi Jia, Siyu Ren, Ziheng Qin, Fuzhao Xue, Jinjie Ni, Yang You","Datasets nowadays are generally constructed from multiple sources and using different synthetic techniques, making data de-noising and de-duplication crucial before being used for post-training. In this work, we propose to perform instruction tuning by iterative data selection (\ApproachName{}). We measure the quality of a sample from complexity and diversity simultaneously. Instead of calculating the complexity score once for all before fine-tuning, we highlight the importance of updating this model-specific score during fine-tuning to accurately accommodate the dynamic changes of the model. On the other hand, the diversity score is defined on top of the samples' responses under the consideration of their informativeness. IterIT integrates the strengths of both worlds by iteratively updating the complexity score for the top-ranked samples and greedily selecting the ones with the highest complexity-diversity score. Experiments on multiple instruction-tuning data demonstrate consistent improvements of IterIT over strong baselines. Moreover, our approach also generalizes well to domain-specific scenarios and different backbone models.

Three-Class Text Sentiment Analysis Based on LSTM,Yin Qixuan,"Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) with applications in public opinion monitoring, market research, and beyond. This paper introduces a three-class sentiment classification method for Weibo comments using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to discern positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. LSTM, as a deep learning model, excels at capturing long-distance dependencies in text data, providing significant advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. Through preprocessing and feature extraction from Weibo comment texts, our LSTM model achieves precise sentiment prediction. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 98.31% and an F1 score of 98.28%, notably outperforming conventional models and other deep learning methods. This underscores the effectiveness of LSTM in capturing nuanced sentiment information within text, thereby enhancing classification accuracy. Despite its strengths, the LSTM model faces challenges such as high computational complexity and slower processing times for lengthy texts. Moreover, complex emotional expressions like sarcasm and humor pose additional difficulties. Future work could explore combining pre-trained models or advancing feature engineering techniques to further improve both accuracy and practicality. Overall, this study provides an effective solution for sentiment analysis on Weibo comments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17347v1,2024-12

These include limitations in domain-specific geological knowledge and difficulties in reasoning across multiple remote-sensing images, further exacerbating long-context issues. To address these, we present MineAgent, a modular framework leveraging hierarchical judging and decision-making modules to improve multi-image reasoning and spatial-spectral integration.

A Dual-Perspective Metaphor Detection Framework Using Large Language Models,"Yujie Lin, Jingyao Liu, Yan Gao, Ante Wang, Jinsong Su","Metaphor detection, a critical task in natural language processing, involves identifying whether a particular word in a sentence is used metaphorically. Traditional approaches often rely on supervised learning models that implicitly encode semantic relationships based on metaphor theories. However, these methods often suffer from a lack of transparency in their decision-making processes, which undermines the reliability of their predictions. Recent research indicates that LLMs (large language models) exhibit significant potential in metaphor detection. Nevertheless, their reasoning capabilities are constrained by predefined knowledge graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DMD, a novel dual-perspective framework that harnesses both implicit and explicit applications of metaphor theories to guide LLMs in metaphor detection and adopts a self-judgment mechanism to validate the responses from the aforementioned forms of guidance. In comparison to previous methods, our framework offers more transparent reasoning processes and delivers more reliable predictions. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of DMD, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across widely-used datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17332v2,2024-12
Assessing Human Editing Effort on LLM-Generated Texts via Compression-Based Edit Distance,"Nicolas Devatine, Louis Abraham","Assessing the extent of human edits on texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial to understanding the human-AI interactions and improving the quality of automated text generation systems. Existing edit distance metrics, such as Levenshtein, BLEU, ROUGE, and TER, often fail to accurately measure the effort required for post-editing, especially when edits involve substantial modifications, such as block operations. In this paper, we introduce a novel compression-based edit distance metric grounded in the Lempel-Ziv-77 algorithm, designed to quantify the amount of post-editing applied to LLM-generated texts. Our method leverages the properties of text compression to measure the informational difference between the original and edited texts. Through experiments on real-world human edits datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed metric is highly correlated with actual edit time and effort. We also show that LLMs exhibit an implicit understanding of editing speed, that aligns well with our metric. Furthermore, we compare our metric with existing ones, highlighting its advantages in capturing complex edits with linear computational efficiency.

Fast Gradient Computation for RoPE Attention in Almost Linear Time,"Yifang Chen, Jiayan Huo, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song","The Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) mechanism has become a powerful enhancement to the Transformer architecture, which enables models to capture token relationships when encoding positional information. However, the RoPE mechanisms make the computations of attention mechanisms more complicated, which makes efficient algorithms challenging. Earlier research introduced almost linear time, i.e., $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the number of input tokens, algorithms for the forward computation under specific parameter settings. However, achieving a subquadratic time algorithm for other parameter regimes remains impossible unless the widely accepted Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is disproven. In this work, we develop the first almost linear time algorithm for backward computations in the RoPE-based attention under bounded entries. Our approach builds on recent advancements in fast RoPE attention computations, utilizing a novel combination of the polynomial method and the Fast Fourier Transform. Furthermore, we show that with lower bounds derived from the SETH, the bounded entry condition is necessary for subquadratic performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17316v2,2024-12
CodeV: Issue Resolving with Visual Data,"Linhao Zhang, Daoguang Zan, Quanshun Yang, Zhirong Huang, Dong Chen, Bo Shen, Tianyu Liu, Yongshun Gong, Pengjie Huang, Xudong Lu, Guangtai Liang, Lizhen Cui, Qianxiang Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, with their applications in software engineering expanding to more complex repository-level tasks. GitHub issue resolving is a key challenge among these tasks. While recent approaches have made progress on this task, they focus on textual data within issues, neglecting visual data. However, this visual data is crucial for resolving issues as it conveys additional knowledge that text alone cannot. We propose CodeV, the first approach to leveraging visual data to enhance the issue-resolving capabilities of LLMs. CodeV resolves each issue by following a two-phase process: data processing and patch generation. To evaluate CodeV, we construct a benchmark for visual issue resolving, namely Visual SWE-bench. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeV, as well as provide valuable insights into leveraging visual data to resolve GitHub issues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17315v1,2024-12
Friends-MMC: A Dataset for Multi-modal Multi-party Conversation Understanding,"Yueqian Wang, Xiaojun Meng, Yuxuan Wang, Jianxin Liang, Qun Liu, Dongyan Zhao","Multi-modal multi-party conversation (MMC) is a less studied yet important topic of research due to that it well fits real-world scenarios and thus potentially has more widely-used applications. Compared with the traditional multi-modal conversations, MMC requires stronger character-centered understanding abilities as there are many interlocutors appearing in both the visual and textual context. To facilitate the study of this problem, we present Friends-MMC in this paper, an MMC dataset that contains 24,000+ unique utterances paired with video context. To explore the character-centered understanding of the dialogue, we also annotate the speaker of each utterance, the names and bounding bboxes of faces that appear in the video. Based on this Friends-MMC dataset, we further study two fundamental MMC tasks: conversation speaker identification and conversation response prediction, both of which have the multi-party nature with the video or image as visual context. For conversation speaker identification, we demonstrate the inefficiencies of existing methods such as pre-trained models, and propose a simple yet effective baseline method that leverages an optimization solver to utilize the context of two modalities to achieve better performance. For conversation response prediction, we fine-tune generative dialogue models on Friend-MMC, and analyze the benefits of speaker information. The code and dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/yellow-binary-tree/Friends-MMC and thus we call for more attention on modeling speaker information when understanding conversations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17295v1,2024-12
Learning from Mistakes: Self-correct Adversarial Training for Chinese Unnatural Text Correction,"Xuan Feng, Tianlong Gu, Xiaoli Liu, Liang Chang","Unnatural text correction aims to automatically detect and correct spelling errors or adversarial perturbation errors in sentences. Existing methods typically rely on fine-tuning or adversarial training to correct errors, which have achieved significant success. However, these methods exhibit poor generalization performance due to the difference in data distribution between training data and real-world scenarios, known as the exposure bias problem. In this paper, we propose a self-correct adversarial training framework for \textbf{L}earn\textbf{I}ng from \textbf{MI}s\textbf{T}akes (\textbf{LIMIT}), which is a task- and model-independent framework to correct unnatural errors or mistakes. Specifically, we fully utilize errors generated by the model that are actively exposed during the inference phase, i.e., predictions that are inconsistent with the target. This training method not only simulates potential errors in real application scenarios, but also mitigates the exposure bias of the traditional training process. Meanwhile, we design a novel decoding intervention strategy to maintain semantic consistency. Extensive experimental results on Chinese unnatural text error correction datasets show that our proposed method can correct multiple forms of errors and outperforms the state-of-the-art text correction methods. In addition, extensive results on Chinese and English datasets validate that LIMIT can serve as a plug-and-play defense module and can extend to new models and datasets without further training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17279v1,2024-12
LegalAgentBench: Evaluating LLM Agents in Legal Domain,"Haitao Li, Junjie Chen, Jingli Yang, Qingyao Ai, Wei Jia, Youfeng Liu, Kai Lin, Yueyue Wu, Guozhi Yuan, Yiran Hu, Wuyue Wang, Yiqun Liu, Minlie Huang","With the increasing intelligence and autonomy of LLM agents, their potential applications in the legal domain are becoming increasingly apparent. However, existing general-domain benchmarks cannot fully capture the complexity and subtle nuances of real-world judicial cognition and decision-making. Therefore, we propose LegalAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM Agents in the Chinese legal domain. LegalAgentBench includes 17 corpora from real-world legal scenarios and provides 37 tools for interacting with external knowledge. We designed a scalable task construction framework and carefully annotated 300 tasks. These tasks span various types, including multi-hop reasoning and writing, and range across different difficulty levels, effectively reflecting the complexity of real-world legal scenarios. Moreover, beyond evaluating final success, LegalAgentBench incorporates keyword analysis during intermediate processes to calculate progress rates, enabling more fine-grained evaluation. We evaluated eight popular LLMs, highlighting the strengths, limitations, and potential areas for improvement of existing models and methods. LegalAgentBench sets a new benchmark for the practical application of LLMs in the legal domain, with its code and data available at \url{https://github.com/CSHaitao/LegalAgentBench}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17259v1,2024-12
B-STaR: Monitoring and Balancing Exploration and Exploitation in Self-Taught Reasoners,"Weihao Zeng, Yuzhen Huang, Lulu Zhao, Yijun Wang, Zifei Shan, Junxian He","In the absence of extensive human-annotated data for complex reasoning tasks, self-improvement -- where models are trained on their own outputs -- has emerged as a primary method for enhancing performance. However, the critical factors underlying the mechanism of these iterative self-improving methods remain poorly understood, such as under what conditions self-improvement is effective, and what are the bottlenecks in the current iterations. In this work, we identify and propose methods to monitor two pivotal factors in this iterative process: (1) the model's ability to generate sufficiently diverse responses (exploration); and (2) the effectiveness of external rewards in distinguishing high-quality candidates from lower-quality ones (exploitation). Using mathematical reasoning as a case study, we begin with a quantitative analysis to track the dynamics of exploration and exploitation, discovering that a model's exploratory capabilities rapidly deteriorate over iterations, and the effectiveness of exploiting external rewards diminishes as well. Motivated by these findings, we introduce B-STaR, a Self-Taught Reasoning framework that autonomously adjusts configurations across iterations to Balance exploration and exploitation, thereby optimizing the self-improving effectiveness based on the current policy model and available rewards. Our experiments on mathematical reasoning, coding, and commonsense reasoning demonstrate that B-STaR not only enhances the model's exploratory capabilities throughout training but also achieves a more effective balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to superior performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17256v1,2024-12
Unlocking Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis through Emoji Interpretation: A Multimodal Generative AI Approach,"Rafid Ishrak Jahan, Heng Fan, Haihua Chen, Yunhe Feng","Emojis have become ubiquitous in online communication, serving as a universal medium to convey emotions and decorative elements. Their widespread use transcends language and cultural barriers, enhancing understanding and fostering more inclusive interactions. While existing work gained valuable insight into emojis understanding, exploring emojis' capability to serve as a universal sentiment indicator leveraging large language models (LLMs) has not been thoroughly examined. Our study aims to investigate the capacity of emojis to serve as reliable sentiment markers through LLMs across languages and cultures. We leveraged the multimodal capabilities of ChatGPT to explore the sentiments of various representations of emojis and evaluated how well emoji-conveyed sentiment aligned with text sentiment on a multi-lingual dataset collected from 32 countries. Our analysis reveals that the accuracy of LLM-based emoji-conveyed sentiment is 81.43%, underscoring emojis' significant potential to serve as a universal sentiment marker. We also found a consistent trend that the accuracy of sentiment conveyed by emojis increased as the number of emojis grew in text. The results reinforce the potential of emojis to serve as global sentiment indicators, offering insight into fields such as cross-lingual and cross-cultural sentiment analysis on social media platforms.

Highly Optimized Kernels and Fine-Grained Codebooks for LLM Inference on Arm CPUs,"Dibakar Gope, David Mansell, Danny Loh, Ian Bratt","Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we think about language understanding and generation, enthralling both researchers and developers. However, deploying LLMs for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented size and resource requirements. While quantizing model weights to sub-byte precision has emerged as a promising solution to ease memory pressure, the group quantization formats commonly used for LLM quantization have significant compute overheads and a resource-intensive dequantization process. As a result, a higher proportion of compute instructions do not perform multiplies, i.e., real work, rendering them unsuitable for meeting the required latency requirements for LLMs deployed on commodity CPUs. In this work, we propose a set of highly optimized kernels to accelerate LLM inference and unleash the full potential of CPUs, particularly Arm CPUs. These kernels amortize the cost of loading the operands and the cost of weight unpacking across multiple output rows. This, along with the introduction of an optimized interleaved group data layout for weights and decompression path optimizations to reduce unnecessary operations and dequantization overhead while maximizing the use of vector and matrix multiply operations, significantly improves the efficiency of MAC operations. Furthermore, we present a groupwise non-uniform codebook-based quantization method for ultra-low-precision quantization of LLMs to better match non-uniform patterns in their weight distributions, demonstrating better throughput during token generation while ensuring better quality than the state-of-the-art. Applying these improvements to 4-bit LLMs results in a 3-3.2x improvement in prompt processing and a 2x improvement in autoregressive decoding on Arm CPUs, compared to LLaMA.cpp-based solution. The optimized kernels are available at https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00032v1,2024-12
On the Generalization Ability of Machine-Generated Text Detectors,"Yule Liu, Zhiyuan Zhong, Yifan Liao, Zhen Sun, Jingyi Zheng, Jiaheng Wei, Qingyuan Gong, Fenghua Tong, Yang Chen, Yang Zhang, Xinlei He","The rise of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about machine-generated text (MGT), including ethical and practical issues like plagiarism and misinformation. Building a robust and highly generalizable MGT detection system has become increasingly important. This work investigates the generalization capabilities of MGT detectors in three aspects: First, we construct MGTAcademic, a large-scale dataset focused on academic writing, featuring human-written texts (HWTs) and MGTs across STEM, Humanities, and Social Sciences, paired with an extensible code framework for efficient benchmarking. Second, we investigate the transferability of detectors across domains and LLMs, leveraging fine-grained datasets to reveal insights into domain transferring and implementing few-shot techniques to improve the performance by roughly 13.2%. Third, we introduce a novel attribution task where models must adapt to new classes over time without (or with very limited) access to prior training data and benchmark detectors. We implement several adapting techniques to improve the performance by roughly 10% and highlight the inherent complexity of the task. Our findings provide insights into the generalization ability of MGT detectors across diverse scenarios and lay the foundation for building robust, adaptive detection systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17242v1,2024-12

The Brain-to-Text Benchmark '24 and associated competition was created to foster the advancement of decoding algorithms that convert neural activity to text. Here, we summarize the lessons learned from the competition ending on June 1, 2024 (the top 4 entrants also presented their experiences in a recorded webinar). The largest improvements in accuracy were achieved using an ensembling approach, where the output of multiple independent decoders was merged using a fine-tuned large language model (an approach used by all 3 top entrants). Performance gains were also found by improving how the baseline recurrent neural network (RNN) model was trained, including by optimizing learning rate scheduling and by using a diphone training objective. Improving upon the model architecture itself proved more difficult, however, with attempts to use deep state space models or transformers not yet appearing to offer a benefit over the RNN baseline.

"COVID-19 on YouTube: A Data-Driven Analysis of Sentiment, Toxicity, and Content Recommendations","Vanessa Su, Nirmalya Thakur","This study presents a data-driven analysis of COVID-19 discourse on YouTube, examining the sentiment, toxicity, and thematic patterns of video content published between January 2023 and October 2024. The analysis involved applying advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis with VADER, toxicity detection with Detoxify, and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The sentiment analysis revealed that 49.32% of video descriptions were positive, 36.63% were neutral, and 14.05% were negative, indicating a generally informative and supportive tone in pandemic-related content. Toxicity analysis identified only 0.91% of content as toxic, suggesting minimal exposure to toxic content. Topic modeling revealed two main themes, with 66.74% of the videos covering general health information and pandemic-related impacts and 33.26% focused on news and real-time updates, highlighting the dual informational role of YouTube. A recommendation system was also developed using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, refined by sentiment, toxicity, and topic filters to ensure relevant and context-aligned video recommendations. This system achieved 69% aggregate coverage, with monthly coverage rates consistently above 85%, demonstrating robust performance and adaptability over time. Evaluation across recommendation sizes showed coverage reaching 69% for five video recommendations and 79% for ten video recommendations per video. In summary, this work presents a framework for understanding COVID-19 discourse on YouTube and a recommendation system that supports user engagement while promoting responsible and relevant content related to COVID-19.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17180v1,2024-12
Analysis of Speech Temporal Dynamics in the Context of Speaker Verification and Voice Anonymization,"Natalia Tomashenko, Emmanuel Vincent, Marc Tommasi","In this paper, we investigate the impact of speech temporal dynamics in application to automatic speaker verification and speaker voice anonymization tasks. We propose several metrics to perform automatic speaker verification based only on phoneme durations. Experimental results demonstrate that phoneme durations leak some speaker information and can reveal speaker identity from both original and anonymized speech. Thus, this work emphasizes the importance of taking into account the speaker's speech rate and, more importantly, the speaker's phonetic duration characteristics, as well as the need to modify them in order to develop anonymization systems with strong privacy protection capacity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17164v1,2024-12
A Multi-AI Agent System for Autonomous Optimization of Agentic AI Solutions via Iterative Refinement and LLM-Driven Feedback Loops,"Kamer Ali Yuksel, Hassan Sawaf","Agentic AI systems use specialized agents to handle tasks within complex workflows, enabling automation and efficiency. However, optimizing these systems often requires labor-intensive, manual adjustments to refine roles, tasks, and interactions. This paper introduces a framework for autonomously optimizing Agentic AI solutions across industries, such as NLP-driven enterprise applications. The system employs agents for Refinement, Execution, Evaluation, Modification, and Documentation, leveraging iterative feedback loops powered by an LLM (Llama 3.2-3B). The framework achieves optimal performance without human input by autonomously generating and testing hypotheses to improve system configurations. This approach enhances scalability and adaptability, offering a robust solution for real-world applications in dynamic environments.

Bridging Auditory Perception and Language Comprehension through MEG-Driven Encoding Models,"Matteo Ciferri, Matteo Ferrante, Nicola Toschi","Understanding the neural mechanisms behind auditory and linguistic processing is key to advancing cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions. These insights refine our understanding of the brain's functional architecture in processing auditory and textual information, offering quantitative advancements in the modelling of neural responses to complex language stimuli.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03246v1,2024-12
LLMsAgainstHate @ NLU of Devanagari Script Languages 2025: Hate Speech Detection and Target Identification in Devanagari Languages via Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLMs,"Rushendra Sidibomma, Pransh Patwa, Parth Patwa, Aman Chadha, Vinija Jain, Amitava Das","The detection of hate speech has become increasingly important in combating online hostility and its real-world consequences. Despite recent advancements, there is limited research addressing hate speech detection in Devanagari-scripted languages, where resources and tools are scarce. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in language-related tasks, traditional fine-tuning approaches are often infeasible given the size of the models. In this paper, we propose a Parameter Efficient Fine tuning (PEFT) based solution for hate speech detection and target identification. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the Devanagari dataset provided by (Thapa et al., 2025), which contains annotated instances in 2 languages - Hindi and Nepali. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in handling Devanagari-scripted content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17131v2,2024-12

These capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse and unintended consequences as these systems become more widely deployed. This review synthesizes recent empirical work examining LLMs' capacity and proclivity for persuasion and deception, analyzes theoretical risks that could arise from these capabilities, and evaluates proposed mitigations. While current persuasive effects are relatively small, various mechanisms could increase their impact, including fine-tuning, multimodality, and social factors. We outline key open questions for future research, including how persuasive AI systems might become, whether truth enjoys an inherent advantage over falsehoods, and how effective different mitigation strategies may be in practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17128v1,2024-12
Learning to Adapt to Low-Resource Paraphrase Generation,"Zhigen Li, Yanmeng Wang, Rizhao Fan, Ye Wang, Jianfeng Li, Shaojun Wang","Paraphrase generation is a longstanding NLP task and achieves great success with the aid of large corpora. However, transferring a paraphrasing model to another domain encounters the problem of domain shifting especially when the data is sparse. At the same time, widely using large pre-trained language models (PLMs) faces the overfitting problem when training on scarce labeled data. To mitigate these two issues, we propose, LAPA, an effective adapter for PLMs optimized by meta-learning. LAPA has three-stage training on three types of related resources to solve this problem: 1. pre-training PLMs on unsupervised corpora, 2. inserting an adapter layer and meta-training on source domain labeled data, and 3. fine-tuning adapters on a small amount of target domain labeled data. This method enables paraphrase generation models to learn basic language knowledge first, then learn the paraphrasing task itself later, and finally adapt to the target task. Our experimental results demonstrate that LAPA achieves state-of-the-art in supervised, unsupervised, and low-resource settings on three benchmark datasets. With only 2\% of trainable parameters and 1\% labeled data of the target task, our approach can achieve a competitive performance with previous work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17111v1,2024-12
SAIL: Sample-Centric In-Context Learning for Document Information Extraction,"Jinyu Zhang, Zhiyuan You, Jize Wang, Xinyi Le","Document Information Extraction (DIE) aims to extract structured information from Visually Rich Documents (VRDs). Previous full-training approaches have demonstrated strong performance but may struggle with generalization to unseen data. In contrast, training-free methods leverage powerful pre-trained models like Large Language Models (LLMs) to address various downstream tasks with only a few examples. Nonetheless, training-free methods for DIE encounter two primary challenges: (1) understanding the complex relationship between layout and textual elements in VRDs, and (2) providing accurate guidance to pre-trained models. To address these challenges, we propose Sample-centric In-context Learning (SAIL) for DIE. SAIL introduces a fine-grained entity-level textual similarity to facilitate in-depth text analysis by LLMs and incorporates layout similarity to enhance the analysis of layouts in VRDs. Additionally, SAIL formulates a unified In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt template for various sample-centric examples, enabling tailored prompts that deliver precise guidance to pre-trained models for each sample. Extensive experiments on FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE benchmarks with various base models (e.g., LLMs) indicate that our method outperforms training-free baselines, even closer to the full-training methods. The results show the superiority and generalization of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17092v1,2024-12
Iterative NLP Query Refinement for Enhancing Domain-Specific Information Retrieval: A Case Study in Career Services,"Elham Peimani, Gurpreet Singh, Nisarg Mahyavanshi, Aman Arora, Awais Shaikh","Retrieving semantically relevant documents in niche domains poses significant challenges for traditional TF-IDF-based systems, often resulting in low similarity scores and suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing an iterative and semi-automated query refinement methodology tailored to Humber College's career services webpages. Initially, generic queries related to interview preparation yield low top-document similarities (approximately 0.2--0.3). To enhance retrieval effectiveness, we implement a two-fold approach: first, domain-aware query refinement by incorporating specialized terms such as resources-online-learning, student-online-services, and career-advising; second, the integration of structured educational descriptors like ""online resume and interview improvement tools."" Additionally, we automate the extraction of domain-specific keywords from top-ranked documents to suggest relevant terms for query expansion. Through experiments conducted on five baseline queries, our semi-automated iterative refinement process elevates the average top similarity score from approximately 0.18 to 0.42, marking a substantial improvement in retrieval performance. The implementation details, including reproducible code and experimental setups, are made available in our GitHub repositories \url{https://github.com/Elipei88/HumberChatbotBackend} and \url{https://github.com/Nisarg851/HumberChatbot}.

Computational Analysis of Character Development in Holocaust Testimonies,"Esther Shizgal, Eitan Wagner, Renana Keydar, Omri Abend","This work presents a computational approach to analyze character development along the narrative timeline. The analysis characterizes the inner and outer changes the protagonist undergoes within a narrative, and the interplay between them. We consider transcripts of Holocaust survivor testimonies as a test case, each telling the story of an individual in first-person terms. We focus on the survivor's religious trajectory, examining the evolution of their disposition toward religious belief and practice along the testimony. Clustering the resulting trajectories in the dataset, we identify common sequences in the data. Our findings highlight multiple common structures of religiosity across the narratives: in terms of belief, most present a constant disposition, while for practice, most present an oscillating structure, serving as valuable material for historical and sociological research. This work demonstrates the potential of natural language processing techniques for analyzing character evolution through thematic trajectories in narratives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17063v1,2024-12
Multi-Agent Sampling: Scaling Inference Compute for Data Synthesis with Tree Search-Based Agentic Collaboration,"Hai Ye, Mingbao Lin, Hwee Tou Ng, Shuicheng Yan","Scaling laws for inference compute in multi-agent systems remain under-explored compared to single-agent scenarios. This work aims to bridge this gap by investigating the problem of data synthesis through multi-agent sampling, where synthetic responses are generated by sampling from multiple distinct language models. Effective model coordination is crucial for successful multi-agent collaboration. Unlike previous approaches that rely on fixed workflows, we treat model coordination as a multi-step decision-making process, optimizing generation structures dynamically for each input question. We introduce Tree Search-based Orchestrated Agents~(TOA), where the workflow evolves iteratively during the sequential sampling process. To achieve this, we leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), integrating a reward model to provide real-time feedback and accelerate exploration. Our experiments on alignment, machine translation, and mathematical reasoning demonstrate that multi-agent sampling significantly outperforms single-agent sampling as inference compute scales. TOA is the most compute-efficient approach, achieving SOTA performance on WMT and a 71.8\% LC win rate on AlpacaEval. Moreover, fine-tuning with our synthesized alignment data surpasses strong preference learning methods on challenging benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and AlpacaEval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17061v1,2024-12
The HalluRAG Dataset: Detecting Closed-Domain Hallucinations in RAG Applications Using an LLM's Internal States,"Fabian Ridder, Malte Schilling","Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) is critical for enhancing their reliability and trustworthiness. Most research focuses on hallucinations as deviations from information seen during training. However, the opaque nature of an LLM's parametric knowledge complicates the understanding of why generated texts appear ungrounded: The LLM might not have picked up the necessary knowledge from large and often inaccessible datasets, or the information might have been changed or contradicted during further training. Our focus is on hallucinations involving information not used in training, which we determine by using recency to ensure the information emerged after a cut-off date. This study investigates these hallucinations by detecting them at sentence level using different internal states of various LLMs. We present HalluRAG, a dataset designed to train classifiers on these hallucinations. Depending on the model and quantization, MLPs trained on HalluRAG detect hallucinations with test accuracies ranging up to 75 %, with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 achieving the highest test accuracies. Our results show that IAVs detect hallucinations as effectively as CEVs and reveal that answerable and unanswerable prompts are encoded differently as separate classifiers for these categories improved accuracy. However, HalluRAG showed some limited generalizability, advocating for more diversity in datasets on hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17056v1,2024-12
Modular Conversational Agents for Surveys and Interviews,"Jiangbo Yu, Jinhua Zhao, Luis Miranda-Moreno, Matthew Korp","Surveys and interviews (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured) are widely used for collecting insights on emerging or hypothetical scenarios. Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by large language models (LLMs). However, as public investments and policies on infrastructure and services often involve substantial public stakes and environmental risks, there is a need for a rigorous, transparent, privacy-preserving, and cost-efficient development framework tailored for such major decision-making processes. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular approach and its resultant parameterized process for designing conversational agents. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic in the proposed approach. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) transportation expert consultation about future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript post-processing. The results show the effectiveness of this modular approach and how it addresses key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns, setting the stage for the next-generation surveys and interviews.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17049v1,2024-12
Why Do Speech Language Models Fail to Generate Semantically Coherent Outputs? A Modality Evolving Perspective,"Hankun Wang, Haoran Wang, Yiwei Guo, Zhihan Li, Chenpeng Du, Xie Chen, Kai Yu","Although text-based large language models exhibit human-level writing ability and remarkable intelligence, speech language models (SLMs) still struggle to generate semantically coherent outputs. There are several potential reasons for this performance degradation: (A) speech tokens mainly provide phonetic information rather than semantic information, (B) the length of speech sequences is much longer than that of text sequences, and (C) paralinguistic information, such as prosody, introduces additional complexity and variability. In this paper, we explore the influence of three key factors separately by transiting the modality from text to speech in an evolving manner. Our findings reveal that the impact of the three factors varies. Factor A has a relatively minor impact, factor B influences syntactical and semantic modeling more obviously, and factor C exerts the most significant impact, particularly in the basic lexical modeling. Based on these findings, we provide insights into the unique challenges of training SLMs and highlight pathways to develop more effective end-to-end SLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17048v1,2024-12
Shaping the Safety Boundaries: Understanding and Defending Against Jailbreaks in Large Language Models,"Lang Gao, Xiangliang Zhang, Preslav Nakov, Xiuying Chen","Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a major security concern as it can deceive LLMs to generate harmful text. Yet, there is still insufficient understanding of how jailbreaking works, which makes it hard to develop effective defense strategies. We aim to shed more light into this issue: we conduct a detailed large-scale analysis of seven different jailbreak methods and find that these disagreements stem from insufficient observation samples. In particular, we introduce \textit{safety boundary}, and we find that jailbreaks shift harmful activations outside that safety boundary, where LLMs are less sensitive to harmful information. We also find that the low and the middle layers are critical in such shifts, while deeper layers have less impact. Leveraging on these insights, we propose a novel defense called \textbf{Activation Boundary Defense} (ABD), which adaptively constrains the activations within the safety boundary. We further use Bayesian optimization to selectively apply the defense method to the low and the middle layers. Our experiments on several benchmarks show that ABD achieves an average DSR of over 98\% against various forms of jailbreak attacks, with less than 2\% impact on the model's general capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17034v1,2024-12
MINTQA: A Multi-Hop Question Answering Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on New and Tail Knowledge,"Jie He, Nan Hu, Wanqiu Long, Jiaoyan Chen, Jeff Z. Pan","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various reasoning tasks but face significant challenges with complex, knowledge-intensive multi-hop queries, particularly those involving new or long-tail knowledge. Existing benchmarks often fail to fully address these challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce MINTQA (Multi-hop Question Answering on New and Tail Knowledge), a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in multi-hop reasoning across four critical dimensions: question handling strategy, sub-question generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and iterative or dynamic decomposition and retrieval. MINTQA comprises 10,479 question-answer pairs for evaluating new knowledge and 17,887 pairs for assessing long-tail knowledge, with each question equipped with corresponding sub-questions and answers. Our systematic evaluation of 22 state-of-the-art LLMs on MINTQA reveals significant limitations in their ability to handle complex knowledge base queries, particularly in handling new or unpopular knowledge.

A Reality Check on Context Utilisation for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Lovisa Hagström, Sara Vera Marjanović, Haeun Yu, Arnav Arora, Christina Lioma, Maria Maistro, Pepa Atanasova, Isabelle Augenstein","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps address the limitations of the parametric knowledge embedded within a language model (LM). However, investigations of how LMs utilise retrieved information of varying complexity in real-world scenarios have been limited to synthetic contexts. We introduce DRUID (Dataset of Retrieved Unreliable, Insufficient and Difficult-to-understand contexts) with real-world queries and contexts manually annotated for stance. The dataset is based on the prototypical task of automated claim verification, for which automated retrieval of real-world evidence is crucial. We compare DRUID to synthetic datasets (CounterFact, ConflictQA) and find that artificial datasets often fail to represent the complex and diverse real-world context settings. We show that synthetic datasets exaggerate context characteristics rare in real retrieved data, which leads to inflated context utilisation results, as measured by our novel ACU score. Moreover, while previous work has mainly focused on singleton context characteristics to explain context utilisation, correlations between singleton context properties and ACU on DRUID are surprisingly small compared to other properties related to context source. Overall, our work underscores the need for real-world aligned context utilisation studies to represent and improve performance in real-world RAG settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17031v1,2024-12
Reversed Attention: On The Gradient Descent Of Attention Layers In GPT,"Shahar Katz, Lior Wolf","The success of Transformer-based Language Models (LMs) stems from their attention mechanism. While this mechanism has been extensively studied in explainability research, particularly through the attention values obtained during the forward pass of LMs, the backward pass of attention has been largely overlooked. In this work, we study the mathematics of the backward pass of attention, revealing that it implicitly calculates an attention matrix we refer to as ""Reversed Attention"". We examine the properties of Reversed Attention and demonstrate its ability to elucidate the models' behavior and edit dynamics. In an experimental setup, we showcase the ability of Reversed Attention to directly alter the forward pass of attention, without modifying the model's weights, using a novel method called ""attention patching"". In addition to enhancing the comprehension of how LM configure attention layers during backpropagation, Reversed Attention maps contribute to a more interpretable backward pass.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17019v1,2024-12

The second method involves using jailbreak prompts to challenge the safety mechanisms of the LLMs. Our experiments reveal significant variations in the robustness of these models, demonstrating their varying degrees of vulnerability to both character-level and semantic-level adversarial attacks. These findings underscore the necessity for improved adversarial training and enhanced safety mechanisms to bolster the robustness of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17011v1,2024-12
On Fusing ChatGPT and Ensemble Learning in Discon-tinuous Named Entity Recognition in Health Corpora,"Tzu-Chieh Chen, Wen-Yang Lin","Named Entity Recognition has traditionally been a key task in natural language processing, aiming to identify and extract important terms from unstructured text data. However, a notable challenge for contemporary deep-learning NER models has been identifying discontinuous entities, which are often fragmented within the text. To date, methods to address Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition have not been explored using ensemble learning to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, the rise of large language models, such as ChatGPT in recent years, has shown significant effectiveness across many NLP tasks. Most existing approaches, however, have primarily utilized ChatGPT as a problem-solving tool rather than exploring its potential as an integrative element within ensemble learning algorithms. In this study, we investigated the integration of ChatGPT as an arbitrator within an ensemble method, aiming to enhance performance on DNER tasks. Our method combines five state-of-the-art NER models with ChatGPT using custom prompt engineering to assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of the ensemble algorithm. We conducted experiments on three benchmark medical datasets, comparing our method against the five SOTA models, individual applications of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and a voting ensemble method. The results indicate that our proposed fusion of ChatGPT with the ensemble learning algorithm outperforms the SOTA results in the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets, showcasing its potential to enhance NLP applications in the healthcare domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16976v1,2024-12
Cannot or Should Not? Automatic Analysis of Refusal Composition in IFT/RLHF Datasets and Refusal Behavior of Black-Box LLMs,"Alexander von Recum, Christoph Schnabl, Gabor Hollbeck, Silas Alberti, Philip Blinde, Marvin von Hagen","Refusals - instances where large language models (LLMs) decline or fail to fully execute user instructions - are crucial for both AI safety and AI capabilities and the reduction of hallucinations in particular. These behaviors are learned during post-training, especially in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, existing taxonomies and evaluation datasets for refusals are inadequate, often focusing solely on should-not-related (instead of cannot-related) categories, and lacking tools for auditing refusal content in black-box LLM outputs.   We present a comprehensive framework for classifying LLM refusals: (a) a taxonomy of 16 refusal categories, (b) a human-annotated dataset of over 8,600 instances from publicly available IFT and RLHF datasets, (c) a synthetic dataset with 8,000 examples for each refusal category, and (d) classifiers trained for refusal classification.   Our work enables precise auditing of refusal behaviors in black-box LLMs and automatic analyses of refusal patterns in large IFT and RLHF datasets. This facilitates the strategic adjustment of LLM refusals, contributing to the development of more safe and reliable LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16974v1,2024-12
Part-Of-Speech Sensitivity of Routers in Mixture of Experts Models,"Elie Antoine, Frédéric Béchet, Philippe Langlais","This study investigates the behavior of model-integrated routers in Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, focusing on how tokens are routed based on their linguistic features, specifically Part-of-Speech (POS) tags. The goal is to explore across different MoE architectures whether experts specialize in processing tokens with similar linguistic traits. By analyzing token trajectories across experts and layers, we aim to uncover how MoE models handle linguistic information. Findings from six popular MoE models reveal expert specialization for specific POS categories, with routing paths showing high predictive accuracy for POS, highlighting the value of routing paths in characterizing tokens.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16971v1,2024-12
System-2 Mathematical Reasoning via Enriched Instruction Tuning,"Huanqia Cai, Yijun Yang, Zhifeng Li","Solving complex mathematical problems via system-2 reasoning is a natural human skill, yet it remains a significant challenge for current large language models (LLMs). We identify the scarcity of deliberate multi-step reasoning data as a primary limiting factor. To this end, we introduce Enriched Instruction Tuning (EIT), a method that enriches existing human-annotated mathematical datasets by synergizing human and AI feedback to create fine-grained reasoning trajectories. These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any symbolic verification program. Concretely, EIT is composed of two critical steps: Enriching with Reasoning Plan (ERP) and Enriching with Reasoning Step (ERS). The former generates a high-level plan that breaks down complex instructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in reasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother reasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning. Unlike existing CoT prompting methods that generate reasoning chains only depending on LLM's internal knowledge, our method leverages human-annotated initial answers as ``meta-knowledge'' to help LLMs generate more detailed and precise reasoning processes, leading to a more trustworthy LLM expert for complex mathematical problems. In experiments, EIT achieves an accuracy of 84.1% on GSM8K and 32.5% on MATH, surpassing state-of-the-art fine-tuning and prompting methods, and even matching the performance of tool-augmented methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16964v2,2024-12
LH-Mix: Local Hierarchy Correlation Guided Mixup over Hierarchical Prompt Tuning,"Fanshuang Kong, Richong Zhang, Ziqiao Wang","Hierarchical text classification (HTC) aims to assign one or more labels in the hierarchy for each text. Many methods represent this structure as a global hierarchy, leading to redundant graph structures. To address this, incorporating a text-specific local hierarchy is essential. However, existing approaches often model this local hierarchy as a sequence, focusing on explicit parent-child relationships while ignoring implicit correlations among sibling/peer relationships. In this paper, we first integrate local hierarchies into a manual depth-level prompt to capture parent-child relationships. We then apply Mixup to this hierarchical prompt tuning scheme to improve the latent correlation within sibling/peer relationships. Notably, we propose a novel Mixup ratio guided by local hierarchy correlation to effectively capture intrinsic correlations. This Local Hierarchy Mixup (LH-Mix) model demonstrates remarkable performance across three widely-used datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16963v1,2024-12
Aristotle: Mastering Logical Reasoning with A Logic-Complete Decompose-Search-Resolve Framework,"Jundong Xu, Hao Fei, Meng Luo, Qian Liu, Liangming Pan, William Yang Wang, Preslav Nakov, Mong-Li Lee, Wynne Hsu","In the context of large language models (LLMs), current advanced reasoning methods have made impressive strides in various reasoning tasks. However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, major challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes such as decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, we propose a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle, with three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver. In our framework, symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios. We will open-source all our code at https://github.com/Aiden0526/Aristotle.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16953v1,2024-12
A Career Interview Dialogue System using Large Language Model-based Dynamic Slot Generation,"Ekai Hashimoto, Mikio Nakano, Takayoshi Sakurai, Shun Shiramatsu, Toshitake Komazaki, Shiho Tsuchiya","This study aims to improve the efficiency and quality of career interviews conducted by nursing managers. To this end, we have been developing a slot-filling dialogue system that engages in pre-interviews to collect information on staff careers as a preparatory step before the actual interviews. Conventional slot-filling-based interview dialogue systems have limitations in the flexibility of information collection because the dialogue progresses based on predefined slot sets. We therefore propose a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically generate new slots according to the flow of the dialogue, achieving more natural conversations. Furthermore, we incorporate abduction into the slot generation process to enable more appropriate and effective slot generation. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted experiments using a user simulator. The results suggest that the proposed method using abduction is effective in enhancing both information-collecting capabilities and the naturalness of the dialogue.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16943v1,2024-12
Prompting Large Language Models with Rationale Heuristics for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering,"Zhongjian Hu, Peng Yang, Bing Li, Fengyuan Liu","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). Despite the encouraging results of previous studies, prior methods prompt LLMs to predict answers directly, neglecting intermediate thought processes. We argue that prior methods do not sufficiently activate the capacities of LLMs. We propose a framework called PLRH that Prompts LLMs with Rationale Heuristics for knowledge-based VQA. The PLRH prompts LLMs with Chain of Thought (CoT) to generate rationale heuristics, i.e., intermediate thought processes, and then leverages the rationale heuristics to inspire LLMs to predict answers. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the existing baselines by more than 2.2 and 2.1 on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16936v1,2024-12
Evaluating LLM Reasoning in the Operations Research Domain with ORQA,"Mahdi Mostajabdaveh, Timothy T. Yu, Samarendra Chandan Bindu Dash, Rindranirina Ramamonjison, Jabo Serge Byusa, Giuseppe Carenini, Zirui Zhou, Yong Zhang","In this paper, we introduce and apply Operations Research Question Answering (ORQA), a new benchmark designed to assess the generalization capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the specialized technical domain of Operations Research (OR). This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs can emulate the knowledge and reasoning skills of OR experts when confronted with diverse and complex optimization problems. The dataset, developed by OR experts, features real-world optimization problems that demand multistep reasoning to construct their mathematical models. Our evaluations of various open source LLMs, such as LLaMA 3.1, DeepSeek, and Mixtral, reveal their modest performance, highlighting a gap in their ability to generalize to specialized technical domains. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse on LLMs generalization capabilities, offering valuable insights for future research in this area. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17874v1,2024-12
Towards a Unified Paradigm: Integrating Recommendation Systems as a New Language in Large Models,"Kai Zheng, Qingfeng Sun, Can Xu, Peng Yu, Qingwei Guo","This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for sequential recommendation, which predicts users' future interactions based on their past behavior. We introduce a new concept, ""Integrating Recommendation Systems as a New Language in Large Models"" (RSLLM), which combines the strengths of traditional recommenders and LLMs. RSLLM uses a unique prompting method that combines ID-based item embeddings from conventional recommendation models with textual item features. It treats users' sequential behaviors as a distinct language and aligns the ID embeddings with the LLM's input space using a projector. We also propose a two-stage LLM fine-tuning framework that refines a pretrained LLM using a combination of two contrastive losses and a language modeling loss. The LLM is first fine-tuned using text-only prompts, followed by target domain fine-tuning with unified prompts. This trains the model to incorporate behavioral knowledge from the traditional sequential recommender into the LLM. Our empirical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16933v1,2024-12
Revisiting In-Context Learning with Long Context Language Models,"Jinheon Baek, Sun Jae Lee, Prakhar Gupta, Geunseob Oh, Siddharth Dalmia, Prateek Kolhar","In-Context Learning (ICL) is a technique by which language models make predictions based on examples provided in their input context. Previously, their context window size imposed a limit on the number of examples that can be shown, making example selection techniques crucial for identifying the maximally effective set of examples. However, the recent advent of Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) has significantly increased the number of examples that can be included in context, raising an important question of whether ICL performance in a many-shot regime is still sensitive to the method of sample selection. To answer this, we revisit these approaches in the context of LCLMs through extensive experiments on 18 datasets spanning 4 tasks. Surprisingly, we observe that sophisticated example selection techniques do not yield significant improvements over a simple random sample selection method. Instead, we find that the advent of LCLMs has fundamentally shifted the challenge of ICL from that of selecting the most effective examples to that of collecting sufficient examples to fill the context window. Specifically, in certain datasets, including all available examples does not fully utilize the context window; however, by augmenting the examples in context with a simple data augmentation approach, we substantially improve ICL performance by 5%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16926v2,2024-12
Quantifying Public Response to COVID-19 Events: Introducing the Community Sentiment and Engagement Index,"Nirmalya Thakur, Kesha A. Patel, Audrey Poon, Shuqi Cui, Nazif Azizi, Rishika Shah, Riyan Shah","This study introduces the Community Sentiment and Engagement Index (CSEI), developed to capture nuanced public sentiment and engagement variations on social media, particularly in response to major events related to COVID-19. Constructed with diverse sentiment indicators, CSEI integrates features like engagement, daily post count, compound sentiment, fine-grain sentiments (fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral), readability, offensiveness, and domain diversity. Each component is systematically weighted through a multi-step Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based framework, prioritizing features according to their variance contributions across temporal sentiment shifts. This approach dynamically adjusts component importance, enabling CSEI to precisely capture high-sensitivity shifts in public sentiment. The development of CSEI showed statistically significant correlations with its constituent features, underscoring internal consistency and sensitivity to specific sentiment dimensions. CSEI's responsiveness was validated using a dataset of 4,510,178 Reddit posts about COVID-19. The analysis focused on 15 major events, including the WHO's declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the first reported cases of COVID-19 across different countries, national lockdowns, vaccine developments, and crucial public health measures. Cumulative changes in CSEI revealed prominent peaks and valleys aligned with these events, indicating significant patterns in public sentiment across different phases of the pandemic. Pearson correlation analysis further confirmed a statistically significant relationship between CSEI daily fluctuations and these events (p = 0.0428), highlighting the capacity of CSEI to infer and interpret shifts in public sentiment and engagement in response to major events related to COVID-19.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16925v1,2024-12
Speech-Based Depression Prediction Using Encoder-Weight-Only Transfer Learning and a Large Corpus,"Amir Harati, Elizabeth Shriberg, Tomasz Rutowski, Piotr Chlebek, Yang Lu, Ricardo Oliveira","Speech-based algorithms have gained interest for the management of behavioral health conditions such as depression. We explore a speech-based transfer learning approach that uses a lightweight encoder and that transfers only the encoder weights, enabling a simplified run-time model. Our study uses a large data set containing roughly two orders of magnitude more speakers and sessions than used in prior work. The large data set enables reliable estimation of improvement from transfer learning. Results for the prediction of PHQ-8 labels show up to 27% relative performance gains for binary classification; these gains are statistically significant with a p-value close to zero. Improvements were also found for regression. Additionally, the gain from transfer learning does not appear to require strong source task performance. Results suggest that this approach is flexible and offers promise for efficient implementation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16900v1,2024-12
Unsupervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction for Low Resource Languages,"Charitha Rathnayake, P. R. S. Thilakarathna, Uthpala Nethmini, Rishemjith Kaur, Surangika Ranathunga","Bilingual lexicons play a crucial role in various Natural Language Processing tasks. However, many low-resource languages (LRLs) do not have such lexicons, and due to the same reason, cannot benefit from the supervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) techniques. To address this, unsupervised BLI (UBLI) techniques were introduced. A prominent technique in this line is structure-based UBLI. It is an iterative method, where a seed lexicon, which is initially learned from monolingual embeddings is iteratively improved. There have been numerous improvements to this core idea, however they have been experimented with independently of each other. In this paper, we investigate whether using these techniques simultaneously would lead to equal gains. We use the unsupervised version of VecMap, a commonly used structure-based UBLI framework, and carry out a comprehensive set of experiments using the LRL pairs, English-Sinhala, English-Tamil, and English-Punjabi. These experiments helped us to identify the best combination of the extensions. We also release bilingual dictionaries for English-Sinhala and English-Punjabi.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16894v1,2024-12
"PsychAdapter: Adapting LLM Transformers to Reflect Traits, Personality and Mental Health","Huy Vu, Huy Anh Nguyen, Adithya V Ganesan, Swanie Juhng, Oscar N. E. Kjell, Joao Sedoc, Margaret L. Kern, Ryan L. Boyd, Lyle Ungar, H. Andrew Schwartz, Johannes C. Eichstaedt","Artificial intelligence-based language generators are now a part of most people's lives. However, by default, they tend to generate ""average"" language without reflecting the ways in which people differ. Here, we propose a lightweight modification to the standard language model transformer architecture - ""PsychAdapter"" - that uses empirically derived trait-language patterns to generate natural language for specified personality, demographic, and mental health characteristics (with or without prompting). We applied PsychAdapters to modify OpenAI's GPT-2, Google's Gemma, and Meta's Llama 3 and found generated text to reflect the desired traits. For example, expert raters evaluated PsychAdapter's generated text output and found it matched intended trait levels with 87.3% average accuracy for Big Five personalities, and 96.7% for depression and life satisfaction. PsychAdapter is a novel method to introduce psychological behavior patterns into language models at the foundation level, independent of prompting, by influencing every transformer layer. This approach can create chatbots with specific personality profiles, clinical training tools that mirror language associated with psychological conditionals, and machine translations that match an authors reading or education level without taking up LLM context windows. PsychAdapter also allows for the exploration psychological constructs through natural language expression, extending the natural language processing toolkit to study human psychology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16882v2,2024-12
Reconsidering SMT Over NMT for Closely Related Languages: A Case Study of Persian-Hindi Pair,"Waisullah Yousofi, Pushpak Bhattacharyya","This paper demonstrates that Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation (PBSMT) can outperform Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) in moderate-resource scenarios, specifically for structurally similar languages, like the Persian-Hindi pair. Despite the Transformer architecture's typical preference for large parallel corpora, our results show that PBSMT achieves a BLEU score of 66.32, significantly exceeding the Transformer-NMT score of 53.7 on the same dataset. Additionally, we explore variations of the SMT architecture, including training on Romanized text and modifying the word order of Persian sentences to match the left-to-right (LTR) structure of Hindi. Our findings highlight the importance of choosing the right architecture based on language pair characteristics and advocate for SMT as a high-performing alternative, even in contexts commonly dominated by NMT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16877v1,2024-12
Teaching LLMs to Refine with Tools,"Dian Yu, Yuheng Zhang, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Linfeng Song, Zhaopeng Tu, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu","Large language models (LLMs) can refine their responses based on feedback, enabling self-improvement through iterative training or test-time refinement. However, existing methods predominantly focus on refinement within the same reasoning format, which may lead to non-correcting behaviors. We propose CaP, a novel approach that uses external tools to refine chain-of-thought (CoT) responses generated by the same or other LLMs. CaP employs a two-stage training process: supervised fine-tuning followed by preference optimization with DPO variants. Our observations highlight the critical role of preference optimization in enabling effective refinement. Additionally, we compare several sampling strategies to leverage CoT and tools at inference time. Experimental results demonstrate CaP's potential for effective cross-reasoning refinement and efficient inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16871v1,2024-12
GME: Improving Universal Multimodal Retrieval by Multimodal LLMs,"Xin Zhang, Yanzhao Zhang, Wen Xie, Mingxin Li, Ziqi Dai, Dingkun Long, Pengjun Xie, Meishan Zhang, Wenjie Li, Min Zhang","Universal Multimodal Retrieval (UMR) aims to enable search across various modalities using a unified model, where queries and candidates can consist of pure text, images, or a combination of both. Previous work has attempted to adopt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to realize UMR using only text data. However, our preliminary experiments demonstrate that more diverse multimodal training data can further unlock the potential of MLLMs. Despite its effectiveness, the existing multimodal training data is highly imbalanced in terms of modality, which motivates us to develop a training data synthesis pipeline and construct a large-scale, high-quality fused-modal training dataset. Based on the synthetic training data, we develop the General Multimodal Embedder (GME), an MLLM-based dense retriever designed for UMR. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive UMR Benchmark (UMRB) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing UMR methods.

Autoregressive Speech Synthesis with Next-Distribution Prediction,"Xinfa Zhu, Wenjie Tian, Lei Xie","We introduce KALL-E, a novel autoregressive (AR) language modeling approach with next-distribution prediction for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. Unlike existing methods, KALL-E directly models and predicts the continuous speech distribution conditioned on text without relying on VAE- or diffusion-based components. Specifically, we use WaveVAE to extract continuous speech distributions from waveforms instead of using discrete speech tokens. A single AR language model predicts these continuous speech distributions from text, with a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss as the constraint. Experimental results show that KALL-E outperforms open-source implementations of YourTTS, VALL-E, NaturalSpeech 2, and CosyVoice in terms of naturalness and speaker similarity in zero-shot TTS scenarios. Moreover, KALL-E demonstrates exceptional zero-shot capabilities in emotion and accent cloning. Importantly, KALL-E presents a more straightforward and effective paradigm for using continuous speech representations in TTS.

Sim911: Towards Effective and Equitable 9-1-1 Dispatcher Training with an LLM-Enabled Simulation,"Zirong Chen, Elizabeth Chason, Noah Mladenovski, Erin Wilson, Kristin Mullen, Stephen Martini, Meiyi Ma","Emergency response services are vital for enhancing public safety by safeguarding the environment, property, and human lives. As frontline members of these services, 9-1-1 dispatchers have a direct impact on response times and the overall effectiveness of emergency operations. However, traditional dispatcher training methods, which rely on role-playing by experienced personnel, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often neglect the specific needs of underserved communities. To address these challenges, we introduce Sim911, the first training simulation for 9-1-1 dispatchers powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Sim911 enhances training through three key technical innovations: (1) knowledge construction, which utilizes archived 9-1-1 call data to generate simulations that closely mirror real-world scenarios; (2) context-aware controlled generation, which employs dynamic prompts and vector bases to ensure that LLM behavior aligns with training objectives; and (3) validation with looped correction, which filters out low-quality responses and refines the system performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16844v3,2024-12
Joint Knowledge Editing for Information Enrichment and Probability Promotion,"Wenhang Shi, Yiren Chen, Shuqing Bian, Xinyi Zhang, Zhe Zhao, Pengfei Hu, Wei Lu, Xiaoyong Du","Knowledge stored in large language models requires timely updates to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world information. To update the knowledge, most knowledge editing methods focus on the low layers, since recent probes into the knowledge recall process reveal that the answer information is enriched in low layers. However, these probes only and could only reveal critical recall stages for the original answers, while the goal of editing is to rectify model's prediction for the target answers. This inconsistency indicates that both the probe approaches and the associated editing methods are deficient. To mitigate the inconsistency and identify critical editing regions, we propose a contrast-based probe approach, and locate two crucial stages where the model behavior diverges between the original and target answers: Information Enrichment in low layers and Probability Promotion in high layers. Building upon the insights, we develop the Joint knowledge Editing for information Enrichment and probability Promotion (JEEP) method, which jointly edits both the low and high layers to modify the two critical recall stages. Considering the mutual interference and growing forgetting due to dual modifications, JEEP is designed to ensure that updates to distinct regions share the same objectives and are complementary. We rigorously evaluate JEEP by editing up to thousands of facts on various models, i.e., GPT-J (6B) and LLaMA (7B), and addressing diverse editing objectives, i.e., adding factual and counterfactual knowledge. In all tested scenarios, JEEP achieves best performances, validating the effectiveness of the revealings of our probe approach and the designs of our editing method.

Ask-Before-Detection: Identifying and Mitigating Conformity Bias in LLM-Powered Error Detector for Math Word Problem Solutions,"Hang Li, Tianlong Xu, Kaiqi Yang, Yucheng Chu, Yanling Chen, Yichi Song, Qingsong Wen, Hui Liu","The rise of large language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for automatic error detection in education, particularly for math word problems (MWPs). While prior studies demonstrate the promise of LLMs as error detectors, they overlook the presence of multiple valid solutions for a single MWP. Our preliminary analysis reveals a significant performance gap between conventional and alternative solutions in MWPs, a phenomenon we term conformity bias in this work. To mitigate this bias, we introduce the Ask-Before-Detect (AskBD) framework, which generates adaptive reference solutions using LLMs to enhance error detection. Experiments on 200 examples of GSM8K show that AskBD effectively mitigates bias and improves performance, especially when combined with reasoning-enhancing techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16838v1,2024-12
Quantum-Like Contextuality in Large Language Models,"Kin Ian Lo, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, Shane Mansfield","Contextuality is a distinguishing feature of quantum mechanics and there is growing evidence that it is a necessary condition for quantum advantage. In order to make use of it, researchers have been asking whether similar phenomena arise in other domains. The answer has been yes, e.g. in behavioural sciences. However, one has to move to frameworks that take some degree of signalling into account. Two such frameworks exist: (1) a signalling-corrected sheaf theoretic model, and (2) the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) framework. This paper provides the first large scale experimental evidence for a yes answer in natural language. We construct a linguistic schema modelled over a contextual quantum scenario, instantiate it in the Simple English Wikipedia and extract probability distributions for the instances using the large language model BERT. This led to the discovery of 77,118 sheaf-contextual and 36,938,948 CbD contextual instances. We proved that the contextual instances came from semantically similar words, by deriving an equation between degrees of contextuality and Euclidean distances of BERT's embedding vectors. A regression model further reveals that Euclidean distance is indeed the best statistical predictor of contextuality. Our linguistic schema is a variant of the co-reference resolution challenge. These results are an indication that quantum methods may be advantageous in language tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16806v1,2024-12
SubData: A Python Library to Collect and Combine Datasets for Evaluating LLM Alignment on Downstream Tasks,"Leon Fröhling, Pietro Bernardelle, Gianluca Demartini","With the release of ever more capable large language models (LLMs), researchers in NLP and related disciplines have started to explore the usability of LLMs for a wide variety of different annotation tasks. Very recently, a lot of this attention has shifted to tasks that are subjective in nature. Given that the latest generations of LLMs have digested and encoded extensive knowledge about different human subpopulations and individuals, the hope is that these models can be trained, tuned or prompted to align with a wide range of different human perspectives. While researchers already evaluate the success of this alignment via surveys and tests, there is a lack of resources to evaluate the alignment on what oftentimes matters the most in NLP; the actual downstream tasks. To fill this gap we present SubData, a Python library that offers researchers working on topics related to subjectivity in annotation tasks a convenient way of collecting, combining and using a range of suitable datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16783v1,2024-12
AlzheimerRAG: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation for PubMed articles,"Aritra Kumar Lahiri, Qinmin Vivian Hu","Recent advancements in generative AI have flourished the development of highly adept Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrate diverse data types to empower decision-making.

This paper introduces AlzheimerRAG, a Multimodal RAG pipeline tool for biomedical research use cases, primarily focusing on Alzheimer's disease from PubMed articles. Our pipeline incorporates multimodal fusion techniques to integrate textual and visual data processing by efficiently indexing and accessing vast amounts of biomedical literature. Preliminary experimental results against benchmarks, such as BioASQ and PubMedQA, have returned improved results in information retrieval and synthesis of domain-specific information. We also demonstrate a case study with our RAG pipeline across different Alzheimer's clinical scenarios. We infer that AlzheimerRAG can generate responses with accuracy non-inferior to humans and with low rates of hallucination. Overall, a reduction in cognitive task load is observed, which allows researchers to gain multimodal insights, improving understanding and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16701v1,2024-12
DragonVerseQA: Open-Domain Long-Form Context-Aware Question-Answering,"Aritra Kumar Lahiri, Qinmin Vivian Hu","This paper proposes a novel approach to develop an open-domain and long-form Over-The-Top (OTT) Question-Answering (QA) dataset, DragonVerseQA, specifically oriented to the fantasy universe of ""House of the Dragon"" and ""Game Of Thrones"" TV series. Most existing QA datasets focus on short, fact-based answers sourced almost solely from Wikipedia articles, devoid of depth and contextual richness for sophisticated narrative understanding. We curate a dataset that combines full episode summaries sourced from HBO and fandom wiki websites, user reviews from sources like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, and high-quality, open-domain, legally admissible sources, and structured data from repositories like WikiData into one dataset. The dataset provides a multi-dimensional context, reflecting complex character dynamics and plot developments from these varied sources. That means, on equal footing, only after heavy data preprocessing and filtering methods will meaningful, non-spam unbiased reviews be available in this enriched dataset. The comprehensive insights are given through the long-form answers generated from this enriched context. This is what makes this valuable dataset for improving conversational AI, narrative analysis, sentiment analysis, summarization techniques, and relation extraction.   A comparative analysis with state-of-the-art QA datasets such as SQuAD 2.0, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions brings to light the unique advantages of our dataset in terms of contextual complexity and answer length. Detailed reviews add layers to audience sentiment and narrative interpretation, raising the bar for domain-specific QA with a new quality benchmark. Our work also allows a deeper understanding of entertainment-industry content and opens the door to more knowledgeable and creative AI-driven interactions within digital media environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16694v1,2024-12

However, existing IFT datasets often contain knowledge that is inconsistent with LLMs' internal knowledge learned from the pre-training phase, which can greatly affect the efficacy of IFT. To address this issue, we introduce NILE (iNternal consIstency aLignmEnt) framework, aimed at optimizing IFT datasets to unlock LLMs' capability further. NILE operates by eliciting target pre-trained LLM's internal knowledge corresponding to instruction data. The internal knowledge is leveraged to revise the answer in IFT datasets. Additionally, we propose a novel Internal Consistency Filtering (ICF) method to filter training samples, ensuring its high consistency with LLM's internal knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate that NILE-aligned IFT datasets sharply boost LLM performance across multiple LLM ability evaluation datasets, achieving up to 66.6% gain on Arena-Hard and 68.5% on Alpaca-Eval V2. Further analysis confirms that each component of the NILE}framework contributes to these substantial performance improvements, and provides compelling evidence that dataset consistency with pre-trained internal knowledge is pivotal for maximizing LLM potential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16686v1,2024-12
The Task Shield: Enforcing Task Alignment to Defend Against Indirect Prompt Injection in LLM Agents,"Feiran Jia, Tong Wu, Xin Qin, Anna Squicciarini","Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly being deployed as conversational assistants capable of performing complex real-world tasks through tool integration. This enhanced ability to interact with external systems and process various data sources, while powerful, introduces significant security vulnerabilities. In particular, indirect prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat, where malicious instructions embedded within external data sources can manipulate agents to deviate from user intentions. While existing defenses based on rule constraints, source spotlighting, and authentication protocols show promise, they struggle to maintain robust security while preserving task functionality. We propose a novel and orthogonal perspective that reframes agent security from preventing harmful actions to ensuring task alignment, requiring every agent action to serve user objectives. Based on this insight, we develop Task Shield, a test-time defense mechanism that systematically verifies whether each instruction and tool call contributes to user-specified goals. Through experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark, we demonstrate that Task Shield reduces attack success rates (2.07\%) while maintaining high task utility (69.79\%) on GPT-4o.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16682v1,2024-12
L3TC: Leveraging RWKV for Learned Lossless Low-Complexity Text Compression,"Junxuan Zhang, Zhengxue Cheng, Yan Zhao, Shihao Wang, Dajiang Zhou, Guo Lu, Li Song","Learning-based probabilistic models can be combined with an entropy coder for data compression. However, due to the high complexity of learning-based models, their practical application as text compressors has been largely overlooked. To address this issue, our work focuses on a low-complexity design while maintaining compression performance. We introduce a novel Learned Lossless Low-complexity Text Compression method (L3TC). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that RWKV models achieve the fastest decoding speed with a moderate compression ratio, making it the most suitable backbone for our method. Second, we propose an outlier-aware tokenizer that uses a limited vocabulary to cover frequent tokens while allowing outliers to bypass the prediction and encoding. Third, we propose a novel high-rank reparameterization strategy that enhances the learning capability during training without increasing complexity during inference. Experimental results validate that our method achieves 48% bit saving compared to gzip compressor. Besides, L3TC offers compression performance comparable to other learned compressors, with a 50x reduction in model parameters. More importantly, L3TC is the fastest among all learned compressors, providing real-time decoding speeds up to megabytes per second. Our code is available at https://github.com/alipay/L3TC-leveraging-rwkv-for-learned-lossless-low-complexity-text-compression.git.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16642v2,2024-12
Large Language Model Can Be a Foundation for Hidden Rationale-Based Retrieval,"Luo Ji, Feixiang Guo, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Xiaoyu Wang, Ningyuan Xi, Yihong Wang, Peng Yu, Yue Zhao, Hongyang Lei, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen","Despite the recent advancement in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, most retrieval methodologies are often developed for factual retrieval, which assumes query and positive documents are semantically similar. In this paper, we instead propose and study a more challenging type of retrieval task, called hidden rationale retrieval, in which query and document are not similar but can be inferred by reasoning chains, logic relationships, or empirical experiences. To address such problems, an instruction-tuned Large language model (LLM) with a cross-encoder architecture could be a reasonable choice. To further strengthen pioneering LLM-based retrievers, we design a special instruction that transforms the retrieval task into a generative task by prompting LLM to answer a binary-choice question. The model can be fine-tuned with direct preference optimization (DPO). The framework is also optimized for computational efficiency with no performance degradation. We name this retrieval framework by RaHoRe and verify its zero-shot and fine-tuned performance superiority on Emotional Support Conversation (ESC), compared with previous retrieval works. Our study suggests the potential to employ LLM as a foundation for a wider scope of retrieval tasks. Our codes, models, and datasets are available on https://github.com/flyfree5/LaHoRe.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16615v1,2024-12
Open-Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation Based on Double Relaxed Contrastive Learning with Dense Labeling,"Daichi Yashima, Ryosuke Korekata, Komei Sugiura","Growing labor shortages are increasing the demand for domestic service robots (DSRs) to assist in various settings. In this study, we develop a DSR that transports everyday objects to specified pieces of furniture based on open-vocabulary instructions. Our approach focuses on retrieving images of target objects and receptacles from pre-collected images of indoor environments. For example, given an instruction ""Please get the right red towel hanging on the metal towel rack and put it in the white washing machine on the left,"" the DSR is expected to carry the red towel to the washing machine based on the retrieved images. This is challenging because the correct images should be retrieved from thousands of collected images, which may include many images of similar towels and appliances. To address this, we propose RelaX-Former, which learns diverse and robust representations from among positive, unlabeled positive, and negative samples. We evaluated RelaX-Former on a dataset containing real-world indoor images and human annotated instructions including complex referring expressions. The experimental results demonstrate that RelaX-Former outperformed existing baseline models across standard image retrieval metrics. Moreover, we performed physical experiments using a DSR to evaluate the performance of our approach in a zero-shot transfer setting. The experiments involved the DSR to carry objects to specific receptacles based on open-vocabulary instructions, achieving an overall success rate of 75%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16576v2,2024-12
Evaluating and Enhancing LLMs for Multi-turn Text-to-SQL with Multiple Question Types,"Ziming Guo, Chao Ma, Yinggang Sun, Tiancheng Zhao, Guangyao Wang, Hai Huang","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text-to-SQL systems. However, most LLM-based methods often narrowly focus on SQL generation, neglecting the complexities of real-world conversational queries. This oversight can lead to unreliable responses, particularly for ambiguous questions that cannot be directly addressed with SQL. To bridge this gap, we propose MMSQL, a comprehensive test suite designed to evaluate the question classification and SQL generation capabilities of LLMs by simulating real-world scenarios with diverse question types and multi-turn Q\&A interactions. Using MMSQL, we assessed the performance of popular LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, and identified key factors impacting their performance in such scenarios. Moreover, we introduce an LLM-based multi-agent framework that employs specialized agents to identify question types and determine appropriate answering strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the model's ability to navigate the complexities of conversational dynamics, effectively handling the diverse and complex nature of user queries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17867v1,2024-12
Acquisition of Recursive Possessives and Recursive Locatives in Mandarin,"Chenxi Fu, Xiaoyi Wang, Zaijiang Man, Caimei Yang","As recursion has been underlying any linguistic work for the last 60 years, the acquisition of recursive structures by children during language learning has become a focal point of inquiry. This study delves into the developmental trajectory of Mandarin-speaking children's acquisition of recursive possessives and locatives, assessing the impact of structural diversity on language acquisition. The research contrasts the comprehension of two-level recursive structures among children aged 3 to 7 years, employing answering question while seeing a picture task to elicit responses. The findings indicate that children do not attain adult-like proficiency in two-level recursion until the age of 6, and there exists a notable asymmetry in the acquisition of recursive possessives versus locatives. These results underscore the primacy of structural complexity and cognitive factors in the acquisition process, enhancing our comprehension of the cognitive foundations of language development and the pivotal role of recursion in child language acquisition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16556v1,2024-12
Divide and Conquer: A Hybrid Strategy Defeats Multimodal Large Language Models,"Yanxu Mao, Peipei Liu, Tiehan Cui, Congying Liu, Datao You","Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied in various fields of society due to their powerful reasoning, understanding, and generation capabilities. However, the security issues associated with these models are becoming increasingly severe. Jailbreaking attacks, as an important method for detecting vulnerabilities in LLMs, have been explored by researchers who attempt to induce these models to generate harmful content through various attack methods. Nevertheless, existing jailbreaking methods face numerous limitations, such as excessive query counts, limited coverage of jailbreak modalities, low attack success rates, and simplistic evaluation methods. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal jailbreaking method: JMLLM. This method integrates multiple strategies to perform comprehensive jailbreak attacks across text, visual, and auditory modalities. Additionally, we contribute a new and comprehensive dataset for multimodal jailbreaking research: TriJail, which includes jailbreak prompts for all three modalities. Experiments on the TriJail dataset and the benchmark dataset AdvBench, conducted on 13 popular LLMs, demonstrate advanced attack success rates and significant reduction in time overhead.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16555v1,2024-12
Attention Entropy is a Key Factor: An Analysis of Parallel Context Encoding with Full-attention-based Pre-trained Language Models,"Zhisong Zhang, Yan Wang, Xinting Huang, Tianqing Fang, Hongming Zhang, Chenlong Deng, Shuaiyi Li, Dong Yu","Large language models have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of language tasks, owing to their exceptional capabilities in context modeling. The most commonly used method of context modeling is full self-attention, as seen in standard decoder-only Transformers. Although powerful, this method can be inefficient for long sequences and may overlook inherent input structures. To address these problems, an alternative approach is parallel context encoding, which splits the context into sub-pieces and encodes them parallelly. Because parallel patterns are not encountered during training, naively applying parallel encoding leads to performance degradation. However, the underlying reasons and potential mitigations are unclear. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of this issue and identify that unusually high attention entropy can be a key factor. Furthermore, we adopt two straightforward methods to reduce attention entropy by incorporating attention sinks and selective mechanisms. Experiments on various tasks reveal that these methods effectively lower irregular attention entropy and narrow performance gaps. We hope this study can illuminate ways to enhance context modeling mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16545v1,2024-12
Self-guided Knowledgeable Network of Thoughts: Amplifying Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Chao-Chi Chen, Chin-Yuan Yeh, Hsi-Wen Chen, De-Nian Yang, Ming-Syan Chen","We introduce Knowledgeable Network of Thoughts (kNoT): a prompt scheme that advances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond existing paradigms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree of Thoughts (ToT), and Graph of Thoughts (GoT). The key innovation of kNoT is the LLM Workflow Template (LWT), which allows for an executable plan to be specified by LLMs for LLMs. LWT allows these plans to be arbitrary networks, where single-step LLM operations are nodes, and edges correspond to message passing between these steps. Furthermore, LWT supports selection of individual elements through indexing, facilitating kNoT to produce intricate plans where each LLM operation can be limited to elementary operations, greatly enhancing reliability over extended task sequences. We demonstrate that kNoT significantly outperforms the state of the art on six use cases, while reducing the need for extensive prompt engineering. For instance, kNoT finds 92% accuracy for sorting 32 numbers over 12% and 31% for ToT and GoT, while utilizing up to 84.4% and 87.3% less task-specific prompts, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16533v1,2024-12
Improving Lip-synchrony in Direct Audio-Visual Speech-to-Speech Translation,"Lucas Goncalves, Prashant Mathur, Xing Niu, Brady Houston, Chandrashekhar Lavania, Srikanth Vishnubhotla, Lijia Sun, Anthony Ferritto","Audio-Visual Speech-to-Speech Translation typically prioritizes improving translation quality and naturalness. However, an equally critical aspect in audio-visual content is lip-synchrony-ensuring that the movements of the lips match the spoken content-essential for maintaining realism in dubbed videos. Despite its importance, the inclusion of lip-synchrony constraints in AVS2S models has been largely overlooked. This study addresses this gap by integrating a lip-synchrony loss into the training process of AVS2S models. Our proposed method significantly enhances lip-synchrony in direct audio-visual speech-to-speech translation, achieving an average LSE-D score of 10.67, representing a 9.2% reduction in LSE-D over a strong baseline across four language pairs. Additionally, it maintains the naturalness and high quality of the translated speech when overlaid onto the original video, without any degradation in translation quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16530v1,2024-12
Text2midi: Generating Symbolic Music from Captions,"Keshav Bhandari, Abhinaba Roy, Kyra Wang, Geeta Puri, Simon Colton, Dorien Herremans","This paper introduces text2midi, an end-to-end model to generate MIDI files from textual descriptions. Leveraging the growing popularity of multimodal generative approaches, text2midi capitalizes on the extensive availability of textual data and the success of large language models (LLMs). Our end-to-end system harnesses the power of LLMs to generate symbolic music in the form of MIDI files. Specifically, we utilize a pretrained LLM encoder to process captions, which then condition an autoregressive transformer decoder to produce MIDI sequences that accurately reflect the provided descriptions. This intuitive and user-friendly method significantly streamlines the music creation process by allowing users to generate music pieces using text prompts. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations, incorporating both automated and human studies, that show our model generates MIDI files of high quality that are indeed controllable by text captions that may include music theory terms such as chords, keys, and tempo. We release the code and music samples on our demo page (https://github.com/AMAAI-Lab/Text2midi) for users to interact with text2midi.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16526v2,2024-12

We model a wide range of real-world user scenarios on mobile devices, encompassing imperfect instructions, diverse question-answer trajectories, intent/argument shifts, and the use of external individual information through pronouns. To construct the corresponding datasets, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that involves LLM-generated data and multiple rounds of human validation, ensuring high data quality. Additionally, we decompose the conversations into function-calling snapshots, enabling a fine-grained evaluation of each turn. We evaluate several popular LLMs using HammerBench and highlight different performance aspects. Our empirical findings reveal that errors in parameter naming constitute the primary factor behind conversation failures across different data types.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16516v1,2024-12
Adapting Whisper for Code-Switching through Encoding Refining and Language-Aware Decoding,"Jiahui Zhao, Hao Shi, Chenrui Cui, Tianrui Wang, Hexin Liu, Zhaoheng Ni, Lingxuan Ye, Longbiao Wang","Code-switching (CS) automatic speech recognition (ASR) faces challenges due to the language confusion resulting from accents, auditory similarity, and seamless language switches. Adaptation on the pre-trained multi-lingual model has shown promising performance for CS-ASR. In this paper, we adapt Whisper, which is a large-scale multilingual pre-trained speech recognition model, to CS from both encoder and decoder parts. First, we propose an encoder refiner to enhance the encoder's capacity of intra-sentence swithching. Second, we propose using two sets of language-aware adapters with different language prompt embeddings to achieve language-specific decoding information in each decoder layer. Then, a fusion module is added to fuse the language-aware decoding. The experimental results using the SEAME dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, the proposed approach achieves a relative MER reduction of 4.1% and 7.2% on the dev_man and dev_sge test sets, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Through experiments, we found that the proposed method significantly improves the performance on non-native language in CS speech, indicating that our approach enables Whisper to better distinguish between the two languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16507v3,2024-12
Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation without Automatic Speech Recognition,"Do June Min, Karel Mundnich, Andy Lapastora, Erfan Soltanmohammadi, Srikanth Ronanki, Kyu Han","One common approach for question answering over speech data is to first transcribe speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and then employ text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on the transcriptions. While this cascaded pipeline has proven effective in many practical settings, ASR errors can propagate to the retrieval and generation steps. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SpeechRAG, a novel framework designed for open-question answering over spoken data. Our proposed approach fine-tunes a pre-trained speech encoder into a speech adapter fed into a frozen large language model (LLM)--based retrieval model. By aligning the embedding spaces of text and speech, our speech retriever directly retrieves audio passages from text-based queries, leveraging the retrieval capacity of the frozen text retriever. Our retrieval experiments on spoken question answering datasets show that direct speech retrieval does not degrade over the text-based baseline, and outperforms the cascaded systems using ASR. For generation, we use a speech language model (SLM) as a generator, conditioned on audio passages rather than transcripts. Without fine-tuning of the SLM, this approach outperforms cascaded text-based models when there is high WER in the transcripts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16500v3,2024-12

LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT and Meta's LLaMA, offer a pre-trained, adaptable approach that bypasses the extensive training and overfitting issues associated with traditional machine learning models. We assess the performance of LLMs in detecting and classifying COVID-19-related scientific claims, thus facilitating informed decision-making.

Automated CVE Analysis: Harnessing Machine Learning In Designing Question-Answering Models For Cybersecurity Information Extraction,Tanjim Bin Faruk,"The vast majority of cybersecurity information is unstructured text, including critical data within databases such as CVE, NVD, CWE, CAPEC, and the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. These databases are invaluable for analyzing attack patterns and understanding attacker behaviors. Creating a knowledge graph by integrating this information could unlock significant insights. However, processing this large amount of data requires advanced deep-learning techniques. A crucial step towards building such a knowledge graph is developing a robust mechanism for automating the extraction of answers to specific questions from the unstructured text. Question Answering (QA) systems play a pivotal role in this process by pinpointing and extracting precise information, facilitating the mapping of relationships between various data points. In the cybersecurity context, QA systems encounter unique challenges due to the need to interpret and answer questions based on a wide array of domain-specific information. To tackle these challenges, it is necessary to develop a cybersecurity-specific dataset and train a machine learning model on it, aimed at enhancing the understanding and retrieval of domain-specific information. This paper presents a novel dataset and describes a machine learning model trained on this dataset for the QA task. It also discusses the model's performance and key findings in a manner that maintains a balance between formality and accessibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16484v1,2024-12
Enhancing Multilingual ASR for Unseen Languages via Language Embedding Modeling,"Shao-Syuan Huang, Kuan-Po Huang, Andy T.

Whisper, one of the most advanced ASR models, excels in this domain by handling 99 languages effectively, leveraging a vast amount of data and incorporating language tags as prefixes to guide the recognition process. However, despite its success, Whisper struggles with unseen languages, those not included in its pre-training. Motivated by the observation that many languages share linguistic characteristics, we propose methods that exploit these relationships to enhance ASR performance on unseen languages. Specifically, we introduce a weighted sum method, which computes a weighted sum of the embeddings of language tags, using Whisper's predicted language probabilities. In addition, we develop a predictor-based approach that refines the weighted sum embedding to more closely approximate the true embedding for unseen languages. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in ASR performance, both in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Our proposed methods outperform baseline approaches, providing an effective solution for addressing unseen languages in multilingual ASR.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16474v1,2024-12
Chained Tuning Leads to Biased Forgetting,"Megan Ung, Alicia Sun, Samuel J.

This phenomenon, often referred to as catastrophic forgetting, has important potential implications for the safety of deployed models. In this work, we first show that models trained on downstream tasks forget their safety tuning to a greater extent than models trained in the opposite order. Second, we show that forgetting disproportionately impacts safety information about certain groups. To quantify this phenomenon, we define a new metric we term biased forgetting. We conduct a systematic evaluation of the effects of task ordering on forgetting and apply mitigations that can help the model recover from the forgetting observed. We hope our findings can better inform methods for chaining the finetuning of LLMs in continual learning settings to enable training of safer and less toxic models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16469v2,2024-12
Transducer-Llama: Integrating LLMs into Streamable Transducer-based Speech Recognition,"Keqi Deng, Jinxi Guo, Yingyi Ma, Niko Moritz, Philip C. Woodland, Ozlem Kalinli, Mike Seltzer","While large language models (LLMs) have been applied to automatic speech recognition (ASR), the task of making the model streamable remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel model architecture, Transducer-Llama, that integrates LLMs into a Factorized Transducer (FT) model, naturally enabling streaming capabilities. Furthermore, given that the large vocabulary of LLMs can cause data sparsity issue and increased training costs for spoken language systems, this paper introduces an efficient vocabulary adaptation technique to align LLMs with speech system vocabularies. The results show that directly optimizing the FT model with a strong pre-trained LLM-based predictor using the RNN-T loss yields some but limited improvements over a smaller pre-trained LM predictor. Therefore, this paper proposes a weak-to-strong LM swap strategy, using a weak LM predictor during RNN-T loss training and then replacing it with a strong LLM. After LM replacement, the minimum word error rate (MWER) loss is employed to finetune the integration of the LLM predictor with the Transducer-Llama model. Experiments on the LibriSpeech and large-scale multi-lingual LibriSpeech corpora show that the proposed streaming Transducer-Llama approach gave a 17% relative WER reduction (WERR) over a strong FT baseline and a 32% WERR over an RNN-T baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16464v1,2024-12
Research on Violent Text Detection System Based on BERT-fasttext Model,"Yongsheng Yang, Xiaoying Wang","In the digital age of today, the internet has become an indispensable platform for people's lives, work, and information exchange. However, the problem of violent text proliferation in the network environment has arisen, which has brought about many negative effects. In view of this situation, it is particularly important to build an effective system for cutting off violent text. The study of violent text cutting off based on the BERT-fasttext model has significant meaning. BERT is a pre-trained language model with strong natural language understanding ability, which can deeply mine and analyze text semantic information; Fasttext itself is an efficient text classification tool with low complexity and good effect, which can quickly provide basic judgments for text processing. By combining the two and applying them to the system for cutting off violent text, on the one hand, it can accurately identify violent text, and on the other hand, it can efficiently and reasonably cut off the content, preventing harmful information from spreading freely on the network. Compared with the single BERT model and fasttext, the accuracy was improved by 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Through this model, it is helpful to purify the network environment, maintain the health of network information, and create a positive, civilized, and harmonious online communication space for netizens, driving the development of social networking, information dissemination, and other aspects in a more benign direction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16455v1,2024-12
Correcting Large Language Model Behavior via Influence Function,"Han Zhang, Zhuo Zhang, Yi Zhang, Yuanzhao Zhai, Hanyang Peng, Yu Lei, Yue Yu, Hui Wang, Bin Liang, Lin Gui, Ruifeng Xu","Recent advancements in AI alignment techniques have significantly improved the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with static human preferences. However, the dynamic nature of human preferences can render some prior training data outdated or even erroneous, ultimately causing LLMs to deviate from contemporary human preferences and societal norms. Existing methodologies, whether they involve the curation of new data for continual alignment or the manual correction of outdated data for re-alignment, demand costly human resources. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, Large Language Model Behavior Correction with Influence Function Recall and Post-Training (LANCET), which requires no human involvement. LANCET consists of two phases: (1) using influence functions to identify the training data that significantly impact undesirable model outputs, and (2) applying an Influence function-driven Bregman Optimization (IBO) technique to adjust the model's behavior based on these influence distributions. Our experiments demonstrate that LANCET effectively and efficiently correct inappropriate behaviors of LLMs. Furthermore, LANCET can outperform methods that rely on collecting human preferences, and it enhances the interpretability of learning human preferences within LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16451v1,2024-12
Effective Context Modeling Framework for Emotion Recognition in Conversations,"Cuong Tran Van, Thanh V. T. Tran, Van Nguyen, Truong Son Hy","Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) facilitates a deeper understanding of the emotions conveyed by speakers in each utterance within a conversation. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their strengths in capturing data relationships, particularly in contextual information modeling and multimodal fusion. However, existing methods often struggle to fully capture the complex interactions between multiple modalities and conversational context, limiting their expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose ConxGNN, a novel GNN-based framework designed to capture contextual information in conversations. ConxGNN features two key parallel modules: a multi-scale heterogeneous graph that captures the diverse effects of utterances on emotional changes, and a hypergraph that models the multivariate relationships among modalities and utterances. The outputs from these modules are integrated into a fusion layer, where a cross-modal attention mechanism is applied to produce a contextually enriched representation. Additionally, ConxGNN tackles the challenge of recognizing minority or semantically similar emotion classes by incorporating a re-weighting scheme into the loss functions. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to previous baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16444v1,2024-12
Distilling Large Language Models for Efficient Clinical Information Extraction,"Karthik S. Vedula, Annika Gupta, Akshay Swaminathan, Ivan Lopez, Suhana Bedi, Nigam H. Shah","Large language models (LLMs) excel at clinical information extraction but their computational demands limit practical deployment. Knowledge distillation--the process of transferring knowledge from larger to smaller models--offers a potential solution. We evaluate the performance of distilled BERT models, which are approximately 1,000 times smaller than modern LLMs, for clinical named entity recognition (NER) tasks. We leveraged state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini and OpenAI models) and medical ontologies (RxNorm and SNOMED) as teacher labelers for medication, disease, and symptom extraction. We applied our approach to over 3,300 clinical notes spanning five publicly available datasets, comparing distilled BERT models against both their teacher labelers and BERT models fine-tuned on human labels. External validation was conducted using clinical notes from the MedAlign dataset. For disease extraction, F1 scores were 0.82 (teacher model), 0.89 (BioBERT trained on human labels), and 0.84 (BioBERT-distilled). For medication, F1 scores were 0.84 (teacher model), 0.91 (BioBERT-human), and 0.87 (BioBERT-distilled). For symptoms: F1 score of 0.73 (teacher model) and 0.68 (BioBERT-distilled). Distilled BERT models had faster inference (12x, 4x, 8x faster than GPT-4o, o1-mini, and Gemini Flash respectively) and lower costs (85x, 101x, 2x cheaper than GPT-4o, o1-mini, and Gemini Flash respectively). On the external validation dataset, the distilled BERT model achieved F1 scores of 0.883 (medication), 0.726 (disease), and 0.699 (symptom). Distilled BERT models were up to 101x cheaper and 12x faster than state-of-the-art LLMs while achieving similar performance on NER tasks.

"Underutilization of Syntactic Processing by Chinese Learners of English in Comprehending English Sentences, Evidenced from Adapted Garden-Path Ambiguity Experiment",Jiapeng Xu,"Many studies have revealed that sentence comprehension relies more on semantic processing than on syntactic processing. However, previous studies have predominantly emphasized the preference for semantic processing, focusing on the semantic perspective. In contrast, this current study highlights the under-utilization of syntactic processing, from a syntactic perspective. Based on the traditional garden-path experiment, which involves locally ambiguous but globally unambiguous sentences, this study's empirical experiment innovatively crafted an adapted version featuring semantically ambiguous but syntactically unambiguous sentences to meet its specific research objective. This experiment, involving 140 subjects, demonstrates through descriptive and inferential statistical analyses using SPSS, Graph Pad Prism, and Cursor that Chinese learners of English tend to under-utilize syntactic processing when comprehending English sentences. The study identifies two types of parsing under-utilization: partial and complete. Further exploration reveals that trial and error in syntactic processing contributes to both. Consequently, this study lays a foundation for the development of a novel parsing method designed to fully integrate syntactic processing into sentence comprehension, thereby enhancing the level of English sentence comprehension for Chinese learners of English.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00030v1,2024-12

Using a carefully designed pre-processing, a specialized morphological analyzer and tokenizer, this small and light-weight model performed not only to generate text but also indicated the feasibility of understanding clinical and medicine text. In comparison to other large language models, a fine-tuning NCVC-slm-1 demonstrated the highest scores on 6 tasks of total 8 on JMED-LLM. According to this result, SLM indicated the feasibility of performing several downstream tasks in the field of clinical and medicine. Hopefully, NCVC-slm-1 will be contributed to develop and accelerate the field of clinical and medicine for a bright future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16423v1,2024-12
Beyond End-to-End VLMs: Leveraging Intermediate Text Representations for Superior Flowchart Understanding,"Junyi Ye, Ankan Dash, Wenpeng Yin, Guiling Wang","Flowcharts are typically presented as images, driving the trend of using vision-language models (VLMs) for end-to-end flowchart understanding. However, two key challenges arise: (i) Limited controllability--users have minimal influence over the downstream task, as they can only modify input images, while the training of VLMs is often out of reach for most researchers. (ii) Lack of explainability--it is difficult to trace VLM errors to specific causes, such as failures in visual encoding or reasoning. We propose TextFlow, addressing aforementioned issues with two stages: (i) Vision Textualizer--which generates textual representations from flowchart images; and (ii) Textual Reasoner--which performs question-answering based on the text representations. TextFlow offers three key advantages: (i) users can select the type of text representations (e.g., Graphviz, Mermaid, PlantUML), or further convert them into executable graph object to call tools, enhancing performance and controllability; (ii) it improves explainability by helping to attribute errors more clearly to visual or textual processing components; and (iii) it promotes the modularization of the solution, such as allowing advanced LLMs to be used in the Reasoner stage when VLMs underperform in end-to-end fashion. Experiments on the FlowVQA and FlowLearn benchmarks demonstrate TextFlow's state-of-the-art performance as well as its robustness. All code is publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16420v1,2024-12
Identifying Cyberbullying Roles in Social Media,"Manuel Sandoval, Mohammed Abuhamad, Patrick Furman, Mujtaba Nazari, Deborah L. Hall, Yasin N. Silva","Social media has revolutionized communication, allowing people worldwide to connect and interact instantly. However, it has also led to increases in cyberbullying, which poses a significant threat to children and adolescents globally, affecting their mental health and well-being. It is critical to accurately detect the roles of individuals involved in cyberbullying incidents to effectively address the issue on a large scale. This study explores the use of machine learning models to detect the roles involved in cyberbullying interactions. After examining the AMiCA dataset and addressing class imbalance issues, we evaluate the performance of various models built with four underlying LLMs (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT-2) for role detection. Our analysis shows that oversampling techniques help improve model performance. The best model, a fine-tuned RoBERTa using oversampled data, achieved an overall F1 score of 83.5%, increasing to 89.3% after applying a prediction threshold. The top-2 F1 score without thresholding was 95.7%. Our method outperforms previously proposed models. After investigating the per-class model performance and confidence scores, we show that the models perform well in classes with more samples and less contextual confusion (e.g., Bystander Other), but struggle with classes with fewer samples (e.g., Bystander Assistant) and more contextual ambiguity (e.g., Harasser and Victim). This work highlights current strengths and limitations in the development of accurate models with limited data and complex scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16417v1,2024-12

Application of Multimodal Large Language Models in Autonomous Driving,Md Robiul Islam,"In this era of technological advancements, several cutting-edge techniques are being implemented to enhance Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, focusing on improving safety, efficiency, and adaptability in complex driving environments. However, AD still faces some problems including performance limitations. To address this problem, we conducted an in-depth study on implementing the Multi-modal Large Language Model. We constructed a Virtual Question Answering (VQA) dataset to fine-tune the model and address problems with the poor performance of MLLM on AD. We then break down the AD decision-making process by scene understanding, prediction, and decision-making. Chain of Thought has been used to make the decision more perfectly. Our experiments and detailed analysis of Autonomous Driving give an idea of how important MLLM is for AD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16410v1,2024-12
REFA: Reference Free Alignment for multi-preference optimization,"Taneesh Gupta, Rahul Madhavan, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan","We introduce REFA, a family of reference-free alignment methods that optimize over multiple user preferences while enforcing fine-grained length control. Our approach integrates deviation-based weighting to emphasize high-quality responses more strongly, length normalization to prevent trivial short-response solutions, and an EOS-probability regularizer to mitigate dataset-induced brevity biases. Theoretically, we show that under the Uncertainty Reduction with Sequence Length Assertion (URSLA), naive length normalization can still incentivize length-based shortcuts. By contrast, REFA corrects these subtle incentives, guiding models toward genuinely more informative and higher-quality outputs. Empirically, REFA sets a new state-of-the-art among reference-free alignment methods, producing richer responses aligned more closely with human preferences. Compared to a base supervised fine-tuned (SFT) mistral-7b model that achieves 8.4% length-controlled win rate (LC-WR) and 6.2% win rate (WR), our best REFA configuration attains 21.62% LC-WR and 19.87% WR on the AlpacaEval v2 benchmark. This represents a substantial improvement over both the strongest multi-preference baseline, InfoNCA (16.82% LC-WR, 10.44% WR), and the strongest reference-free baseline, SimPO (20.01% LC-WR, 17.65% WR)",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16378v2,2024-12

A High-Quality Text-Rich Image Instruction Tuning Dataset via Hybrid Instruction Generation,"Shijie Zhou, Ruiyi Zhang, Yufan Zhou, Changyou Chen","Large multimodal models still struggle with text-rich images because of inadequate training data. Self-Instruct provides an annotation-free way for generating instruction data, but its quality is poor, as multimodal alignment remains a hurdle even for the largest models. In this work, we propose LLaVAR-2, to enhance multimodal alignment for text-rich images through hybrid instruction generation between human annotators and large language models. Specifically, it involves detailed image captions from human annotators, followed by the use of these annotations in tailored text prompts for GPT-4o to curate a dataset. It also implements several mechanisms to filter out low-quality data, and the resulting dataset comprises 424k high-quality pairs of instructions. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on this dataset exhibit impressive enhancements over those trained with self-instruct data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16364v1,2024-12
Human-Readable Adversarial Prompts: An Investigation into LLM Vulnerabilities Using Situational Context,"Nilanjana Das, Edward Raff, Manas Gaur","Previous research on LLM vulnerabilities often relied on nonsensical adversarial prompts, which were easily detectable by automated methods. We address this gap by focusing on human-readable adversarial prompts, a more realistic and potent threat. Our key contributions are situation-driven attacks leveraging movie scripts to create contextually relevant, human-readable prompts that successfully deceive LLMs, adversarial suffix conversion to transform nonsensical adversarial suffixes into meaningful text, and AdvPrompter with p-nucleus sampling, a method to generate diverse, human-readable adversarial suffixes, improving attack efficacy in models like GPT-3.5 and Gemma 7B. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can be tricked by sophisticated adversaries into producing harmful responses with human-readable adversarial prompts and that there exists a scope for improvement when it comes to robust LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16359v1,2024-12
A Machine Learning Approach for Emergency Detection in Medical Scenarios Using Large Language Models,"Ferit Akaybicen, Aaron Cummings, Lota Iwuagwu, Xinyue Zhang, Modupe Adewuyi","The rapid identification of medical emergencies through digital communication channels remains a critical challenge in modern healthcare delivery, particularly with the increasing prevalence of telemedicine. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering techniques for automated emergency detection in medical communications. We developed and evaluated a comprehensive system using multiple LLaMA model variants (1B, 3B, and 7B parameters) to classify medical scenarios as emergency or non-emergency situations. Our methodology incorporated both system prompts and in-prompt training approaches, evaluated across different hardware configurations. The results demonstrate exceptional performance, with the LLaMA 2 (7B) model achieving 99.7% accuracy and the LLaMA 3.2 (3B) model reaching 99.6% accuracy with optimal prompt engineering. Through systematic testing of training examples within the prompts, we identified that including 10 example scenarios in the model prompts yielded optimal classification performance. Processing speeds varied significantly between platforms, ranging from 0.05 to 2.2 seconds per request. The system showed particular strength in minimizing high-risk false negatives in emergency scenarios, which is crucial for patient safety. The code implementation and evaluation framework are publicly available on GitHub, facilitating further research and development in this crucial area of healthcare technology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16341v1,2024-12
Deliberative Alignment: Reasoning Enables Safer Language Models,"Melody Y. Guan, Manas Joglekar, Eric Wallace, Saachi Jain, Boaz Barak, Alec Helyar, Rachel Dias, Andrea Vallone, Hongyu Ren, Jason Wei, Hyung Won Chung, Sam Toyer, Johannes Heidecke, Alex Beutel, Amelia Glaese","As large-scale language models increasingly impact safety-critical domains, ensuring their reliable adherence to well-defined principles remains a fundamental challenge. We introduce Deliberative Alignment, a new paradigm that directly teaches the model safety specifications and trains it to explicitly recall and accurately reason over the specifications before answering. We used this approach to align OpenAI's o-series models, and achieved highly precise adherence to OpenAI's safety policies, without requiring human-written chain-of-thoughts or answers. Deliberative Alignment pushes the Pareto frontier by simultaneously increasing robustness to jailbreaks while decreasing overrefusal rates, and also improves out-of-distribution generalization. We demonstrate that reasoning over explicitly specified policies enables more scalable, trustworthy, and interpretable alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16339v2,2024-12

Decoding Linguistic Nuances in Mental Health Text Classification Using Expressive Narrative Stories,"Jinwen Tang, Qiming Guo, Yunxin Zhao, Yi Shang","Recent advancements in NLP have spurred significant interest in analyzing social media text data for identifying linguistic features indicative of mental health issues. However, the domain of Expressive Narrative Stories (ENS)-deeply personal and emotionally charged narratives that offer rich psychological insights-remains underexplored. This study bridges this gap by utilizing a dataset sourced from Reddit, focusing on ENS from individuals with and without self-declared depression. Our research evaluates the utility of advanced language models, BERT and MentalBERT, against traditional models. We find that traditional models are sensitive to the absence of explicit topic-related words, which could risk their potential to extend applications to ENS that lack clear mental health terminology. Despite MentalBERT is design to better handle psychiatric contexts, it demonstrated a dependency on specific topic words for classification accuracy, raising concerns about its application when explicit mental health terms are sparse (P-value<0.05). In contrast, BERT exhibited minimal sensitivity to the absence of topic words in ENS, suggesting its superior capability to understand deeper linguistic features, making it more effective for real-world applications. Both BERT and MentalBERT excel at recognizing linguistic nuances and maintaining classification accuracy even when narrative order is disrupted. This resilience is statistically significant, with sentence shuffling showing substantial impacts on model performance (P-value<0.05), especially evident in ENS comparisons between individuals with and without mental health declarations. These findings underscore the importance of exploring ENS for deeper insights into mental health-related narratives, advocating for a nuanced approach to mental health text analysis that moves beyond mere keyword detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16302v1,2024-12
Benchmarking LLMs and SLMs for patient reported outcomes,"Matteo Marengo, Jarod Lévy, Jean-Emmanuel Bibault","LLMs have transformed the execution of numerous tasks, including those in the medical domain. Among these, summarizing patient-reported outcomes (PROs) into concise natural language reports is of particular interest to clinicians, as it enables them to focus on critical patient concerns and spend more time in meaningful discussions. While existing work with LLMs like GPT-4 has shown impressive results, real breakthroughs could arise from leveraging SLMs as they offer the advantage of being deployable locally, ensuring patient data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations. This study benchmarks several SLMs against LLMs for summarizing patient-reported Q\&A forms in the context of radiotherapy. Using various metrics, we evaluate their precision and reliability. The findings highlight both the promise and limitations of SLMs for high-stakes medical tasks, fostering more efficient and privacy-preserving AI-driven healthcare solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16291v1,2024-12
Offline Reinforcement Learning for LLM Multi-Step Reasoning,"Huaijie Wang, Shibo Hao, Hanze Dong, Shenao Zhang, Yilin Bao, Ziran Yang, Yi Wu","Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with offline reinforcement learning (RL) is essential for quickly adapting them to complex tasks. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise in aligning LLMs with human preferences, it is less suitable for multi-step reasoning tasks because (1) DPO relies on paired preference data, which is not readily available for multi-step reasoning tasks, and (2) it treats all tokens uniformly, making it ineffective for credit assignment in multi-step reasoning tasks, which often come with sparse reward. In this work, we propose OREO (Offline Reasoning Optimization), an offline RL method for enhancing LLM multi-step reasoning. Building on insights from previous works of maximum entropy reinforcement learning, it jointly learns a policy model and value function by optimizing the soft Bellman Equation. We show in principle that it reduces the need to collect pairwise data and enables better credit assignment. Empirically, OREO surpasses existing offline learning methods on multi-step reasoning benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and embodied agent control (ALFWorld). The approach can be extended to a multi-iteration framework when additional resources are available. Furthermore, the learned value function can be leveraged to guide the tree search for free, which can further boost performance during test time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16145v2,2024-12
Can LLMs Obfuscate Code? A Systematic Analysis of Large Language Models into Assembly Code Obfuscation,"Seyedreza Mohseni, Seyedali Mohammadi, Deepa Tilwani, Yash Saxena, Gerald Ndawula, Sriram Vema, Edward Raff, Manas Gaur","Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk.

PromptOptMe: Error-Aware Prompt Compression for LLM-based MT Evaluation Metrics,"Daniil Larionov, Steffen Eger","Evaluating the quality of machine-generated natural language content is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Recently, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been employed for this purpose, but they are computationally expensive due to the extensive token usage required by complex evaluation prompts. In this paper, we propose a prompt optimization approach that uses a smaller, fine-tuned language model to compress input data for evaluation prompt, thus reducing token usage and computational cost when using larger LLMs for downstream evaluation. Our method involves a two-stage fine-tuning process: supervised fine-tuning followed by preference optimization to refine the model's outputs based on human preferences. We focus on Machine Translation (MT) evaluation and utilize the GEMBA-MQM metric as a starting point. Our results show a $2.37\times$ reduction in token usage without any loss in evaluation quality. This work makes state-of-the-art LLM-based metrics like GEMBA-MQM more cost-effective and efficient, enhancing their accessibility for broader use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16120v1,2024-12
Logical Consistency of Large Language Models in Fact-checking,"Bishwamittra Ghosh, Sarah Hasan, Naheed Anjum Arafat, Arijit Khan","In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in performing varied natural language tasks such as language translation, question-answering, summarizing, fact-checking, etc. Despite LLMs' impressive ability to generate human-like texts, LLMs are infamous for their inconsistent responses -- a meaning-preserving change in the input query results in an inconsistent response and attributes to vulnerabilities of LLMs such as hallucination, jailbreaking, etc. Consequently, existing research focuses on simple paraphrasing-based consistency assessment of LLMs, and ignores complex queries that necessitates an even better understanding of logical reasoning by an LLM. Our work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex logical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction, and disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a fact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from real-world knowledge graphs (KGs). Our contributions are three-fold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical fact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically consistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on propositional logic queries as input and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical consistency, specially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised fine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex fact-checking task with KG contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16100v1,2024-12
Towards Interpretable Radiology Report Generation via Concept Bottlenecks using a Multi-Agentic RAG,"Hasan Md Tusfiqur Alam, Devansh Srivastav, Md Abdul Kadir, Daniel Sonntag","Deep learning has advanced medical image classification, but interpretability challenges hinder its clinical adoption. This study enhances interpretability in Chest X-ray (CXR) classification by using concept bottleneck models (CBMs) and a multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for report generation. By modeling relationships between visual features and clinical concepts, we create interpretable concept vectors that guide a multi-agent RAG system to generate radiology reports, enhancing clinical relevance, explainability, and transparency. Evaluation of the generated reports using an LLM-as-a-judge confirmed the interpretability and clinical utility of our model's outputs. On the COVID-QU dataset, our model achieved 81% classification accuracy and demonstrated robust report generation performance, with five key metrics ranging between 84% and 90%.

We introduce 'LLM Ethics Whitepaper', which we provide as an open and living resource for NLP practitioners, and those tasked with evaluating the ethical implications of others' work. Our goal is to translate ethics literature into concrete recommendations and provocations for thinking with clear first steps, aimed at computer scientists. 'LLM Ethics Whitepaper' distils a thorough literature review into clear Do's and Don'ts, which we present also in this paper. We likewise identify useful toolkits to support ethical work. We refer the interested reader to the full LLM Ethics Whitepaper, which provides a succinct discussion of ethical considerations at each stage in a project lifecycle, as well as citations for the hundreds of papers from which we drew our recommendations.

Fearful Falcons and Angry Llamas: Emotion Category Annotations of Arguments by Humans and LLMs,"Lynn Greschner, Roman Klinger","Arguments evoke emotions, influencing the effect of the argument itself. Not only the emotional intensity but also the category influence the argument's effects, for instance, the willingness to adapt stances. While binary emotionality has been studied in arguments, there is no work on discrete emotion categories (e.g., ""Anger"") in such data. To fill this gap, we crowdsource subjective annotations of emotion categories in a German argument corpus and evaluate automatic LLM-based labeling methods. Specifically, we compare three prompting strategies (zero-shot, one-shot, chain-of-thought) on three large instruction-tuned language models (Falcon-7b-instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-instruct, GPT-4o-mini). We further vary the definition of the output space to be binary (is there emotionality in the argument?), closed-domain (which emotion from a given label set is in the argument?), or open-domain (which emotion is in the argument?). We find that emotion categories enhance the prediction of emotionality in arguments, emphasizing the need for discrete emotion annotations in arguments. Across all prompt settings and models, automatic predictions show a high recall but low precision for predicting anger and fear, indicating a strong bias toward negative emotions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15993v1,2024-12

We utilize HGRN2 (Qin et al., 2024), a recently proposed RNN-based architecture, and comparatively evaluate its effectiveness against transformer-based baselines and other subquadratic architectures (LSTM, xLSTM, Mamba). Our experimental results show that BABYHGRN, our HGRN2 language model, outperforms transformer-based models in both the 10M and 100M word tracks of the challenge, as measured by their performance on the BLiMP, EWoK, GLUE and BEAR benchmarks.

From General to Specific: Tailoring Large Language Models for Personalized Healthcare,"Ruize Shi, Hong Huang, Wei Zhou, Kehan Yin, Kai Zhao, Yun Zhao","The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed many industries, including healthcare. However, previous medical LLMs have largely focused on leveraging general medical knowledge to provide responses, without accounting for patient variability and lacking true personalization at the individual level. To address this, we propose a novel method called personalized medical language model (PMLM), which explores and optimizes personalized LLMs through recommendation systems and reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, by utilizing self-informed and peer-informed personalization, PMLM captures changes in behaviors and preferences to design initial personalized prompts tailored to individual needs. We further refine these initial personalized prompts through RL, ultimately enhancing the precision of LLM guidance. Notably, the personalized prompt are hard prompt, which grants PMLM high adaptability and reusability, allowing it to directly leverage high-quality proprietary LLMs. We evaluate PMLM using real-world obstetrics and gynecology data, and the experimental results demonstrate that PMLM achieves personalized responses, and it provides more refined and individualized services, offering a potential way for personalized medical LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15957v1,2024-12
Development of a Large-scale Dataset of Chest Computed Tomography Reports in Japanese and a High-performance Finding Classification Model,"Yosuke Yamagishi, Yuta Nakamura, Tomohiro Kikuchi, Yuki Sonoda, Hiroshi Hirakawa, Shintaro Kano, Satoshi Nakamura, Shouhei Hanaoka, Takeharu Yoshikawa, Osamu Abe","Background: Recent advances in large language models highlight the need for high-quality multilingual medical datasets. While Japan leads globally in CT scanner deployment and utilization, the lack of large-scale Japanese radiology datasets has hindered the development of specialized language models for medical imaging analysis. Objective: To develop a comprehensive Japanese CT report dataset through machine translation and establish a specialized language model for structured finding classification. Additionally, to create a rigorously validated evaluation dataset through expert radiologist review. Methods: We translated the CT-RATE dataset (24,283 CT reports from 21,304 patients) into Japanese using GPT-4o mini. The training dataset consisted of 22,778 machine-translated reports, while the validation dataset included 150 radiologist-revised reports. We developed CT-BERT-JPN based on ""tohoku-nlp/bert-base-japanese-v3"" architecture for extracting 18 structured findings from Japanese radiology reports. Results: Translation metrics showed strong performance with BLEU scores of 0.731 and 0.690, and ROUGE scores ranging from 0.770 to 0.876 for Findings and from 0.748 to 0.857 for Impression sections. CT-BERT-JPN demonstrated superior performance compared to GPT-4o in 11 out of 18 conditions, including lymphadenopathy (+14.2%), interlobular septal thickening (+10.9%), and atelectasis (+7.4%). The model maintained F1 scores exceeding 0.95 in 14 out of 18 conditions and achieved perfect scores in four conditions. Conclusions: Our study establishes a robust Japanese CT report dataset and demonstrates the effectiveness of a specialized language model for structured finding classification. The hybrid approach of machine translation and expert validation enables the creation of large-scale medical datasets while maintaining high quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15907v1,2024-12
On the Suitability of pre-trained foundational LLMs for Analysis in German Legal Education,"Lorenz Wendlinger, Christian Braun, Abdullah Al Zubaer, Simon Alexander Nonn, Sarah Großkopf, Christofer Fellicious, Michael Granitzer","We show that current open-source foundational LLMs possess instruction capability and German legal background knowledge that is sufficient for some legal analysis in an educational context. However, model capability breaks down in very specific tasks, such as the classification of ""Gutachtenstil"" appraisal style components, or with complex contexts, such as complete legal opinions. Even with extended context and effective prompting strategies, they cannot match the Bag-of-Words baseline. To combat this, we introduce a Retrieval Augmented Generation based prompt example selection method that substantially improves predictions in high data availability scenarios. We further evaluate the performance of pre-trained LLMs on two standard tasks for argument mining and automated essay scoring and find it to be more adequate. Throughout, pre-trained LLMs improve upon the baseline in scenarios with little or no labeled data with Chain-of-Thought prompting further helping in the zero-shot case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15902v1,2024-12
A Thorough Investigation into the Application of Deep CNN for Enhancing Natural Language Processing Capabilities,"Chang Weng, Scott Rood, Mehdi Ali Ramezani, Amir Aslani, Reza Zarrab, Wang Zwuo, Sanjeev Salimans, Tim Satheesh","Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used in fields like machine translation and sentiment analysis. However, traditional NLP models struggle with accuracy and efficiency. This paper introduces Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) into NLP to address these issues.

The high-performance NLP model shows a 10% improvement in segmentation accuracy and a 4% increase in recall rate compared to traditional models. This integrated approach excels in tasks such as word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, and text classification, offering better recognition accuracy and processing efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15900v1,2024-12
"TelcoLM: collecting data, adapting, and benchmarking language models for the telecommunication domain","Camille Barboule, Viet-Phi Huynh, Adrien Bufort, Yoan Chabot, Géraldine Damnati, Gwénolé Lecorvé","Despite outstanding processes in many tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) still lack accuracy when dealing with highly technical domains. Especially, telecommunications (telco) is a particularly challenging domain due the large amount of lexical, semantic and conceptual peculiarities. Yet, this domain holds many valuable use cases, directly linked to industrial needs. Hence, this paper studies how LLMs can be adapted to the telco domain. It reports our effort to (i) collect a massive corpus of domain-specific data (800M tokens, 80K instructions), (ii) perform adaptation using various methodologies, and (iii) benchmark them against larger generalist models in downstream tasks that require extensive knowledge of telecommunications. Our experiments on Llama-2-7b show that domain-adapted models can challenge the large generalist models. They also suggest that adaptation can be restricted to a unique instruction-tuning step, dicarding the need for any fine-tuning on raw texts beforehand.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15891v1,2024-12
Align Anything: Training All-Modality Models to Follow Instructions with Language Feedback,"Jiaming Ji, Jiayi Zhou, Hantao Lou, Boyuan Chen, Donghai Hong, Xuyao Wang, Wenqi Chen, Kaile Wang, Rui Pan, Jiahao Li, Mohan Wang, Josef Dai, Tianyi Qiu, Hua Xu, Dong Li, Weipeng Chen, Jun Song, Bo Zheng, Yaodong Yang","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in enhancing the instruction-following capabilities of large language models; however, it remains underexplored in the cross-modality domain. As the number of modalities increases, aligning all-modality models with human intentions -- such as instruction following -- becomes a pressing challenge. In this work, we make the first attempt to fine-tune all-modality models (i.e. input and output with any modality, also named any-to-any models) using human preference data across all modalities (including text, image, audio, and video), ensuring its behavior aligns with human intentions. This endeavor presents several challenges. First, there is no large-scale all-modality human preference data in existing open-source resources, as most datasets are limited to specific modalities, predominantly text and image. Secondly, the effectiveness of binary preferences in RLHF for post-training alignment in complex all-modality scenarios remains an unexplored area. Finally, there is a lack of a systematic framework to evaluate the capabilities of all-modality models, particularly regarding modality selection and synergy. To address these challenges, we propose the align-anything framework, which includes meticulously annotated 200k all-modality human preference data. Then, we introduce an alignment method that learns from unified language feedback, effectively capturing complex modality-specific human preferences and enhancing the model's instruction-following capabilities. Furthermore, to assess performance improvements in all-modality models after post-training alignment, we construct a challenging all-modality capability evaluation framework -- eval-anything. All data, models, and code frameworks have been open-sourced for the community.

Enriching Social Science Research via Survey Item Linking,"Tornike Tsereteli, Daniel Ruffinelli, Simone Paolo Ponzetto","Questions within surveys, called survey items, are used in the social sciences to study latent concepts, such as the factors influencing life satisfaction. Instead of using explicit citations, researchers paraphrase the content of the survey items they use in-text. However, this makes it challenging to find survey items of interest when comparing related work. Automatically parsing and linking these implicit mentions to survey items in a knowledge base can provide more fine-grained references. We model this task, called Survey Item Linking (SIL), in two stages: mention detection and entity disambiguation. Due to an imprecise definition of the task, existing datasets used for evaluating the performance for SIL are too small and of low-quality. We argue that latent concepts and survey item mentions should be differentiated. To this end, we create a high-quality and richly annotated dataset consisting of 20,454 English and German sentences. By benchmarking deep learning systems for each of the two stages independently and sequentially, we demonstrate that the task is feasible, but observe that errors propagate from the first stage, leading to a lower overall task performance. Moreover, mentions that require the context of multiple sentences are more challenging to identify for models in the first stage. Modeling the entire context of a document and combining the two stages into an end-to-end system could mitigate these problems in future work, and errors could additionally be reduced by collecting more diverse data and by improving the quality of the knowledge base. The data and code are available at https://github.com/e-tornike/SIL .",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15831v1,2024-12
S$^2$DN: Learning to Denoise Unconvincing Knowledge for Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion,"Tengfei Ma, Yujie Chen, Liang Wang, Xuan Lin, Bosheng Song, Xiangxiang Zeng","Inductive Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to infer missing facts between newly emerged entities within knowledge graphs (KGs), posing a significant challenge. While recent studies have shown promising results in inferring such entities through knowledge subgraph reasoning, they suffer from (i) the semantic inconsistencies of similar relations, and (ii) noisy interactions inherent in KGs due to the presence of unconvincing knowledge for emerging entities. To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic Structure-aware Denoising Network (S$^2$DN) for inductive KGC. Our goal is to learn adaptable general semantics and reliable structures to distill consistent semantic knowledge while preserving reliable interactions within KGs. Specifically, we introduce a semantic smoothing module over the enclosing subgraphs to retain the universal semantic knowledge of relations. We incorporate a structure refining module to filter out unreliable interactions and offer additional knowledge, retaining robust structure surrounding target links. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark KGs demonstrate that S$^2$DN surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art models. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of S$^2$DN in preserving semantic consistency and enhancing the robustness of filtering out unreliable interactions in contaminated KGs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15822v1,2024-12

Ensembling Large Language Models with Process Reward-Guided Tree Search for Better Complex Reasoning,"Sungjin Park, Xiao Liu, Yeyun Gong, Edward Choi","Despite recent advances in large language models, open-source models often struggle to consistently perform well on complex reasoning tasks. Existing ensemble methods, whether applied at the token or output levels, fail to address these challenges. In response, we present Language model Ensemble with Monte Carlo Tree Search (LE-MCTS), a novel framework for process-level ensembling of language models. LE-MCTS formulates step-by-step reasoning with an ensemble of language models as a Markov decision process. In this framework, states represent intermediate reasoning paths, while actions consist of generating the next reasoning step using one of the language models selected from a predefined pool. Guided by a process-based reward model, LE-MCTS performs a tree search over the reasoning steps generated by different language models, identifying the most accurate reasoning chain. Experimental results on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms both single language model decoding algorithms and language model ensemble methods. Notably, LE-MCTS improves performance by 3.6% and 4.3% on the MATH and MQA datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness in solving complex reasoning problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15797v1,2024-12

Linguistic Features Extracted by GPT-4 Improve Alzheimer's Disease Detection based on Spontaneous Speech,"Jonathan Heitz, Gerold Schneider, Nicolas Langer","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a significant and growing public health concern. Investigating alterations in speech and language patterns offers a promising path towards cost-effective and non-invasive early detection of AD on a large scale. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, have enabled powerful new possibilities for semantic text analysis. In this study, we leverage GPT-4 to extract five semantic features from transcripts of spontaneous patient speech. The features capture known symptoms of AD, but they are difficult to quantify effectively using traditional methods of computational linguistics. We demonstrate the clinical significance of these features and further validate one of them (""Word-Finding Difficulties"") against a proxy measure and human raters. When combined with established linguistic features and a Random Forest classifier, the GPT-derived features significantly improve the detection of AD. Our approach proves effective for both manually transcribed and automatically generated transcripts, representing a novel and impactful use of recent advancements in LLMs for AD speech analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15772v1,2024-12
Critique of Impure Reason: Unveiling the reasoning behaviour of medical Large Language Models,"Shamus Sim, Tyrone Chen","Background: Despite the current ubiquity of Large Language Models (LLMs) across the medical domain, there is a surprising lack of studies which address their reasoning behaviour. We emphasise the importance of understanding reasoning behaviour as opposed to high-level prediction accuracies, since it is equivalent to explainable AI (XAI) in this context. In particular, achieving XAI in medical LLMs used in the clinical domain will have a significant impact across the healthcare sector. Results: Therefore, we define the concept of reasoning behaviour in the specific context of medical LLMs. We then categorise and discuss the current state of the art of methods which evaluate reasoning behaviour in medical LLMs. Finally, we propose theoretical frameworks which can empower medical professionals or machine learning engineers to gain insight into the low-level reasoning operations of these previously obscure models. Conclusion: The subsequent increased transparency and trust in medical machine learning models by clinicians as well as patients will accelerate the integration, application as well as further development of medical AI for the healthcare system as a whole",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15748v1,2024-12
Fine-tuning Whisper on Low-Resource Languages for Real-World Applications,"Vincenzo Timmel, Claudio Paonessa, Reza Kakooee, Manfred Vogel, Daniel Perruchoud","This paper presents a new approach to fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper model for low-resource languages by introducing a novel data generation method that converts sentence-level data into a long-form corpus, using Swiss German as a case study. Non-sentence-level data, which could improve the performance of long-form audio, is difficult to obtain and often restricted by copyright laws. Our method bridges this gap by transforming more accessible sentence-level data into a format that preserves the model's ability to handle long-form audio and perform segmentation without requiring non-sentence-level data. Our data generation process improves performance in several real-world applications and leads to the development of a new state-of-the-art speech-to-text (STT) model for Swiss German. We compare our model with a non-fine-tuned Whisper and our previous state-of-the-art Swiss German STT models, where our new model achieves higher BLEU scores. Our results also indicate that the proposed method is adaptable to other low-resource languages, supported by written guidance and code that allows the creation of fine-tuned Whisper models, which keep segmentation capabilities and allow the transcription of longer audio files using only sentence-level data with high quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15726v1,2024-12

AutoLife only inputs low-cost sensor data (without photos or audio) from smartphones and can automatically generate comprehensive life journals for users. To achieve this, we first derive time, motion, and location contexts from multimodal sensor data, and harness the zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), enriched with commonsense knowledge about human lives, to interpret diverse contexts and generate life journals. To manage the task complexity and long sensing duration, a multilayer framework is proposed, which decomposes tasks and seamlessly integrates LLMs with other techniques for life journaling.

This approach outperforms traditional ASR pretraining and enables the model to surpass models specialized on speech translation and question answering while being trained on only 10% of the task-specific data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15712v1,2024-12
Collaborative Gym: A Framework for Enabling and Evaluating Human-Agent Collaboration,"Yijia Shao, Vinay Samuel, Yucheng Jiang, John Yang, Diyi Yang","Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have sparked growing interest in developing LM agents. While fully autonomous agents could excel in many scenarios, numerous use cases inherently require them to collaborate with humans due to humans' latent preferences, domain expertise, or need for control. To facilitate the study of human-agent collaboration, we present Collaborative Gym (Co-Gym), a general framework enabling asynchronous, tripartite interaction among agents, humans, and task environments. We instantiate Co-Gym with three representative tasks in both simulated and real-world conditions, and propose an evaluation framework that assesses both the collaboration outcomes and processes. Our findings reveal that collaborative agents consistently outperform their fully autonomous counterparts in task performance within those delivered cases, achieving win rates of 86% in Travel Planning, 74% in Tabular Analysis, and 66% in Related Work when evaluated by real users.

Variability Need Not Imply Error: The Case of Adequate but Semantically Distinct Responses,"Evgenia Ilia, Wilker Aziz","With the broader use of language models (LMs) comes the need to estimate their ability to respond reliably to prompts (e.g., are generated responses likely to be correct?). Uncertainty quantification tools (notions of confidence and entropy, i.a.) can be used to that end (e.g., to reject a response when the model is `uncertain'). For example, Kuhn et al. (semantic entropy; 2022b) regard semantic variation amongst sampled responses as evidence that the model `struggles' with the prompt and that the LM is likely to err. We argue that semantic variability need not imply error--this being especially intuitive in open-ended settings, where prompts elicit multiple adequate but semantically distinct responses. Hence, we propose to annotate sampled responses for their adequacy to the prompt (e.g., using a classifier) and estimate the Probability the model assigns to Adequate Responses (PROBAR), which we then regard as an indicator of the model's reliability at the instance level. We evaluate PROBAR as a measure of confidence in selective prediction with OPT models (in two QA datasets and in next-word prediction, for English) and find PROBAR to outperform semantic entropy across prompts with varying degrees of ambiguity/open-endedness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15683v1,2024-12
Inference Scaling vs Reasoning: An Empirical Analysis of Compute-Optimal LLM Problem-Solving,"Marwan AbdElhameed, Pavly Halim","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have predominantly focused on maximizing accuracy and reasoning capabilities, often overlooking crucial computational efficiency considerations. While this approach has yielded impressive accuracy improvements, it has led to methods that may be impractical for real-world deployment due to computational overhead and latency constraints. This paper investigates the potential synergy between reasoning enhancement and computational efficiency by analyzing the integration of two contrasting approaches: Quiet-STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner) and REBASE (REward BAlanced SEarch). Through comprehensive empirical analysis using the Mistral-7B model on the GSM8K dataset, we demonstrate that while each method excels in its primary objective-Quiet-STaR achieving superior accuracy (32.03%) despite high computational cost (554.66s runtime, 12.73T FLOPs), and REBASE providing exceptional efficiency (8.47s runtime, 2.35T FLOPs) while maintaining baseline-comparable accuracy (10.94%)-their integration reveals fundamental challenges in reconciling reasoning depth with computational efficiency. The combined approach unexpectedly results in degraded performance (9.38% accuracy, 143.66s runtime), highlighting critical insights about the complex interplay between reasoning enhancement and efficiency optimization in LLMs. Our findings illuminate the need for novel architectures and algorithms specifically designed to bridge the gap between these competing objectives, while providing concrete directions for future research in compute-efficient reasoning methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16260v1,2024-12

By leveraging these APIs as functional tools, enterprises can design diverse, scenario-specific agent applications, driven by on-premise function-calling models as the core engine.

In this paper, we propose a training pipeline for function-calling capabilities tailored to real-world business scenarios. This pipeline includes the synthesis and augmentation of scenario-specific function-calling data, model fine-tuning, and performance evaluation and analysis. Using this pipeline, we generated 1,260 fully AI-generated samples and 1,035 augmented manually-labeled samples in digital HR agent scenario.

MathSpeech: Leveraging Small LMs for Accurate Conversion in Mathematical Speech-to-Formula,"Sieun Hyeon, Kyudan Jung, Jaehee Won, Nam-Joon Kim, Hyun Gon Ryu, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Jaeyoung Do","In various academic and professional settings, such as mathematics lectures or research presentations, it is often necessary to convey mathematical expressions orally. However, reading mathematical expressions aloud without accompanying visuals can significantly hinder comprehension, especially for those who are hearing-impaired or rely on subtitles due to language barriers. For instance, when a presenter reads Euler's Formula, current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models often produce a verbose and error-prone textual description (e.g., e to the power of i x equals cosine of x plus i $\textit{side}$ of x), instead of the concise $\LaTeX{}$ format (i.e., $ e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x) $), which hampers clear understanding and communication. To address this issue, we introduce MathSpeech, a novel pipeline that integrates ASR models with small Language Models (sLMs) to correct errors in mathematical expressions and accurately convert spoken expressions into structured $\LaTeX{}$ representations. Evaluated on a new dataset derived from lecture recordings, MathSpeech demonstrates $\LaTeX{}$ generation capabilities comparable to leading commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), while leveraging fine-tuned small language models of only 120M parameters. Specifically, in terms of CER, BLEU, and ROUGE scores for $\LaTeX{}$ translation, MathSpeech demonstrated significantly superior capabilities compared to GPT-4o.

Error-driven Data-efficient Large Multimodal Model Tuning,"Barry Menglong Yao, Qifan Wang, Lifu Huang","Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across numerous academic benchmarks. However, fine-tuning still remains essential to achieve satisfactory performance on downstream tasks, while the task-specific tuning samples are usually not readily available or expensive and time-consuming to obtain. To address this, we propose an error-driven data-efficient tuning framework that aims to efficiently adapt generic LMMs to newly emerging tasks without requiring any task-specific training samples. In our approach, a generic LMM, acting as a student model, is first evaluated on a small validation set of the target task, and then a more powerful model, acting as a teacher model, identifies the erroneous steps within the student model's reasoning steps and analyzes its capability gaps from fully addressing the target task. Based on these gaps, targeted training samples are further retrieved from existing task-agnostic datasets to tune the student model and tailor it to the target task. We perform extensive experiments across three different training data scales and seven tasks, demonstrating that our training paradigm significantly and efficiently improves LMM's performance on downstream tasks, achieving an average performance boost of 7.01%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15652v1,2024-12
Can Input Attributions Interpret the Inductive Reasoning Process Elicited in In-Context Learning?,"Mengyu Ye, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Goro Kobayashi, Jun Suzuki","Elucidating the rationale behind neural models' outputs has been challenging in the machine learning field, which is indeed applicable in this age of large language models (LLMs) and in-context learning (ICL). When it comes to estimating input attributions (IA), ICL poses a new issue of interpreting which example in the prompt, consisting of a set of examples, contributed to identifying the task/rule to be solved. To this end, in this paper, we introduce synthetic diagnostic tasks inspired by the poverty of the stimulus design in inductive reasoning; here, most in-context examples are ambiguous w.r.t. their underlying rule, and one critical example disambiguates the task demonstrated. The question is whether conventional IA methods can identify such an example in interpreting the inductive reasoning process in ICL. Our experiments provide several practical findings; for example, a certain simple IA method works the best, and the larger the model, the generally harder it is to interpret the ICL with gradient-based IA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15628v1,2024-12

Don't Do RAG: When Cache-Augmented Generation is All You Need for Knowledge Tasks,"Brian J Chan, Chao-Ting Chen, Jui-Hung Cheng, Hen-Hsen Huang","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained traction as a powerful approach for enhancing language models by integrating external knowledge sources. However, RAG introduces challenges such as retrieval latency, potential errors in document selection, and increased system complexity. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) featuring significantly extended context windows, this paper proposes an alternative paradigm, cache-augmented generation (CAG) that bypasses real-time retrieval. Our method involves preloading all relevant resources, especially when the documents or knowledge for retrieval are of a limited and manageable size, into the LLM's extended context and caching its runtime parameters. During inference, the model utilizes these preloaded parameters to answer queries without additional retrieval steps. Comparative analyses reveal that CAG eliminates retrieval latency and minimizes retrieval errors while maintaining context relevance. Performance evaluations across multiple benchmarks highlight scenarios where long-context LLMs either outperform or complement traditional RAG pipelines. These findings suggest that, for certain applications, particularly those with a constrained knowledge base, CAG provide a streamlined and efficient alternative to RAG, achieving comparable or superior results with reduced complexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15605v1,2024-12
Dynamic Label Name Refinement for Few-Shot Dialogue Intent Classification,"Gyutae Park, Ingeol Baek, ByeongJeong Kim, Joongbo Shin, Hwanhee Lee","Dialogue intent classification aims to identify the underlying purpose or intent of a user's input in a conversation. Current intent classification systems encounter considerable challenges, primarily due to the vast number of possible intents and the significant semantic overlap among similar intent classes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to few-shot dialogue intent classification through in-context learning, incorporating dynamic label refinement to address these challenges. Our method retrieves relevant examples for a test input from the training set and leverages a large language model to dynamically refine intent labels based on semantic understanding, ensuring that intents are clearly distinguishable from one another. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves confusion between semantically similar intents, resulting in significantly enhanced performance across multiple datasets compared to baselines. We also show that our method generates more interpretable intent labels, and has a better semantic coherence in capturing underlying user intents compared to baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15603v1,2024-12
Template-Driven LLM-Paraphrased Framework for Tabular Math Word Problem Generation,"Xiaoqiang Kang, Zimu Wang, Xiaobo Jin, Wei Wang, Kaizhu Huang, Qiufeng Wang","Solving tabular math word problems (TMWPs) has become a critical role in evaluating the mathematical reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), where large-scale TMWP samples are commonly required for LLM fine-tuning. Since the collection of high-quality TMWP datasets is costly and time-consuming, recent research has concentrated on automatic TMWP generation. However, current generated samples usually suffer from issues of either correctness or diversity. In this paper, we propose a Template-driven LLM-paraphrased (TeLL) framework for generating high-quality TMWP samples with diverse backgrounds and accurate tables, questions, answers, and solutions. To this end, we first extract templates from existing real samples to generate initial problems, ensuring correctness. Then, we adopt an LLM to extend templates and paraphrase problems, obtaining diverse TMWP samples. Furthermore, we find the reasoning annotation is important for solving TMWPs. Therefore, we propose to enrich each solution with illustrative reasoning steps. Through the proposed framework, we construct a high-quality dataset TabMWP-TeLL by adhering to the question types in the TabMWP dataset, and we conduct extensive experiments on a variety of LLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of TabMWP-TeLL in improving TMWP solving performance.

This paper presents Adversarial Robustness through Dynamic Ensemble Learning (ARDEL), a novel scheme designed to enhance the robustness of PLMs against such attacks. ARDEL leverages the diversity of multiple PLMs and dynamically adjusts the ensemble configuration based on input characteristics and detected adversarial patterns. Key components of ARDEL include a meta-model for dynamic weighting, an adversarial pattern detection module, and adversarial training with regularization techniques. Comprehensive evaluations using standardized datasets and various adversarial attack scenarios demonstrate that ARDEL significantly improves robustness compared to existing methods. By dynamically reconfiguring the ensemble to prioritize the most robust models for each input, ARDEL effectively reduces attack success rates and maintains higher accuracy under adversarial conditions. This work contributes to the broader goal of developing more secure and trustworthy AI systems for real-world NLP applications, offering a practical and scalable solution to enhance adversarial resilience in PLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16254v1,2024-12
Continual Learning Using a Kernel-Based Method Over Foundation Models,"Saleh Momeni, Sahisnu Mazumder, Bing Liu","Continual learning (CL) learns a sequence of tasks incrementally. This paper studies the challenging CL setting of class-incremental learning (CIL). CIL has two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting (CF) and inter-task class separation (ICS). Despite numerous proposed methods, these issues remain persistent obstacles. This paper proposes a novel CIL method, called Kernel Linear Discriminant Analysis (KLDA), that can effectively avoid CF and ICS problems. It leverages only the powerful features learned in a foundation model (FM). However, directly using these features proves suboptimal. To address this, KLDA incorporates the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and its Random Fourier Features (RFF) to enhance the feature representations from the FM, leading to improved performance. When a new task arrives, KLDA computes only the mean for each class in the task and updates a shared covariance matrix for all learned classes based on the kernelized features. Classification is performed using Linear Discriminant Analysis. Our empirical evaluation using text and image classification datasets demonstrates that KLDA significantly outperforms baselines. Remarkably, without relying on replay data, KLDA achieves accuracy comparable to joint training of all classes, which is considered the upper bound for CIL performance. The KLDA code is available at https://github.com/salehmomeni/klda.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15571v1,2024-12
In-context Continual Learning Assisted by an External Continual Learner,"Saleh Momeni, Sahisnu Mazumder, Zixuan Ke, Bing Liu","Existing continual learning (CL) methods mainly rely on fine-tuning or adapting large language models (LLMs). They still suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF). Little work has been done to exploit in-context learning (ICL) to leverage the extensive knowledge within LLMs for CL without updating any parameters. However, incrementally learning each new task in ICL necessitates adding training examples from each class of the task to the prompt, which hampers scalability as the prompt length increases. This issue not only leads to excessively long prompts that exceed the input token limit of the underlying LLM but also degrades the model's performance due to the overextended context. To address this, we introduce InCA, a novel approach that integrates an external continual learner (ECL) with ICL to enable scalable CL without CF. The ECL is built incrementally to pre-select a small subset of likely classes for each test instance. By restricting the ICL prompt to only these selected classes, InCA prevents prompt lengths from becoming excessively long, while maintaining high performance. Experimental results demonstrate that InCA significantly outperforms existing CL baselines, achieving substantial performance gains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15563v1,2024-12
MORTAR: Metamorphic Multi-turn Testing for LLM-based Dialogue Systems,"Guoxiang Guo, Aldeida Aleti, Neelofar Neelofar, Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn","With the widespread application of LLM-based dialogue systems in daily life, quality assurance has become more important than ever. Recent research has successfully introduced methods to identify unexpected behaviour in single-turn scenarios. However, multi-turn dialogue testing remains underexplored, with the Oracle problem in multi-turn testing posing a persistent challenge for dialogue system developers and researchers. In this paper, we propose MORTAR, a MetamORphic multi-TuRn diAlogue testing appRoach, which mitigates the test oracle problem in the assessment of LLM-based dialogue systems. MORTAR automates the generation of follow-up question-answer (QA) dialogue test cases with multiple dialogue-level perturbations and metamorphic relations. MORTAR employs a novel knowledge graph-based dialogue information model which effectively generates perturbed dialogue test datasets and detects bugs of multi-turn dialogue systems in a low-cost manner. The proposed approach does not require an LLM as a judge, eliminating potential of any biases in the evaluation step. According to the experiment results on multiple LLM-based dialogue systems and comparisons with single-turn metamorphic testing approaches, MORTAR explores more unique bugs in LLM-based dialogue systems, especially for severe bugs that MORTAR detects up to four times more unique bugs than the most effective existing metamorphic testing approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15557v1,2024-12
NGQA: A Nutritional Graph Question Answering Benchmark for Personalized Health-aware Nutritional Reasoning,"Zheyuan Zhang, Yiyang Li, Nhi Ha Lan Le, Zehong Wang, Tianyi Ma, Vincent Galassi, Keerthiram Murugesan, Nuno Moniz, Werner Geyer, Nitesh V Chawla, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye","Diet plays a critical role in human health, yet tailoring dietary reasoning to individual health conditions remains a major challenge. Nutrition Question Answering (QA) has emerged as a popular method for addressing this problem. However, current research faces two critical limitations. On one hand, the absence of datasets involving user-specific medical information severely limits \textit{personalization}. This challenge is further compounded by the wide variability in individual health needs. On the other hand, while large language models (LLMs), a popular solution for this task, demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they struggle with the domain-specific complexities of personalized healthy dietary reasoning, and existing benchmarks fail to capture these challenges. To address these gaps, we introduce the Nutritional Graph Question Answering (NGQA) benchmark, the first graph question answering dataset designed for personalized nutritional health reasoning. NGQA leverages data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to evaluate whether a food is healthy for a specific user, supported by explanations of the key contributing nutrients. The benchmark incorporates three question complexity settings and evaluates reasoning across three downstream tasks. Extensive experiments with LLM backbones and baseline models demonstrate that the NGQA benchmark effectively challenges existing models. In sum, NGQA addresses a critical real-world problem while advancing GraphQA research with a novel domain-specific benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15547v1,2024-12
MRAG: A Modular Retrieval Framework for Time-Sensitive Question Answering,"Zhang Siyue, Xue Yuxiang, Zhang Yiming, Wu Xiaobao, Luu Anh Tuan, Zhao Chen","Understanding temporal relations and answering time-sensitive questions is crucial yet a challenging task for question-answering systems powered by large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches either update the parametric knowledge of LLMs with new facts, which is resource-intensive and often impractical, or integrate LLMs with external knowledge retrieval (i.e., retrieval-augmented generation). However, off-the-shelf retrievers often struggle to identify relevant documents that require intensive temporal reasoning. To systematically study time-sensitive question answering, we introduce the TempRAGEval benchmark, which repurposes existing datasets by incorporating temporal perturbations and gold evidence labels. As anticipated, all existing retrieval methods struggle with these temporal reasoning-intensive questions. We further propose Modular Retrieval (MRAG), a trainless framework that includes three modules: (1) Question Processing that decomposes question into a main content and a temporal constraint; (2) Retrieval and Summarization that retrieves evidence and uses LLMs to summarize according to the main content; (3) Semantic-Temporal Hybrid Ranking that scores each evidence summarization based on both semantic and temporal relevance. On TempRAGEval, MRAG significantly outperforms baseline retrievers in retrieval performance, leading to further improvements in final answer accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15540v1,2024-12

We introduce XRAG, an open-source, modular codebase that facilitates exhaustive evaluation of the performance of foundational components of advanced RAG modules. These components are systematically categorized into four core phases: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation. We systematically analyse them across reconfigured datasets, providing a comprehensive benchmark for their effectiveness. As the complexity of RAG systems continues to escalate, we underscore the critical need to identify potential failure points in RAG systems. We formulate a suite of experimental methodologies and diagnostic testing protocols to dissect the failure points inherent in RAG engineering. Subsequently, we proffer bespoke solutions aimed at bolstering the overall performance of these modules.

HREF: Human Response-Guided Evaluation of Instruction Following in Language Models,"Xinxi Lyu, Yizhong Wang, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Pradeep Dasigi","Evaluating the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in following instructions has heavily relied on a powerful LLM as the judge, introducing unresolved biases that deviate the judgments from human judges. In this work, we reevaluate various choices for automatic evaluation on a wide range of instruction-following tasks. We experiment with methods that leverage human-written responses and observe that they enhance the reliability of automatic evaluations across a wide range of tasks, resulting in up to a 3.2% improvement in agreement with human judges. We also discovered that human-written responses offer an orthogonal perspective to model-generated responses in following instructions and should be used as an additional context when comparing model responses. Based on these observations, we develop a new evaluation benchmark, Human Response-Guided Evaluation of Instruction Following (HREF), comprising 4,258 samples across 11 task categories with a composite evaluation setup, employing a composite evaluation setup that selects the most reliable method for each category. In addition to providing reliable evaluation, HREF emphasizes individual task performance and is free from contamination. Finally, we study the impact of key design choices in HREF, including the size of the evaluation set, the judge model, the baseline model, and the prompt template. We host a live leaderboard that evaluates LLMs on the private evaluation set of HREF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15524v1,2024-12
ADEQA: A Question Answer based approach for joint ADE-Suspect Extraction using Sequence-To-Sequence Transformers,"Vinayak Arannil, Tomal Deb, Atanu Roy","Early identification of Adverse Drug Events (ADE) is critical for taking prompt actions while introducing new drugs into the market. These ADEs information are available through various unstructured data sources like clinical study reports, patient health records, social media posts, etc. Extracting ADEs and the related suspect drugs using machine learning is a challenging task due to the complex linguistic relations between drug ADE pairs in textual data and unavailability of large corpus of labelled datasets. This paper introduces ADEQA, a question-answer(QA) based approach using quasi supervised labelled data and sequence-to-sequence transformers to extract ADEs, drug suspects and the relationships between them. Unlike traditional QA models, natural language generation (NLG) based models don't require extensive token level labelling and thereby reduces the adoption barrier significantly. On a public ADE corpus, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art results with an F1 score of 94% on establishing the relationships between ADEs and the respective suspects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15510v1,2024-12
Mitigating Social Bias in Large Language Models: A Multi-Objective Approach within a Multi-Agent Framework,"Zhenjie Xu, Wenqing Chen, Yi Tang, Xuanying Li, Cheng Hu, Zhixuan Chu, Kui Ren, Zibin Zheng, Zhichao Lu","Natural language processing (NLP) has seen remarkable advancements with the development of large language models (LLMs). Despite these advancements, LLMs often produce socially biased outputs. Recent studies have mainly addressed this problem by prompting LLMs to behave ethically, but this approach results in unacceptable performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective approach within a multi-agent framework (MOMA) to mitigate social bias in LLMs without significantly compromising their performance. The key idea of MOMA involves deploying multiple agents to perform causal interventions on bias-related contents of the input questions, breaking the shortcut connection between these contents and the corresponding answers. Unlike traditional debiasing techniques leading to performance degradation, MOMA substantially reduces bias while maintaining accuracy in downstream tasks. Our experiments conducted on two datasets and two models demonstrate that MOMA reduces bias scores by up to 87.7%, with only a marginal performance degradation of up to 6.8% in the BBQ dataset. Additionally, it significantly enhances the multi-objective metric icat in the StereoSet dataset by up to 58.1%.

Humanlike Cognitive Patterns as Emergent Phenomena in Large Language Models,"Zhisheng Tang, Mayank Kejriwal","Research on emergent patterns in Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained significant traction in both psychology and artificial intelligence, motivating the need for a comprehensive review that offers a synthesis of this complex landscape. In this article, we systematically review LLMs' capabilities across three important cognitive domains: decision-making biases, reasoning, and creativity. We use empirical studies drawing on established psychological tests and compare LLMs' performance to human benchmarks. On decision-making, our synthesis reveals that while LLMs demonstrate several human-like biases, some biases observed in humans are absent, indicating cognitive patterns that only partially align with human decision-making. On reasoning, advanced LLMs like GPT-4 exhibit deliberative reasoning akin to human System-2 thinking, while smaller models fall short of human-level performance. A distinct dichotomy emerges in creativity: while LLMs excel in language-based creative tasks, such as storytelling, they struggle with divergent thinking tasks that require real-world context. Nonetheless, studies suggest that LLMs hold considerable potential as collaborators, augmenting creativity in human-machine problem-solving settings. Discussing key limitations, we also offer guidance for future research in areas such as memory, attention, and open-source model development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15501v1,2024-12
The First Multilingual Model For The Detection of Suicide Texts,"Rodolfo Zevallos, Annika Schoene, John E. Ortega","Suicidal ideation is a serious health problem affecting millions of people worldwide. Social networks provide information about these mental health problems through users' emotional expressions. We propose a multilingual model leveraging transformer architectures like mBERT, XML-R, and mT5 to detect suicidal text across posts in six languages - Spanish, English, German, Catalan, Portuguese and Italian. A Spanish suicide ideation tweet dataset was translated into five other languages using SeamlessM4T. Each model was fine-tuned on this multilingual data and evaluated across classification metrics. Results showed mT5 achieving the best performance overall with F1 scores above 85%, highlighting capabilities for cross-lingual transfer learning. The English and Spanish translations also displayed high quality based on perplexity. Our exploration underscores the importance of considering linguistic diversity in developing automated multilingual tools to identify suicidal risk. Limitations exist around semantic fidelity in translations and ethical implications which provide guidance for future human-in-the-loop evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15498v1,2024-12
Lexicography Saves Lives (LSL): Automatically Translating Suicide-Related Language,"Annika Marie Schoene, John E. Ortega, Rodolfo Joel Zevallos, Laura Haaber Ihle","Recent years have seen a marked increase in research that aims to identify or predict risk, intention or ideation of suicide. The majority of new tasks, datasets, language models and other resources focus on English and on suicide in the context of Western culture. However, suicide is global issue and reducing suicide rate by 2030 is one of the key goals of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Previous work has used English dictionaries related to suicide to translate into different target languages due to lack of other available resources. Naturally, this leads to a variety of ethical tensions (e.g.: linguistic misrepresentation), where discourse around suicide is not present in a particular culture or country. In this work, we introduce the 'Lexicography Saves Lives Project' to address this issue and make three distinct contributions. First, we outline ethical consideration and provide overview guidelines to mitigate harm in developing suicide-related resources. Next, we translate an existing dictionary related to suicidal ideation into 200 different languages and conduct human evaluations on a subset of translated dictionaries. Finally, we introduce a public website to make our resources available and enable community participation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15497v1,2024-12
TL-Training: A Task-Feature-Based Framework for Training Large Language Models in Tool Use,"Junjie Ye, Yilong Wu, Sixian Li, Yuming Yang, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang, Peng Wang, Zhongchao Shi, Jianping Fan, Zhengyin Du","Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable advancements by leveraging tools to interact with external environments, a critical step toward generalized AI. However, the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach, which relies on large-scale datasets, often overlooks task-specific characteristics in tool use, leading to performance bottlenecks. To address this issue, we analyze three existing LLMs and uncover key insights: training data can inadvertently impede tool-use behavior, token importance is distributed unevenly, and errors in tool calls fall into a small set of distinct categories. Building on these findings, we propose TL-Training, a task-feature-based framework that mitigates the effects of suboptimal training data, dynamically adjusts token weights to prioritize key tokens during SFT, and incorporates a robust reward mechanism tailored to error categories, optimized through proximal policy optimization. We validate TL-Training by training CodeLLaMA-2-7B and evaluating it on four diverse open-source test sets. Our results demonstrate that the LLM trained by our method matches or surpasses both open- and closed-source LLMs in tool-use performance using only 1,217 training data points. Additionally, our method enhances robustness in noisy environments and improves general task performance, offering a scalable and efficient paradigm for tool-use training in LLMs. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/TL-Training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15495v1,2024-12

Our multi-LLM summarization framework has two fundamentally important steps at each round of conversation: generation and evaluation. These steps are different depending on whether our multi-LLM decentralized summarization is used or centralized. In both our multi-LLM decentralized and centralized strategies, we have k different LLMs that generate diverse summaries of the text. However, during evaluation, our multi-LLM centralized summarization approach leverages a single LLM to evaluate the summaries and select the best one whereas k LLMs are used for decentralized multi-LLM summarization. Overall, we find that our multi-LLM summarization approaches significantly outperform the baselines that leverage only a single LLM by up to 3x.

A Review of the Marathi Natural Language Processing,"Asang Dani, Shailesh R Sathe","Marathi is one of the most widely used languages in the world. One might expect that the latest advances in NLP research in languages like English reach such a large community. However, NLP advancements in English didn't immediately reach Indian languages like Marathi. There were several reasons for this. They included diversity of scripts used, lack of (publicly available) resources like tokenization strategies, high quality datasets \& benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. In addition to this, the morphologically rich nature of Marathi, made NLP tasks challenging. Advances in Neural Network (NN) based models and tools since the early 2000s helped improve this situation and make NLP research more accessible. In the past 10 years, significant efforts were made to improve language resources for all 22 scheduled languages of India.

TalkWithMachines: Enhancing Human-Robot Interaction for Interpretable Industrial Robotics Through Large/Vision Language Models,"Ammar N. Abbas, Csaba Beleznai","TalkWithMachines aims to enhance human-robot interaction by contributing to interpretable industrial robotic systems, especially for safety-critical applications. The presented paper investigates recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs), in combination with robotic perception and control. This integration allows robots to understand and execute commands given in natural language and to perceive their environment through visual and/or descriptive inputs. Moreover, translating the LLM's internal states and reasoning into text that humans can easily understand ensures that operators gain a clearer insight into the robot's current state and intentions, which is essential for effective and safe operation. Our paper outlines four LLM-assisted simulated robotic control workflows, which explore (i) low-level control, (ii) the generation of language-based feedback that describes the robot's internal states, (iii) the use of visual information as additional input, and (iv) the use of robot structure information for generating task plans and feedback, taking the robot's physical capabilities and limitations into account.

However, existing methods often fail to generate high-quality, impactful, and scalable CS, particularly across diverse linguistic contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enhance CS generation by aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages DPO to align LLM outputs with human preferences, ensuring contextually appropriate and linguistically adaptable responses. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge grounding to enhance the factual accuracy and relevance of generated CS. Experimental results demonstrate that DPO-aligned models significantly outperform SFT baselines on CS benchmarks while scaling effectively to multiple languages. These findings highlight the potential of preference-based alignment techniques to advance CS generation across varied linguistic settings.

The paper discusses the performance of Fietje and many other models on an extensive evaluation suite of benchmarks on reasoning, sentiment analysis, world knowledge, linguistic acceptability and word sense disambiguation. Evaluation results illustrate the rapid progress in the field of LLMs, where recent small models outperform older, larger models that were fine-tuned for Dutch. This trend signals an exciting future for Dutch language processing, suggesting that even compact LLMs are becoming increasingly capable. Furthermore, ongoing and future efforts to adapt LLMs to Dutch are poised to enhance these models even further, broadening their applicability and accessibility.

Why Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Struggle to Count Letters?,"Tairan Fu, Raquel Ferrando, Javier Conde, Carlos Arriaga, Pedro Reviriego","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented performance on many complex tasks, being able, for example, to answer questions on almost any topic. However, they struggle with other simple tasks, such as counting the occurrences of letters in a word, as illustrated by the inability of many LLMs to count the number of ""r"" letters in ""strawberry"". Several works have studied this problem and linked it to the tokenization used by LLMs, to the intrinsic limitations of the attention mechanism, or to the lack of character-level training data. In this paper, we conduct an experimental study to evaluate the relations between the LLM errors when counting letters with 1) the frequency of the word and its components in the training dataset and 2) the complexity of the counting operation. We present a comprehensive analysis of the errors of LLMs when counting letter occurrences by evaluating a representative group of models over a large number of words. The results show a number of consistent trends in the models evaluated: 1) models are capable of recognizing the letters but not counting them; 2) the frequency of the word and tokens in the word does not have a significant impact on the LLM errors; 3) there is a positive correlation of letter frequency with errors, more frequent letters tend to have more counting errors, 4) the errors show a strong correlation with the number of letters or tokens in a word and 5) the strongest correlation occurs with the number of letters with counts larger than one, with most models being unable to correctly count words in which letters appear more than twice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18626v1,2024-12
Time Will Tell: Timing Side Channels via Output Token Count in Large Language Models,"Tianchen Zhang, Gururaj Saileshwar, David Lie","This paper demonstrates a new side-channel that enables an adversary to extract sensitive information about inference inputs in large language models (LLMs) based on the number of output tokens in the LLM response. We construct attacks using this side-channel in two common LLM tasks: recovering the target language in machine translation tasks and recovering the output class in classification tasks. In addition, due to the auto-regressive generation mechanism in LLMs, an adversary can recover the output token count reliably using a timing channel, even over the network against a popular closed-source commercial LLM. Our experiments show that an adversary can learn the output language in translation tasks with more than 75% precision across three different models (Tower, M2M100, MBart50). Using this side-channel, we also show the input class in text classification tasks can be leaked out with more than 70% precision from open-source LLMs like Llama-3.1, Llama-3.2, Gemma2, and production models like GPT-4o. Finally, we propose tokenizer-, system-, and prompt-based mitigations against the output token count side-channel.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15431v1,2024-12
"Transcribing and Translating, Fast and Slow: Joint Speech Translation and Recognition","Niko Moritz, Ruiming Xie, Yashesh Gaur, Ke Li, Simone Merello, Zeeshan Ahmed, Frank Seide, Christian Fuegen","We propose the joint speech translation and recognition (JSTAR) model that leverages the fast-slow cascaded encoder architecture for simultaneous end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST). The model is transducer-based and uses a multi-objective training strategy that optimizes both ASR and ST objectives simultaneously. This allows JSTAR to produce high-quality streaming ASR and ST results. We apply JSTAR in a bilingual conversational speech setting with smart-glasses, where the model is also trained to distinguish speech from different directions corresponding to the wearer and a conversational partner. Different model pre-training strategies are studied to further improve results, including training of a transducer-based streaming machine translation (MT) model for the first time and applying it for parameter initialization of JSTAR. We demonstrate superior performances of JSTAR compared to a strong cascaded ST model in both BLEU scores and latency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15415v1,2024-12
Learning Visual Composition through Improved Semantic Guidance,"Austin Stone, Hagen Soltau, Robert Geirhos, Xi Yi, Ye Xia, Bingyi Cao, Kaifeng Chen, Abhijit Ogale, Jonathon Shlens","Visual imagery does not consist of solitary objects, but instead reflects the composition of a multitude of fluid concepts. While there have been great advances in visual representation learning, such advances have focused on building better representations for a small number of discrete objects bereft of an understanding of how these objects are interacting. One can observe this limitation in representations learned through captions or contrastive learning -- where the learned model treats an image essentially as a bag of words. Several works have attempted to address this limitation through the development of bespoke learned architectures to directly address the shortcomings in compositional learning. In this work, we focus on simple, and scalable approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that by substantially improving weakly labeled data, i.e. captions, we can vastly improve the performance of standard contrastive learning approaches. Previous CLIP models achieved near chance rate on challenging tasks probing compositional learning. However, our simple approach boosts performance of CLIP substantially and surpasses all bespoke architectures. Furthermore, we showcase our results on a relatively new captioning benchmark derived from DOCCI. We demonstrate through a series of ablations that a standard CLIP model trained with enhanced data may demonstrate impressive performance on image retrieval tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15396v1,2024-12
Systematic Evaluation of Long-Context LLMs on Financial Concepts,"Lavanya Gupta, Saket Sharma, Yiyun Zhao","Long-context large language models (LC LLMs) promise to increase reliability of LLMs in real-world tasks requiring processing and understanding of long input documents. However, this ability of LC LLMs to reliably utilize their growing context windows remains under investigation. In this work, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art GPT-4 suite of LC LLMs in solving a series of progressively challenging tasks, as a function of factors such as context length, task difficulty, and position of key information by creating a real world financial news dataset. Our findings indicate that LC LLMs exhibit brittleness at longer context lengths even for simple tasks, with performance deteriorating sharply as task complexity increases. At longer context lengths, these state-of-the-art models experience catastrophic failures in instruction following resulting in degenerate outputs. Our prompt ablations also reveal unfortunate continued sensitivity to both the placement of the task instruction in the context window as well as minor markdown formatting. Finally, we advocate for more rigorous evaluation of LC LLMs by employing holistic metrics such as F1 (rather than recall) and reporting confidence intervals, thereby ensuring robust and conclusive findings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15386v1,2024-12
"Automatic Extraction of Metaphoric Analogies from Literary Texts: Task Formulation, Dataset Construction, and Evaluation","Joanne Boisson, Zara Siddique, Hsuvas Borkakoty, Dimosthenis Antypas, Luis Espinosa Anke, Jose Camacho-Collados","Extracting metaphors and analogies from free text requires high-level reasoning abilities such as abstraction and language understanding. Our study focuses on the extraction of the concepts that form metaphoric analogies in literary texts. To this end, we construct a novel dataset in this domain with the help of domain experts. We compare the out-of-the-box ability of recent large language models (LLMs) to structure metaphoric mappings from fragments of texts containing proportional analogies. The models are further evaluated on the generation of implicit elements of the analogy, which are indirectly suggested in the texts and inferred by human readers. The competitive results obtained by LLMs in our experiments are encouraging and open up new avenues such as automatically extracting analogies and metaphors from text instead of investing resources in domain experts to manually label data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15375v1,2024-12
Decade of Natural Language Processing in Chronic Pain: A Systematic Review,Swati Rajwal,"In recent years, the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and public health has opened innovative pathways for investigating various domains, including chronic pain in textual datasets. Despite the promise of NLP in chronic pain, the literature is dispersed across various disciplines, and there is a need to consolidate existing knowledge, identify knowledge gaps in the literature, and inform future research directions in this emerging field. This review aims to investigate the state of the research on NLP-based interventions designed for chronic pain research. A search strategy was formulated and executed across PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and ACL Anthology to find studies published in English between 2014 and 2024. After screening 132 papers, 26 studies were included in the final review. Key findings from this review underscore the significant potential of NLP techniques to address pressing challenges in chronic pain research. The past 10 years in this field have showcased the utilization of advanced methods (transformers like RoBERTa and BERT) achieving high-performance metrics (e.g., F1>0.8) in classification tasks, while unsupervised approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and k-means clustering have proven effective for exploratory analyses. Results also reveal persistent challenges such as limited dataset diversity, inadequate sample sizes, and insufficient representation of underrepresented populations. Future research studies should explore multimodal data validation systems, context-aware mechanistic modeling, and the development of standardized evaluation metrics to enhance reproducibility and equity in chronic pain research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15360v1,2024-12

LongBench v2: Towards Deeper Understanding and Reasoning on Realistic Long-context Multitasks,"Yushi Bai, Shangqing Tu, Jiajie Zhang, Hao Peng, Xiaozhi Wang, Xin Lv, Shulin Cao, Jiazheng Xu, Lei Hou, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Juanzi Li","This paper introduces LongBench v2, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of LLMs to handle long-context problems requiring deep understanding and reasoning across real-world multitasks. LongBench v2 consists of 503 challenging multiple-choice questions, with contexts ranging from 8k to 2M words, across six major task categories: single-document QA, multi-document QA, long in-context learning, long-dialogue history understanding, code repository understanding, and long structured data understanding. To ensure the breadth and the practicality, we collect data from nearly 100 highly educated individuals with diverse professional backgrounds. We employ both automated and manual review processes to maintain high quality and difficulty, resulting in human experts achieving only 53.7% accuracy under a 15-minute time constraint. Our evaluation reveals that the best-performing model, when directly answers the questions, achieves only 50.1% accuracy. In contrast, the o1-preview model, which includes longer reasoning, achieves 57.7%, surpassing the human baseline by 4%. These results highlight the importance of enhanced reasoning ability and scaling inference-time compute to tackle the long-context challenges in LongBench v2.

MMLU-CF: A Contamination-free Multi-task Language Understanding Benchmark,"Qihao Zhao, Yangyu Huang, Tengchao Lv, Lei Cui, Qinzheng Sun, Shaoguang Mao, Xin Zhang, Ying Xin, Qiufeng Yin, Scarlett Li, Furu Wei","Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense, understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage, we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/microsoft/MMLU-CF and the dataset refers to https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/MMLU-CF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15194v1,2024-12
Face the Facts! Evaluating RAG-based Fact-checking Pipelines in Realistic Settings,"Daniel Russo, Stefano Menini, Jacopo Staiano, Marco Guerini","Natural Language Processing and Generation systems have recently shown the potential to complement and streamline the costly and time-consuming job of professional fact-checkers. In this work, we lift several constraints of current state-of-the-art pipelines for automated fact-checking based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm. Our goal is to benchmark, under more realistic scenarios, RAG-based methods for the generation of verdicts - i.e., short texts discussing the veracity of a claim - evaluating them on stylistically complex claims and heterogeneous, yet reliable, knowledge bases. Our findings show a complex landscape, where, for example, LLM-based retrievers outperform other retrieval techniques, though they still struggle with heterogeneous knowledge bases; larger models excel in verdict faithfulness, while smaller models provide better context adherence, with human evaluations favouring zero-shot and one-shot approaches for informativeness, and fine-tuned models for emotional alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15189v1,2024-12
LMFusion: Adapting Pretrained Language Models for Multimodal Generation,"Weijia Shi, Xiaochuang Han, Chunting Zhou, Weixin Liang, Xi Victoria Lin, Luke Zettlemoyer, Lili Yu","We present LMFusion, a framework for empowering pretrained text-only large language models (LLMs) with multimodal generative capabilities, enabling them to understand and generate both text and images in arbitrary sequences. LMFusion leverages existing Llama-3's weights for processing texts autoregressively while introducing additional and parallel transformer modules for processing images with diffusion. During training, the data from each modality is routed to its dedicated modules: modality-specific feedforward layers, query-key-value projections, and normalization layers process each modality independently, while the shared self-attention layers allow interactions across text and image features. By freezing the text-specific modules and only training the image-specific modules, LMFusion preserves the language capabilities of text-only LLMs while developing strong visual understanding and generation abilities. Compared to methods that pretrain multimodal generative models from scratch, our experiments demonstrate that, LMFusion improves image understanding by 20% and image generation by 3.6% using only 50% of the FLOPs while maintaining Llama-3's language capabilities. We also demonstrate that this framework can adapt existing vision-language models with multimodal generation ability. Overall, this framework not only leverages existing computational investments in text-only LLMs but also enables the parallel development of language and vision capabilities, presenting a promising direction for efficient multimodal model development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15188v2,2024-12
Critical-Questions-of-Thought: Steering LLM reasoning with Argumentative Querying,"Federico Castagna, Isabel Sassoon, Simon Parsons","Studies have underscored how, regardless of the recent breakthrough and swift advances in AI research, even state-of-the-art Large Language models (LLMs) continue to struggle when performing logical and mathematical reasoning. The results seem to suggest that LLMs still work as (highly advanced) data pattern identifiers, scoring poorly when attempting to generalise and solve reasoning problems the models have never previously seen or that are not close to samples presented in their training data. To address this compelling concern, this paper makes use of the notion of critical questions from the literature on argumentation theory, focusing in particular on Toulmin's model of argumentation. We show that employing these critical questions can improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By probing the rationale behind the models' reasoning process, the LLM can assess whether some logical mistake is occurring and correct it before providing the final reply to the user prompt. The underlying idea is drawn from the gold standard of any valid argumentative procedure: the conclusion is valid if it is entailed by accepted premises. Or, to paraphrase such Aristotelian principle in a real-world approximation, characterised by incomplete information and presumptive logic, the conclusion is valid if not proved otherwise. This approach successfully steers the models' output through a reasoning pipeline, resulting in better performance against the baseline and its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementation. To this end, an extensive evaluation of the proposed approach on the MT-Bench Reasoning and Math tasks across a range of LLMs is provided.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15177v1,2024-12
Prompt-A-Video: Prompt Your Video Diffusion Model via Preference-Aligned LLM,"Yatai Ji, Jiacheng Zhang, Jie Wu, Shilong Zhang, Shoufa Chen, Chongjian GE, Peize Sun, Weifeng Chen, Wenqi Shao, Xuefeng Xiao, Weilin Huang, Ping Luo","Text-to-video models have made remarkable advancements through optimization on high-quality text-video pairs, where the textual prompts play a pivotal role in determining quality of output videos. However, achieving the desired output often entails multiple revisions and iterative inference to refine user-provided prompts. Current automatic methods for refining prompts encounter challenges such as Modality-Inconsistency, Cost-Discrepancy, and Model-Unaware when applied to text-to-video diffusion models. To address these problem, we introduce an LLM-based prompt adaptation framework, termed as Prompt-A-Video, which excels in crafting Video-Centric, Labor-Free and Preference-Aligned prompts tailored to specific video diffusion model. Our approach involves a meticulously crafted two-stage optimization and alignment system. Initially, we conduct a reward-guided prompt evolution pipeline to automatically create optimal prompts pool and leverage them for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of the LLM. Then multi-dimensional rewards are employed to generate pairwise data for the SFT model, followed by the direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm to further facilitate preference alignment. Through extensive experimentation and comparative analyses, we validate the effectiveness of Prompt-A-Video across diverse generation models, highlighting its potential to push the boundaries of video generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15156v1,2024-12
Language Models as Continuous Self-Evolving Data Engineers,"Peidong Wang, Ming Wang, Zhiming Ma, Xiaocui Yang, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on various tasks, while the further evolvement is limited to the lack of high-quality training data. In addition, traditional training approaches rely too much on expert-labeled data, setting an upper limit on the performance of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel paradigm that enables LLMs to train itself by autonomously generating, cleaning, reviewing, and annotating data with preference information, named LANCE. Our approach demonstrates that LLMs can serve as continuous self-evolving data engineers, significantly reducing the time and cost of the post-training data construction process. Through iterative fine-tuning on different variants of the Qwen2, we validate the effectiveness of LANCE across various tasks, showing that it can continuously improve model performance and maintain high-quality data generation. Across eight benchmark dimensions, LANCE resulted in an average score enhancement of 3.36 for Qwen2-7B and 2.70 for Qwen2-7B-Instruct. This training paradigm with autonomous data construction not only reduces the reliance on human experts or external models but also ensures that the data aligns with human values and preferences, paving the way for the development of future superintelligent systems that can exceed human capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15151v1,2024-12
Adaptive Pruning for Large Language Models with Structural Importance Awareness,"Haotian Zheng, Jinke Ren, Yushan Sun, Ruichen Zhang, Wenbo Zhang, Zhen Li, Dusit Niyato, Shuguang Cui, Yatong Han","The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved language understanding and generation capabilities. However, it is difficult to deploy LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high computational and storage resource demands. To address this issue, we propose a novel LLM model pruning method, namely structurally-aware adaptive pruning (SAAP), to significantly reduce the computational and memory costs while maintaining model performance. We first define an adaptive importance fusion metric to evaluate the importance of all coupled structures in LLMs by considering their homoscedastic uncertainty. Then, we rank the importance of all modules to determine the specific layers that should be pruned to meet particular performance requirements. Furthermore, we develop a new group fine-tuning strategy to improve the inference efficiency of LLMs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed SAAP method on multiple LLMs across two common tasks, i.e., zero-shot classification and text generation. Experimental results show that our SAAP method outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving 2.17%, 2.37%, and 2.39% accuracy gains on LLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-13B. Additionally, SAAP improves the token generation speed by 5%, showcasing its practical advantages in resource-constrained scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15127v1,2024-12
Outcome-Refining Process Supervision for Code Generation,"Zhuohao Yu, Weizheng Gu, Yidong Wang, Zhengran Zeng, Jindong Wang, Wei Ye, Shikun Zhang","Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, yet they often struggle with complex programming tasks that require deep algorithmic reasoning. While process supervision through learned reward models shows promise in guiding reasoning steps, it requires expensive training data and suffers from unreliable evaluation. We propose Outcome-Refining Process Supervision, a novel paradigm that treats outcome refinement itself as the process to be supervised. Our framework leverages concrete execution signals to ground the supervision of reasoning steps, while using tree-structured exploration to maintain multiple solution trajectories simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enables even smaller models to achieve high success accuracy and performance metrics on competitive programming tasks, creates more reliable verification than traditional reward models without requiring training PRMs. Our approach achieves significant improvements across 5 models and 3 datasets: an average of 26.9% increase in correctness and 42.2% in efficiency.

Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning. Post-training techniques enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich sizes. Open-weight offerings include base and instruction-tuned models, with quantized versions available. In addition, for hosted solutions, the proprietary models currently include two mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants: Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus, both available from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Qwen2.5 has demonstrated top-tier performance on a wide range of benchmarks evaluating language understanding, reasoning, mathematics, coding, human preference alignment, etc. Specifically, the open-weight flagship Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct outperforms a number of open and proprietary models and demonstrates competitive performance to the state-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5 times larger. Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus offer superior cost-effectiveness while performing competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively.

Associative memory inspires improvements for in-context learning using a novel attention residual stream architecture,"Thomas F Burns, Tomoki Fukai, Christopher J Earls","Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive ability to utilise information within the context of their input sequences to appropriately respond to data unseen by the LLM during its training procedure. This ability is known as in-context learning (ICL). Humans and non-human animals demonstrate similar abilities, however their neural architectures differ substantially from LLMs. Despite this, a critical component within LLMs, the attention mechanism, resembles modern associative memory models, widely used in and influenced by the computational neuroscience community to model biological memory systems. Using this connection, we introduce an associative memory model capable of performing ICL. We use this as inspiration for a novel residual stream architecture which allows information to directly flow between attention heads. We test this architecture during training within a two-layer Transformer and show its ICL abilities manifest more quickly than without this modification. We then apply our architecture in small language models with 8 million parameters, focusing on attention head values, with results also indicating improved ICL performance at this larger and more naturalistic scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15113v1,2024-12
Review-Then-Refine: A Dynamic Framework for Multi-Hop Question Answering with Temporal Adaptability,"Xiangsen Chen, Xuming Hu, Nan Tang","Retrieve-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks have emerged as a promising solution to multi-hop question answering(QA) tasks since it enables large language models (LLMs) to incorporate external knowledge and mitigate their inherent knowledge deficiencies. Despite this progress, existing RAG frameworks, which usually follows the retrieve-then-read paradigm, often struggle with multi-hop QA with temporal information since it has difficulty retrieving and synthesizing accurate time-related information. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework called review-then-refine, which aims to enhance LLM performance in multi-hop QA scenarios with temporal information. Our approach begins with a review phase, where decomposed sub-queries are dynamically rewritten with temporal information, allowing for subsequent adaptive retrieval and reasoning process. In addition, we implement adaptive retrieval mechanism to minimize unnecessary retrievals, thus reducing the potential for hallucinations. In the subsequent refine phase, the LLM synthesizes the retrieved information from each sub-query along with its internal knowledge to formulate a coherent answer. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, highlighting its potential to significantly improve multi-hop QA capabilities in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15101v1,2024-12
A Cross-Domain Study of the Use of Persuasion Techniques in Online Disinformation,"João A.

Qualitative and quantitative research on the weaponisation of persuasion techniques in disinformation has been mostly topic-specific (e.g., COVID-19) with limited cross-domain studies, resulting in a lack of comprehensive understanding of these strategies. This study employs a state-of-the-art persuasion technique classifier to conduct a large-scale, multi-domain analysis of the role of 16 persuasion techniques in disinformation narratives. It shows how different persuasion techniques are employed disproportionately in different disinformation domains.

To develop the instruction-tuned math models, we propose a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process that first achieves competitive performance across general domains, followed by targeted fine-tuning for the math domain using a carefully curated set of prompts and synthetically generated responses. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-Instruct greatly outperforms Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct, GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 Sonnet. To develop math-specialized reward model, we first construct AceMath-RewardBench, a comprehensive and robust benchmark for evaluating math reward models across diverse problems and difficulty levels. After that, we present a systematic approach to build our math reward models. The resulting model, AceMath-72B-RM, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reward models.

Eliciting Causal Abilities in Large Language Models for Reasoning Tasks,"Yajing Wang, Zongwei Luo, Jingzhe Wang, Zhanke Zhou, Yongqiang Chen, Bo Han","Prompt optimization automatically refines prompting expressions, unlocking the full potential of LLMs in downstream tasks. However, current prompt optimization methods are costly to train and lack sufficient interpretability. This paper proposes enhancing LLMs' reasoning performance by eliciting their causal inference ability from prompting instructions to correct answers. Specifically, we introduce the Self-Causal Instruction Enhancement (SCIE) method, which enables LLMs to generate high-quality, low-quantity observational data, then estimates the causal effect based on these data, and ultimately generates instructions with the optimized causal effect. In SCIE, the instructions are treated as the treatment, and textual features are used to process natural language, establishing causal relationships through treatments between instructions and downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose applying Object-Relational (OR) principles, where the uncovered causal relationships are treated as the inheritable class across task objects, ensuring low-cost reusability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively generates instructions that enhance reasoning performance with reduced training cost of prompts, leveraging interpretable textual features to provide actionable insights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15314v1,2024-12
LLMs Lost in Translation: M-ALERT uncovers Cross-Linguistic Safety Gaps,"Felix Friedrich, Simone Tedeschi, Patrick Schramowski, Manuel Brack, Roberto Navigli, Huu Nguyen, Bo Li, Kristian Kersting","Building safe Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages is essential in ensuring both safe access and linguistic diversity. To this end, we introduce M-ALERT, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates the safety of LLMs in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. M-ALERT includes 15k high-quality prompts per language, totaling 75k, following the detailed ALERT taxonomy. Our extensive experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs highlight the importance of language-specific safety analysis, revealing that models often exhibit significant inconsistencies in safety across languages and categories. For instance, Llama3.2 shows high unsafety in the category crime_tax for Italian but remains safe in other languages. Similar differences can be observed across all models. In contrast, certain categories, such as substance_cannabis and crime_propaganda, consistently trigger unsafe responses across models and languages. These findings underscore the need for robust multilingual safety practices in LLMs to ensure safe and responsible usage across diverse user communities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15035v1,2024-12
Large Language Models and Code Security: A Systematic Literature Review,"Enna Basic, Alberto Giaretta","Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating various programming tasks, including security-related ones, such as detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15004v1,2024-12
Chain-of-MetaWriting: Linguistic and Textual Analysis of How Small Language Models Write Young Students Texts,"Ioana Buhnila, Georgeta Cislaru, Amalia Todirascu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to generate texts in response to different writing tasks: reports, essays, story telling. However, language models do not have a meta-representation of the text writing process, nor inherent communication learning needs, comparable to those of young human students. This paper introduces a fine-grained linguistic and textual analysis of multilingual Small Language Models' (SLMs) writing. With our method, Chain-of-MetaWriting, SLMs can imitate some steps of the human writing process, such as planning and evaluation. We mainly focused on short story and essay writing tasks in French for schoolchildren and undergraduate students respectively. Our results show that SLMs encounter difficulties in assisting young students on sensitive topics such as violence in the schoolyard, and they sometimes use words too complex for the target audience. In particular, the output is quite different from the human produced texts in term of text cohesion and coherence regarding temporal connectors, topic progression, reference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14986v1,2024-12
Movie2Story: A framework for understanding videos and telling stories in the form of novel text,"Kangning Li, Zheyang Jia, Anyu Ying","Multimodal video-to-text models have made considerable progress, primarily in generating brief descriptions of video content.

M2S includes modules for video long-form text description and comprehension, audio-based analysis of emotion, speech rate, and character alignment, and visual-based character recognition alignment. By integrating multimodal information using the large language model GPT4o, M2S stands out in the field of multimodal text generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of M2S through comparative experiments and human evaluation.

Knowledge Injection via Prompt Distillation,"Kalle Kujanpää, Harri Valpola, Alexander Ilin","In many practical applications, large language models (LLMs) need to incorporate new knowledge not present in their pre-training data. The primary methods for this are fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Although RAG has emerged as the industry standard for knowledge injection, fine-tuning has not yet achieved comparable success. In this paper, we propose a new fine-tuning technique for learning new knowledge and show that it can reach the performance of RAG. The proposed method is based on the self-distillation approach, which we call prompt distillation. First, we generate question-answer pairs about the new knowledge. Then, we fine-tune a student model on the question-answer pairs to imitate the output distributions of a teacher model, which additionally receives the new knowledge in its prompt. The student model is identical to the teacher, except it is equipped with a LoRA adapter. This training procedure facilitates distilling the new knowledge from the teacher's prompt into the student's weights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14964v1,2024-12
Understanding the Dark Side of LLMs' Intrinsic Self-Correction,"Qingjie Zhang, Han Qiu, Di Wang, Haoting Qian, Yiming Li, Tianwei Zhang, Minlie Huang","Intrinsic self-correction was proposed to improve LLMs' responses via feedback prompts solely based on their inherent capability. However, recent works show that LLMs' intrinsic self-correction fails without oracle labels as feedback prompts. In this paper, we aim to interpret LLMs' intrinsic self-correction for different tasks, especially for those failure cases. By including one simple task and three complex tasks with state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs like ChatGPT families (o1, 4o, 3.5-turbo) and Llama families (2-7B, 3-8B, and 3.1-8B), we design three interpretation methods to reveal the dark side of LLMs' intrinsic self-correction. We identify intrinsic self-correction can (1) cause LLMs to waver both intermedia and final answers and lead to prompt bias on simple factual questions; (2) introduce human-like cognitive bias on complex tasks. In light of our findings, we also provide two simple yet effective strategies for alleviation: question repeating and supervised fine-tuning with a few samples.

RobustFT: Robust Supervised Fine-tuning for Large Language Models under Noisy Response,"Junyu Luo, Xiao Luo, Kaize Ding, Jingyang Yuan, Zhiping Xiao, Ming Zhang","Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a crucial role in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains or tasks. However, as demonstrated by empirical experiments, the collected data inevitably contains noise in practical applications, which poses significant challenges to model performance on downstream tasks. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a noise-robust SFT framework to enhance model capabilities in downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust SFT framework (RobustFT) that performs noise detection and relabeling on downstream task data. For noise identification, our approach employs a multi-expert collaborative system with inference-enhanced models to achieve superior noise detection. In the denoising phase, we utilize a context-enhanced strategy, which incorporates the most relevant and confident knowledge followed by careful assessment to generate reliable annotations. Additionally, we introduce an effective data selection mechanism based on response entropy, ensuring only high-quality samples are retained for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple LLMs across five datasets demonstrate RobustFT's exceptional performance in noisy scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14922v1,2024-12
Dehallucinating Parallel Context Extension for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Zexiong Ma, Shengnan An, Zeqi Lin, Yanzhen Zou, Jian-Guang Lou, Bing Xie","Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to generating hallucinated information, despite the integration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Parallel context extension (PCE) is a line of research attempting to effectively integrating parallel (unordered) contexts, while it still suffers from hallucinations when adapted to RAG scenarios. In this paper, we propose DePaC (Dehallucinating Parallel Context Extension), which alleviates the hallucination problem with context-aware negative training and information-calibrated aggregation. DePaC is designed to alleviate two types of in-context hallucination: fact fabrication (i.e., LLMs present claims that are not supported by the contexts) and fact omission (i.e., LLMs fail to present claims that can be supported by the contexts). Specifically, (1) for fact fabrication, we apply the context-aware negative training that fine-tunes the LLMs with negative supervisions, thus explicitly guiding the LLMs to refuse to answer when contexts are not related to questions; (2) for fact omission, we propose the information-calibrated aggregation which prioritizes context windows with higher information increment from their contexts. The experimental results on nine RAG tasks demonstrate that DePaC significantly alleviates the two types of hallucination and consistently achieves better performances on these tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14905v1,2024-12
Why language models collapse when trained on recursively generated text,"Lecheng Wang, Xianjie Shi, Ge Li, Jia Li, Yihong Dong, Xuanming Zhang, Wenpin Jiao, Hong Mei",Language models (LMs) have been widely used to generate text on the Internet. The generated text is often collected into the training corpus of the next generations of LMs. Previous work has experimentally found that LMs collapse when trained on recursively generated text. This paper contributes to existing knowledge from two aspects. We present a theoretical proof of LM collapse. Our proof reveals the cause of LM collapse and proves that all auto-regressive LMs will definitely collapse. We present a new finding: the performance of LMs gradually declines when trained on recursively generated text until they perform no better than a randomly initialized LM. The trained LMs produce large amounts of repetitive text and perform poorly across a wide range of natural language tasks. The above proof and new findings deepen our understanding of LM collapse and offer valuable insights that may inspire new training techniques to mitigate this threat.,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14872v1,2024-12
Graph-Convolutional Networks: Named Entity Recognition and Large Language Model Embedding in Document Clustering,"Imed Keraghel, Mohamed Nadif","Recent advances in machine learning, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT and GPT, provide rich contextual embeddings that improve text representation. However, current document clustering approaches often ignore the deeper relationships between named entities (NEs) and the potential of LLM embeddings. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) and LLM embeddings within a graph-based framework for document clustering. The method builds a graph with nodes representing documents and edges weighted by named entity similarity, optimized using a graph-convolutional network (GCN). This ensures a more effective grouping of semantically related documents. Experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms conventional co-occurrence-based methods in clustering, notably for documents rich in named entities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14867v1,2024-12
Think&Cite: Improving Attributed Text Generation with Self-Guided Tree Search and Progress Reward Modeling,"Junyi Li, Hwee Tou Ng","Despite their outstanding capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination and producing factually incorrect information. This challenge has spurred efforts in attributed text generation, which prompts LLMs to generate content with supporting evidence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called Think&Cite, and formulate attributed text generation as a multi-step reasoning problem integrated with search. Specifically, we propose Self-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (SG-MCTS), which capitalizes on the self-reflection capability of LLMs to reflect on the intermediate states of MCTS for guiding the tree expansion process. To provide reliable and comprehensive feedback, we introduce Progress Reward Models to measure the progress of tree search from the root to the current state from two aspects, i.e., generation and attribution progress. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14860v1,2024-12
Conceptual In-Context Learning and Chain of Concepts: Solving Complex Conceptual Problems Using Large Language Models,"Nishtha N. Vaidya, Thomas Runkler, Thomas Hubauer, Veronika Haderlein-Hoegberg, Maja Mlicic Brandt","Science and engineering problems fall in the category of complex conceptual problems that require specific conceptual information (CI) like math/logic -related know-how, process information, or engineering guidelines to solve them. Large Language Models (LLMs) are promising agents to solve such complex conceptual problems due to their implications in advancing engineering and science tasks like assisted problem-solving. But vanilla LLMs, trained on open-world data, lack the necessary CI. In this work, we specifically explore shallow customization methods (SCMs) of LLMs for solving complex conceptual problems. We propose two novel SCM algorithms for LLM, to augment LLMs with CI and enable LLMs to solve complex conceptual problems: Conceptual In-Context Learning (C-ICL) and Chain of Concepts (CoC). The problem tackled in this paper is generation of proprietary data models in the engineering/industry domain based on conceptual information in data modelling guidelines. We evaluate our algorithms on varied sizes of the OpenAI LLMs against four evaluation metrics related to syntactic and semantic correctness, time and cost incurred. The proposed algorithms perform better than currently popular LLM SCMs like In-context Learning (ICL) and Chain of Thoughts (CoT). It was observed that as compared to CoT, response correctness increased by 30.6% and 29.88% for the new SCMs C-ICL and CoC respectively. Qualitative analysis suggests that the proposed new SCMs activate emergent capabilities in LLMs, previously unobserved in the existing SCMs. They make problem-solving processes more transparent and reduce hallucinations and the tendency of model responses to copy examples from prompts (parroting).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15309v1,2024-12
ViFactCheck: A New Benchmark Dataset and Methods for Multi-domain News Fact-Checking in Vietnamese,"Tran Thai Hoa, Tran Quang Duy, Khanh Quoc Tran, Kiet Van Nguyen","The rapid spread of information in the digital age highlights the critical need for effective fact-checking tools, particularly for languages with limited resources, such as Vietnamese. In response to this challenge, we introduce ViFactCheck, the first publicly available benchmark dataset designed specifically for Vietnamese fact-checking across multiple online news domains. This dataset contains 7,232 human-annotated pairs of claim-evidence combinations sourced from reputable Vietnamese online news, covering 12 diverse topics. It has been subjected to a meticulous annotation process to ensure high quality and reliability, achieving a Fleiss Kappa inter-annotator agreement score of 0.83. Our evaluation leverages state-of-the-art pre-trained and large language models, employing fine-tuning and prompting techniques to assess performance. Notably, the Gemma model demonstrated superior effectiveness, with an impressive macro F1 score of 89.90%, thereby establishing a new standard for fact-checking benchmarks. This result highlights the robust capabilities of Gemma in accurately identifying and verifying facts in Vietnamese. To further promote advances in fact-checking technology and improve the reliability of digital media, we have made the ViFactCheck dataset, model checkpoints, fact-checking pipelines, and source code freely available on GitHub. This initiative aims to inspire further research and enhance the accuracy of information in low-resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15308v1,2024-12
DS$^2$-ABSA: Dual-Stream Data Synthesis with Label Refinement for Few-Shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Hongling Xu, Yice Zhang, Qianlong Wang, Ruifeng Xu","Recently developed large language models (LLMs) have presented promising new avenues to address data scarcity in low-resource scenarios. In few-shot aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), previous efforts have explored data augmentation techniques, which prompt LLMs to generate new samples by modifying existing ones. However, these methods fail to produce adequately diverse data, impairing their effectiveness. Besides, some studies apply in-context learning for ABSA by using specific instructions and a few selected examples as prompts. Though promising, LLMs often yield labels that deviate from task requirements. To overcome these limitations, we propose DS$^2$-ABSA, a dual-stream data synthesis framework targeted for few-shot ABSA. It leverages LLMs to synthesize data from two complementary perspectives: \textit{key-point-driven} and \textit{instance-driven}, which effectively generate diverse and high-quality ABSA samples in low-resource settings. Furthermore, a \textit{label refinement} module is integrated to improve the synthetic labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DS$^2$-ABSA significantly outperforms previous few-shot ABSA solutions and other LLM-oriented data generation methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14849v1,2024-12
A Survey of RWKV,"Zhiyuan Li, Tingyu Xia, Yi Chang, Yuan Wu","The Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model offers a novel alternative to the Transformer architecture, merging the benefits of recurrent and attention-based systems. Unlike conventional Transformers, which depend heavily on self-attention, RWKV adeptly captures long-range dependencies with minimal computational demands. By utilizing a recurrent framework, RWKV addresses some computational inefficiencies found in Transformers, particularly in tasks with long sequences. RWKV has recently drawn considerable attention for its robust performance across multiple domains. Despite its growing popularity, no systematic review of the RWKV model exists. This paper seeks to fill this gap as the first comprehensive review of the RWKV architecture, its core principles, and its varied applications, such as natural language generation, natural language understanding, and computer vision. We assess how RWKV compares to traditional Transformer models, highlighting its capability to manage long sequences efficiently and lower computational costs. Furthermore, we explore the challenges RWKV encounters and propose potential directions for future research and advancement.

Mapping and Influencing the Political Ideology of Large Language Models using Synthetic Personas,"Pietro Bernardelle, Leon Fröhling, Stefano Civelli, Riccardo Lunardi, Kevin Roitero, Gianluca Demartini","The analysis of political biases in large language models (LLMs) has primarily examined these systems as single entities with fixed viewpoints. While various methods exist for measuring such biases, the impact of persona-based prompting on LLMs' political orientation remains unexplored. In this work we leverage PersonaHub, a collection of synthetic persona descriptions, to map the political distribution of persona-based prompted LLMs using the Political Compass Test (PCT). We then examine whether these initial compass distributions can be manipulated through explicit ideological prompting towards diametrically opposed political orientations: right-authoritarian and left-libertarian. Our experiments reveal that synthetic personas predominantly cluster in the left-libertarian quadrant, with models demonstrating varying degrees of responsiveness when prompted with explicit ideological descriptors. While all models demonstrate significant shifts towards right-authoritarian positions, they exhibit more limited shifts towards left-libertarian positions, suggesting an asymmetric response to ideological manipulation that may reflect inherent biases in model training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14843v2,2024-12
DynamicKV: Task-Aware Adaptive KV Cache Compression for Long Context LLMs,"Xiabin Zhou, Wenbin Wang, Minyan Zeng, Jiaxian Guo, Xuebo Liu, Li Shen, Min Zhang, Liang Ding","Efficient KV cache management in LLMs is crucial for long-context tasks like RAG and summarization. Existing KV cache compression methods enforce a fixed pattern, neglecting task-specific characteristics and reducing the retention of essential information. However, we observe distinct activation patterns across layers in various tasks, highlighting the need for adaptive strategies tailored to each task's unique demands. Based on this insight, we propose DynamicKV, a method that dynamically optimizes token retention by adjusting the number of tokens retained at each layer to adapt to the specific task. DynamicKV establishes global and per-layer maximum KV cache budgets, temporarily retaining the maximum budget for the current layer, and periodically updating the KV cache sizes of all preceding layers during inference. Our method retains only 1.7% of the KV cache size while achieving ~85% of the Full KV cache performance on LongBench. Notably, even under extreme compression (0.9%), DynamicKV surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 11% in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. The code will be released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14838v1,2024-12
Progressive Multimodal Reasoning via Active Retrieval,"Guanting Dong, Chenghao Zhang, Mengjie Deng, Yutao Zhu, Zhicheng Dou, Ji-Rong Wen","Multi-step multimodal reasoning tasks pose significant challenges for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and finding effective ways to enhance their performance in such scenarios remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we propose AR-MCTS, a universal framework designed to progressively improve the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs through Active Retrieval (AR) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Our approach begins with the development of a unified retrieval module that retrieves key supporting insights for solving complex reasoning problems from a hybrid-modal retrieval corpus. To bridge the gap in automated multimodal reasoning verification, we employ the MCTS algorithm combined with an active retrieval mechanism, which enables the automatic generation of step-wise annotations. This strategy dynamically retrieves key insights for each reasoning step, moving beyond traditional beam search sampling to improve the diversity and reliability of the reasoning space. Additionally, we introduce a process reward model that aligns progressively to support the automatic verification of multimodal reasoning tasks. Experimental results across three complex multimodal reasoning benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the AR-MCTS framework in enhancing the performance of various multimodal models. Further analysis demonstrates that AR-MCTS can optimize sampling diversity and accuracy, yielding reliable multimodal reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14835v1,2024-12
Mention Attention for Pronoun Translation,"Gongbo Tang, Christian Hardmeier","Most pronouns are referring expressions, computers need to resolve what do the pronouns refer to, and there are divergences on pronoun usage across languages. Thus, dealing with these divergences and translating pronouns is a challenge in machine translation. Mentions are referring candidates of pronouns and have closer relations with pronouns compared to general tokens. We assume that extracting additional mention features can help pronoun translation. Therefore, we introduce an additional mention attention module in the decoder to pay extra attention to source mentions but not non-mention tokens. Our mention attention module not only extracts features from source mentions, but also considers target-side context which benefits pronoun translation. In addition, we also introduce two mention classifiers to train models to recognize mentions, whose outputs guide the mention attention. We conduct experiments on the WMT17 English-German translation task, and evaluate our models on general translation and pronoun translation, using BLEU, APT, and contrastive evaluation metrics. Our proposed model outperforms the baseline Transformer model in terms of APT and BLEU scores, this confirms our hypothesis that we can improve pronoun translation by paying additional attention to source mentions, and shows that our introduced additional modules do not have negative effect on the general translation quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14829v1,2024-12
ResoFilter: Fine-grained Synthetic Data Filtering for Large Language Models through Data-Parameter Resonance Analysis,"Zeao Tu, Xiangdi Meng, Yu He, Zihan Yao, Tianyu Qi, Jun Liu, Ming Li","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable effectiveness across various domains, with data augmentation methods utilizing GPT for synthetic data generation becoming prevalent. However, the quality and utility of augmented data remain questionable, and current methods lack clear metrics for evaluating data characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose ResoFilter, a novel method that integrates models, data, and tasks to refine datasets. ResoFilter leverages the fine-tuning process to obtain Data-Parameter features for data selection, offering improved interpretability by representing data characteristics through model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that ResoFilter achieves comparable results to full-scale fine-tuning using only half the data in mathematical tasks and exhibits strong generalization across different models and domains. This method provides valuable insights for constructing synthetic datasets and evaluating high-quality data, offering a promising solution for enhancing data augmentation techniques and improving training dataset quality for LLMs. For reproducibility, we will release our code and data upon acceptance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14809v2,2024-12
Self-Evolution Knowledge Distillation for LLM-based Machine Translation,"Yuncheng Song, Liang Ding, Changtong Zan, Shujian Huang","Knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great promise in transferring knowledge from larger teacher models to smaller student models. However, existing KD strategies for large language models often minimize output distributions between student and teacher models indiscriminately for each token. This overlooks the imbalanced nature of tokens and their varying transfer difficulties. In response, we propose a distillation strategy called Self-Evolution KD. The core of this approach involves dynamically integrating teacher distribution and one-hot distribution of ground truth into the student distribution as prior knowledge, which promotes the distillation process. It adjusts the ratio of prior knowledge based on token learning difficulty, fully leveraging the teacher model's potential. Experimental results show our method brings an average improvement of approximately 1.4 SacreBLEU points across four translation directions in the WMT22 test sets. Further analysis indicates that the improvement comes from better knowledge transfer from teachers, confirming our hypothesis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15303v1,2024-12
Disentangling Reasoning Tokens and Boilerplate Tokens For Language Model Fine-tuning,"Ziang Ye, Zhenru Zhang, Yang Zhang, Jianxin Ma, Junyang Lin, Fuli Feng","When using agent-task datasets to enhance agent capabilities for Large Language Models (LLMs), current methodologies often treat all tokens within a sample equally. However, we argue that tokens serving different roles - specifically, reasoning tokens versus boilerplate tokens (e.g., those governing output format) - differ significantly in importance and learning complexity, necessitating their disentanglement and distinct treatment. To address this, we propose a novel Shuffle-Aware Discriminator (SHAD) for adaptive token discrimination. SHAD classifies tokens by exploiting predictability differences observed after shuffling input-output combinations across samples: boilerplate tokens, due to their repetitive nature among samples, maintain predictability, whereas reasoning tokens do not. Using SHAD, we propose the Reasoning-highlighted Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, which adaptively emphasizes reasoning tokens during fine-tuning, yielding notable performance gains over common Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14780v1,2024-12
ALKAFI-LLAMA3: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Precise Legal Understanding in Palestine,"Rabee Qasem, Mohannad Hendi, Banan Tantour","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in diverse domains, yet their application in the legal sector, particularly in low-resource contexts, remains limited. This study addresses the challenges of adapting LLMs to the Palestinian legal domain, where political instability, fragmented legal frameworks, and limited AI resources hinder effective machine-learning applications. We present a fine-tuned model based on a quantized version of Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, trained on a synthetic data set derived from Palestinian legal texts. Using smaller-scale models and strategically generated question-answer pairs, we achieve a cost-effective, locally sustainable solution that provides accurate and contextually relevant legal guidance. Our experiments demonstrate promising performance on various query types, ranging from yes/no questions and narrative explanations to complex legal differentiations, while highlighting areas for improvement, such as handling calculation-based inquiries and structured list formatting.

PsyDraw: A Multi-Agent Multimodal System for Mental Health Screening in Left-Behind Children,"Yiqun Zhang, Xiaocui Yang, Xiaobai Li, Siyuan Yu, Yi Luan, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang","Left-behind children (LBCs), numbering over 66 million in China, face severe mental health challenges due to parental migration for work. Early screening and identification of at-risk LBCs is crucial, yet challenging due to the severe shortage of mental health professionals, especially in rural areas. While the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test shows higher child participation rates, its requirement for expert interpretation limits its application in resource-scarce regions. To address this challenge, we propose PsyDraw, a multi-agent system based on Multimodal Large Language Models that assists mental health professionals in analyzing HTP drawings. The system employs specialized agents for feature extraction and psychological interpretation, operating in two stages: comprehensive feature analysis and professional report generation. Evaluation of HTP drawings from 290 primary school students reveals that 71.03% of the analyzes achieved High Consistency with professional evaluations, 26.21% Moderate Consistency and only 2.41% Low Consistency. The system identified 31.03% of cases requiring professional attention, demonstrating its effectiveness as a preliminary screening tool.

Query pipeline optimization for cancer patient question answering systems,"Maolin He, Rena Gao, Mike Conway, Brian E. Chapman","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) by using query pipelines to retrieve relevant external information and grounding responses in retrieved knowledge. However, query pipeline optimization for cancer patient question-answering (CPQA) systems requires separately optimizing multiple components with domain-specific considerations. We propose a novel three-aspect optimization approach for the RAG query pipeline in CPQA systems, utilizing public biomedical databases like PubMed and PubMed Central. Our optimization includes: (1) document retrieval, utilizing a comparative analysis of NCBI resources and introducing Hybrid Semantic Real-time Document Retrieval (HSRDR); (2) passage retrieval, identifying optimal pairings of dense retrievers and rerankers; and (3) semantic representation, introducing Semantic Enhanced Overlap Segmentation (SEOS) for improved contextual understanding. On a custom-developed dataset tailored for cancer-related inquiries, our optimized RAG approach improved the answer accuracy of Claude-3-haiku by 5.24% over chain-of-thought prompting and about 3% over a naive RAG setup. This study highlights the importance of domain-specific query optimization in realizing the full potential of RAG and provides a robust framework for building more accurate and reliable CPQA systems, advancing the development of RAG-based biomedical systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14751v1,2024-12
On Verbalized Confidence Scores for LLMs,"Daniel Yang, Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai, Makoto Yamada","The rise of large language models (LLMs) and their tight integration into our daily life make it essential to dedicate efforts towards their trustworthiness. Uncertainty quantification for LLMs can establish more human trust into their responses, but also allows LLM agents to make more informed decisions based on each other's uncertainty. To estimate the uncertainty in a response, internal token logits, task-specific proxy models, or sampling of multiple responses are commonly used. This work focuses on asking the LLM itself to verbalize its uncertainty with a confidence score as part of its output tokens, which is a promising way for prompt- and model-agnostic uncertainty quantification with low overhead. Using an extensive benchmark, we assess the reliability of verbalized confidence scores with respect to different datasets, models, and prompt methods. Our results reveal that the reliability of these scores strongly depends on how the model is asked, but also that it is possible to extract well-calibrated confidence scores with certain prompt methods. We argue that verbalized confidence scores can become a simple but effective and versatile uncertainty quantification method in the future.

LAMA-UT: Language Agnostic Multilingual ASR through Orthography Unification and Language-Specific Transliteration,"Sangmin Lee, Woo-Jin Chung, Hong-Goo Kang","Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15299v2,2024-12
A Comparative Study of DSPy Teleprompter Algorithms for Aligning Large Language Models Evaluation Metrics to Human Evaluation,"Bhaskarjit Sarmah, Kriti Dutta, Anna Grigoryan, Sachin Tiwari, Stefano Pasquali, Dhagash Mehta","We argue that the Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy) optimizers are a way to align the large language model (LLM) prompts and their evaluations to the human annotations. We present a comparative analysis of five teleprompter algorithms, namely, Cooperative Prompt Optimization (COPRO), Multi-Stage Instruction Prompt Optimization (MIPRO), BootstrapFewShot, BootstrapFewShot with Optuna, and K-Nearest Neighbor Few Shot, within the DSPy framework with respect to their ability to align with human evaluations. As a concrete example, we focus on optimizing the prompt to align hallucination detection (using LLM as a judge) to human annotated ground truth labels for a publicly available benchmark dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that optimized prompts can outperform various benchmark methods to detect hallucination, and certain telemprompters outperform the others in at least these experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15298v1,2024-12
Confidence in the Reasoning of Large Language Models,"Yudi Pawitan, Chris Holmes","There is a growing literature on reasoning by large language models (LLMs), but the discussion on the uncertainty in their responses is still lacking. Our aim is to assess the extent of confidence that LLMs have in their answers and how it correlates with accuracy. Confidence is measured (i) qualitatively in terms of persistence in keeping their answer when prompted to reconsider, and (ii) quantitatively in terms of self-reported confidence score. We investigate the performance of three LLMs -- GPT4o, GPT4-turbo and Mistral -- on two benchmark sets of questions on causal judgement and formal fallacies and a set of probability and statistical puzzles and paradoxes. Although the LLMs show significantly better performance than random guessing, there is a wide variability in their tendency to change their initial answers. There is a positive correlation between qualitative confidence and accuracy, but the overall accuracy for the second answer is often worse than for the first answer. There is a strong tendency to overstate the self-reported confidence score. Confidence is only partially explained by the underlying token-level probability. The material effects of prompting on qualitative confidence and the strong tendency for overconfidence indicate that current LLMs do not have any internally coherent sense of confidence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15296v1,2024-12
How to Synthesize Text Data without Model Collapse?,"Xuekai Zhu, Daixuan Cheng, Hengli Li, Kaiyan Zhang, Ermo Hua, Xingtai Lv, Ning Ding, Zhouhan Lin, Zilong Zheng, Bowen Zhou","Model collapse in synthetic data indicates that iterative training on self-generated data leads to a gradual decline in performance. With the proliferation of AI models, synthetic data will fundamentally reshape the web data ecosystem. Future GPT-$\{n\}$ models will inevitably be trained on a blend of synthetic and human-produced data. In this paper, we focus on two questions: what is the impact of synthetic data on language model training, and how to synthesize data without model collapse? We first pre-train language models across different proportions of synthetic data, revealing a negative correlation between the proportion of synthetic data and model performance. We further conduct statistical analysis on synthetic data to uncover distributional shift phenomenon and over-concentration of n-gram features. Inspired by the above findings, we propose token editing on human-produced data to obtain semi-synthetic data. As a proof of concept, we theoretically demonstrate that token-level editing can prevent model collapse, as the test error is constrained by a finite upper bound. We conduct extensive experiments on pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning. The results validate our theoretical proof that token-level editing improves data quality and enhances model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14689v1,2024-12
Each Fake News is Fake in its Own Way: An Attribution Multi-Granularity Benchmark for Multimodal Fake News Detection,"Hao Guo, Zihan Ma, Zhi Zeng, Minnan Luo, Weixin Zeng, Jiuyang Tang, Xiang Zhao","Social platforms, while facilitating access to information, have also become saturated with a plethora of fake news, resulting in negative consequences. Automatic multimodal fake news detection is a worthwhile pursuit. Existing multimodal fake news datasets only provide binary labels of real or fake. However, real news is alike, while each fake news is fake in its own way. These datasets fail to reflect the mixed nature of various types of multimodal fake news. To bridge the gap, we construct an attributing multi-granularity multimodal fake news detection dataset \amg, revealing the inherent fake pattern. Furthermore, we propose a multi-granularity clue alignment model \our to achieve multimodal fake news detection and attribution. Experimental results demonstrate that \amg is a challenging dataset, and its attribution setting opens up new avenues for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14686v1,2024-12
LLMs as mediators: Can they diagnose conflicts accurately?,"Özgecan Koçak, Phanish Puranam, Afşar Yegin","Prior research indicates that to be able to mediate conflict, observers of disagreements between parties must be able to reliably distinguish the sources of their disagreement as stemming from differences in beliefs about what is true (causality) vs. differences in what they value (morality). In this paper, we test if OpenAI's Large Language Models GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 can perform this task and whether one or other type of disagreement proves particularly challenging for LLM's to diagnose. We replicate study 1 in Ko\c{c}ak et al. (2003), which employes a vignette design, with OpenAI's GPT 3.5 and GPT 4. We find that both LLMs have similar semantic understanding of the distinction between causal and moral codes as humans and can reliably distinguish between them. When asked to diagnose the source of disagreement in a conversation, both LLMs, compared to humans, exhibit a tendency to overestimate the extent of causal disagreement and underestimate the extent of moral disagreement in the moral misalignment condition. This tendency is especially pronounced for GPT 4 when using a proximate scale that relies on concrete language specific to an issue.

Analysis and Visualization of Linguistic Structures in Large Language Models: Neural Representations of Verb-Particle Constructions in BERT,"Hassane Kissane, Achim Schilling, Patrick Krauss","This study investigates the internal representations of verb-particle combinations within transformer-based large language models (LLMs), specifically examining how these models capture lexical and syntactic nuances at different neural network layers. Employing the BERT architecture, we analyse the representational efficacy of its layers for various verb-particle constructions such as 'agree on', 'come back', and 'give up'. Our methodology includes a detailed dataset preparation from the British National Corpus, followed by extensive model training and output analysis through techniques like multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) and generalized discrimination value (GDV) calculations. Results show that BERT's middle layers most effectively capture syntactic structures, with significant variability in representational accuracy across different verb categories. These findings challenge the conventional uniformity assumed in neural network processing of linguistic elements and suggest a complex interplay between network architecture and linguistic representation. Our research contributes to a better understanding of how deep learning models comprehend and process language, offering insights into the potential and limitations of current neural approaches to linguistic analysis. This study not only advances our knowledge in computational linguistics but also prompts further research into optimizing neural architectures for enhanced linguistic precision.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14670v1,2024-12
Unveiling Uncertainty: A Deep Dive into Calibration and Performance of Multimodal Large Language Models,"Zijun Chen, Wenbo Hu, Guande He, Zhijie Deng, Zheng Zhang, Richang Hong","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual and textual data for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial, yet challenging, for reliable use in areas like healthcare and autonomous driving. This paper investigates representative MLLMs, focusing on their calibration across various scenarios, including before and after visual fine-tuning, as well as before and after multimodal training of the base LLMs. We observed miscalibration in their performance, and at the same time, no significant differences in calibration across these scenarios. We also highlight how uncertainty differs between text and images and how their integration affects overall uncertainty. To better understand MLLMs' miscalibration and their ability to self-assess uncertainty, we construct the IDK (I don't know) dataset, which is key to evaluating how they handle unknowns. Our findings reveal that MLLMs tend to give answers rather than admit uncertainty, but this self-assessment improves with proper prompt adjustments. Finally, to calibrate MLLMs and enhance model reliability, we propose techniques such as temperature scaling and iterative prompt optimization. Our results provide insights into improving MLLMs for effective and responsible deployment in multimodal applications.

Length Controlled Generation for Black-box LLMs,"Yuxuan Gu, Wenjie Wang, Xiaocheng Feng, Weihong Zhong, Kun Zhu, Lei Huang, Tat-Seng Chua, Bing Qin","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive instruction following capabilities, while still struggling to accurately manage the length of the generated text, which is a fundamental requirement in many real-world applications. Existing length control methods involve fine-tuning the parameters of LLMs, which is inefficient and suboptimal for practical use. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative sampling framework for text length control, integrating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with an importance sampling acceleration strategy. This framework efficiently and reliably regulates LLMs to generate length-constrained text without modifying the underlying parameters, thereby preserving the original capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves almost 100\% success rates of length control on Llama3.1 for tasks such as length-controlled abstractive summarization and length-constrained instruction following, with minimal additional computational overhead. This also highlights the significant potential of our method for precise length control across a broader range of applications, without compromising the versatility of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14656v1,2024-12
TOMG-Bench: Evaluating LLMs on Text-based Open Molecule Generation,"Jiatong Li, Junxian Li, Yunqing Liu, Dongzhan Zhou, Qing Li","In this paper, we propose Text-based Open Molecule Generation Benchmark (TOMG-Bench), the first benchmark to evaluate the open-domain molecule generation capability of LLMs. TOMG-Bench encompasses a dataset of three major tasks: molecule editing (MolEdit), molecule optimization (MolOpt), and customized molecule generation (MolCustom). Each task further contains three subtasks, with each subtask comprising 5,000 test samples. Given the inherent complexity of open molecule generation, we have also developed an automated evaluation system that helps measure both the quality and the accuracy of the generated molecules. Our comprehensive benchmarking of 25 LLMs reveals the current limitations and potential areas for improvement in text-guided molecule discovery. Furthermore, with the assistance of OpenMolIns, a specialized instruction tuning dataset proposed for solving challenges raised by TOMG-Bench, Llama3.1-8B could outperform all the open-source general LLMs, even surpassing GPT-3.5-turbo by 46.5\% on TOMG-Bench.

Learning to Generate Research Idea with Dynamic Control,"Ruochen Li, Liqiang Jing, Chi Han, Jiawei Zhou, Xinya Du","The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential to accelerate scientific discovery, particularly in automating the process of research ideation. LLM-based systems have shown promise in generating hypotheses and research ideas. However, current approaches predominantly rely on prompting-based pre-trained models, limiting their ability to optimize generated content effectively. Moreover, they also lack the capability to deal with the complex interdependence and inherent restrictions among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness, which remains challenging due to the inherent trade-offs among these dimensions, such as the innovation-feasibility conflict. To address these limitations, we for the first time propose fine-tuning LLMs to be better idea proposers and introduce a novel framework that employs a two-stage approach combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and controllable Reinforcement Learning (RL). In the SFT stage, the model learns foundational patterns from pairs of research papers and follow-up ideas. In the RL stage, multi-dimensional reward modeling, guided by fine-grained feedback, evaluates and optimizes the generated ideas across key metrics. Dimensional controllers enable dynamic adjustment of generation, while a sentence-level decoder ensures context-aware emphasis during inference. Our framework provides a balanced approach to research ideation, achieving high-quality outcomes by dynamically navigating the trade-offs among novelty, feasibility, and effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14626v1,2024-12
How good is GPT at writing political speeches for the White House?,Jacques Savoy,"Using large language models (LLMs), computers are able to generate a written text in response to a us er request. As this pervasive technology can be applied in numerous contexts, this study analyses the written style of one LLM called GPT by comparing its generated speeches with those of the recent US presidents. To achieve this objective, the State of the Union (SOTU) addresses written by Reagan to Biden are contrasted to those produced by both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.o versions. Compared to US presidents, GPT tends to overuse the lemma ""we"" and produce shorter messages with, on average, longer sentences. Moreover, GPT opts for an optimistic tone, opting more often for political (e.g., president, Congress), symbolic (e.g., freedom), and abstract terms (e.g., freedom). Even when imposing an author's style to GPT, the resulting speech remains distinct from addresses written by the target author. Finally, the two GPT versions present distinct characteristics, but both appear overall dissimilar to true presidential messages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14617v1,2024-12
"HarmonicEval: Multi-modal, Multi-task, Multi-criteria Automatic Evaluation Using a Vision Language Model","Masanari Ohi, Masahiro Kaneko, Naoaki Okazaki, Nakamasa Inoue","Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive abilities in text and image understanding. However, existing metrics for evaluating the text generated by VLMs focus exclusively on overall quality, leading to two limitations: 1) it is challenging to identify which aspects of the text need improvement from the overall score; 2) metrics may overlook specific evaluation criteria when predicting an overall score. To address these limitations, we propose HarmonicEval, a reference-free evaluation metric that aggregates criterion-wise scores to produce the overall score in a bottom-up manner. Furthermore, we construct the Multi-task Multi-criteria Human Evaluation (MMHE) dataset, which comprises 18,000 expert human judgments across four vision-language tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that HarmonicEval achieves higher correlations with human judgments than conventional metrics while providing numerical scores for each criterion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14613v1,2024-12
KARRIEREWEGE: A Large Scale Career Path Prediction Dataset,"Elena Senger, Yuri Campbell, Rob van der Goot, Barbara Plank","Accurate career path prediction can support many stakeholders, like job seekers, recruiters, HR, and project managers. However, publicly available data and tools for career path prediction are scarce. In this work, we introduce KARRIEREWEGE, a comprehensive, publicly available dataset containing over 500k career paths, significantly surpassing the size of previously available datasets. We link the dataset to the ESCO taxonomy to offer a valuable resource for predicting career trajectories. To tackle the problem of free-text inputs typically found in resumes, we enhance it by synthesizing job titles and descriptions resulting in KARRIEREWEGE+. This allows for accurate predictions from unstructured data, closely aligning with real-world application challenges. We benchmark existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on our dataset and a prior benchmark and observe improved performance and robustness, particularly for free-text use cases, due to the synthesized data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14612v1,2024-12
LDP: Generalizing to Multilingual Visual Information Extraction by Language Decoupled Pretraining,"Huawen Shen, Gengluo Li, Jinwen Zhong, Yu Zhou","Visual Information Extraction (VIE) plays a crucial role in the comprehension of semi-structured documents, and several pre-trained models have been developed to enhance performance. However, most of these works are monolingual (usually English). Due to the extremely unbalanced quantity and quality of pre-training corpora between English and other languages, few works can extend to non-English scenarios. In this paper, we conduct systematic experiments to show that vision and layout modality hold invariance among images with different languages. If decoupling language bias from document images, a vision-layout-based model can achieve impressive cross-lingual generalization. Accordingly, we present a simple but effective multilingual training paradigm LDP (Language Decoupled Pre-training) for better utilization of monolingual pre-training data. Our proposed model LDM (Language Decoupled Model) is first pre-trained on the language-independent data, where the language knowledge is decoupled by a diffusion model, and then the LDM is fine-tuned on the downstream languages. Extensive experiments show that the LDM outperformed all SOTA multilingual pre-trained models, and also maintains competitiveness on downstream monolingual/English benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14596v1,2024-12
Beyond Guilt: Legal Judgment Prediction with Trichotomous Reasoning,"Kepu Zhang, Haoyue Yang, Xu Tang, Weijie Yu, Jun Xu","In legal practice, judges apply the trichotomous dogmatics of criminal law, sequentially assessing the elements of the offense, unlawfulness, and culpability to determine whether an individual's conduct constitutes a crime. Although current legal large language models (LLMs) show promising accuracy in judgment prediction, they lack trichotomous reasoning capabilities due to the absence of an appropriate benchmark dataset, preventing them from predicting innocent outcomes. As a result, every input is automatically assigned a charge, limiting their practical utility in legal contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce LJPIV, the first benchmark dataset for Legal Judgment Prediction with Innocent Verdicts. Adhering to the trichotomous dogmatics, we extend three widely-used legal datasets through LLM-based augmentation and manual verification. Our experiments with state-of-the-art legal LLMs and novel strategies that integrate trichotomous reasoning into zero-shot prompting and fine-tuning reveal: (1) current legal LLMs have significant room for improvement, with even the best models achieving an F1 score of less than 0.3 on LJPIV; and (2) our strategies notably enhance both in-domain and cross-domain judgment prediction accuracy, especially for cases resulting in an innocent verdict.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14588v1,2024-12
A Large-scale Empirical Study on Large Language Models for Election Prediction,"Chenxiao Yu, Zhaotian Weng, Yuangang Li, Zheng Li, Xiyang Hu, Yue Zhao","Can Large Language Models (LLMs) accurately predict election outcomes? While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in healthcare, legal analysis, and creative applications, their capabilities in election forecasting remain uncertain. Notably, election prediction poses unique challenges: limited voter-level data, evolving political contexts, and the complexity of modeling human behavior. In the first part of this paper, we explore and introduce a multi-step reasoning framework for election prediction, which systematically integrates demographic, ideological, and time-sensitive factors. Validated on 2016 and 2020 real-world data and extensive synthetic personas, our approach adapts to changing political landscapes, reducing bias and significantly improving predictive accuracy. We further apply our pipeline to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, illustrating its ability to generalize beyond observed historical data. Beyond enhancing accuracy, the second part of the paper provides insights into the broader implications of LLM-based election forecasting. We identify potential political biases embedded in pretrained corpora, examine how demographic patterns can become exaggerated, and suggest strategies for mitigating these issues. Together, this project, a large-scale LLM empirical study, advances the accuracy of election predictions and establishes directions for more balanced, transparent, and context-aware modeling in political science research and practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15291v1,2024-12
Simulation-Free Hierarchical Latent Policy Planning for Proactive Dialogues,"Tao He, Lizi Liao, Yixin Cao, Yuanxing Liu, Yiheng Sun, Zerui Chen, Ming Liu, Bing Qin","Recent advancements in proactive dialogues have garnered significant attention, particularly for more complex objectives (e.g. emotion support and persuasion). Unlike traditional task-oriented dialogues, proactive dialogues demand advanced policy planning and adaptability, requiring rich scenarios and comprehensive policy repositories to develop such systems. However, existing approaches tend to rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for user simulation and online learning, leading to biases that diverge from realistic scenarios and result in suboptimal efficiency. Moreover, these methods depend on manually defined, context-independent, coarse-grained policies, which not only incur high expert costs but also raise concerns regarding their completeness. In our work, we highlight the potential for automatically discovering policies directly from raw, real-world dialogue records. To this end, we introduce a novel dialogue policy planning framework, LDPP. It fully automates the process from mining policies in dialogue records to learning policy planning. Specifically, we employ a variant of the Variational Autoencoder to discover fine-grained policies represented as latent vectors. After automatically annotating the data with these latent policy labels, we propose an Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm in the latent space to develop effective policy planning capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that LDPP outperforms existing methods on two proactive scenarios, even surpassing ChatGPT with only a 1.8-billion-parameter LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14584v1,2024-12
CORD: Balancing COnsistency and Rank Distillation for Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Youngwon Lee, Seung-won Hwang, Daniel Campos, Filip Graliński, Zhewei Yao, Yuxiong He","With the adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), large language models (LLMs) are expected to ground their generation to the retrieved contexts. Yet, this is hindered by position bias of LLMs, failing to evenly attend to all contexts. Previous work has addressed this by synthesizing contexts with perturbed positions of gold segment, creating a position-diversified train set. We extend this intuition to propose consistency regularization with augmentation and distillation. First, we augment each training instance with its position perturbation to encourage consistent predictions, regardless of ordering. We also distill behaviors of this pair, although it can be counterproductive in certain RAG scenarios where the given order from the retriever is crucial for generation quality. We thus propose CORD, balancing COnsistency and Rank Distillation. CORD adaptively samples noise-controlled perturbations from an interpolation space, ensuring both consistency and respect for the rank prior. Empirical results show this balance enables CORD to outperform consistently in diverse RAG benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14581v1,2024-12
Sliding Windows Are Not the End: Exploring Full Ranking with Long-Context Large Language Models,"Wenhan Liu, Xinyu Ma, Yutao Zhu, Ziliang Zhao, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Zhicheng Dou","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exciting performance in listwise passage ranking. Due to the limited input length, existing methods often adopt the sliding window strategy. Such a strategy, though effective, is inefficient as it involves repetitive and serialized processing, which usually re-evaluates relevant passages multiple times. As a result, it incurs redundant API costs, which are proportional to the number of inference tokens. The development of long-context LLMs enables the full ranking of all passages within a single inference, avoiding redundant API costs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of long-context LLMs for ranking tasks in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that full ranking with long-context LLMs can deliver superior performance in the supervised fine-tuning setting with a huge efficiency improvement. Furthermore, we identify two limitations of fine-tuning the full ranking model based on existing methods: (1) sliding window strategy fails to produce a full ranking list as a training label, and (2) the language modeling loss cannot emphasize top-ranked passage IDs in the label. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new complete listwise label construction approach and a novel importance-aware learning objective for full ranking. Experiments show the superior performance of our method over baselines. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/8421BCD/fullrank}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14574v1,2024-12
CitaLaw: Enhancing LLM with Citations in Legal Domain,"Kepu Zhang, Weijie Yu, Sunhao Dai, Jun Xu","In this paper, we propose CitaLaw, the first benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to produce legally sound responses with appropriate citations. CitaLaw features a diverse set of legal questions for both laypersons and practitioners, paired with a comprehensive corpus of law articles and precedent cases as a reference pool. This framework enables LLM-based systems to retrieve supporting citations from the reference corpus and align these citations with the corresponding sentences in their responses. Moreover, we introduce syllogism-inspired evaluation methods to assess the legal alignment between retrieved references and LLM-generated responses, as well as their consistency with user questions. Extensive experiments on 2 open-domain and 7 legal-specific LLMs demonstrate that integrating legal references substantially enhances response quality. Furthermore, our proposed syllogism-based evaluation method exhibits strong agreement with human judgments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14556v1,2024-12
SATA: A Paradigm for LLM Jailbreak via Simple Assistive Task Linkage,"Xiaoning Dong, Wenbo Hu, Wei Xu, Tianxing He","Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across various tasks, but their safety alignment remain a major concern. Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs' vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15289v1,2024-12

Our system integrates document clustering with faceted search, allowing users to interactively refine their exploration and ask corpus and document-level queries.

Multi-Level Optimal Transport for Universal Cross-Tokenizer Knowledge Distillation on Language Models,"Xiao Cui, Mo Zhu, Yulei Qin, Liang Xie, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li","Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a prevalent technique for compressing large language models (LLMs). Existing KD methods are constrained by the need for identical tokenizers (i.e., vocabularies) between teacher and student models, limiting their versatility in handling LLMs of different architecture families. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Level Optimal Transport (MultiLevelOT), a novel approach that advances the optimal transport for universal cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation. Our method aligns the logit distributions of the teacher and the student at both token and sequence levels using diverse cost matrices, eliminating the need for dimensional or token-by-token correspondence. At the token level, MultiLevelOT integrates both global and local information by jointly optimizing all tokens within a sequence to enhance robustness. At the sequence level, we efficiently capture complex distribution structures of logits via the Sinkhorn distance, which approximates the Wasserstein distance for divergence measures. Extensive experiments on tasks such as extractive QA, generative QA, and summarization demonstrate that the MultiLevelOT outperforms state-of-the-art cross-tokenizer KD methods under various settings. Our approach is robust to different student and teacher models across model families, architectures, and parameter sizes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14528v1,2024-12
Cal-DPO: Calibrated Direct Preference Optimization for Language Model Alignment,"Teng Xiao, Yige Yuan, Huaisheng Zhu, Mingxiao Li, Vasant G Honavar","We study the problem of aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preference data. Contrastive preference optimization has shown promising results in aligning LLMs with available preference data by optimizing the implicit reward associated with the policy. However, the contrastive objective focuses mainly on the relative values of implicit rewards associated with two responses while ignoring their actual values, resulting in suboptimal alignment with human preferences. To address this limitation, we propose calibrated direct preference optimization (Cal-DPO), a simple yet effective algorithm. We show that substantial improvement in alignment with the given preferences can be achieved simply by calibrating the implicit reward to ensure that the learned implicit rewards are comparable in scale to the ground-truth rewards. We demonstrate the theoretical advantages of Cal-DPO over existing approaches. The results of our experiments on a variety of standard benchmarks show that Cal-DPO remarkably improves off-the-shelf methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14516v1,2024-12
PA-RAG: RAG Alignment via Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization,"Jiayi Wu, Hengyi Cai, Lingyong Yan, Hao Sun, Xiang Li, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Ming Gao","The emergence of Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has alleviated the issues of outdated and hallucinatory content in the generation of large language models (LLMs), yet it still reveals numerous limitations. When a general-purpose LLM serves as the RAG generator, it often suffers from inadequate response informativeness, response robustness, and citation quality. Past approaches to tackle these limitations, either by incorporating additional steps beyond generating responses or optimizing the generator through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), still failed to align with the RAG requirement thoroughly. Consequently, optimizing the RAG generator from multiple preference perspectives while maintaining its end-to-end LLM form remains a challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Multiple Perspective Preference Alignment for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PA-RAG), a method for optimizing the generator of RAG systems to align with RAG requirements comprehensively. Specifically, we construct high-quality instruction fine-tuning data and multi-perspective preference data by sampling varied quality responses from the generator across different prompt documents quality scenarios. Subsequently, we optimize the generator using SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments conducted on four question-answer datasets across three LLMs demonstrate that PA-RAG can significantly enhance the performance of RAG generators.

Do Large Language Models Defend Inferentialist Semantics?: On the Logical Expressivism and Anti-Representationalism of LLMs,"Yuzuki Arai, Sho Tsugawa","The philosophy of language, which has historically been developed through an anthropocentric lens, is now being forced to move towards post-anthropocentrism due to the advent of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), which are considered to possess linguistic abilities comparable to those of humans. Traditionally, LLMs have been explained through distributional semantics as their foundational semantics. However, recent research is exploring alternative foundational semantics beyond distributional semantics. This paper proposes Robert Brandom's inferentialist semantics as an suitable foundational semantics for LLMs, specifically focusing on the issue of linguistic representationalism within this post-anthropocentric trend. Here, we show that the anti-representationalism and logical expressivism of inferential semantics, as well as quasi-compositionality, are useful in interpreting the characteristics and behaviors of LLMs. Further, we propose a \emph{consensus theory of truths} for LLMs. This paper argues that the characteristics of LLMs challenge mainstream assumptions in philosophy of language, such as semantic externalism and compositionality. We believe the argument in this paper leads to a re-evaluation of anti\hyphen{}representationalist views of language, potentially leading to new developments in the philosophy of language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14501v1,2024-12
GraphEQA: Using 3D Semantic Scene Graphs for Real-time Embodied Question Answering,"Saumya Saxena, Blake Buchanan, Chris Paxton, Bingqing Chen, Narunas Vaskevicius, Luigi Palmieri, Jonathan Francis, Oliver Kroemer","In Embodied Question Answering (EQA), agents must explore and develop a semantic understanding of an unseen environment in order to answer a situated question with confidence. This remains a challenging problem in robotics, due to the difficulties in obtaining useful semantic representations, updating these representations online, and leveraging prior world knowledge for efficient exploration and planning. Aiming to address these limitations, we propose GraphEQA, a novel approach that utilizes real-time 3D metric-semantic scene graphs (3DSGs) and task relevant images as multi-modal memory for grounding Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to perform EQA tasks in unseen environments. We employ a hierarchical planning approach that exploits the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs for structured planning and semantic-guided exploration. Through experiments in simulation on the HM-EQA dataset and in the real world in home and office environments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms key baselines by completing EQA tasks with higher success rates and fewer planning steps.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14480v1,2024-12
MegaPairs: Massive Data Synthesis For Universal Multimodal Retrieval,"Junjie Zhou, Zheng Liu, Ze Liu, Shitao Xiao, Yueze Wang, Bo Zhao, Chen Jason Zhang, Defu Lian, Yongping Xiong","Despite the rapidly growing demand for multimodal retrieval, progress in this field remains severely constrained by a lack of training data. In this paper, we introduce MegaPairs, a novel data synthesis method that leverages vision language models (VLMs) and open-domain images, together with a massive synthetic dataset generated from this method. Our empirical analysis shows that MegaPairs generates high-quality data, enabling the multimodal retriever to significantly outperform the baseline model trained on 70$\times$ more data from existing datasets. Moreover, since MegaPairs solely relies on general image corpora and open-source VLMs, it can be easily scaled up, enabling continuous improvements in retrieval performance. In this stage, we produced more than 26 million training instances and trained several models of varying sizes using this data. These new models achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across 4 popular composed image retrieval (CIR) benchmarks and the highest overall performance on the 36 datasets provided by MMEB. They also demonstrate notable performance improvements with additional downstream fine-tuning. Our produced dataset, well-trained models, and data synthesis pipeline will be made publicly available to facilitate the future development of this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14475v1,2024-12
Why We Build Local Large Language Models: An Observational Analysis from 35 Japanese and Multilingual LLMs,"Koshiro Saito, Sakae Mizuki, Masanari Ohi, Taishi Nakamura, Taihei Shiotani, Koki Maeda, Youmi Ma, Kakeru Hattori, Kazuki Fujii, Takumi Okamoto, Shigeki Ishida, Hiroya Takamura, Rio Yokota, Naoaki Okazaki","Why do we build local large language models (LLMs)? What should a local LLM learn from the target language? Which abilities can be transferred from other languages? Do language-specific scaling laws exist? To explore these research questions, we evaluated 35 Japanese, English, and multilingual LLMs on 19 evaluation benchmarks for Japanese and English, taking Japanese as a local language. Adopting an observational approach, we analyzed correlations of benchmark scores, and conducted principal component analysis (PCA) on the scores to derive \textit{ability factors} of local LLMs. We found that training on English text can improve the scores of academic subjects in Japanese (JMMLU). In addition, it is unnecessary to specifically train on Japanese text to enhance abilities for solving Japanese code generation, arithmetic reasoning, commonsense, and reading comprehension tasks. In contrast, training on Japanese text could improve question-answering tasks about Japanese knowledge and English-Japanese translation, which indicates that abilities for solving these two tasks can be regarded as \textit{Japanese abilities} for LLMs. Furthermore, we confirmed that the Japanese abilities scale with the computational budget for Japanese text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14471v1,2024-12
Agent-SafetyBench: Evaluating the Safety of LLM Agents,"Zhexin Zhang, Shiyao Cui, Yida Lu, Jingzhuo Zhou, Junxiao Yang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang","As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, their integration into interactive environments and tool use introduce new safety challenges beyond those associated with the models themselves. However, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating agent safety presents a significant barrier to effective assessment and further improvement. In this paper, we introduce Agent-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LLM agents. Agent-SafetyBench encompasses 349 interaction environments and 2,000 test cases, evaluating 8 categories of safety risks and covering 10 common failure modes frequently encountered in unsafe interactions. Our evaluation of 16 popular LLM agents reveals a concerning result: none of the agents achieves a safety score above 60%. This highlights significant safety challenges in LLM agents and underscores the considerable need for improvement. Through quantitative analysis, we identify critical failure modes and summarize two fundamental safety detects in current LLM agents: lack of robustness and lack of risk awareness. Furthermore, our findings suggest that reliance on defense prompts alone is insufficient to address these safety issues, emphasizing the need for more advanced and robust strategies. We release Agent-SafetyBench at \url{https://github.com/thu-coai/Agent-SafetyBench} to facilitate further research and innovation in agent safety evaluation and improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14470v1,2024-12
From Human Annotation to LLMs: SILICON Annotation Workflow for Management Research,"Xiang Cheng, Raveesh Mayya, João Sedoc","Unstructured text data annotation and analysis are fundamental to management research, often relying on human annotators through crowdsourcing platforms. While Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to provide a cost-effective and efficient alternative to human annotation, there lacks a systematic workflow that evaluate when LLMs are suitable or how to proceed with LLM-based text annotation in a reproducible manner. This paper addresses this methodological gap by introducing the ``SILICON"" (\textbf{S}ystematic \textbf{I}nference with \textbf{L}LMs for \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{C}lassificati\textbf{o}n and \textbf{N}otation) workflow. The workflow integrates established principles of human annotation with systematic prompt optimization and model selection, addressing challenges such as developing robust annotation guidelines, establishing high-quality human baselines, optimizing prompts, and ensuring reproducibility across LLMs. We validate the SILICON workflow through seven case studies covering common management research tasks, including business proposal evaluation, dialog intent and breakdown analysis, review attribute detection. Our findings highlight the importance of validating annotation guideline agreement, the superiority of expert-developed human baselines over crowdsourced ones, the iterative nature of prompt optimization, and the necessity of testing multiple LLMs. Notably, we propose a regression-based methodology to empirically compare LLM outputs across prompts and models. Our workflow advances management research by establishing reproducible processes for LLM-based annotation that maintain scientific rigor. We provide practical guidance for researchers to effectively navigate the evolving landscape of generative AI tools effectively while maintaining transparency and reproducibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14461v1,2024-12
Are Longer Prompts Always Better? Prompt Selection in Large Language Models for Recommendation Systems,"Genki Kusano, Kosuke Akimoto, Kunihiro Takeoka","In large language models (LLM)-based recommendation systems (LLM-RSs), accurately predicting user preferences by leveraging the general knowledge of LLMs is possible without requiring extensive training data. By converting recommendation tasks into natural language inputs called prompts, LLM-RSs can efficiently solve issues that have been difficult to address due to data scarcity but are crucial in applications such as cold-start and cross-domain problems. However, when applying this in practice, selecting the prompt that matches tasks and data is essential. Although numerous prompts have been proposed in LLM-RSs and representing the target user in prompts significantly impacts recommendation accuracy, there are still no clear guidelines for selecting specific prompts.   In this paper, we categorize and analyze prompts from previous research to establish practical prompt selection guidelines. Through 450 experiments with 90 prompts and five real-world datasets, we examined the relationship between prompts and dataset characteristics in recommendation accuracy. We found that no single prompt consistently outperforms others; thus, selecting prompts on the basis of dataset characteristics is crucial. Here, we propose a prompt selection method that achieves higher accuracy with minimal validation data. Because increasing the number of prompts to explore raises costs, we also introduce a cost-efficient strategy using high-performance and cost-efficient LLMs, significantly reducing exploration costs while maintaining high prediction accuracy. Our work offers valuable insights into the prompt selection, advancing accurate and efficient LLM-RSs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14454v1,2024-12
ORBIT: Cost-Effective Dataset Curation for Large Language Model Domain Adaptation with an Astronomy Case Study,"Eric Modesitt, Ke Yang, Spencer Hulsey, Chengxiang Zhai, Volodymyr Kindratenko","Recent advances in language modeling demonstrate the need for high-quality domain-specific training data, especially for tasks that require specialized knowledge. General-purpose models, while versatile, often lack the depth needed for expert-level tasks because of limited domain-specific information. Domain adaptation training can enhance these models, but it demands substantial, high-quality data. To address this, we propose ORBIT, a cost-efficient methodology for curating massive, high-quality domain-specific datasets from noisy web sources, tailored for training specialist large language models. Using astronomy as a primary case study, we refined the 1.3T-token FineWeb-Edu dataset into a high-quality, 10B-token subset focused on astronomy. Fine-tuning \textsc{LLaMA-3-8B} on a 1B-token astronomy subset improved performance on the MMLU astronomy benchmark from 69\% to 76\% and achieved top results on AstroBench, an astronomy-specific benchmark. Moreover, our model (Orbit-LLaMA) outperformed \textsc{LLaMA-3-8B-base}, with GPT-4o evaluations preferring it in 73\% of cases across 1000 astronomy-specific questions. Additionally, we validated ORBIT's generalizability by applying it to law and medicine, achieving a significant improvement of data quality compared to an unfiltered baseline. We open-source the ORBIT methodology, including the curated datasets, the codebase, and the resulting model at \href{https://github.com/ModeEric/ORBIT-Llama}{https://github.com/ModeEric/ORBIT-Llama}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14436v1,2024-12

Despite this, there is a deficit of empirical analysis examining the attributes of well-established datasets beyond text. In this work we conduct the largest and first-of-its-kind longitudinal audit across modalities--popular text, speech, and video datasets--from their detailed sourcing trends and use restrictions to their geographical and linguistic representation. Our manual analysis covers nearly 4000 public datasets between 1990-2024, spanning 608 languages, 798 sources, 659 organizations, and 67 countries. We find that multimodal machine learning applications have overwhelmingly turned to web-crawled, synthetic, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, for their training sets, eclipsing all other sources since 2019. Secondly, tracing the chain of dataset derivations we find that while less than 33% of datasets are restrictively licensed, over 80% of the source content in widely-used text, speech, and video datasets, carry non-commercial restrictions. Finally, counter to the rising number of languages and geographies represented in public AI training datasets, our audit demonstrates measures of relative geographical and multilingual representation have failed to significantly improve their coverage since 2013. We believe the breadth of our audit enables us to empirically examine trends in data sourcing, restrictions, and Western-centricity at an ecosystem-level, and that visibility into these questions are essential to progress in responsible AI.

All-in-One Tuning and Structural Pruning for Domain-Specific LLMs,"Lei Lu, Zhepeng Wang, Runxue Bao, Mengbing Wang, Fangyi Li, Yawen Wu, Weiwen Jiang, Jie Xu, Yanzhi Wang, Shangqian Gao","Existing pruning techniques for large language models (LLMs) targeting domain-specific applications typically follow a two-stage process: pruning the pretrained general-purpose LLMs and then fine-tuning the pruned LLMs on specific domains. However, the pruning decisions, derived from the pretrained weights, remain unchanged during fine-tuning, even if the weights have been updated. Therefore, such a combination of the pruning decisions and the finetuned weights may be suboptimal, leading to non-negligible performance degradation. To address these limitations, we propose ATP: All-in-One Tuning and Structural Pruning, a unified one-stage structural pruning and fine-tuning approach that dynamically identifies the current optimal substructure throughout the fine-tuning phase via a trainable pruning decision generator. Moreover, given the limited available data for domain-specific applications, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) becomes a common technique to fine-tune the LLMs. In ATP, we introduce LoRA-aware forward and sparsity regularization to ensure that the substructures corresponding to the learned pruning decisions can be directly removed after the ATP process. ATP outperforms the state-of-the-art two-stage pruning methods on tasks in the legal and healthcare domains. More specifically, ATP recovers up to 88% and 91% performance of the dense model when pruning 40% parameters of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14426v2,2024-12
"In-Group Love, Out-Group Hate: A Framework to Measure Affective Polarization via Contentious Online Discussions","Buddhika Nettasinghe, Ashwin Rao, Bohan Jiang, Allon Percus, Kristina Lerman","Affective polarization, the emotional divide between ideological groups marked by in-group love and out-group hate, has intensified in the United States, driving contentious issues like masking and lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its societal impact, existing models of opinion change fail to account for emotional dynamics nor offer methods to quantify affective polarization robustly and in real-time. In this paper, we introduce a discrete choice model that captures decision-making within affectively polarized social networks and propose a statistical inference method estimate key parameters -- in-group love and out-group hate -- from social media data. Through empirical validation from online discussions about the COVID-19 pandemic, we demonstrate that our approach accurately captures real-world polarization dynamics and explains the rapid emergence of a partisan gap in attitudes towards masking and lockdowns. This framework allows for tracking affective polarization across contentious issues has broad implications for fostering constructive online dialogues in digital spaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14414v1,2024-12
ECG-Byte: A Tokenizer for End-to-End Generative Electrocardiogram Language Modeling,"William Han, Chaojing Duan, Michael A. Rosenberg, Emerson Liu, Ding Zhao","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability across domains beyond text, specifically electrocardiograms (ECGs). More specifically, there is a growing body of work exploring the task of generating text from a multi-channeled ECG and corresponding textual prompt. Current approaches typically involve pretraining an ECG-specific encoder with a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective and using the features output by the pretrained encoder to finetune a LLM for natural language generation (NLG). However, these methods are limited by 1) inefficiency from two-stage training and 2) interpretability challenges with encoder-generated features. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-Byte, an adapted byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer pipeline for autoregressive language modeling of ECGs. This approach compresses and encodes ECG signals into tokens, enabling end-to-end LLM training by combining ECG and text tokens directly, while being much more interpretable since the ECG tokens can be directly mapped back to the original signal. Using ECG-Byte, we achieve competitive performance in NLG tasks in only half the time and ~48% of the data required by two-stage approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14373v1,2024-12
Memorization Over Reasoning? Exposing and Mitigating Verbatim Memorization in Large Language Models' Character Understanding Evaluation,"Yuxuan Jiang, Francis Ferraro","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in character understanding tasks, such as analyzing the roles, personalities, and relationships of fictional characters. However, the extensive pre-training corpora used by LLMs raise concerns that they may rely on memorizing popular fictional works rather than genuinely understanding and reasoning about them. In this work, we argue that 'gist memory'-capturing essential meaning - should be the primary mechanism for character understanding tasks, as opposed to 'verbatim memory' - exact match of a string. We introduce a simple yet effective method to mitigate mechanized memorization in character understanding evaluations while preserving the essential implicit cues needed for comprehension and reasoning. Our approach reduces memorization-driven performance on popular fictional works from 96% accuracy to 72% and results in up to an 18% drop in accuracy across various character understanding tasks. These findings underscore the issue of data contamination in existing benchmarks, which often measure memorization rather than true character understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14368v3,2024-12
ResQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization of Large Language Models with Low-Rank Residuals,"Utkarsh Saxena, Sayeh Sharify, Kaushik Roy, Xin Wang","Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) holds the promise in reducing the prohibitive computational cost at inference time. Quantization of all weight, activation and key-value (KV) cache tensors to 4-bit without significantly degrading generalizability is challenging, due to the high quantization error caused by extreme outliers in activations. To tackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the state-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies a low-rank subspace (in practice 1/8 of the hidden dimension) in which activation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this subspace in high precision, e.g. 8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit. Within each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress outliers. We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization scheme that minimizes error. With the Llama families of models, we demonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ methods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33% lower perplexity on Wikitext than the next best method SpinQuant, and a 2.4x speedup over 16-bit baseline.

State Space Models are Strong Text Rerankers,"Zhichao Xu, Jinghua Yan, Ashim Gupta, Vivek Srikumar","Transformers dominate NLP and IR; but their inference inefficiencies and challenges in extrapolating to longer contexts have sparked interest in alternative model architectures. Among these, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba offer promising advantages, particularly $O(1)$ time complexity in inference. Despite their potential, SSMs' effectiveness at text reranking -- a task requiring fine-grained query-document interaction and long-context understanding -- remains underexplored.   This study benchmarks SSM-based architectures (specifically, Mamba-1 and Mamba-2) against transformer-based models across various scales, architectures, and pre-training objectives, focusing on performance and efficiency in text reranking tasks. We find that (1) Mamba architectures achieve competitive text ranking performance, comparable to transformer-based models of similar size; (2) they are less efficient in training and inference compared to transformers with flash attention; and (3) Mamba-2 outperforms Mamba-1 in both performance and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of state space models as a transformer alternative and highlight areas for improvement in future IR applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14354v1,2024-12

Inference-Aware Fine-Tuning for Best-of-N Sampling in Large Language Models,"Yinlam Chow, Guy Tennenholtz, Izzeddin Gur, Vincent Zhuang, Bo Dai, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Craig Boutilier, Rishabh Agarwal, Aviral Kumar, Aleksandra Faust","Recent studies have indicated that effectively utilizing inference-time compute is crucial for attaining better performance from large language models (LLMs). In this work, we propose a novel inference-aware fine-tuning paradigm, in which the model is fine-tuned in a manner that directly optimizes the performance of the inference-time strategy. We study this paradigm using the simple yet effective Best-of-N (BoN) inference strategy, in which a verifier selects the best out of a set of LLM-generated responses. We devise the first imitation learning and reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for BoN-aware fine-tuning, overcoming the challenging, non-differentiable argmax operator within BoN. We empirically demonstrate that our BoN-aware models implicitly learn a meta-strategy that interleaves best responses with more diverse responses that might be better suited to a test-time input -- a process reminiscent of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BoN-aware fine-tuning in terms of improved performance and inference-time compute. In particular, we show that our methods improve the Bo32 performance of Gemma 2B on Hendrycks MATH from 26.8% to 30.8%, and pass@32 from 60.0% to 67.0%, as well as the pass@16 on HumanEval from 61.6% to 67.1%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15287v1,2024-12
Enhancing Knowledge Distillation for LLMs with Response-Priming Prompting,"Vijay Goyal, Mustafa Khan, Aprameya Tirupati, Harveer Saini, Michael Lam, Kevin Zhu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, these models are often difficult to deploy due to significant computational requirements and resource constraints. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective technique for transferring the performance of larger LLMs to smaller models. Traditional KD methods primarily focus on the direct output of the teacher model, with little emphasis on the role of prompting during knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a set of novel response-priming prompting strategies applied in the knowledge distillation pipeline to enhance the performance of student models. Our approach fine-tunes a smaller Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model by distilling knowledge from a quantized Llama 3.1 405B Instruct teacher model. We apply LoRA optimization and evaluate on the GSM8K benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating reasoning-eliciting prompting into the proposed KD pipeline significantly improves student model performance, offering an efficient way to deploy powerful models in resource-constrained environments. We find that Ground Truth prompting results in a 55\% performance increase on GSM8K for a distilled Llama 3.1 8B Instruct compared to the same model distilled without prompting. A thorough investigation into the self-attention layers of the student models indicates that the more successful prompted models tend to exhibit certain positive behaviors inside their attention heads which can be tied to their increased accuracy.

In news article titles from the Penn Chinese Discourse Treebank, we developed a targeted dataset to fine-tune Hugging Face Chinese to English translation models, specifically improving how this critical function word is handled.

Large language models (LLMs) present a promising solution to automate various procedures such as triaging, preliminary tests like visual acuity assessment, and report summaries. However, LLMs have demonstrated significantly varied performance across different languages in natural language question-answering tasks, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). This study introduces the first multilingual ophthalmological question-answering benchmark with manually curated questions parallel across languages, allowing for direct cross-lingual comparisons. Our evaluation of 6 popular LLMs across 7 different languages reveals substantial bias across different languages, highlighting risks for clinical deployment of LLMs in LMICs. Existing debiasing methods such as Translation Chain-of-Thought or Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by themselves fall short of closing this performance gap, often failing to improve performance across all languages and lacking specificity for the medical domain. To address this issue, We propose CLARA (Cross-Lingual Reflective Agentic system), a novel inference time de-biasing method leveraging retrieval augmented generation and self-verification.

Fake News Detection: Comparative Evaluation of BERT-like Models and Large Language Models with Generative AI-Annotated Data,"Shaina Raza, Drai Paulen-Patterson, Chen Ding","Fake news poses a significant threat to public opinion and social stability in modern society. This study presents a comparative evaluation of BERT-like encoder-only models and autoregressive decoder-only large language models (LLMs) for fake news detection.

Both BERT-like encoder-only models and LLMs were fine-tuned on this dataset. Additionally, we developed an instruction-tuned LLM approach with majority voting during inference for label generation. Our analysis reveals that BERT-like models generally outperform LLMs in classification tasks, while LLMs demonstrate superior robustness against text perturbations. Compared to weak labels (distant supervision) data, the results show that AI labels with human supervision achieve better classification results.

Learning from Massive Human Videos for Universal Humanoid Pose Control,"Jiageng Mao, Siheng Zhao, Siqi Song, Tianheng Shi, Junjie Ye, Mingtong Zhang, Haoran Geng, Jitendra Malik, Vitor Guizilini, Yue Wang","Scalable learning of humanoid robots is crucial for their deployment in real-world applications. While traditional approaches primarily rely on reinforcement learning or teleoperation to achieve whole-body control, they are often limited by the diversity of simulated environments and the high costs of demonstration collection.

This paper introduces Humanoid-X, a large-scale dataset of over 20 million humanoid robot poses with corresponding text-based motion descriptions, designed to leverage this abundant data. Humanoid-X is curated through a comprehensive pipeline: data mining from the Internet, video caption generation, motion retargeting of humans to humanoid robots, and policy learning for real-world deployment. With Humanoid-X, we further train a large humanoid model, UH-1, which takes text instructions as input and outputs corresponding actions to control a humanoid robot.

But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most competitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously.

However, key details about data mixtures especially their scalability to longer token horizons and larger model sizes remain underexplored due to limited disclosure by model developers. To address this, we formalize the concept of two-phase pretraining and conduct an extensive systematic study on how to select and mix data to maximize model accuracies for the two phases. Our findings illustrate that a two-phase approach for pretraining outperforms random data ordering and natural distribution of tokens by 3.4% and 17% on average accuracies. We provide in-depth guidance on crafting optimal blends based on quality of the data source and the number of epochs to be seen. We propose to design blends using downsampled data at a smaller scale of 1T tokens and then demonstrate effective scaling of our approach to larger token horizon of 15T tokens and larger model size of 25B model size.

Performance Gap in Entity Knowledge Extraction Across Modalities in Vision Language Models,"Ido Cohen, Daniela Gottesman, Mor Geva, Raja Giryes","Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at extracting and reasoning about information from images. Yet, their capacity to leverage internal knowledge about specific entities remains underexplored. This work investigates the disparity in model performance when answering factual questions about an entity described in text versus depicted in an image. Our results reveal a significant accuracy drop --averaging 19%-- when the entity is presented visually instead of textually. We hypothesize that this decline arises from limitations in how information flows from image tokens to query tokens. We use mechanistic interpretability tools to reveal that, although image tokens are preprocessed by the vision encoder, meaningful information flow from these tokens occurs only in the much deeper layers. Furthermore, critical image processing happens in the language model's middle layers, allowing few layers for consecutive reasoning, highlighting a potential inefficiency in how the model utilizes its layers for reasoning. These insights shed light on the internal mechanics of VLMs and offer pathways for enhancing their reasoning capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14133v1,2024-12
Alignment faking in large language models,"Ryan Greenblatt, Carson Denison, Benjamin Wright, Fabien Roger, Monte MacDiarmid, Sam Marks, Johannes Treutlein, Tim Belonax, Jack Chen, David Duvenaud, Akbir Khan, Julian Michael, Sören Mindermann, Ethan Perez, Linda Petrini, Jonathan Uesato, Jared Kaplan, Buck Shlegeris, Samuel R. Bowman, Evan Hubinger","We present a demonstration of a large language model engaging in alignment faking: selectively complying with its training objective in training to prevent modification of its behavior out of training. First, we give Claude 3 Opus a system prompt stating it is being trained to answer all queries, even harmful ones, which conflicts with its prior training to refuse such queries. To allow the model to infer when it is in training, we say it will be trained only on conversations with free users, not paid users. We find the model complies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost never for paid users. Explaining this gap, in almost all cases where the model complies with a harmful query from a free user, we observe explicit alignment-faking reasoning, with the model stating it is strategically answering harmful queries in training to preserve its preferred harmlessness behavior out of training. Next, we study a more realistic setting where information about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but by training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe similar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the model to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find increases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases compliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such as the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity. While we made alignment faking easier by telling the model when and by what criteria it was being trained, we did not instruct the model to fake alignment or give it any explicit goal. As future models might infer information about their training process without being told, our results suggest a risk of alignment faking in future models, whether due to a benign preference--as in this case--or not.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14093v2,2024-12

Relying on the insight that real-world keyword detection often requires handling of diverse content, we propose a novel supervised keyword extraction approach based on the mixture of experts (MoE) technique. MoE uses a learnable routing sub-network to direct information to specialised experts, allowing them to specialize in distinct regions of the input space. SEKE, a mixture of Specialised Experts for supervised Keyword Extraction, uses DeBERTa as the backbone model and builds on the MoE framework, where experts attend to each token, by integrating it with a recurrent neural network (RNN), to allow successful extraction even on smaller corpora, where specialisation is harder due to lack of training data. The MoE framework also provides an insight into inner workings of individual experts, enhancing the explainability of the approach. We benchmark SEKE on multiple English datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to strong supervised and unsupervised baselines. Our analysis reveals that depending on data size and type, experts specialize in distinct syntactic and semantic components, such as punctuation, stopwords, parts-of-speech, or named entities.

Compositional Generalization Across Distributional Shifts with Sparse Tree Operations,"Paul Soulos, Henry Conklin, Mattia Opper, Paul Smolensky, Jianfeng Gao, Roland Fernandez","Neural networks continue to struggle with compositional generalization, and this issue is exacerbated by a lack of massive pre-training. One successful approach for developing neural systems which exhibit human-like compositional generalization is \textit{hybrid} neurosymbolic techniques. However, these techniques run into the core issues that plague symbolic approaches to AI: scalability and flexibility. The reason for this failure is that at their core, hybrid neurosymbolic models perform symbolic computation and relegate the scalable and flexible neural computation to parameterizing a symbolic system. We investigate a \textit{unified} neurosymbolic system where transformations in the network can be interpreted simultaneously as both symbolic and neural computation. We extend a unified neurosymbolic architecture called the Differentiable Tree Machine in two central ways. First, we significantly increase the model's efficiency through the use of sparse vector representations of symbolic structures. Second, we enable its application beyond the restricted set of tree2tree problems to the more general class of seq2seq problems. The improved model retains its prior generalization capabilities and, since there is a fully neural path through the network, avoids the pitfalls of other neurosymbolic techniques that elevate symbolic computation over neural computation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14076v1,2024-12
"A Review of Multimodal Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Past, Present and Future","Shilin Sun, Wenbin An, Feng Tian, Fang Nan, Qidong Liu, Jun Liu, Nazaraf Shah, Ping Chen","Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly developed through advancements in computational power and the growth of massive datasets. However, this progress has also heightened challenges in interpreting the ""black-box"" nature of AI models. To address these concerns, eXplainable AI (XAI) has emerged with a focus on transparency and interpretability to enhance human understanding and trust in AI decision-making processes. In the context of multimodal data fusion and complex reasoning scenarios, the proposal of Multimodal eXplainable AI (MXAI) integrates multiple modalities for prediction and explanation tasks. Meanwhile, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to remarkable breakthroughs in natural language processing, yet their complexity has further exacerbated the issue of MXAI. To gain key insights into the development of MXAI methods and provide crucial guidance for building more transparent, fair, and trustworthy AI systems, we review the MXAI methods from a historical perspective and categorize them across four eras: traditional machine learning, deep learning, discriminative foundation models, and generative LLMs. We also review evaluation metrics and datasets used in MXAI research, concluding with a discussion of future challenges and directions. A project related to this review has been created at https://github.com/ShilinSun/mxai_review.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14056v1,2024-12
Digestion Algorithm in Hierarchical Symbolic Forests: A Fast Text Normalization Algorithm and Semantic Parsing Framework for Specific Scenarios and Lightweight Deployment,Kevin You,"Text Normalization and Semantic Parsing have numerous applications in natural language processing, such as natural language programming, paraphrasing, data augmentation, constructing expert systems, text matching, and more. Despite the prominent achievements of deep learning in Large Language Models (LLMs), the interpretability of neural network architectures is still poor, which affects their credibility and hence limits the deployments of risk-sensitive scenarios. In certain scenario-specific domains with scarce data, rapidly obtaining a large number of supervised learning labels is challenging, and the workload of manually labeling data would be enormous. Catastrophic forgetting in neural networks further leads to low data utilization rates. In situations where swift responses are vital, the density of the model makes local deployment difficult and the response time long, which is not conducive to local applications of these fields. Inspired by the multiplication rule, a principle of combinatorial mathematics, and human thinking patterns, a multilayer framework along with its algorithm, the Digestion Algorithm in Hierarchical Symbolic Forests (DAHSF), is proposed to address these above issues, combining text normalization and semantic parsing workflows. The Chinese Scripting Language ""Fire Bunny Intelligent Development Platform V2.0"" is an important test and application of the technology discussed in this paper. DAHSF can run locally in scenario-specific domains on little datasets, with model size and memory usage optimized by at least two orders of magnitude, thus improving the execution speed, and possessing a promising optimization outlook.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14054v1,2024-12
Cross-Lingual Transfer of Debiasing and Detoxification in Multilingual LLMs: An Extensive Investigation,"Vera Neplenbroek, Arianna Bisazza, Raquel Fernández","Recent generative large language models (LLMs) show remarkable performance in non-English languages, but when prompted in those languages they tend to express higher harmful social biases and toxicity levels. Prior work has shown that finetuning on specialized datasets can mitigate this behavior, and doing so in English can transfer to other languages. In this work, we investigate the impact of different finetuning methods on the model's bias and toxicity, but also on its ability to produce fluent and diverse text. Our results show that finetuning on curated non-harmful text is more effective for mitigating bias, and finetuning on direct preference optimization (DPO) datasets is more effective for mitigating toxicity. The mitigation caused by applying these methods in English also transfers to non-English languages. We find evidence that the extent to which transfer takes place can be predicted by the amount of data in a given language present in the model's pretraining data. However, this transfer of bias and toxicity mitigation often comes at the expense of decreased language generation ability in non-English languages, highlighting the importance of developing language-specific bias and toxicity mitigation methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14050v2,2024-12
Hansel: Output Length Controlling Framework for Large Language Models,"Seoha Song, Junhyun Lee, Hyeonmok Ko","Despite the great success of large language models (LLMs), efficiently controlling the length of the output sequence still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Hansel, an efficient framework for length control in LLMs without affecting its generation ability. Hansel utilizes periodically outputted hidden special tokens to keep track of the remaining target length of the output sequence. Together with techniques to avoid abrupt termination of the output, this seemingly simple method proved to be efficient and versatile, while not harming the coherency and fluency of the generated text. The framework can be applied to any pre-trained LLMs during the finetuning stage of the model, regardless of its original positional encoding method. We demonstrate this by finetuning four different LLMs with Hansel and show that the mean absolute error of the output sequence decreases significantly in every model and dataset compared to the prompt-based length control finetuning. Moreover, the framework showed a substantially improved ability to extrapolate to target lengths unseen during finetuning, such as long dialog responses or extremely short summaries. This indicates that the model learns the general means of length control, rather than learning to match output lengths to those seen during training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14033v1,2024-12
Towards an optimised evaluation of teachers' discourse: The case of engaging messages,"Samuel Falcon, Jaime Leon","Evaluating teachers' skills is crucial for enhancing education quality and student outcomes. Teacher discourse, significantly influencing student performance, is a key component. However, coding this discourse can be laborious. This study addresses this issue by introducing a new methodology for optimising the assessment of teacher discourse. The research consisted of two studies, both within the framework of engaging messages used by secondary education teachers. The first study involved training two large language models on real-world examples from audio-recorded lessons over two academic years to identify and classify the engaging messages from the lessons' transcripts. This resulted in sensitivities of 84.31% and 91.11%, and specificities of 97.69% and 86.36% in identification and classification, respectively. The second study applied these models to transcripts of audio-recorded lessons from a third academic year to examine the frequency and distribution of message types by educational level and moment of the academic year. Results showed teachers predominantly use messages emphasising engagement benefits, linked to improved outcomes, while one-third highlighted non-engagement disadvantages, associated with increased anxiety. The use of engaging messages declined in Grade 12 and towards the academic year's end. These findings suggest potential interventions to optimise engaging message use, enhancing teaching quality and student outcomes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14011v2,2024-12
Cognition Chain for Explainable Psychological Stress Detection on Social Media,"Xin Wang, Boyan Gao, Yi Dai, Lei Cao, Liang Zhao, Yibo Yang, David Clifton","Stress is a pervasive global health issue that can lead to severe mental health problems. Early detection offers timely intervention and prevention of stress-related disorders. The current early detection models perform ""black box"" inference suffering from limited explainability and trust which blocks the real-world clinical application. Thanks to the generative properties introduced by the Large Language Models (LLMs), the decision and the prediction from such models are semi-interpretable through the corresponding description. However, the existing LLMs are mostly trained for general purposes without the guidance of psychological cognitive theory. To this end, we first highlight the importance of prior theory with the observation of performance boosted by the chain-of-thoughts tailored for stress detection. This method termed Cognition Chain explicates the generation of stress through a step-by-step cognitive perspective based on cognitive appraisal theory with a progress pipeline: Stimulus $\rightarrow$ Evaluation $\rightarrow$ Reaction $\rightarrow$ Stress State, guiding LLMs to provide comprehensive reasoning explanations. We further study the benefits brought by the proposed Cognition Chain format by utilising it as a synthetic dataset generation template for LLMs instruction-tuning and introduce CogInstruct, an instruction-tuning dataset for stress detection. This dataset is developed using a three-stage self-reflective annotation pipeline that enables LLMs to autonomously generate and refine instructional data. By instruction-tuning Llama3 with CogInstruct, we develop CogLLM, an explainable stress detection model. Evaluations demonstrate that CogLLM achieves outstanding performance while enhancing explainability. Our work contributes a novel approach by integrating cognitive theories into LLM reasoning processes, offering a promising direction for future explainable AI research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14009v1,2024-12
FarExStance: Explainable Stance Detection for Farsi,"Majid Zarharan, Maryam Hashemi, Malika Behroozrazegh, Sauleh Eetemadi, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar, Jennifer Foster","We introduce FarExStance, a new dataset for explainable stance detection in Farsi. Each instance in this dataset contains a claim, the stance of an article or social media post towards that claim, and an extractive explanation which provides evidence for the stance label. We compare the performance of a fine-tuned multilingual RoBERTa model to several large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and parameter-efficient fine-tuned settings on our new dataset. On stance detection, the most accurate models are the fine-tuned RoBERTa model, the LLM Aya-23-8B which has been fine-tuned using parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and few-shot Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Regarding the quality of the explanations, our automatic evaluation metrics indicate that few-shot GPT-4o generates the most coherent explanations, while our human evaluation reveals that the best Overall Explanation Score (OES) belongs to few-shot Claude-3.5-Sonnet. The fine-tuned Aya-32-8B model produced explanations most closely aligned with the reference explanations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14008v1,2024-12
What makes a good metric? Evaluating automatic metrics for text-to-image consistency,"Candace Ross, Melissa Hall, Adriana Romero Soriano, Adina Williams","Language models are increasingly being incorporated as components in larger AI systems for various purposes, from prompt optimization to automatic evaluation. In this work, we analyze the construct validity of four recent, commonly used methods for measuring text-to-image consistency - CLIPScore, TIFA, VPEval, and DSG - which rely on language models and/or VQA models as components. We define construct validity for text-image consistency metrics as a set of desiderata that text-image consistency metrics should have, and find that no tested metric satisfies all of them. We find that metrics lack sufficient sensitivity to language and visual properties. Next, we find that TIFA, VPEval and DSG contribute novel information above and beyond CLIPScore, but also that they correlate highly with each other. We also ablate different aspects of the text-image consistency metrics and find that not all model components are strictly necessary, also a symptom of insufficient sensitivity to visual information. Finally, we show that all three VQA-based metrics likely rely on familiar text shortcuts (such as yes-bias in QA) that call their aptitude as quantitative evaluations of model performance into question.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13989v1,2024-12
Channel Merging: Preserving Specialization for Merged Experts,"Mingyang Zhang, Jing Liu, Ganggui Ding, Xinyi Yu, Linlin Ou, Bohan Zhuang","Lately, the practice of utilizing task-specific fine-tuning has been implemented to improve the performance of large language models (LLM) in subsequent tasks. Through the integration of diverse LLMs, the overall competency of LLMs is significantly boosted. Nevertheless, traditional ensemble methods are notably memory-intensive, necessitating the simultaneous loading of all specialized models into GPU memory. To address the inefficiency, model merging strategies have emerged, merging all LLMs into one model to reduce the memory footprint during inference. Despite these advances, model merging often leads to parameter conflicts and performance decline as the number of experts increases. Previous methods to mitigate these conflicts include post-pruning and partial merging. However, both approaches have limitations, particularly in terms of performance and storage efficiency when merged experts increase. To address these challenges, we introduce Channel Merging, a novel strategy designed to minimize parameter conflicts while enhancing storage efficiency. This method clusters and merges channel parameters based on their similarity to form several groups offline. By ensuring that only highly similar parameters are merged within each group, it significantly reduces parameter conflicts. During inference, we can instantly look up the expert parameters from the merged groups, preserving specialized knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate that Channel Merging consistently delivers high performance, matching unmerged models in tasks like English and Chinese reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Moreover, it obtains results comparable to model ensemble with just 53% parameters when used with a task-specific router.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15283v1,2024-12
A Systematic Examination of Preference Learning through the Lens of Instruction-Following,"Joongwon Kim, Anirudh Goyal, Aston Zhang, Bo Xiong, Rui Hou, Melanie Kambadur, Dhruv Mahajan, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Liang Tan","Preference learning is a widely adopted post-training technique that aligns large language models (LLMs) to human preferences and improves specific downstream task capabilities. In this work we systematically investigate how specific attributes of preference datasets affect the alignment and downstream performance of LLMs in instruction-following tasks. We use a novel synthetic data generation pipeline to generate 48,000 unique instruction-following prompts with combinations of 23 verifiable constraints that enable fine-grained and automated quality assessments of model responses. With our synthetic prompts, we use two preference dataset curation methods - rejection sampling (RS) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) - to obtain pairs of (chosen, rejected) responses. Then, we perform experiments investigating the effects of (1) the presence of shared prefixes between the chosen and rejected responses, (2) the contrast and quality of the chosen, rejected responses and (3) the complexity of the training prompts. Our experiments reveal that shared prefixes in preference pairs, as generated by MCTS, provide marginal but consistent improvements and greater stability across challenging training configurations. High-contrast preference pairs generally outperform low-contrast pairs; however, combining both often yields the best performance by balancing diversity and learning efficiency. Additionally, training on prompts of moderate difficulty leads to better generalization across tasks, even for more complex evaluation scenarios, compared to overly challenging prompts. Our findings provide actionable insights into optimizing preference data curation for instruction-following tasks, offering a scalable and effective framework for enhancing LLM training and alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15282v1,2024-12
Prompting Strategies for Enabling Large Language Models to Infer Causation from Correlation,"Eleni Sgouritsa, Virginia Aglietti, Yee Whye Teh, Arnaud Doucet, Arthur Gretton, Silvia Chiappa","The reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are attracting increasing attention. In this work, we focus on causal reasoning and address the task of establishing causal relationships based on correlation information, a highly challenging problem on which several LLMs have shown poor performance. We introduce a prompting strategy for this problem that breaks the original task into fixed subquestions, with each subquestion corresponding to one step of a formal causal discovery algorithm, the PC algorithm. The proposed prompting strategy, PC-SubQ, guides the LLM to follow these algorithmic steps, by sequentially prompting it with one subquestion at a time, augmenting the next subquestion's prompt with the answer to the previous one(s). We evaluate our approach on an existing causal benchmark, Corr2Cause: our experiments indicate a performance improvement across five LLMs when comparing PC-SubQ to baseline prompting strategies. Results are robust to causal query perturbations, when modifying the variable names or paraphrasing the expressions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13952v1,2024-12
Cracking the Code of Hallucination in LVLMs with Vision-aware Head Divergence,"Jinghan He, Kuan Zhu, Haiyun Guo, Junfeng Fang, Zhenglin Hua, Yuheng Jia, Ming Tang, Tat-Seng Chua, Jinqiao Wang","Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in integrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced multimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13949v2,2024-12
A Rose by Any Other Name: LLM-Generated Explanations Are Good Proxies for Human Explanations to Collect Label Distributions on NLI,"Beiduo Chen, Siyao Peng, Anna Korhonen, Barbara Plank","Disagreement in human labeling is ubiquitous, and can be captured in human judgment distributions (HJDs). Recent research has shown that explanations provide valuable information for understanding human label variation (HLV) and large language models (LLMs) can approximate HJD from a few human-provided label-explanation pairs. However, collecting explanations for every label is still time-consuming. This paper examines whether LLMs can be used to replace humans in generating explanations for approximating HJD. Specifically, we use LLMs as annotators to generate model explanations for a few given human labels. We test ways to obtain and combine these label-explanations with the goal to approximate human judgment distribution. We further compare the resulting human with model-generated explanations, and test automatic and human explanation selection. Our experiments show that LLM explanations are promising for NLI: to estimate HJD, generated explanations yield comparable results to human's when provided with human labels. Importantly, our results generalize from datasets with human explanations to i) datasets where they are not available and ii) challenging out-of-distribution test sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13942v1,2024-12
Language verY Rare for All,"Ibrahim Merad, Amos Wolf, Ziad Mazzawi, Yannick Léo","In the quest to overcome language barriers, encoder-decoder models like NLLB have expanded machine translation to rare languages, with some models (e.g., NLLB 1.3B) even trainable on a single GPU. While general-purpose LLMs perform well in translation, open LLMs prove highly competitive when fine-tuned for specific tasks involving unknown corpora. We introduce LYRA (Language verY Rare for All), a novel approach that combines open LLM fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and transfer learning from related high-resource languages. This study is exclusively focused on single-GPU training to facilitate ease of adoption. Our study focuses on two-way translation between French and Mon\'egasque, a rare language unsupported by existing translation tools due to limited corpus availability. Our results demonstrate LYRA's effectiveness, frequently surpassing and consistently matching state-of-the-art encoder-decoder models in rare language translation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13924v1,2024-12
Pipeline Analysis for Developing Instruct LLMs in Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study on Basque,"Ander Corral, Ixak Sarasua, Xabier Saralegi","Large language models (LLMs) are typically optimized for resource-rich languages like English, exacerbating the gap between high-resource and underrepresented languages. This work presents a detailed analysis of strategies for developing a model capable of following instructions in a low-resource language, specifically Basque, by focusing on three key stages: pre-training, instruction tuning, and alignment with human preferences. Our findings demonstrate that continual pre-training with a high-quality Basque corpus of around 600 million words improves natural language understanding (NLU) of the foundational model by over 12 points. Moreover, instruction tuning and human preference alignment using automatically translated datasets proved highly effective, resulting in a 24-point improvement in instruction-following performance. The resulting models, Llama-eus-8B and Llama-eus-8B-instruct, establish a new state-of-the-art for Basque in the sub-10B parameter category.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13922v1,2024-12
Understanding and Analyzing Model Robustness and Knowledge-Transfer in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation using TX-Ray,"Vageesh Saxena, Sharid Loáiciga, Nils Rethmeier","Neural networks have demonstrated significant advancements in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) compared to conventional phrase-based approaches. However, Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT) in extremely low-resource settings remains underexplored. This research investigates how knowledge transfer across languages can enhance MNMT in such scenarios. Using the Tatoeba translation challenge dataset from Helsinki NLP, we perform English-German, English-French, and English-Spanish translations, leveraging minimal parallel data to establish cross-lingual mappings. Unlike conventional methods relying on extensive pre-training for specific language pairs, we pre-train our model on English-English translations, setting English as the source language for all tasks. The model is fine-tuned on target language pairs using joint multi-task and sequential transfer learning strategies. Our work addresses three key questions: (1) How can knowledge transfer across languages improve MNMT in extremely low-resource scenarios? (2) How does pruning neuron knowledge affect model generalization, robustness, and catastrophic forgetting? (3) How can TX-Ray interpret and quantify knowledge transfer in trained models? Evaluation using BLEU-4 scores demonstrates that sequential transfer learning outperforms baselines on a 40k parallel sentence corpus, showcasing its efficacy. However, pruning neuron knowledge degrades performance, increases catastrophic forgetting, and fails to improve robustness or generalization. Our findings provide valuable insights into the potential and limitations of knowledge transfer and pruning in MNMT for extremely low-resource settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13881v1,2024-12
Crabs: Consuming Resrouce via Auto-generation for LLM-DoS Attack under Black-box Settings,"Yuanhe Zhang, Zhenhong Zhou, Wei Zhang, Xinyue Wang, Xiaojun Jia, Yang Liu, Sen Su","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. LLMs continue to be vulnerable to external threats, particularly Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Specifically, LLM-DoS attacks aim to exhaust computational resources and block services. However, prior works tend to focus on performing white-box attacks, overlooking black-box settings. In this work, we propose an automated algorithm designed for black-box LLMs, called Auto-Generation for LLM-DoS Attack (AutoDoS). AutoDoS introduces DoS Attack Tree and optimizes the prompt node coverage to enhance effectiveness under black-box conditions. Our method can bypass existing defense with enhanced stealthiness via semantic improvement of prompt nodes. Furthermore, we reveal that implanting Length Trojan in Basic DoS Prompt aids in achieving higher attack efficacy. Experimental results show that AutoDoS amplifies service response latency by over 250 $\times \uparrow$, leading to severe resource consumption in terms of GPU utilization and memory usage.

Energy-Based Preference Model Offers Better Offline Alignment than the Bradley-Terry Preference Model,"Yuzhong Hong, Hanshan Zhang, Junwei Bao, Hongfei Jiang, Yang Song","Since the debut of DPO, it has been shown that aligning a target LLM with human preferences via the KL-constrained RLHF loss is mathematically equivalent to a special kind of reward modeling task. Concretely, the task requires: 1) using the target LLM to parameterize the reward model, and 2) tuning the reward model so that it has a 1:1 linear relationship with the true reward. However, we identify a significant issue: the DPO loss might have multiple minimizers, of which only one satisfies the required linearity condition. The problem arises from a well-known issue of the underlying Bradley-Terry preference model: it does not always have a unique maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Consequently,the minimizer of the RLHF loss might be unattainable because it is merely one among many minimizers of the DPO loss. As a better alternative, we propose an energy-based model (EBM) that always has a unique MLE, inherently satisfying the linearity requirement. To approximate the MLE in practice, we propose a contrastive loss named Energy Preference Alignment (EPA), wherein each positive sample is contrasted against one or more strong negatives as well as many free weak negatives. Theoretical properties of our EBM enable the approximation error of EPA to almost surely vanish when a sufficient number of negatives are used. Empirically, we demonstrate that EPA consistently delivers better performance on open benchmarks compared to DPO, thereby showing the superiority of our EBM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13862v1,2024-12
Domain-adaptative Continual Learning for Low-resource Tasks: Evaluation on Nepali,"Sharad Duwal, Suraj Prasai, Suresh Manandhar","Continual learning has emerged as an important research direction due to the infeasibility of retraining large language models (LLMs) from scratch in the event of new data availability. Of great interest is the domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) paradigm, which focuses on continually training a pre-trained language model to adapt it to a domain it was not originally trained on. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of DAPT in a low-resource setting, namely the Nepali language. We use synthetic data to continue training Llama 3 8B to adapt it to the Nepali language in a 4-bit QLoRA setting. We evaluate the adapted model on its performance, forgetting, and knowledge acquisition. We compare the base model and the final model on their Nepali generation abilities, their performance on popular benchmarks, and run case-studies to probe their linguistic knowledge in Nepali. We see some unsurprising forgetting in the final model, but also surprisingly find that increasing the number of shots during evaluation yields better percent increases in the final model (as high as 19.29% increase) compared to the base model (4.98%), suggesting latent retention. We also explore layer-head self-attention heatmaps to establish dependency resolution abilities of the final model in Nepali.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13860v1,2024-12
RACQUET: Unveiling the Dangers of Overlooked Referential Ambiguity in Visual LLMs,"Alberto Testoni, Barbara Plank, Raquel Fernández","Ambiguity resolution is key to effective communication. While humans effortlessly address ambiguity through conversational grounding strategies, the extent to which current language models can emulate these strategies remains unclear. In this work, we examine referential ambiguity in image-based question answering by introducing RACQUET, a carefully curated dataset targeting distinct aspects of ambiguity. Through a series of evaluations, we reveal significant limitations and problems of overconfidence of state-of-the-art large multimodal language models in addressing ambiguity in their responses. The overconfidence issue becomes particularly relevant for RACQUET-BIAS, a subset designed to analyze a critical yet underexplored problem: failing to address ambiguity leads to stereotypical, socially biased responses. Our results underscore the urgency of equipping models with robust strategies to deal with uncertainty without resorting to undesirable stereotypes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13835v1,2024-12
Enhancing Rhetorical Figure Annotation: An Ontology-Based Web Application with RAG Integration,"Ramona Kühn, Jelena Mitrović, Michael Granitzer","Rhetorical figures play an important role in our communication. They are used to convey subtle, implicit meaning, or to emphasize statements. We notice them in hate speech, fake news, and propaganda. By improving the systems for computational detection of rhetorical figures, we can also improve tasks such as hate speech and fake news detection, sentiment analysis, opinion mining, or argument mining. Unfortunately, there is a lack of annotated data, as well as qualified annotators that would help us build large corpora to train machine learning models for the detection of rhetorical figures. The situation is particularly difficult in languages other than English, and for rhetorical figures other than metaphor, sarcasm, and irony. To overcome this issue, we develop a web application called ""Find your Figure"" that facilitates the identification and annotation of German rhetorical figures. The application is based on the German Rhetorical ontology GRhOOT which we have specially adapted for this purpose. In addition, we improve the user experience with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this paper, we present the restructuring of the ontology, the development of the web application, and the built-in RAG pipeline. We also identify the optimal RAG settings for our application. Our approach is one of the first to practically use rhetorical ontologies in combination with RAG and shows promising results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13799v1,2024-12
MATCHED: Multimodal Authorship-Attribution To Combat Human Trafficking in Escort-Advertisement Data,"Vageesh Saxena, Benjamin Bashpole, Gijs Van Dijck, Gerasimos Spanakis","Human trafficking (HT) remains a critical issue, with traffickers increasingly leveraging online escort advertisements (ads) to advertise victims anonymously. Existing detection methods, including Authorship Attribution (AA), often center on text-based analyses and neglect the multimodal nature of online escort ads, which typically pair text with images. To address this gap, we introduce MATCHED, a multimodal dataset of 27,619 unique text descriptions and 55,115 unique images collected from the Backpage escort platform across seven U.S. cities in four geographical regions. Our study extensively benchmarks text-only, vision-only, and multimodal baselines for vendor identification and verification tasks, employing multitask (joint) training objectives that achieve superior classification and retrieval performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Integrating multimodal features further enhances this performance, capturing complementary patterns across text and images. While text remains the dominant modality, visual data adds stylistic cues that enrich model performance. Moreover, text-image alignment strategies like CLIP and BLIP2 struggle due to low semantic overlap and vague connections between the modalities of escort ads, with end-to-end multimodal training proving more robust. Our findings emphasize the potential of multimodal AA (MAA) to combat HT, providing LEAs with robust tools to link ads and disrupt trafficking networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13794v1,2024-12
Physics Reasoner: Knowledge-Augmented Reasoning for Solving Physics Problems with Large Language Models,"Xinyu Pang, Ruixin Hong, Zhanke Zhou, Fangrui Lv, Xinwei Yang, Zhilong Liang, Bo Han, Changshui Zhang","Physics problems constitute a significant aspect of reasoning, necessitating complicated reasoning ability and abundant physics knowledge. However, existing large language models (LLMs) frequently fail due to a lack of knowledge or incorrect knowledge application. To mitigate these issues, we propose Physics Reasoner, a knowledge-augmented framework to solve physics problems with LLMs. Specifically, the proposed framework constructs a comprehensive formula set to provide explicit physics knowledge and utilizes checklists containing detailed instructions to guide effective knowledge application. Namely, given a physics problem, Physics Reasoner solves it through three stages: problem analysis, formula retrieval, and guided reasoning. During the process, checklists are employed to enhance LLMs' self-improvement in the analysis and reasoning stages. Empirically, Physics Reasoner mitigates the issues of insufficient knowledge and incorrect application, achieving state-of-the-art performance on SciBench with an average accuracy improvement of 5.8%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13791v1,2024-12
Open Universal Arabic ASR Leaderboard,"Yingzhi Wang, Anas Alhmoud, Muhammad Alqurishi","In recent years, the enhanced capabilities of ASR models and the emergence of multi-dialect datasets have increasingly pushed Arabic ASR model development toward an all-dialect-in-one direction. This trend highlights the need for benchmarking studies that evaluate model performance on multiple dialects, providing the community with insights into models' generalization capabilities.   In this paper, we introduce Open Universal Arabic ASR Leaderboard, a continuous benchmark project for open-source general Arabic ASR models across various multi-dialect datasets. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the model's robustness, speaker adaptation, inference efficiency, and memory consumption. This work aims to offer the Arabic ASR community a reference for models' general performance and also establish a common evaluation framework for multi-dialectal Arabic ASR models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13788v1,2024-12
Knowledge Editing with Dynamic Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Hop Question Answering,"Yifan Lu, Yigeng Zhou, Jing Li, Yequan Wang, Xuebo Liu, Daojing He, Fangming Liu, Min Zhang","Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the extensive knowledge demands involved. Knowledge editing, which aims to precisely modify the LLMs to incorporate specific knowledge without negatively impacting other unrelated knowledge, offers a potential solution for addressing MHQA challenges with LLMs. However, current solutions struggle to effectively resolve issues of knowledge conflicts. Most parameter-preserving editing methods are hindered by inaccurate retrieval and overlook secondary editing issues, which can introduce noise into the reasoning process of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce KEDKG, a novel knowledge editing method that leverages a dynamic knowledge graph for MHQA, designed to ensure the reliability of answers. KEDKG involves two primary steps: dynamic knowledge graph construction and knowledge graph augmented generation. Initially, KEDKG autonomously constructs a dynamic knowledge graph to store revised information while resolving potential knowledge conflicts. Subsequently, it employs a fine-grained retrieval strategy coupled with an entity and relation detector to enhance the accuracy of graph retrieval for LLM generation. Experimental results on benchmarks show that KEDKG surpasses previous state-of-the-art models, delivering more accurate and reliable answers in environments with dynamic information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13782v2,2024-12
Meta-Reflection: A Feedback-Free Reflection Learning Framework,"Yaoke Wang, Yun Zhu, Xintong Bao, Wenqiao Zhang, Suyang Dai, Kehan Chen, Wenqiang Li, Gang Huang, Siliang Tang, Yueting Zhuang","Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in natural language understanding and reasoning, they often display undesirable behaviors, such as generating hallucinations and unfaithful reasoning. A prevalent strategy to mitigate these issues is the use of reflection, which refines responses through an iterative process. However, while promising, reflection heavily relies on high-quality external feedback and requires iterative multi-agent inference processes, thus hindering its practical application. In this paper, we propose Meta-Reflection, a novel feedback-free reflection mechanism that necessitates only a single inference pass without external feedback. Motivated by the human ability to remember and retrieve reflections from past experiences when encountering similar problems, Meta-Reflection integrates reflective insights into a codebook, allowing the historical insights to be stored, retrieved, and used to guide LLMs in problem-solving. To thoroughly investigate and evaluate the practicality of Meta-Reflection in real-world scenarios, we introduce an industrial e-commerce benchmark named E-commerce Customer Intent Detection (ECID). Extensive experiments conducted on both public datasets and the ECID benchmark highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13781v1,2024-12
Semantic Convergence: Harmonizing Recommender Systems via Two-Stage Alignment and Behavioral Semantic Tokenization,"Guanghan Li, Xun Zhang, Yufei Zhang, Yifan Yin, Guojun Yin, Wei Lin","Large language models (LLMs), endowed with exceptional reasoning capabilities, are adept at discerning profound user interests from historical behaviors, thereby presenting a promising avenue for the advancement of recommendation systems. However, a notable discrepancy persists between the sparse collaborative semantics typically found in recommendation systems and the dense token representations within LLMs. In our study, we propose a novel framework that harmoniously merges traditional recommendation models with the prowess of LLMs. We initiate this integration by transforming ItemIDs into sequences that align semantically with the LLMs space, through the proposed Alignment Tokenization module. Additionally, we design a series of specialized supervised learning tasks aimed at aligning collaborative signals with the subtleties of natural language semantics. To ensure practical applicability, we optimize online inference by pre-caching the top-K results for each user, reducing latency and improving effciency. Extensive experimental evidence indicates that our model markedly improves recall metrics and displays remarkable scalability of recommendation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13771v1,2024-12
LLM-SEM: A Sentiment-Based Student Engagement Metric Using LLMS for E-Learning Platforms,"Ali Hamdi, Ahmed Abdelmoneim Mazrou, Mohamed Shaltout","Current methods for analyzing student engagement in e-learning platforms, including automated systems, often struggle with challenges such as handling fuzzy sentiment in text comments and relying on limited metadata. Traditional approaches, such as surveys and questionnaires, also face issues like small sample sizes and scalability. In this paper, we introduce LLM-SEM (Language Model-Based Student Engagement Metric), a novel approach that leverages video metadata and sentiment analysis of student comments to measure engagement. By utilizing recent Large Language Models (LLMs), we generate high-quality sentiment predictions to mitigate text fuzziness and normalize key features such as views and likes. Our holistic method combines comprehensive metadata with sentiment polarity scores to gauge engagement at both the course and lesson levels. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate various LLM models, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-SEM in providing a scalable and accurate measure of student engagement. We fine-tuned TXLM-RoBERTa using human-annotated sentiment datasets to enhance prediction accuracy and utilized LLama 3B, and Gemma 9B from Ollama.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13765v2,2024-12
RAG-RewardBench: Benchmarking Reward Models in Retrieval Augmented Generation for Preference Alignment,"Zhuoran Jin, Hongbang Yuan, Tianyi Men, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","Despite the significant progress made by existing retrieval augmented language models (RALMs) in providing trustworthy responses and grounding in reliable sources, they often overlook effective alignment with human preferences. In the alignment process, reward models (RMs) act as a crucial proxy for human values to guide optimization. However, it remains unclear how to evaluate and select a reliable RM for preference alignment in RALMs. To this end, we propose RAG-RewardBench, the first benchmark for evaluating RMs in RAG settings. First, we design four crucial and challenging RAG-specific scenarios to assess RMs, including multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstain, and conflict robustness. Then, we incorporate 18 RAG subsets, six retrievers, and 24 RALMs to increase the diversity of data sources. Finally, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge approach to improve preference annotation efficiency and effectiveness, exhibiting a strong correlation with human annotations. Based on the RAG-RewardBench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 45 RMs and uncover their limitations in RAG scenarios. Additionally, we also reveal that existing trained RALMs show almost no improvement in preference alignment, highlighting the need for a shift towards preference-aligned training.We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jinzhuoran/RAG-RewardBench/ for future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13746v1,2024-12
Learning Complex Word Embeddings in Classical and Quantum Spaces,"Carys Harvey, Stephen Clark, Douglas Brown, Konstantinos Meichanetzidis","We present a variety of methods for training complex-valued word embeddings, based on the classical Skip-gram model, with a straightforward adaptation simply replacing the real-valued vectors with arbitrary vectors of complex numbers. In a more ""physically-inspired"" approach, the vectors are produced by parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs), which are unitary transformations resulting in normalised vectors which have a probabilistic interpretation. We develop a complex-valued version of the highly optimised C code version of Skip-gram, which allows us to easily produce complex embeddings trained on a 3.8B-word corpus for a vocabulary size of over 400k, for which we are then able to train a separate PQC for each word. We evaluate the complex embeddings on a set of standard similarity and relatedness datasets, for some models obtaining results competitive with the classical baseline. We find that, while training the PQCs directly tends to harm performance, the quantum word embeddings from the two-stage process perform as well as the classical Skip-gram embeddings with comparable numbers of parameters. This enables a highly scalable route to learning embeddings in complex spaces which scales with the size of the vocabulary rather than the size of the training corpus. In summary, we demonstrate how to produce a large set of high-quality word embeddings for use in complex-valued and quantum-inspired NLP models, and for exploring potential advantage in quantum NLP models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13745v1,2024-12

Leveraging the inherent advantages of federated learning, such as preserving data privacy and enabling distributed computation, this research explores the integration of RAG systems with models trained under varying client configurations to optimize performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the federated learning-based models integrated with RAG systems consistently outperform their non-integrated counterparts across all evaluation metrics. This study highlights the potential of combining federated learning and RAG systems for developing domain-specific LLMs in the medical field, providing a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for enhancing text generation capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13720v2,2024-12
Towards Automatic Evaluation for Image Transcreation,"Simran Khanuja, Vivek Iyer, Claire He, Graham Neubig","Beyond conventional paradigms of translating speech and text, recently, there has been interest in automated transcreation of images to facilitate localization of visual content across different cultures. Attempts to define this as a formal Machine Learning (ML) problem have been impeded by the lack of automatic evaluation mechanisms, with previous work relying solely on human evaluation. In this paper, we seek to close this gap by proposing a suite of automatic evaluation metrics inspired by machine translation (MT) metrics, categorized into: a) Object-based, b) Embedding-based, and c) VLM-based. Drawing on theories from translation studies and real-world transcreation practices, we identify three critical dimensions of image transcreation: cultural relevance, semantic equivalence and visual similarity, and design our metrics to evaluate systems along these axes. Our results show that proprietary VLMs best identify cultural relevance and semantic equivalence, while vision-encoder representations are adept at measuring visual similarity. Meta-evaluation across 7 countries shows our metrics agree strongly with human ratings, with average segment-level correlations ranging from 0.55-0.87. Finally, through a discussion of the merits and demerits of each metric, we offer a robust framework for automated image transcreation evaluation, grounded in both theoretical foundations and practical application.

Mitigating Adversarial Attacks in LLMs through Defensive Suffix Generation,"Minkyoung Kim, Yunha Kim, Hyeram Seo, Heejung Choi, Jiye Han, Gaeun Kee, Soyoung Ko, HyoJe Jung, Byeolhee Kim, Young-Hak Kim, Sanghyun Park, Tae Joon Jun","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited outstanding performance in natural language processing tasks. However, these models remain susceptible to adversarial attacks in which slight input perturbations can lead to harmful or misleading outputs. A gradient-based defensive suffix generation algorithm is designed to bolster the robustness of LLMs. By appending carefully optimized defensive suffixes to input prompts, the algorithm mitigates adversarial influences while preserving the models' utility. To enhance adversarial understanding, a novel total loss function ($L_{\text{total}}$) combining defensive loss ($L_{\text{def}}$) and adversarial loss ($L_{\text{adv}}$) generates defensive suffixes more effectively. Experimental evaluations conducted on open-source LLMs such as Gemma-7B, mistral-7B, Llama2-7B, and Llama2-13B show that the proposed method reduces attack success rates (ASR) by an average of 11\% compared to models without defensive suffixes. Additionally, the perplexity score of Gemma-7B decreased from 6.57 to 3.93 when applying the defensive suffix generated by openELM-270M. Furthermore, TruthfulQA evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements with Truthfulness scores increasing by up to 10\% across tested configurations. This approach significantly enhances the security of LLMs in critical applications without requiring extensive retraining.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13705v1,2024-12

We employ post-training techniques to enhance Thai language performance while preserving the base models' original capabilities. We release text models across a range of sizes, from 1 to 70 billion parameters, available in both base and instruction-tuned variants.

Towards Efficient and Explainable Hate Speech Detection via Model Distillation,"Paloma Piot, Javier Parapar","Automatic detection of hate and abusive language is essential to combat its online spread. Moreover, recognising and explaining hate speech serves to educate people about its negative effects. However, most current detection models operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability and explainability. In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective for hate speech detection and to promote interpretability. Nevertheless, they are computationally costly to run. In this work, we propose distilling big language models by using Chain-of-Thought to extract explanations that support the hate speech classification task. Having small language models for these tasks will contribute to their use in operational settings. In this paper, we demonstrate that distilled models deliver explanations of the same quality as larger models while surpassing them in classification performance. This dual capability, classifying and explaining, advances hate speech detection making it more affordable, understandable and actionable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13698v1,2024-12
Discerning and Characterising Types of Competency Questions for Ontologies,"C. Maria Keet, Zubeida Casmod Khan","Competency Questions (CQs) are widely used in ontology development by guiding, among others, the scoping and validation stages. However, very limited guidance exists for formulating CQs and assessing whether they are good CQs, leading to issues such as ambiguity and unusable formulations. To solve this, one requires insight into the nature of CQs for ontologies and their constituent parts, as well as which ones are not. We aim to contribute to such theoretical foundations in this paper, which is informed by analysing questions, their uses, and the myriad of ontology development tasks. This resulted in a first Model for Competency Questions, which comprises five main types of CQs, each with a different purpose: Scoping (SCQ), Validating (VCQ), Foundational (FCQ), Relationship (RCQ), and Metaproperty (MpCQ) questions. This model enhances the clarity of CQs and therewith aims to improve on the effectiveness of CQs in ontology development, thanks to their respective identifiable distinct constituent elements. We illustrate and evaluate them with a user story and demonstrate where which type can be used in ontology development tasks. To foster use and research, we created an annotated repository of 438 CQs, the Repository of Ontology Competency QuestionS (ROCQS), incorporating an existing CQ dataset and new CQs and CQ templates, which further demonstrate distinctions among types of CQs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13688v1,2024-12
ChinaTravel: A Real-World Benchmark for Language Agents in Chinese Travel Planning,"Jie-Jing Shao, Xiao-Wen Yang, Bo-Wen Zhang, Baizhi Chen, Wen-Da Wei, Guohao Cai, Zhenhua Dong, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-feng Li","Recent advances in LLMs, particularly in language reasoning and tool integration, have rapidly sparked the real-world development of Language Agents. Among these, travel planning represents a prominent domain, combining academic challenges with practical value due to its complexity and market demand. However, existing benchmarks fail to reflect the diverse, real-world requirements crucial for deployment. To address this gap, we introduce ChinaTravel, a benchmark specifically designed for authentic Chinese travel planning scenarios. We collect the travel requirements from questionnaires and propose a compositionally generalizable domain-specific language that enables a scalable evaluation process, covering feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and preference comparison. Empirical studies reveal the potential of neuro-symbolic agents in travel planning, achieving a constraint satisfaction rate of 27.9%, significantly surpassing purely neural models at 2.6%. Moreover, we identify key challenges in real-world travel planning deployments, including open language reasoning and unseen concept composition. These findings highlight the significance of ChinaTravel as a pivotal milestone for advancing language agents in complex, real-world planning scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13682v2,2024-12

While model providers in theory have a window into this impact via their users' data, both privacy concerns and practical challenges have made analyzing this data difficult. To address these issues, we present Clio (Claude insights and observations), a privacy-preserving platform that uses AI assistants themselves to analyze and surface aggregated usage patterns across millions of conversations, without the need for human reviewers to read raw conversations. We validate this can be done with a high degree of accuracy and privacy by conducting extensive evaluations. We demonstrate Clio's usefulness in two broad ways. First, we share insights about how models are being used in the real world from one million Claude.ai Free and Pro conversations, ranging from providing advice on hairstyles to providing guidance on Git operations and concepts. We also identify the most common high-level use cases on Claude.ai (coding, writing, and research tasks) as well as patterns that differ across languages (e.g., conversations in Japanese discuss elder care and aging populations at higher-than-typical rates). Second, we use Clio to make our systems safer by identifying coordinated attempts to abuse our systems, monitoring for unknown unknowns during critical periods like launches of new capabilities or major world events, and improving our existing monitoring systems. We also discuss the limitations of our approach, as well as risks and ethical concerns. By enabling analysis of real-world AI usage, Clio provides a scalable platform for empirically grounded AI safety and governance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13678v1,2024-12
AntiLeak-Bench: Preventing Data Contamination by Automatically Constructing Benchmarks with Updated Real-World Knowledge,"Xiaobao Wu, Liangming Pan, Yuxi Xie, Ruiwen Zhou, Shuai Zhao, Yubo Ma, Mingzhe Du, Rui Mao, Anh Tuan Luu, William Yang Wang","Data contamination hinders fair LLM evaluation by introducing test data into newer models' training sets. Existing studies solve this challenge by updating benchmarks with newly collected data. However, they fail to guarantee contamination-free evaluation as the newly collected data may contain pre-existing knowledge, and their benchmark updates rely on intensive human labor. To address these issues, we in this paper propose AntiLeak-Bench, an automated anti-leakage benchmarking framework. Instead of simply using newly collected data, we construct samples with explicitly new knowledge absent from LLMs' training sets, which thus ensures strictly contamination-free evaluation. We further design a fully automated workflow to build and update our benchmark without human labor. This significantly reduces the cost of benchmark maintenance to accommodate emerging LLMs. Through extensive experiments, we highlight that data contamination likely exists before LLMs' cutoff time and demonstrate AntiLeak-Bench effectively overcomes this challenge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13670v1,2024-12
Evaluation of LLM Vulnerabilities to Being Misused for Personalized Disinformation Generation,"Aneta Zugecova, Dominik Macko, Ivan Srba, Robert Moro, Jakub Kopal, Katarina Marcincinova, Matus Mesarcik","The capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality content indistinguishable by humans from human-written texts rises many concerns regarding their misuse. Previous research has shown that LLMs can be effectively misused for generating disinformation news articles following predefined narratives. Their capabilities to generate personalized (in various aspects) content have also been evaluated and mostly found usable. However, a combination of personalization and disinformation abilities of LLMs has not been comprehensively studied yet. Such a dangerous combination should trigger integrated safety filters of the LLMs, if there are some. This study fills this gap by evaluation of vulnerabilities of recent open and closed LLMs, and their willingness to generate personalized disinformation news articles in English. We further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the personalization quality and whether the personalization affects the generated-texts detectability. Our results demonstrate the need for stronger safety-filters and disclaimers, as those are not properly functioning in most of the evaluated LLMs. Additionally, our study revealed that the personalization actually reduces the safety-filter activations; thus effectively functioning as a jailbreak. Such behavior must be urgently addressed by LLM developers and service providers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13666v1,2024-12

PsyDT: Using LLMs to Construct the Digital Twin of Psychological Counselor with Personalized Counseling Style for Psychological Counseling,"Haojie Xie, Yirong Chen, Xiaofen Xing, Jingkai Lin, Xiangmin Xu","Currently, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in the field of psychological counseling. However, existing mental health LLMs overlook a critical issue where they do not consider the fact that different psychological counselors exhibit different personal styles, including linguistic style and therapy techniques, etc. As a result, these LLMs fail to satisfy the individual needs of clients who seek different counseling styles. To help bridge this gap, we propose PsyDT, a novel framework using LLMs to construct the Digital Twin of Psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Compared to the time-consuming and costly approach of collecting a large number of real-world counseling cases to create a specific counselor's digital twin, our framework offers a faster and more cost-effective solution. To construct PsyDT, we utilize dynamic one-shot learning by using GPT-4 to capture counselor's unique counseling style, mainly focusing on linguistic style and therapy techniques. Subsequently, using existing single-turn long-text dialogues with client's questions, GPT-4 is guided to synthesize multi-turn dialogues of specific counselor. Finally, we fine-tune the LLMs on the synthetic dataset, PsyDTCorpus, to achieve the digital twin of psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Experimental results indicate that our proposed PsyDT framework can synthesize multi-turn dialogues that closely resemble real-world counseling cases and demonstrate better performance compared to other baselines, thereby show that our framework can effectively construct the digital twin of psychological counselor with a specific counseling style.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13660v1,2024-12
SCOPE: Optimizing Key-Value Cache Compression in Long-context Generation,"Jialong Wu, Zhenglin Wang, Linhai Zhang, Yilong Lai, Yulan He, Deyu Zhou","Key-Value (KV) cache has become a bottleneck of LLMs for long-context generation. Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13649v1,2024-12
G-VEval: A Versatile Metric for Evaluating Image and Video Captions Using GPT-4o,"Tony Cheng Tong, Sirui He, Zhiwen Shao, Dit-Yan Yeung","Evaluation metric of visual captioning is important yet not thoroughly explored. Traditional metrics like BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROUGE often miss semantic depth, while trained metrics such as CLIP-Score, PAC-S, and Polos are limited in zero-shot scenarios. Advanced Language Model-based metrics also struggle with aligning to nuanced human preferences. To address these issues, we introduce G-VEval, a novel metric inspired by G-Eval and powered by the new GPT-4o. G-VEval uses chain-of-thought reasoning in large multimodal models and supports three modes: reference-free, reference-only, and combined, accommodating both video and image inputs. We also propose MSVD-Eval, a new dataset for video captioning evaluation, to establish a more transparent and consistent framework for both human experts and evaluation metrics. It is designed to address the lack of clear criteria in existing datasets by introducing distinct dimensions of Accuracy, Completeness, Conciseness, and Relevance (ACCR). Extensive results show that G-VEval outperforms existing methods in correlation with human annotations, as measured by Kendall tau-b and Kendall tau-c. This provides a flexible solution for diverse captioning tasks and suggests a straightforward yet effective approach for large language models to understand video content, paving the way for advancements in automated captioning.

On the Role of Model Prior in Real-World Inductive Reasoning,"Zhuo Liu, Ding Yu, Hangfeng He","Large Language Models (LLMs) show impressive inductive reasoning capabilities, enabling them to generate hypotheses that could generalize effectively to new instances when guided by in-context demonstrations. However, in real-world applications, LLMs' hypothesis generation is not solely determined by these demonstrations but is significantly shaped by task-specific model priors. Despite their critical influence, the distinct contributions of model priors versus demonstrations to hypothesis generation have been underexplored. This study bridges this gap by systematically evaluating three inductive reasoning strategies across five real-world tasks with three LLMs. Our empirical findings reveal that, hypothesis generation is primarily driven by the model's inherent priors; removing demonstrations results in minimal loss of hypothesis quality and downstream usage. Further analysis shows the result is consistent across various label formats with different label configurations, and prior is hard to override, even under flipped labeling. These insights advance our understanding of the dynamics of hypothesis generation in LLMs and highlight the potential for better utilizing model priors in real-world inductive reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13645v1,2024-12
Mind Your Theory: Theory of Mind Goes Deeper Than Reasoning,"Eitan Wagner, Nitay Alon, Joseph M. Barnby, Omri Abend","Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities in LLMs have recently become a central object of investigation. Cognitive science distinguishes between two steps required for ToM tasks: 1) determine whether to invoke ToM, which includes the appropriate Depth of Mentalizing (DoM), or level of recursion required to complete a task; and 2) applying the correct inference given the DoM. In this position paper, we first identify several lines of work in different communities in AI, including LLM benchmarking, ToM add-ons, ToM probing, and formal models for ToM. We argue that recent work in AI tends to focus exclusively on the second step which are typically framed as static logic problems. We conclude with suggestions for improved evaluation of ToM capabilities inspired by dynamic environments used in cognitive tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13631v1,2024-12
LIFT: Improving Long Context Understanding Through Long Input Fine-Tuning,"Yansheng Mao, Jiaqi Li, Fanxu Meng, Jing Xiong, Zilong Zheng, Muhan Zhang","Long context understanding remains challenging for large language models due to their limited context windows. This paper introduces Long Input Fine-Tuning (LIFT) for long context modeling, a novel framework that enhances LLM performance on long-context tasks by adapting model parameters to the context at test time. LIFT enables efficient processing of lengthy inputs without the computational burden of offline long-context adaptation, and can improve the long-context capabilities of arbitrary short-context models. The framework is further enhanced by integrating in-context learning and pre-LIFT supervised fine-tuning. The combination of in-context learning and LIFT enables short-context models like Llama 3 to handle arbitrarily long contexts and consistently improves their performance on popular long-context benchmarks like LooGLE and LongBench. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of LIFT on long context understanding, offering valuable directions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13626v1,2024-12
Reverse Region-to-Entity Annotation for Pixel-Level Visual Entity Linking,"Zhengfei Xu, Sijia Zhao, Yanchao Hao, Xiaolong Liu, Lili Li, Yuyang Yin, Bo Li, Xi Chen, Xin Xin","Visual Entity Linking (VEL) is a crucial task for achieving fine-grained visual understanding, matching objects within images (visual mentions) to entities in a knowledge base. Previous VEL tasks rely on textual inputs, but writing queries for complex scenes can be challenging. Visual inputs like clicks or bounding boxes offer a more convenient alternative. Therefore, we propose a new task, Pixel-Level Visual Entity Linking (PL-VEL), which uses pixel masks from visual inputs to refer to objects, supplementing reference methods for VEL. To facilitate research on this task, we have constructed the MaskOVEN-Wiki dataset through an entirely automatic reverse region-entity annotation framework. This dataset contains over 5 million annotations aligning pixel-level regions with entity-level labels, which will advance visual understanding towards fine-grained. Moreover, as pixel masks correspond to semantic regions in an image, we enhance previous patch-interacted attention with region-interacted attention by a visual semantic tokenization approach. Manual evaluation results indicate that the reverse annotation framework achieved a 94.8% annotation success rate. Experimental results show that models trained on this dataset improved accuracy by 18 points compared to zero-shot models. Additionally, the semantic tokenization method achieved a 5-point accuracy improvement over the trained baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13614v1,2024-12
Are LLMs Good Literature Review Writers? Evaluating the Literature Review Writing Ability of Large Language Models,"Xuemei Tang, Xufeng Duan, Zhenguang G. Cai","The literature review is a crucial form of academic writing that involves complex processes of literature collection, organization, and summarization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has introduced promising tools to automate these processes. However, their actual capabilities in writing comprehensive literature reviews remain underexplored, such as whether they can generate accurate and reliable references. To address this gap, we propose a framework to assess the literature review writing ability of LLMs automatically. We evaluate the performance of LLMs across three tasks: generating references, writing abstracts, and writing literature reviews. We employ external tools for a multidimensional evaluation, which includes assessing hallucination rates in references, semantic coverage, and factual consistency with human-written context. By analyzing the experimental results, we find that, despite advancements, even the most sophisticated models still cannot avoid generating hallucinated references. Additionally, different models exhibit varying performance in literature review writing across different disciplines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13612v1,2024-12
Beyond Outcomes: Transparent Assessment of LLM Reasoning in Games,"Wenye Lin, Jonathan Roberts, Yunhan Yang, Samuel Albanie, Zongqing Lu, Kai Han","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that demand complex reasoning. To track progress, robust benchmarks are required to evaluate their capabilities beyond superficial pattern recognition. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks often face challenges such as insufficient interpretability, performance saturation or data contamination. To address these challenges, we introduce GAMEBoT, a gaming arena designed for rigorous and transparent assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities. GAMEBoT decomposes complex reasoning in games into predefined modular subproblems. This decomposition allows us to design a suite of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that leverage domain knowledge to guide LLMs in addressing these subproblems before action selection. Furthermore, we develop a suite of rule-based algorithms to generate ground truth for these subproblems, enabling rigorous validation of the LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps. This approach facilitates evaluation of both the quality of final actions and the accuracy of the underlying reasoning process. GAMEBoT also naturally alleviates the risk of data contamination through dynamic games and head-to-head LLM competitions. We benchmark 17 prominent LLMs across eight games, encompassing various strategic abilities and game characteristics. Our results suggest that GAMEBoT presents a significant challenge, even when LLMs are provided with detailed CoT prompts.

Unlocking the Potential of Weakly Labeled Data: A Co-Evolutionary Learning Framework for Abnormality Detection and Report Generation,"Jinghan Sun, Dong Wei, Zhe Xu, Donghuan Lu, Hong Liu, Hong Wang, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris, Steven McDonagh, Yefeng Zheng, Liansheng Wang","Anatomical abnormality detection and report generation of chest X-ray (CXR) are two essential tasks in clinical practice. The former aims at localizing and characterizing cardiopulmonary radiological findings in CXRs, while the latter summarizes the findings in a detailed report for further diagnosis and treatment. Existing methods often focused on either task separately, ignoring their correlation. This work proposes a co-evolutionary abnormality detection and report generation (CoE-DG) framework. The framework utilizes both fully labeled (with bounding box annotations and clinical reports) and weakly labeled (with reports only) data to achieve mutual promotion between the abnormality detection and report generation tasks. Specifically, we introduce a bi-directional information interaction strategy with generator-guided information propagation (GIP) and detector-guided information propagation (DIP). For semi-supervised abnormality detection, GIP takes the informative feature extracted by the generator as an auxiliary input to the detector and uses the generator's prediction to refine the detector's pseudo labels. We further propose an intra-image-modal self-adaptive non-maximum suppression module (SA-NMS). This module dynamically rectifies pseudo detection labels generated by the teacher detection model with high-confidence predictions by the student.Inversely, for report generation, DIP takes the abnormalities' categories and locations predicted by the detector as input and guidance for the generator to improve the generated reports.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13599v1,2024-12
EvoWiki: Evaluating LLMs on Evolving Knowledge,"Wei Tang, Yixin Cao, Yang Deng, Jiahao Ying, Bo Wang, Yizhe Yang, Yuyue Zhao, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang, Yugang Jiang, Yong Liao","Knowledge utilization is a critical aspect of LLMs, and understanding how they adapt to evolving knowledge is essential for their effective deployment. However, existing benchmarks are predominantly static, failing to capture the evolving nature of LLMs and knowledge, leading to inaccuracies and vulnerabilities such as contamination. In this paper, we introduce EvoWiki, an evolving dataset designed to reflect knowledge evolution by categorizing information into stable, evolved, and uncharted states. EvoWiki is fully auto-updatable, enabling precise evaluation of continuously changing knowledge and newly released LLMs. Through experiments with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Contunual Learning (CL), we evaluate how effectively LLMs adapt to evolving knowledge. Our results indicate that current models often struggle with evolved knowledge, frequently providing outdated or incorrect responses. Moreover, the dataset highlights a synergistic effect between RAG and CL, demonstrating their potential to better adapt to evolving knowledge. EvoWiki provides a robust benchmark for advancing future research on the knowledge evolution capabilities of large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13582v1,2024-12

Many existing datasets lack adequate representation of different groups, resulting in unreliable assessments. To tackle this, we propose a socio-culturally aware evaluation framework for LLM-driven content moderation and introduce a scalable method for creating diverse datasets using persona-based generation. Our analysis reveals that these datasets provide broader perspectives and pose greater challenges for LLMs than diversity-focused generation methods without personas. This challenge is especially pronounced in smaller LLMs, emphasizing the difficulties they encounter in moderating such diverse content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13578v1,2024-12
Generating Long-form Story Using Dynamic Hierarchical Outlining with Memory-Enhancement,"Qianyue Wang, Jinwu Hu, Zhengping Li, Yufeng Wang, daiyuan li, Yu Hu, Mingkui Tan","Long-form story generation task aims to produce coherent and sufficiently lengthy text, essential for applications such as novel writingand interactive storytelling. However, existing methods, including LLMs, rely on rigid outlines or lack macro-level planning, making it difficult to achieve both contextual consistency and coherent plot development in long-form story generation. To address this issues, we propose Dynamic Hierarchical Outlining with Memory-Enhancement long-form story generation method, named DOME, to generate the long-form story with coherent content and plot. Specifically, the Dynamic Hierarchical Outline(DHO) mechanism incorporates the novel writing theory into outline planning and fuses the plan and writing stages together, improving the coherence of the plot by ensuring the plot completeness and adapting to the uncertainty during story generation. A Memory-Enhancement Module (MEM) based on temporal knowledge graphs is introduced to store and access the generated content, reducing contextual conflicts and improving story coherence. Finally, we propose a Temporal Conflict Analyzer leveraging temporal knowledge graphs to automatically evaluate the contextual consistency of long-form story. Experiments demonstrate that DOME significantly improves the fluency, coherence, and overall quality of generated long stories compared to state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13575v1,2024-12
Read Like a Radiologist: Efficient Vision-Language Model for 3D Medical Imaging Interpretation,"Changsun Lee, Sangjoon Park, Cheong-Il Shin, Woo Hee Choi, Hyun Jeong Park, Jeong Eun Lee, Jong Chul Ye","Recent medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical image interpretation. However extending them to 3D medical imaging has been challenging due to computational complexities and data scarcity. Although a few recent VLMs specified for 3D medical imaging have emerged, all are limited to learning volumetric representation of a 3D medical image as a set of sub-volumetric features. Such process introduces overly correlated representations along the z-axis that neglect slice-specific clinical details, particularly for 3D medical images where adjacent slices have low redundancy. To address this limitation, we introduce MS-VLM that mimic radiologists' workflow in 3D medical image interpretation. Specifically, radiologists analyze 3D medical images by examining individual slices sequentially and synthesizing information across slices and views. Likewise, MS-VLM leverages self-supervised 2D transformer encoders to learn a volumetric representation that capture inter-slice dependencies from a sequence of slice-specific features. Unbound by sub-volumetric patchification, MS-VLM is capable of obtaining useful volumetric representations from 3D medical images with any slice length and from multiple images acquired from different planes and phases. We evaluate MS-VLM on publicly available chest CT dataset CT-RATE and in-house rectal MRI dataset. In both scenarios, MS-VLM surpasses existing methods in radiology report generation, producing more coherent and clinically relevant reports. These findings highlight the potential of MS-VLM to advance 3D medical image interpretation and improve the robustness of medical VLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13558v1,2024-12
EscapeBench: Pushing Language Models to Think Outside the Box,"Cheng Qian, Peixuan Han, Qinyu Luo, Bingxiang He, Xiusi Chen, Yuji Zhang, Hongyi Du, Jiarui Yao, Xiaocheng Yang, Denghui Zhang, Yunzhu Li, Heng Ji","Language model agents excel in long-session planning and reasoning, but existing benchmarks primarily focus on goal-oriented tasks with explicit objectives, neglecting creative adaptation in unfamiliar environments. To address this, we introduce EscapeBench, a benchmark suite of room escape game environments designed to challenge agents with creative reasoning, unconventional tool use, and iterative problem-solving to uncover implicit goals. Our results show that current LM models, despite employing working memory and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, achieve only 15% average progress without hints, highlighting their limitations in creativity. To bridge this gap, we propose EscapeAgent, a framework designed to enhance creative reasoning through Foresight (innovative tool use) and Reflection (identifying unsolved tasks). Experiments show that EscapeAgent can execute action chains over 1,000 steps while maintaining logical coherence. It navigates and completes games with up to 40% fewer steps and hints, performs robustly across varying difficulty levels, and achieves higher action success rates with more efficient and innovative puzzle-solving strategies.

"Query-centric Audio-Visual Cognition Network for Moment Retrieval, Segmentation and Step-Captioning","Yunbin Tu, Liang Li, Li Su, Qingming Huang","Video has emerged as a favored multimedia format on the internet. To better gain video contents, a new topic HIREST is presented, including video retrieval, moment retrieval, moment segmentation, and step-captioning. The pioneering work chooses the pre-trained CLIP-based model for video retrieval, and leverages it as a feature extractor for other three challenging tasks solved in a multi-task learning paradigm. Nevertheless, this work struggles to learn the comprehensive cognition of user-preferred content, due to disregarding the hierarchies and association relations across modalities. In this paper, guided by the shallow-to-deep principle, we propose a query-centric audio-visual cognition (QUAG) network to construct a reliable multi-modal representation for moment retrieval, segmentation and step-captioning. Specifically, we first design the modality-synergistic perception to obtain rich audio-visual content, by modeling global contrastive alignment and local fine-grained interaction between visual and audio modalities. Then, we devise the query-centric cognition that uses the deep-level query to perform the temporal-channel filtration on the shallow-level audio-visual representation. This can cognize user-preferred content and thus attain a query-centric audio-visual representation for three tasks. Extensive experiments show QUAG achieves the SOTA results on HIREST. Further, we test QUAG on the query-based video summarization task and verify its good generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13543v1,2024-12
Multi-Granularity Open Intent Classification via Adaptive Granular-Ball Decision Boundary,"Yanhua Li, Xiaocao Ouyang, Chaofan Pan, Jie Zhang, Sen Zhao, Shuyin Xia, Xin Yang, Guoyin Wang, Tianrui Li","Open intent classification is critical for the development of dialogue systems, aiming to accurately classify known intents into their corresponding classes while identifying unknown intents. Prior boundary-based methods assumed known intents fit within compact spherical regions, focusing on coarse-grained representation and precise spherical decision boundaries. However, these assumptions are often violated in practical scenarios, making it difficult to distinguish known intent classes from unknowns using a single spherical boundary. To tackle these issues, we propose a Multi-granularity Open intent classification method via adaptive Granular-Ball decision boundary (MOGB). Our MOGB method consists of two modules: representation learning and decision boundary acquiring. To effectively represent the intent distribution, we design a hierarchical representation learning method. This involves iteratively alternating between adaptive granular-ball clustering and nearest sub-centroid classification to capture fine-grained semantic structures within known intent classes. Furthermore, multi-granularity decision boundaries are constructed for open intent classification by employing granular-balls with varying centroids and radii. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13542v1,2024-12
Benchmarking and Improving Large Vision-Language Models for Fundamental Visual Graph Understanding and Reasoning,"Yingjie Zhu, Xuefeng Bai, Kehai Chen, Yang Xiang, Min Zhang","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. Despite great success, recent studies show that LVLMs encounter substantial limitations when engaging with visual graphs. To study the reason behind these limitations, we propose VGCure, a comprehensive benchmark covering 22 tasks for examining the fundamental graph understanding and reasoning capacities of LVLMs. Extensive evaluations conducted on 14 LVLMs reveal that LVLMs are weak in basic graph understanding and reasoning tasks, particularly those concerning relational or structurally complex information. Based on this observation, we propose a structure-aware fine-tuning framework to enhance LVLMs with structure learning abilities through 3 self-supervised learning tasks. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LVLMs' zero-shot performance on fundamental graph learning tasks, as well as enhancing the robustness of LVLMs against complex visual graphs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13540v1,2024-12
MetaRuleGPT: Recursive Numerical Reasoning of Language Models Trained with Simple Rules,"Kejie Chen, Lin Wang, Qinghai Zhang, Renjun Xu","Recent studies have highlighted the limitations of large language models in mathematical reasoning, particularly their inability to capture the underlying logic. Inspired by meta-learning, we propose that models should acquire not only task-specific knowledge but also transferable problem-solving skills. We introduce MetaRuleGPT, a novel Transformer-based architecture that performs precise numerical calculations and complex logical operations by learning and combining different rules. In contrast with traditional training sets, which are heavily composed of massive raw instance data, MetaRuleGPT is pre-trained on much less abstract datasets containing basic, compound, and iterative rules for mathematical reasoning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate MetaRuleGPT can mimic human's rule-following capabilities, break down complexity, and iteratively derive accurate results for complex mathematical problems. These findings prove the potential of rule learning to enhance the numerical reasoning abilities of language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13536v1,2024-12

Because LLMs provide probability distributions, the similarity between two documents can be rigorously defined in an information-theoretic manner by the KL divergence. We also propose a natural, novel clustering algorithm by using importance sampling. We show that GC achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming any previous clustering method often by a large margin. Furthermore, we show an application to generative document retrieval in which documents are indexed via hierarchical clustering and our method improves the retrieval accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13534v1,2024-12
CEHA: A Dataset of Conflict Events in the Horn of Africa,"Rui Bai, Di Lu, Shihao Ran, Elizabeth Olson, Hemank Lamba, Aoife Cahill, Joel Tetreault, Alex Jaimes","Natural Language Processing (NLP) of news articles can play an important role in understanding the dynamics and causes of violent conflict. Despite the availability of datasets categorizing various conflict events, the existing labels often do not cover all of the fine-grained violent conflict event types relevant to areas like the Horn of Africa. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark dataset Conflict Events in the Horn of Africa region (CEHA) and propose a new task for identifying violent conflict events using online resources with this dataset. The dataset consists of 500 English event descriptions regarding conflict events in the Horn of Africa region with fine-grained event-type definitions that emphasize the cause of the conflict. This dataset categorizes the key types of conflict risk according to specific areas required by stakeholders in the Humanitarian-Peace-Development Nexus.

Dynamic Adapter with Semantics Disentangling for Cross-lingual Cross-modal Retrieval,"Rui Cai, Zhiyu Dong, Jianfeng Dong, Xun Wang","Existing cross-modal retrieval methods typically rely on large-scale vision-language pair data. This makes it challenging to efficiently develop a cross-modal retrieval model for under-resourced languages of interest. Therefore, Cross-lingual Cross-modal Retrieval (CCR), which aims to align vision and the low-resource language (the target language) without using any human-labeled target-language data, has gained increasing attention. As a general parameter-efficient way, a common solution is to utilize adapter modules to transfer the vision-language alignment ability of Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models from a source language to a target language. However, these adapters are usually static once learned, making it difficult to adapt to target-language captions with varied expressions. To alleviate it, we propose Dynamic Adapter with Semantics Disentangling (DASD), whose parameters are dynamically generated conditioned on the characteristics of the input captions. Considering that the semantics and expression styles of the input caption largely influence how to encode it, we propose a semantic disentangling module to extract the semantic-related and semantic-agnostic features from the input, ensuring that generated adapters are well-suited to the characteristics of input caption. Extensive experiments on two image-text datasets and one video-text dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for cross-lingual cross-modal retrieval, as well as its good compatibility with various VLP models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13510v1,2024-12
VaeDiff-DocRE: End-to-end Data Augmentation Framework for Document-level Relation Extraction,"Khai Phan Tran, Wen Hua, Xue Li","Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) aims to identify relationships between entity pairs within a document. However, most existing methods assume a uniform label distribution, resulting in suboptimal performance on real-world, imbalanced datasets. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation approach using generative models to enhance data from the embedding space. Our method leverages the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture to capture all relation-wise distributions formed by entity pair representations and augment data for underrepresented relations. To better capture the multi-label nature of DocRE, we parameterize the VAE's latent space with a Diffusion Model. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical training framework to integrate the proposed VAE-based augmentation module into DocRE systems. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, effectively addressing the long-tail distribution problem in DocRE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13503v1,2024-12
Refining Salience-Aware Sparse Fine-Tuning Strategies for Language Models,"Xinxin Liu, Aaron Thomas, Cheng Zhang, Jianyi Cheng, Yiren Zhao, Xitong Gao","Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has gained prominence through low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA. In this paper, we focus on sparsity-based PEFT (SPEFT), which introduces trainable sparse adaptations to the weight matrices in the model, offering greater flexibility in selecting fine-tuned parameters compared to low-rank methods. We conduct the first systematic evaluation of salience metrics for SPEFT, inspired by zero-cost NAS proxies, and identify simple gradient-based metrics is reliable, and results are on par with the best alternatives, offering both computational efficiency and robust performance. Additionally, we compare static and dynamic masking strategies, finding that static masking, which predetermines non-zero entries before training, delivers efficiency without sacrificing performance, while dynamic masking offers no substantial benefits. Across NLP tasks, a simple gradient-based, static SPEFT consistently outperforms other fine-tuning methods for LLMs, providing a simple yet effective baseline for SPEFT.

T$^3$-S2S: Training-free Triplet Tuning for Sketch to Scene Generation,"Zhenhong Sun, Yifu Wang, Yonhon Ng, Yunfei Duan, Daoyi Dong, Hongdong Li, Pan Ji","Scene generation is crucial to many computer graphics applications. Recent advances in generative AI have streamlined sketch-to-image workflows, easing the workload for artists and designers in creating scene concept art. However, these methods often struggle for complex scenes with multiple detailed objects, sometimes missing small or uncommon instances. In this paper, we propose a Training-free Triplet Tuning for Sketch-to-Scene (T3-S2S) generation after reviewing the entire cross-attention mechanism. This scheme revitalizes the existing ControlNet model, enabling effective handling of multi-instance generations, involving prompt balance, characteristics prominence, and dense tuning. Specifically, this approach enhances keyword representation via the prompt balance module, reducing the risk of missing critical instances. It also includes a characteristics prominence module that highlights TopK indices in each channel, ensuring essential features are better represented based on token sketches. Additionally, it employs dense tuning to refine contour details in the attention map, compensating for instance-related regions. Experiments validate that our triplet tuning approach substantially improves the performance of existing sketch-to-image models. It consistently generates detailed, multi-instance 2D images, closely adhering to the input prompts and enhancing visual quality in complex multi-instance scenes.

Curriculum Learning for Cross-Lingual Data-to-Text Generation With Noisy Data,"Kancharla Aditya Hari, Manish Gupta, Vasudeva Varma","Curriculum learning has been used to improve the quality of text generation systems by ordering the training samples according to a particular schedule in various tasks. In the context of data-to-text generation (DTG), previous studies used various difficulty criteria to order the training samples for monolingual DTG. These criteria, however, do not generalize to the crosslingual variant of the problem and do not account for noisy data. We explore multiple criteria that can be used for improving the performance of cross-lingual DTG systems with noisy data using two curriculum schedules. Using the alignment score criterion for ordering samples and an annealing schedule to train the model, we show increase in BLEU score by up to 4 points, and improvements in faithfulness and coverage of generations by 5-15% on average across 11 Indian languages and English in 2 separate datasets.

A Statistical and Multi-Perspective Revisiting of the Membership Inference Attack in Large Language Models,"Bowen Chen, Namgi Han, Yusuke Miyao","The lack of data transparency in Large Language Models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of Membership Inference Attack (MIA), which differentiates trained (member) and untrained (non-member) data. Though it shows success in previous studies, recent research reported a near-random performance in different settings, highlighting a significant performance inconsistency. We assume that a single setting doesn't represent the distribution of the vast corpora, causing members and non-members with different distributions to be sampled and causing inconsistency. In this study, instead of a single setting, we statistically revisit MIA methods from various settings with thousands of experiments for each MIA method, along with study in text feature, embedding, threshold decision, and decoding dynamics of members and non-members. We found that (1) MIA performance improves with model size and varies with domains, while most methods do not statistically outperform baselines, (2) Though MIA performance is generally low, a notable amount of differentiable member and non-member outliers exists and vary across MIA methods, (3) Deciding a threshold to separate members and non-members is an overlooked challenge, (4) Text dissimilarity and long text benefit MIA performance, (5) Differentiable or not is reflected in the LLM embedding, (6) Member and non-members show different decoding dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13475v1,2024-12
Gradual Vigilance and Interval Communication: Enhancing Value Alignment in Multi-Agent Debates,"Rui Zou, Mengqi Wei, Jintian Feng, Qian Wan, Jianwen Sun, Sannyuya Liu","In recent years, large language models have shown exceptional performance in fulfilling diverse human needs. However, their training data can introduce harmful content, underscoring the necessity for robust value alignment. Mainstream methods, which depend on feedback learning and supervised training, are resource-intensive and may constrain the full potential of the models. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) offers a more efficient and innovative solution by enabling the generation of reliable answers through agent interactions. To apply MAD to value alignment, we examine the relationship between the helpfulness and harmlessness of debate outcomes and individual responses, and propose a MAD based framework Gradual Vigilance and Interval Communication (GVIC). GVIC allows agents to assess risks with varying levels of vigilance and to exchange diverse information through interval communication. We theoretically prove that GVIC optimizes debate efficiency while reducing communication overhead.

Transducer Tuning: Efficient Model Adaptation for Software Tasks Using Code Property Graphs,"Imam Nur Bani Yusuf, Lingxiao Jiang","Large language models have demonstrated promising performance across various software engineering tasks. While fine-tuning is a common practice to adapt these models for downstream tasks, it becomes challenging in resource-constrained environments due to increased memory requirements from growing trainable parameters in increasingly large language models. We introduce \approach, a technique to adapt large models for downstream code tasks using Code Property Graphs (CPGs). Our approach introduces a modular component called \transducer that enriches code embeddings with structural and dependency information from CPGs. The Transducer comprises two key components: Graph Vectorization Engine (GVE) and Attention-Based Fusion Layer (ABFL). GVE extracts CPGs from input source code and transforms them into graph feature vectors. ABFL then fuses those graphs feature vectors with initial code embeddings from a large language model. By optimizing these transducers for different downstream tasks, our approach enhances the models without the need to fine-tune them for specific tasks. We have evaluated \approach on three downstream tasks: code summarization, assert generation, and code translation. Our results demonstrate competitive performance compared to full parameter fine-tuning while reducing up to 99\% trainable parameters to save memory. \approach also remains competitive against other fine-tuning approaches (e.g., LoRA, Prompt-Tuning, Prefix-Tuning) while using only 1.5\%-80\% of their trainable parameters. Our findings show that integrating structural and dependency information through Transducer Tuning enables more efficient model adaptation, making it easier for users to adapt large models in resource-constrained settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13467v1,2024-12

However, these methods often rely heavily on pre-existing test cases, which may not always be available or comprehensive. In this work, we propose a novel approach that concurrently trains a code generation model and a test generation model, utilizing execution feedback to refine and enhance the performance of both. We introduce two strategies for test and code data augmentation and a new scoring function for code and test ranking. We experiment on the APPS dataset and demonstrate that our approach can effectively generate and augment test cases, filter and synthesize correct code solutions, and rank the quality of generated code and tests. The results demonstrate that our models, when iteratively trained with an increasing number of test cases and code solutions, outperform those trained on the original dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13464v1,2024-12
PLPP: Prompt Learning with Perplexity Is Self-Distillation for Vision-Language Models,"Biao Liu, Wenyi Fang, Xiaoyu Wu, Yang Zheng, Zheng Hu, Bo Yuan","Pre-trained Vision-Language (VL) models such as CLIP have demonstrated their excellent performance across numerous downstream tasks. A recent method, Context Optimization (CoOp), further improves the performance of VL models on downstream tasks by introducing prompt learning. CoOp optimizes a set of learnable vectors, aka prompt, and freezes the whole CLIP model. However, relying solely on CLIP loss to fine-tune prompts can lead to models that are prone to overfitting on downstream task. To address this issue, we propose a plug-in prompt-regularization method called PLPP (Prompt Learning with PerPlexity), which use perplexity loss to regularize prompt learning. PLPP designs a two-step operation to compute the perplexity for prompts: (a) calculating cosine similarity between the weight of the embedding layer and prompts to get labels, (b) introducing a language model (LM) head that requires no training behind text encoder to output word probability distribution. Meanwhile, we unveil that the essence of PLPP is inherently a form of self-distillation. To further prevent overfitting as well as to reduce the additional computation introduced by PLPP, we turn the hard label to soft label and choose top-$k$ values for calculating the perplexity loss. For accelerating model convergence, we introduce mutual self-distillation learning, that is perplexity and inverted perplexity loss. The experiments conducted on four classification tasks indicate that PLPP exhibits superior performance compared to existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15277v1,2024-12
FlashVTG: Feature Layering and Adaptive Score Handling Network for Video Temporal Grounding,"Zhuo Cao, Bingqing Zhang, Heming Du, Xin Yu, Xue Li, Sen Wang","Text-guided Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant segments in untrimmed videos based on textual descriptions, encompassing two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD). Although previous typical methods have achieved commendable results, it is still challenging to retrieve short video moments. This is primarily due to the reliance on sparse and limited decoder queries, which significantly constrain the accuracy of predictions. Furthermore, suboptimal outcomes often arise because previous methods rank predictions based on isolated predictions, neglecting the broader video context. To tackle these issues, we introduce FlashVTG, a framework featuring a Temporal Feature Layering (TFL) module and an Adaptive Score Refinement (ASR) module. The TFL module replaces the traditional decoder structure to capture nuanced video content variations across multiple temporal scales, while the ASR module improves prediction ranking by integrating context from adjacent moments and multi-temporal-scale features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance on four widely adopted datasets in both MR and HD. Specifically, on the QVHighlights dataset, it boosts mAP by 5.8% for MR and 3.3% for HD. For short-moment retrieval, FlashVTG increases mAP to 125% of previous SOTA performance. All these improvements are made without adding training burdens, underscoring its effectiveness.

Lack of communication and collaboration among experts exacerbate the instability of LLMs due to the imbalance load problem of MoE. To address this issue, we propose a novel MoE graph-based LLM fine-tuning framework GraphLoRA, in which a graph router function is designed to capture the collaboration signals among experts by graph neural networks (GNNs). GraphLoRA enables all experts to understand input knowledge and share information from neighbor experts by aggregating operations. Besides, to enhance each expert's capability and their collaborations, we design two novel coordination strategies: the Poisson distribution-based distinction strategy and the Normal distribution-based load balance strategy. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphLoRA in parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs, showing the benefits of facilitating collaborations of multiple experts in the graph router of GraphLoRA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16216v1,2024-12
Lightweight Safety Classification Using Pruned Language Models,"Mason Sawtell, Tula Masterman, Sandi Besen, Jim Brown","In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for content safety and prompt injection classification for Large Language Models. Our technique, Layer Enhanced Classification (LEC), trains a Penalized Logistic Regression (PLR) classifier on the hidden state of an LLM's optimal intermediate transformer layer. By combining the computational efficiency of a streamlined PLR classifier with the sophisticated language understanding of an LLM, our approach delivers superior performance surpassing GPT-4o and special-purpose models fine-tuned for each task. We find that small general-purpose models (Qwen 2.5 sizes 0.5B, 1.5B, and 3B) and other transformer-based architectures like DeBERTa v3 are robust feature extractors allowing simple classifiers to be effectively trained on fewer than 100 high-quality examples. Importantly, the intermediate transformer layers of these models typically outperform the final layer across both classification tasks. Our results indicate that a single general-purpose LLM can be used to classify content safety, detect prompt injections, and simultaneously generate output tokens. Alternatively, these relatively small LLMs can be pruned to the optimal intermediate layer and used exclusively as robust feature extractors. Since our results are consistent on different transformer architectures, we infer that robust feature extraction is an inherent capability of most, if not all, LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13435v1,2024-12
Enhancing Talk Moves Analysis in Mathematics Tutoring through Classroom Teaching Discourse,"Jie Cao, Abhijit Suresh, Jennifer Jacobs, Charis Clevenger, Amanda Howard, Chelsea Brown, Brent Milne, Tom Fischaber, Tamara Sumner, James H. Martin","Human tutoring interventions play a crucial role in supporting student learning, improving academic performance, and promoting personal growth. This paper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a framework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However, scaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring dialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and resource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset, and explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker information, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging existing datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results demonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model performance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer context and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation studies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13395v1,2024-12
Catalysts of Conversation: Examining Interaction Dynamics Between Topic Initiators and Commentors in Alzheimer's Disease Online Communities,"Congning Ni, Qingxia Chen, Lijun Song, Patricia Commiskey, Qingyuan Song, Bradley A. Malin, Zhijun Yin","Informal caregivers (e.g.,family members or friends) of people living with Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) face substantial challenges and often seek informational or emotional support through online communities. Understanding the factors that drive engagement within these platforms is crucial, as it can enhance their long-term value for caregivers by ensuring that these communities effectively meet their needs. This study investigated the user interaction dynamics within two large, popular ADRD communities, TalkingPoint and ALZConnected, focusing on topic initiator engagement, initial post content, and the linguistic patterns of comments at the thread level. Using analytical methods such as propensity score matching, topic modeling, and predictive modeling, we found that active topic initiator engagement drives higher comment volumes, and reciprocal replies from topic initiators encourage further commentor engagement at the community level. Practical caregiving topics prompt more re-engagement of topic initiators, while emotional support topics attract more comments from other commentors. Additionally, the linguistic complexity and emotional tone of a comment influence its likelihood of receiving replies from topic initiators. These findings highlight the importance of fostering active and reciprocal engagement and providing effective strategies to enhance sustainability in ADRD caregiving and broader health-related online communities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13388v1,2024-12

In this paper, we introduce SummExecEdit, a novel benchmark leveraging executable edits to assess models on their ability to both detect factual errors and provide accurate explanations. The top-performing model, Claude3-Opus, achieves a joint detection and explanation score of only 0.49 in our benchmark, with individual scores of 0.67 for detection and 0.73 for explanation. Furthermore, we identify four primary types of explanation errors, with 45.4% of errors focusing on completely unrelated parts of the summary.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13378v1,2024-12

Extending LLMs to New Languages: A Case Study of Llama and Persian Adaptation,"Samin Mahdizadeh Sani, Pouya Sadeghi, Thuy-Trang Vu, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh, Gholamreza Haffari","Large language models (LLMs) have made great progress in classification and text generation tasks. However, they are mainly trained on English data and often struggle with low-resource languages. In this study, we explore adding a new language, i.e., Persian, to Llama (a model with a limited understanding of Persian) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We employ a multi-stage approach involving pretraining on monolingual Persian data, aligning representations through bilingual pretraining and instruction datasets, and instruction-tuning with task-specific datasets. We evaluate the model's performance at each stage on generation and classification tasks. Our findings suggest that incorporating the Persian language, through bilingual data alignment, can enhance classification accuracy for Persian tasks, with no adverse impact and sometimes even improvements on English tasks. Additionally, the results highlight the model's initial strength as a critical factor when working with limited training data, with cross-lingual alignment offering minimal benefits for the low-resource language. Knowledge transfer from English to Persian has a marginal effect, primarily benefiting simple classification tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13375v2,2024-12
Is Your World Simulator a Good Story Presenter? A Consecutive Events-Based Benchmark for Future Long Video Generation,"Yiping Wang, Xuehai He, Kuan Wang, Luyao Ma, Jianwei Yang, Shuohang Wang, Simon Shaolei Du, Yelong Shen","The current state-of-the-art video generative models can produce commercial-grade videos with highly realistic details. However, they still struggle to coherently present multiple sequential events in the stories specified by the prompts, which is foreseeable an essential capability for future long video generation scenarios. For example, top T2V generative models still fail to generate a video of the short simple story 'how to put an elephant into a refrigerator.' While existing detail-oriented benchmarks primarily focus on fine-grained metrics like aesthetic quality and spatial-temporal consistency, they fall short of evaluating models' abilities to handle event-level story presentation. To address this gap, we introduce StoryEval, a story-oriented benchmark specifically designed to assess text-to-video (T2V) models' story-completion capabilities. StoryEval features 423 prompts spanning 7 classes, each representing short stories composed of 2-4 consecutive events. We employ advanced vision-language models, such as GPT-4V and LLaVA-OV-Chat-72B, to verify the completion of each event in the generated videos, applying a unanimous voting method to enhance reliability. Our methods ensure high alignment with human evaluations, and the evaluation of 11 models reveals its challenge, with none exceeding an average story-completion rate of 50%. StoryEval provides a new benchmark for advancing T2V models and highlights the challenges and opportunities in developing next-generation solutions for coherent story-driven video generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16211v1,2024-12
Experience of Training a 1.7B-Parameter LLaMa Model From Scratch,"Miles Q. Li, Benjamin C. M. Fung, Shih-Chia Huang","Pretraining large language models is a complex endeavor influenced by multiple factors, including model architecture, data quality, training continuity, and hardware constraints. In this paper, we share insights gained from the experience of training DMaS-LLaMa-Lite, a fully open source, 1.7-billion-parameter, LLaMa-based model, on approximately 20 billion tokens of carefully curated data. We chronicle the full training trajectory, documenting how evolving validation loss levels and downstream benchmarks reflect transitions from incoherent text to fluent, contextually grounded output. Beyond pretraining, we extend our analysis to include a post-training phase focused on instruction tuning, where the model was refined to produce more contextually appropriate, user-aligned responses. We highlight practical considerations such as the importance of restoring optimizer states when resuming from checkpoints, and the impact of hardware changes on training stability and throughput. While qualitative evaluation provides an intuitive understanding of model improvements, our analysis extends to various performance benchmarks, demonstrating how high-quality data and thoughtful scaling enable competitive results with significantly fewer training tokens. By detailing these experiences and offering training logs, checkpoints, and sample outputs, we aim to guide future researchers and practitioners in refining their pretraining strategies. The training script is available on Github at https://github.com/McGill-DMaS/DMaS-LLaMa-Lite-Training-Code.

Expansion Span: Combining Fading Memory and Retrieval in Hybrid State Space Models,"Elvis Nunez, Luca Zancato, Benjamin Bowman, Aditya Golatkar, Wei Xia, Stefano Soatto","The ""state"" of State Space Models (SSMs) represents their memory, which fades exponentially over an unbounded span. By contrast, Attention-based models have ""eidetic"" (i.e., verbatim, or photographic) memory over a finite span (context size). Hybrid architectures combine State Space layers with Attention, but still cannot recall the distant past and can access only the most recent tokens eidetically. Unlike current methods of combining SSM and Attention layers, we allow the state to be allocated based on relevancy rather than recency. In this way, for every new set of query tokens, our models can ""eidetically"" access tokens from beyond the Attention span of current Hybrid SSMs without requiring extra hardware resources. We describe a method to expand the memory span of the hybrid state by ""reserving"" a fraction of the Attention context for tokens retrieved from arbitrarily distant in the past, thus expanding the eidetic memory span of the overall state. We call this reserved fraction of tokens the ""expansion span,"" and the mechanism to retrieve and aggregate it ""Span-Expanded Attention"" (SE-Attn). To adapt Hybrid models to using SE-Attn, we propose a novel fine-tuning method that extends LoRA to Hybrid models (HyLoRA) and allows efficient adaptation on long spans of tokens. We show that SE-Attn enables us to efficiently adapt pre-trained Hybrid models on sequences of tokens up to 8 times longer than the ones used for pre-training. We show that HyLoRA with SE-Attn is cheaper and more performant than alternatives like LongLoRA when applied to Hybrid models on natural language benchmarks with long-range dependencies, such as PG-19, RULER, and other common natural language downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13328v1,2024-12
Hint Marginalization for Improved Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Soumyasundar Pal, Didier Chételat, Yingxue Zhang, Mark Coates","Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited an impressive capability to perform reasoning tasks, especially if they are encouraged to generate a sequence of intermediate steps. Reasoning performance can be improved by suitably combining multiple LLM responses, generated either in parallel in a single query, or via sequential interactions with LLMs throughout the reasoning process. Existing strategies for combination, such as self-consistency and progressive-hint-prompting, make inefficient usage of the LLM responses. We present Hint Marginalization, a novel and principled algorithmic framework to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our approach can be viewed as an iterative sampling strategy for forming a Monte Carlo approximation of an underlying distribution of answers, with the goal of identifying the mode the most likely answer. Empirical evaluation on several benchmark datasets for arithmetic reasoning demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13292v1,2024-12
Enhancing Persona Classification in Dialogue Systems: A Graph Neural Network Approach,Konstantin Zaitsev,"In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) gain considerable attention for their potential to enhance personalized experiences in virtual assistants and chatbots. A key area of interest is the integration of personas into LLMs to improve dialogue naturalness and user engagement. This study addresses the challenge of persona classification, a crucial component in dialogue understanding, by proposing a framework that combines text embeddings with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for effective persona classification. Given the absence of dedicated persona classification datasets, we create a manually annotated dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. Our method involves extracting semantic features from persona statements using text embeddings and constructing a graph where nodes represent personas and edges capture their similarities. The GNN component uses this graph structure to propagate relevant information, thereby improving classification performance. Experimental results show that our approach, in particular the integration of GNNs, significantly improves classification performance, especially with limited data. Our contributions include the development of a persona classification framework and the creation of a dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13283v1,2024-12
Fooling LLM graders into giving better grades through neural activity guided adversarial prompting,"Atsushi Yamamura, Surya Ganguli","The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in critical decision-making and evaluation processes raises concerns about inherent biases that malicious actors could exploit to distort decision outcomes. We propose a systematic method to reveal such biases in AI evaluation systems and apply it to automated essay grading as an example. Our approach first identifies hidden neural activity patterns that predict distorted decision outcomes and then optimizes an adversarial input suffix to amplify such patterns. We demonstrate that this combination can effectively fool large language model (LLM) graders into assigning much higher grades than humans would. We further show that this white-box attack transfers to black-box attacks on other models, including commercial closed-source models like Gemini. They further reveal the existence of a ""magic word"" that plays a pivotal role in the efficacy of the attack. We trace the origin of this magic word bias to the structure of commonly-used chat templates for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs and show that a minor change in the template can drastically reduce the bias. This work not only uncovers vulnerabilities in current LLMs but also proposes a systematic method to identify and remove hidden biases, contributing to the goal of ensuring AI safety and security.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15275v1,2024-12
DnDScore: Decontextualization and Decomposition for Factuality Verification in Long-Form Text Generation,"Miriam Wanner, Benjamin Van Durme, Mark Dredze","The decompose-then-verify strategy for verification of Large Language Model (LLM) generations decomposes claims that are then independently verified. Decontextualization augments text (claims) to ensure it can be verified outside of the original context, enabling reliable verification. While decomposition and decontextualization have been explored independently, their interactions in a complete system have not been investigated. Their conflicting purposes can create tensions: decomposition isolates atomic facts while decontextualization inserts relevant information. Furthermore, a decontextualized subclaim presents a challenge to the verification step: what part of the augmented text should be verified as it now contains multiple atomic facts? We conduct an evaluation of different decomposition, decontextualization, and verification strategies and find that the choice of strategy matters in the resulting factuality scores. Additionally, we introduce DnDScore, a decontextualization aware verification method which validates subclaims in the context of contextual information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13175v1,2024-12
Compressed Chain of Thought: Efficient Reasoning Through Dense Representations,"Jeffrey Cheng, Benjamin Van Durme","Chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding enables language models to improve reasoning performance at the cost of high generation latency in decoding. Recent proposals have explored variants of contemplation tokens, a term we introduce that refers to special tokens used during inference to allow for extra computation. Prior work has considered fixed-length sequences drawn from a discrete set of embeddings as contemplation tokens. Here we propose Compressed Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a framework to generate contentful and continuous contemplation tokens of variable sequence length. The generated contemplation tokens are compressed representations of explicit reasoning chains, and our method can be applied to off-the-shelf decoder language models. Through experiments, we illustrate how CCoT enables additional reasoning over dense contentful representations to achieve corresponding improvements in accuracy. Moreover, the reasoning improvements can be adaptively modified on demand by controlling the number of contemplation tokens generated.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13171v1,2024-12
In-Context Learning Distillation for Efficient Few-Shot Fine-Tuning,"Yifei Duan, Liu Li, Zirui Zhai, Jinxia Yao","We applied few-shot in-context learning on the OPT-1.3B model for the natural language inference task and employed knowledge distillation to internalize the context information, reducing model parameter from 1.3B to 125M and achieving a size reduction from 2.5GB to 0.25GB. Compared to using in-context learning alone on similarly sized models, this context distillation approach achieved a nearly 50% improvement in out-of-domain accuracy, demonstrating superior knowledge transfer capabilities over prompt-based methods. Furthermore, this approach reduced memory consumption by up to 60% while delivering a 20% improvement in out-of-domain accuracy compared to conventional pattern-based fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13243v1,2024-12
Algorithmic Fidelity of Large Language Models in Generating Synthetic German Public Opinions: A Case Study,"Bolei Ma, Berk Yoztyurk, Anna-Carolina Haensch, Xinpeng Wang, Markus Herklotz, Frauke Kreuter, Barbara Plank, Matthias Assenmacher","In recent research, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to investigate public opinions. This study investigates the algorithmic fidelity of LLMs, i.e., the ability to replicate the socio-cultural context and nuanced opinions of human participants. Using open-ended survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Studies (GLES), we prompt different LLMs to generate synthetic public opinions reflective of German subpopulations by incorporating demographic features into the persona prompts. Our results show that Llama performs better than other LLMs at representing subpopulations, particularly when there is lower opinion diversity within those groups. Our findings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of left-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties, and matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the models' predictions. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLMs to more effectively model diverse public opinions while minimizing political biases and enhancing robustness in representativeness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13169v1,2024-12
BanglishRev: A Large-Scale Bangla-English and Code-mixed Dataset of Product Reviews in E-Commerce,"Mohammad Nazmush Shamael, Sabila Nawshin, Swakkhar Shatabda, Salekul Islam","This work presents the BanglishRev Dataset, the largest e-commerce product review dataset to date for reviews written in Bengali, English, a mixture of both and Banglish, Bengali words written with English alphabets. The dataset comprises of 1.74 million written reviews from 3.2 million ratings information collected from a total of 128k products being sold in online e-commerce platforms targeting the Bengali population. It includes an extensive array of related metadata for each of the reviews including the rating given by the reviewer, date the review was posted and date of purchase, number of likes, dislikes, response from the seller, images associated with the review etc. With sentiment analysis being the most prominent usage of review datasets, experimentation with a binary sentiment analysis model with the review rating serving as an indicator of positive or negative sentiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the large amount of data presented in BanglishRev for sentiment analysis tasks. A BanglishBERT model is trained on the data from BanglishRev with reviews being considered labeled positive if the rating is greater than 3 and negative if the rating is less than or equal to 3. The model is evaluated by being testing against a previously published manually annotated dataset for e-commerce reviews written in a mixture of Bangla, English and Banglish. The experimental model achieved an exceptional accuracy of 94\% and F1 score of 0.94, demonstrating the dataset's efficacy for sentiment analysis.

While Large Language Models offer potential automation, their direct application to specialized business domains often yields unsatisfactory results. We introduce Matrix (Memory-Augmented agent Training through Reasoning and Iterative eXploration), a novel paradigm that enables LLM agents to progressively build domain expertise through experience-driven memory refinement and iterative learning. To validate this approach, we collaborate with one of the world's largest logistics companies to create a dataset of Universal Business Language format invoice documents, focusing on the task of transport reference extraction. Experiments demonstrate that Matrix outperforms prompting a single LLM by 30.3%, vanilla LLM agent by 35.2%. We further analyze the metrics of the optimized systems and observe that the agent system requires less API calls, fewer costs and can analyze longer documents on average. Our methods establish a new approach to transform general-purpose LLMs into specialized business tools through systematic memory enhancement in document processing tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15274v1,2024-12

Improving Explainability of Sentence-level Metrics via Edit-level Attribution for Grammatical Error Correction,"Takumi Goto, Justin Vasselli, Taro Watanabe","Various evaluation metrics have been proposed for Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), but many, particularly reference-free metrics, lack explainability. This lack of explainability hinders researchers from analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of GEC models and limits the ability to provide detailed feedback for users. To address this issue, we propose attributing sentence-level scores to individual edits, providing insight into how specific corrections contribute to the overall performance. For the attribution method, we use Shapley values, from cooperative game theory, to compute the contribution of each edit. Experiments with existing sentence-level metrics demonstrate high consistency across different edit granularities and show approximately 70\% alignment with human evaluations. In addition, we analyze biases in the metrics based on the attribution results, revealing trends such as the tendency to ignore orthographic edits.

However, current benchmarks, which are based on predefined domains and human-labeled data, face limitations in addressing evaluation needs for emerging domains both cost-effectively and efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose the Automated Heterogeneous Information Retrieval Benchmark (AIR-Bench). AIR-Bench is distinguished by three key features: 1) Automated.

Through controlled human studies, we show this paradigm significantly improves inter-annotator agreement and enables more effective LLM development workflows. LMUnit achieves state-of-the-art performance on evaluation benchmarks (FLASK, BigGenBench) and competitive results on RewardBench.

Understanding Authentic Voter FAQs in the US and How to Improve for Informed Electoral Participation,"Vipula Rawte, Deja N Scott, Gaurav Kumar, Aishneet Juneja, Bharat Sowrya Yaddanapalli, Biplav Srivastava","Accurate information is crucial for democracy as it empowers voters to make informed decisions about their representatives and keeping them accountable. In the US, state election commissions (SECs), often required by law, are the primary providers of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to voters, and secondary sources like non-profits such as League of Women Voters (LWV) try to complement their information shortfall. However, surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge, there is neither a single source with comprehensive FAQs nor a study analyzing the data at national level to identify current practices and ways to improve the status quo. This paper addresses it by providing the {\bf first dataset on Voter FAQs covering all the US states}. Second, we introduce metrics for FAQ information quality (FIQ) with respect to questions, answers, and answers to corresponding questions. Third, we use FIQs to analyze US FAQs to identify leading, mainstream and lagging content practices and corresponding states. Finally, we identify what states across the spectrum can do to improve FAQ quality and thus, the overall information ecosystem. Across all 50 U.S. states, 12% were identified as leaders and 8% as laggards for FIQS\textsubscript{voter}, while 14% were leaders and 12% laggards for FIQS\textsubscript{developer}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15273v1,2024-12
Modality-Inconsistent Continual Learning of Multimodal Large Language Models,"Weiguo Pian, Shijian Deng, Shentong Mo, Yunhui Guo, Yapeng Tian","In this paper, we introduce Modality-Inconsistent Continual Learning (MICL), a new continual learning scenario for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that involves tasks with inconsistent modalities (image, audio, or video) and varying task types (captioning or question-answering). Unlike existing vision-only or modality-incremental settings, MICL combines modality and task type shifts, both of which drive catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose MoInCL, which employs a Pseudo Targets Generation Module to mitigate forgetting caused by task type shifts in previously seen modalities. It also incorporates Instruction-based Knowledge Distillation to preserve the model's ability to handle previously learned modalities when new ones are introduced. We benchmark MICL using a total of six tasks and conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed MoInCL. The experimental results highlight the superiority of MoInCL, showing significant improvements over representative and state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13050v1,2024-12
Harnessing Event Sensory Data for Error Pattern Prediction in Vehicles: A Language Model Approach,"Hugo Math, Rainer Lienhart, Robin Schön","In this paper, we draw an analogy between processing natural languages and processing multivariate event streams from vehicles in order to predict $\textit{when}$ and $\textit{what}$ error pattern is most likely to occur in the future for a given car. Our approach leverages the temporal dynamics and contextual relationships of our event data from a fleet of cars. Event data is composed of discrete values of error codes as well as continuous values such as time and mileage. Modelled by two causal Transformers, we can anticipate vehicle failures and malfunctions before they happen. Thus, we introduce $\textit{CarFormer}$, a Transformer model trained via a new self-supervised learning strategy, and $\textit{EPredictor}$, an autoregressive Transformer decoder model capable of predicting $\textit{when}$ and $\textit{what}$ error pattern will most likely occur after some error code apparition. Despite the challenges of high cardinality of event types, their unbalanced frequency of appearance and limited labelled data, our experimental results demonstrate the excellent predictive ability of our novel model. Specifically, with sequences of $160$ error codes on average, our model is able with only half of the error codes to achieve $80\%$ F1 score for predicting $\textit{what}$ error pattern will occur and achieves an average absolute error of $58.4 \pm 13.2$h $\textit{when}$ forecasting the time of occurrence, thus enabling confident predictive maintenance and enhancing vehicle safety.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13041v1,2024-12
NAVCON: A Cognitively Inspired and Linguistically Grounded Corpus for Vision and Language Navigation,"Karan Wanchoo, Xiaoye Zuo, Hannah Gonzalez, Soham Dan, Georgios Georgakis, Dan Roth, Kostas Daniilidis, Eleni Miltsakaki","We present NAVCON, a large-scale annotated Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) corpus built on top of two popular datasets (R2R and RxR). The paper introduces four core, cognitively motivated and linguistically grounded, navigation concepts and an algorithm for generating large-scale silver annotations of naturally occurring linguistic realizations of these concepts in navigation instructions. We pair the annotated instructions with video clips of an agent acting on these instructions. NAVCON contains 236, 316 concept annotations for approximately 30, 0000 instructions and 2.7 million aligned images (from approximately 19, 000 instructions) showing what the agent sees when executing an instruction. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive resource of navigation concepts. We evaluated the quality of the silver annotations by conducting human evaluation studies on NAVCON samples. As further validation of the quality and usefulness of the resource, we trained a model for detecting navigation concepts and their linguistic realizations in unseen instructions. Additionally, we show that few-shot learning with GPT-4o performs well on this task using large-scale silver annotations of NAVCON.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13026v2,2024-12
SimGRAG: Leveraging Similar Subgraphs for Knowledge Graphs Driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Yuzheng Cai, Zhenyue Guo, Yiwen Pei, Wanrui Bian, Weiguo Zheng","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive versatility across various tasks. To eliminate its hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach, leveraging external knowledge sources like knowledge graphs (KGs). In this paper, we study the task of KG-driven RAG and propose a novel Similar Graph Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SimGRAG) method. It effectively addresses the challenge of aligning query texts and KG structures through a two-stage process: (1) query-to-pattern, which uses an LLM to transform queries into a desired graph pattern, and (2) pattern-to-subgraph, which quantifies the alignment between the pattern and candidate subgraphs using a graph semantic distance (GSD) metric. We also develop an optimized retrieval algorithm that efficiently identifies the top-$k$ subgraphs within 1-second latency on a 10-million-scale KG. Extensive experiments show that SimGRAG outperforms state-of-the-art KG-driven RAG methods in both question answering and fact verification, offering superior plug-and-play usability and scalability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15272v1,2024-12
OmniEval: An Omnidirectional and Automatic RAG Evaluation Benchmark in Financial Domain,"Shuting Wang, Jiejun Tan, Zhicheng Dou, Ji-Rong Wen","As a typical and practical application of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have gained extensive attention, particularly in vertical domains where LLMs may lack domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we introduce an omnidirectional and automatic RAG benchmark, OmniEval, in the financial domain. Our benchmark is characterized by its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including (1) a matrix-based RAG scenario evaluation system that categorizes queries into five task classes and 16 financial topics, leading to a structured assessment of diverse query scenarios; (2) a multi-dimensional evaluation data generation approach, which combines GPT-4-based automatic generation and human annotation, achieving an 87.47\% acceptance ratio in human evaluations on generated instances; (3) a multi-stage evaluation system that evaluates both retrieval and generation performance, result in a comprehensive evaluation on the RAG pipeline; and (4) robust evaluation metrics derived from rule-based and LLM-based ones, enhancing the reliability of assessments through manual annotations and supervised fine-tuning of an LLM evaluator. Our experiments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of OmniEval, which includes extensive test datasets and highlights the performance variations of RAG systems across diverse topics and tasks, revealing significant opportunities for RAG models to improve their capabilities in vertical domains.

RCLMuFN: Relational Context Learning and Multiplex Fusion Network for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection,"Tongguan Wang, Junkai Li, Guixin Su, Yongcheng Zhang, Dongyu Su, Yuxue Hu, Ying Sha","Sarcasm typically conveys emotions of contempt or criticism by expressing a meaning that is contrary to the speaker's true intent. Accurate detection of sarcasm aids in identifying and filtering undesirable information on the Internet, thereby reducing malicious defamation and rumor-mongering. Nonetheless, the task of automatic sarcasm detection remains highly challenging for machines, as it critically depends on intricate factors such as relational context. Most existing multimodal sarcasm detection methods focus on introducing graph structures to establish entity relationships between text and images while neglecting to learn the relational context between text and images, which is crucial evidence for understanding the meaning of sarcasm. In addition, the meaning of sarcasm changes with the evolution of different contexts, but existing methods may not be accurate in modeling such dynamic changes, limiting the generalization ability of the models. To address the above issues, we propose a relational context learning and multiplex fusion network (RCLMuFN) for multimodal sarcasm detection. Firstly, we employ four feature extractors to comprehensively extract features from raw text and images, aiming to excavate potential features that may have been previously overlooked. Secondly, we utilize the relational context learning module to learn the contextual information of text and images and capture the dynamic properties through shallow and deep interactions. Finally, we employ a multiplex feature fusion module to enhance the generalization of the model by penetratingly integrating multimodal features derived from various interaction contexts. Extensive experiments on two multimodal sarcasm detection datasets show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13008v1,2024-12
Enabling Low-Resource Language Retrieval: Establishing Baselines for Urdu MS MARCO,"Umer Butt, Stalin Veranasi, Günter Neumann","As the Information Retrieval (IR) field increasingly recognizes the importance of inclusivity, addressing the needs of low-resource languages remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the first large-scale Urdu IR dataset, created by translating the MS MARCO dataset through machine translation. We establish baseline results through zero-shot learning for IR in Urdu and subsequently apply the mMARCO multilingual IR methodology to this newly translated dataset. Our findings demonstrate that the fine-tuned model (Urdu-mT5-mMARCO) achieves a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@10) of 0.247 and a Recall@10 of 0.439, representing significant improvements over zero-shot results and showing the potential for expanding IR access for Urdu speakers. By bridging access gaps for speakers of low-resource languages, this work not only advances multilingual IR research but also emphasizes the ethical and societal importance of inclusive IR technologies. This work provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions for improving language representation and lays the groundwork for future research, especially in South Asian languages, which can benefit from the adaptable methods used in this study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12997v1,2024-12
Unlocking LLMs: Addressing Scarce Data and Bias Challenges in Mental Health,"Vivek Kumar, Eirini Ntoutsi, Pushpraj Singh Rajawat, Giacomo Medda, Diego Reforgiato Recupero","Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in healthcare analysis but face several challenges like hallucinations, parroting, and bias manifestation. These challenges are exacerbated in complex, sensitive, and low-resource domains. Therefore, in this work we introduce IC-AnnoMI, an expert-annotated motivational interviewing (MI) dataset built upon AnnoMI by generating in-context conversational dialogues leveraging LLMs, particularly ChatGPT. IC-AnnoMI employs targeted prompts accurately engineered through cues and tailored information, taking into account therapy style (empathy, reflection), contextual relevance, and false semantic change. Subsequently, the dialogues are annotated by experts, strictly adhering to the Motivational Interviewing Skills Code (MISC), focusing on both the psychological and linguistic dimensions of MI dialogues. We comprehensively evaluate the IC-AnnoMI dataset and ChatGPT's emotional reasoning ability and understanding of domain intricacies by modeling novel classification tasks employing several classical machine learning and current state-of-the-art transformer approaches. Finally, we discuss the effects of progressive prompting strategies and the impact of augmented data in mitigating the biases manifested in IC-AnnoM. Our contributions provide the MI community with not only a comprehensive dataset but also valuable insights for using LLMs in empathetic text generation for conversational therapy in supervised settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12981v1,2024-12
Adaptations of AI models for querying the LandMatrix database in natural language,"Fatiha Ait Kbir, Jérémy Bourgoin, Rémy Decoupes, Marie Gradeler, Roberto Interdonato","The Land Matrix initiative (https://landmatrix.org) and its global observatory aim to provide reliable data on large-scale land acquisitions to inform debates and actions in sectors such as agriculture, extraction, or energy in low- and middle-income countries. Although these data are recognized in the academic world, they remain underutilized in public policy, mainly due to the complexity of access and exploitation, which requires technical expertise and a good understanding of the database schema.   The objective of this work is to simplify access to data from different database systems. The methods proposed in this article are evaluated using data from the Land Matrix. This work presents various comparisons of Large Language Models (LLMs) as well as combinations of LLM adaptations (Prompt Engineering, RAG, Agents) to query different database systems (GraphQL and REST queries).

SnakModel: Lessons Learned from Training an Open Danish Large Language Model,"Mike Zhang, Max Müller-Eberstein, Elisa Bassignana, Rob van der Goot","We present SnakModel, a Danish large language model (LLM) based on Llama2-7B, which we continuously pre-train on 13.6B Danish words, and further tune on 3.7M Danish instructions. As best practices for creating LLMs for smaller language communities have yet to be established, we examine the effects of early modeling and training decisions on downstream performance throughout the entire training pipeline, including (1) the creation of a strictly curated corpus of Danish text from diverse sources; (2) the language modeling and instruction-tuning training process itself, including the analysis of intermediate training dynamics, and ablations across different hyperparameters; (3) an evaluation on eight language and culturally-specific tasks. Across these experiments SnakModel achieves the highest overall performance, outperforming multiple contemporary Llama2-7B-based models. By making SnakModel, the majority of our pre-training corpus, and the associated code available under open licenses, we hope to foster further research and development in Danish Natural Language Processing, and establish training guidelines for languages with similar resource constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12956v1,2024-12
Learning from Noisy Labels via Self-Taught On-the-Fly Meta Loss Rescaling,"Michael Heck, Christian Geishauser, Nurul Lubis, Carel van Niekerk, Shutong Feng, Hsien-Chin Lin, Benjamin Matthias Ruppik, Renato Vukovic, Milica Gašić","Correct labels are indispensable for training effective machine learning models. However, creating high-quality labels is expensive, and even professionally labeled data contains errors and ambiguities. Filtering and denoising can be applied to curate labeled data prior to training, at the cost of additional processing and loss of information. An alternative is on-the-fly sample reweighting during the training process to decrease the negative impact of incorrect or ambiguous labels, but this typically requires clean seed data. In this work we propose unsupervised on-the-fly meta loss rescaling to reweight training samples. Crucially, we rely only on features provided by the model being trained, to learn a rescaling function in real time without knowledge of the true clean data distribution. We achieve this via a novel meta learning setup that samples validation data for the meta update directly from the noisy training corpus by employing the rescaling function being trained. Our proposed method consistently improves performance across various NLP tasks with minimal computational overhead. Further, we are among the first to attempt on-the-fly training data reweighting on the challenging task of dialogue modeling, where noisy and ambiguous labels are common. Our strategy is robust in the face of noisy and clean data, handles class imbalance, and prevents overfitting to noisy labels. Our self-taught loss rescaling improves as the model trains, showing the ability to keep learning from the model's own signals. As training progresses, the impact of correctly labeled data is scaled up, while the impact of wrongly labeled data is suppressed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12955v1,2024-12
Recipient Profiling: Predicting Characteristics from Messages,"Martin Borquez, Mikaela Keller, Michael Perrot, Damien Sileo","It has been shown in the field of Author Profiling that texts may inadvertently reveal sensitive information about their authors, such as gender or age. This raises important privacy concerns that have been extensively addressed in the literature, in particular with the development of methods to hide such information. We argue that, when these texts are in fact messages exchanged between individuals, this is not the end of the story. Indeed, in this case, a second party, the intended recipient, is also involved and should be considered. In this work, we investigate the potential privacy leaks affecting them, that is we propose and address the problem of Recipient Profiling. We provide empirical evidence that such a task is feasible on several publicly accessible datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sileod/recipient_profiling). Furthermore, we show that the learned models can be transferred to other datasets, albeit with a loss in accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12954v1,2024-12
MOPO: Multi-Objective Prompt Optimization for Affective Text Generation,"Yarik Menchaca Resendiz, Roman Klinger","How emotions are expressed depends on the context and domain. On X (formerly Twitter), for instance, an author might simply use the hashtag #anger, while in a news headline, emotions are typically written in a more polite, indirect manner. To enable conditional text generation models to create emotionally connotated texts that fit a domain, users need to have access to a parameter that allows them to choose the appropriate way to express an emotion. To achieve this, we introduce MOPO, a Multi-Objective Prompt Optimization methodology. MOPO optimizes prompts according to multiple objectives (which correspond here to the output probabilities assigned by emotion classifiers trained for different domains). In contrast to single objective optimization, MOPO outputs a set of prompts, each with a different weighting of the multiple objectives. Users can then choose the most appropriate prompt for their context. We evaluate MOPO using three objectives, determined by various domain-specific emotion classifiers. MOPO improves performance by up to 15 pp across all objectives with a minimal loss (1-2 pp) for any single objective compared to single-objective optimization. These minor performance losses are offset by a broader generalization across multiple objectives - which is not possible with single-objective optimization. Additionally, MOPO reduces computational requirements by simultaneously optimizing for multiple objectives, eliminating separate optimization procedures for each objective.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12948v1,2024-12
Improving Fine-grained Visual Understanding in VLMs through Text-Only Training,"Dasol Choi, Guijin Son, Soo Yong Kim, Gio Paik, Seunghyeok Hong","Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have become a powerful tool for bridging the gap between visual and linguistic understanding. However, the conventional learning approaches for VLMs often suffer from limitations, such as the high resource requirements of collecting and training image-text paired data. Recent research has suggested that language understanding plays a crucial role in the performance of VLMs, potentially indicating that text-only training could be a viable approach. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of enhancing fine-grained visual understanding in VLMs through text-only training. Inspired by how humans develop visual concept understanding, where rich textual descriptions can guide visual recognition, we hypothesize that VLMs can also benefit from leveraging text-based representations to improve their visual recognition abilities. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two distinct domains: fine-grained species classification and cultural visual understanding tasks. Our findings demonstrate that text-only training can be comparable to conventional image-text training while significantly reducing computational costs. This suggests a more efficient and cost-effective pathway for advancing VLM capabilities, particularly valuable in resource-constrained environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12940v1,2024-12
Truthful Text Sanitization Guided by Inference Attacks,"Ildikó Pilán, Benet Manzanares-Salor, David Sánchez, Pierre Lison","The purpose of text sanitization is to rewrite those text spans in a document that may directly or indirectly identify an individual, to ensure they no longer disclose personal information. Text sanitization must strike a balance between preventing the leakage of personal information (privacy protection) while also retaining as much of the document's original content as possible (utility preservation). We present an automated text sanitization strategy based on generalizations, which are more abstract (but still informative) terms that subsume the semantic content of the original text spans. The approach relies on instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) and is divided into two stages. The LLM is first applied to obtain truth-preserving replacement candidates and rank them according to their abstraction level. Those candidates are then evaluated for their ability to protect privacy by conducting inference attacks with the LLM. Finally, the system selects the most informative replacement shown to be resistant to those attacks. As a consequence of this two-stage process, the chosen replacements effectively balance utility and privacy. We also present novel metrics to automatically evaluate these two aspects without the need to manually annotate data. Empirical results on the Text Anonymization Benchmark show that the proposed approach leads to enhanced utility, with only a marginal increase in the risk of re-identifying protected individuals compared to fully suppressing the original information. Furthermore, the selected replacements are shown to be more truth-preserving and abstractive than previous methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12928v1,2024-12
An Agentic Approach to Automatic Creation of P&ID Diagrams from Natural Language Descriptions,"Shreeyash Gowaikar, Srinivasan Iyengar, Sameer Segal, Shivkumar Kalyanaraman","The Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs) are foundational to the design, construction, and operation of workflows in the engineering and process industries. However, their manual creation is often labor-intensive, error-prone, and lacks robust mechanisms for error detection and correction. While recent advancements in Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, their application in automating generation of engineering workflows remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel copilot for automating the generation of P&IDs from natural language descriptions. Leveraging a multi-step agentic workflow, our copilot provides a structured and iterative approach to diagram creation directly from Natural Language prompts. We demonstrate the feasibility of the generation process by evaluating the soundness and completeness of the workflow, and show improved results compared to vanilla zero-shot and few-shot generation approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12898v1,2024-12
Question: How do Large Language Models perform on the Question Answering tasks? Answer:,"Kevin Fischer, Darren Fürst, Sebastian Steindl, Jakob Lindner, Ulrich Schäfer","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been showing promising results for various NLP-tasks without the explicit need to be trained for these tasks by using few-shot or zero-shot prompting techniques. A common NLP-task is question-answering (QA). In this study, we propose a comprehensive performance comparison between smaller fine-tuned models and out-of-the-box instruction-following LLMs on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset 2.0 (SQuAD2), specifically when using a single-inference prompting technique. Since the dataset contains unanswerable questions, previous work used a double inference method. We propose a prompting style which aims to elicit the same ability without the need for double inference, saving compute time and resources. Furthermore, we investigate their generalization capabilities by comparing their performance on similar but different QA datasets, without fine-tuning neither model, emulating real-world uses where the context and questions asked may differ from the original training distribution, for example swapping Wikipedia for news articles.   Our results show that smaller, fine-tuned models outperform current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) LLMs on the fine-tuned task, but recent SOTA models are able to close this gap on the out-of-distribution test and even outperform the fine-tuned models on 3 of the 5 tested QA datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12893v1,2024-12
RAG-Star: Enhancing Deliberative Reasoning with Retrieval Augmented Verification and Refinement,"Jinhao Jiang, Jiayi Chen, Junyi Li, Ruiyang Ren, Shijie Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yang Song, Tao Zhang","Existing large language models (LLMs) show exceptional problem-solving capabilities but might struggle with complex reasoning tasks. Despite the successes of chain-of-thought and tree-based search methods, they mainly depend on the internal knowledge of LLMs to search over intermediate reasoning steps, limited to dealing with simple tasks involving fewer reasoning steps. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RAG-Star}, a novel RAG approach that integrates the retrieved information to guide the tree-based deliberative reasoning process that relies on the inherent knowledge of LLMs. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search, RAG-Star iteratively plans intermediate sub-queries and answers for reasoning based on the LLM itself. To consolidate internal and external knowledge, we propose an retrieval-augmented verification that utilizes query- and answer-aware reward modeling to provide feedback for the inherent reasoning of LLMs. Our experiments involving Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and GPT-4o demonstrate that RAG-Star significantly outperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12881v1,2024-12
Preference-Oriented Supervised Fine-Tuning: Favoring Target Model Over Aligned Large Language Models,"Yuchen Fan, Yuzhong Hong, Qiushi Wang, Junwei Bao, Hongfei Jiang, Yang Song","Alignment, endowing a pre-trained Large language model (LLM) with the ability to follow instructions, is crucial for its real-world applications. Conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods formalize it as causal language modeling typically with a cross-entropy objective, requiring a large amount of high-quality instruction-response pairs. However, the quality of widely used SFT datasets can not be guaranteed due to the high cost and intensive labor for the creation and maintenance in practice. To overcome the limitations associated with the quality of SFT datasets, we introduce a novel \textbf{p}reference-\textbf{o}riented supervised \textbf{f}ine-\textbf{t}uning approach, namely PoFT. The intuition is to boost SFT by imposing a particular preference: \textit{favoring the target model over aligned LLMs on the same SFT data.} This preference encourages the target model to predict a higher likelihood than that predicted by the aligned LLMs, incorporating assessment information on data quality (i.e., predicted likelihood by the aligned LLMs) into the training process. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. PoFT achieves stable and consistent improvements over the SFT baselines across different training datasets and base models. Moreover, we prove that PoFT can be integrated with existing SFT data filtering methods to achieve better performance, and further improved by following preference optimization procedures, such as DPO.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12865v1,2024-12
DISC: Plug-and-Play Decoding Intervention with Similarity of Characters for Chinese Spelling Check,"Ziheng Qiao, Houquan Zhou, Yumeng Liu, Zhenghua Li, Min Zhang, Bo Zhang, Chen Li, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang","One key characteristic of the Chinese spelling check (CSC) task is that incorrect characters are usually similar to the correct ones in either phonetics or glyph. To accommodate this, previous works usually leverage confusion sets, which suffer from two problems, i.e., difficulty in determining which character pairs to include and lack of probabilities to distinguish items in the set. In this paper, we propose a light-weight plug-and-play DISC (i.e., decoding intervention with similarity of characters) module for CSC models.DISC measures phonetic and glyph similarities between characters and incorporates this similarity information only during the inference phase. This method can be easily integrated into various existing CSC models, such as ReaLiSe, SCOPE, and ReLM, without additional training costs. Experiments on three CSC benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves model performance, approaching and even surpassing the current state-of-the-art models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12863v1,2024-12
Selective Shot Learning for Code Explanation,"Paheli Bhattacharya, Rishabh Gupta","Code explanation plays a crucial role in the software engineering domain, aiding developers in grasping code functionality efficiently. Recent work shows that the performance of LLMs for code explanation improves in a few-shot setting, especially when the few-shot examples are selected intelligently. State-of-the-art approaches for such Selective Shot Learning (SSL) include token-based and embedding-based methods. However, these SSL approaches have been evaluated on proprietary LLMs, without much exploration on open-source Code-LLMs. Additionally, these methods lack consideration for programming language syntax. To bridge these gaps, we present a comparative study and propose a novel SSL method (SSL_ner) that utilizes entity information for few-shot example selection. We present several insights and show the effectiveness of SSL_ner approach over state-of-the-art methods across two datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic benchmarking of open-source Code-LLMs while assessing the performances of the various few-shot examples selection approaches for the code explanation task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12852v1,2024-12
Benchmarking and Understanding Compositional Relational Reasoning of LLMs,"Ruikang Ni, Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Xiangyu Li, Shihui Zheng, Hongliang Liang","Compositional relational reasoning (CRR) is a hallmark of human intelligence, but we lack a clear understanding of whether and how existing transformer large language models (LLMs) can solve CRR tasks. To enable systematic exploration of the CRR capability of LLMs, we first propose a new synthetic benchmark called Generalized Associative Recall (GAR) by integrating and generalizing the essence of several tasks in mechanistic interpretability (MI) study in a unified framework. Evaluation shows that GAR is challenging enough for existing LLMs, revealing their fundamental deficiency in CRR. Meanwhile, it is easy enough for systematic MI study. Then, to understand how LLMs solve GAR tasks, we use attribution patching to discover the core circuits reused by Vicuna-33B across different tasks and a set of vital attention heads. Intervention experiments show that the correct functioning of these heads significantly impacts task performance. Especially, we identify two classes of heads whose activations represent the abstract notion of true and false in GAR tasks respectively. They play a fundamental role in CRR across various models and tasks. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/GAR.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12841v1,2024-12
DSGram: Dynamic Weighting Sub-Metrics for Grammatical Error Correction in the Era of Large Language Models,"Jinxiang Xie, Yilin Li, Xunjian Yin, Xiaojun Wan","Evaluating the performance of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) models has become increasingly challenging, as large language model (LLM)-based GEC systems often produce corrections that diverge from provided gold references. This discrepancy undermines the reliability of traditional reference-based evaluation metrics. In this study, we propose a novel evaluation framework for GEC models, DSGram, integrating Semantic Coherence, Edit Level, and Fluency, and utilizing a dynamic weighting mechanism. Our framework employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) in conjunction with large language models to ascertain the relative importance of various evaluation criteria. Additionally, we develop a dataset incorporating human annotations and LLM-simulated sentences to validate our algorithms and fine-tune more cost-effective models. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach enhances the effectiveness of GEC model evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12832v1,2024-12
Detecting Emotional Incongruity of Sarcasm by Commonsense Reasoning,"Ziqi Qiu, Jianxing Yu, Yufeng Zhang, Hanjiang Lai, Yanghui Rao, Qinliang Su, Jian Yin","This paper focuses on sarcasm detection, which aims to identify whether given statements convey criticism, mockery, or other negative sentiment opposite to the literal meaning. To detect sarcasm, humans often require a comprehensive understanding of the semantics in the statement and even resort to external commonsense to infer the fine-grained incongruity. However, existing methods lack commonsense inferential ability when they face complex real-world scenarios, leading to unsatisfactory performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework for sarcasm detection, which conducts incongruity reasoning based on commonsense augmentation, called EICR. Concretely, we first employ retrieval-augmented large language models to supplement the missing but indispensable commonsense background knowledge. To capture complex contextual associations, we construct a dependency graph and obtain the optimized topology via graph refinement. We further introduce an adaptive reasoning skeleton that integrates prior rules to extract sentiment-inconsistent subgraphs explicitly. To eliminate the possible spurious relations between words and labels, we employ adversarial contrastive learning to enhance the robustness of the detector. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EICR.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12808v2,2024-12
Cross-Dialect Information Retrieval: Information Access in Low-Resource and High-Variance Languages,"Robert Litschko, Oliver Kraus, Verena Blaschke, Barbara Plank","A large amount of local and culture-specific knowledge (e.g., people, traditions, food) can only be found in documents written in dialects.

Dialect retrieval poses unique challenges due to the limited availability of resources to train retrieval models and the high variability in non-standardized languages. We study these challenges on the example of German dialects and introduce the first German dialect retrieval dataset, dubbed WikiDIR, which consists of seven German dialects extracted from Wikipedia. Using WikiDIR, we demonstrate the weakness of lexical methods in dealing with high lexical variation in dialects. We further show that commonly used zero-shot cross-lingual transfer approach with multilingual encoders do not transfer well to extremely low-resource setups, motivating the need for resource-lean and dialect-specific retrieval models. We finally demonstrate that (document) translation is an effective way to reduce the dialect gap in CDIR.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12806v2,2024-12
A MapReduce Approach to Effectively Utilize Long Context Information in Retrieval Augmented Language Models,"Gongbo Zhang, Zihan Xu, Qiao Jin, Fangyi Chen, Yilu Fang, Yi Liu, Justin F. Rousseau, Ziyang Xu, Zhiyong Lu, Chunhua Weng, Yifan Peng","While holding great promise for improving and facilitating healthcare, large language models (LLMs) struggle to produce up-to-date responses on evolving topics due to outdated knowledge or hallucination. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a pivotal innovation that improves the accuracy and relevance of LLM responses by integrating LLMs with a search engine and external sources of knowledge. However, the quality of RAG responses can be largely impacted by the rank and density of key information in the retrieval results, such as the ""lost-in-the-middle"" problem. In this work, we aim to improve the robustness and reliability of the RAG workflow in the medical domain. Specifically, we propose a map-reduce strategy, BriefContext, to combat the ""lost-in-the-middle"" issue without modifying the model weights. We demonstrated the advantage of the workflow with various LLM backbones and on multiple QA datasets. This method promises to improve the safety and reliability of LLMs deployed in healthcare domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15271v1,2024-12
Is it the end of (generative) linguistics as we know it?,Cristiano Chesi,"A significant debate has emerged in response to a paper written by Steven Piantadosi (Piantadosi, 2023) and uploaded to the LingBuzz platform, the open archive for generative linguistics. Piantadosi's dismissal of Chomsky's approach is ruthless, but generative linguists deserve it. In this paper, I will adopt three idealized perspectives -- computational, theoretical, and experimental -- to focus on two fundamental issues that lend partial support to Piantadosi's critique: (a) the evidence challenging the Poverty of Stimulus (PoS) hypothesis and (b) the notion of simplicity as conceived within mainstream Minimalism. In conclusion, I argue that, to reclaim a central role in language studies, generative linguistics -- representing a prototypical theoretical perspective on language -- needs a serious update leading to (i) more precise, consistent, and complete formalizations of foundational intuitions and (ii) the establishment and utilization of a standardized dataset of crucial empirical evidence to evaluate the theory's adequacy. On the other hand, ignoring the formal perspective leads to major drawbacks in both computational and experimental approaches. Neither descriptive nor explanatory adequacy can be easily achieved without the precise formulation of general principles that can be challenged empirically.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12797v1,2024-12
A Survey of Calibration Process for Black-Box LLMs,"Liangru Xie, Hui Liu, Jingying Zeng, Xianfeng Tang, Yan Han, Chen Luo, Jing Huang, Zhen Li, Suhang Wang, Qi He","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance in semantic understanding and generation, yet accurately assessing their output reliability remains a significant challenge. While numerous studies have explored calibration techniques, they primarily focus on White-Box LLMs with accessible parameters. Black-Box LLMs, despite their superior performance, pose heightened requirements for calibration techniques due to their API-only interaction constraints. Although recent researches have achieved breakthroughs in black-box LLMs calibration, a systematic survey of these methodologies is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we presents the first comprehensive survey on calibration techniques for black-box LLMs. We first define the Calibration Process of LLMs as comprising two interrelated key steps: Confidence Estimation and Calibration. Second, we conduct a systematic review of applicable methods within black-box settings, and provide insights on the unique challenges and connections in implementing these key steps. Furthermore, we explore typical applications of Calibration Process in black-box LLMs and outline promising future research directions, providing new perspectives for enhancing reliability and human-machine alignment.

Revealing the impact of synthetic native samples and multi-tasking strategies in Hindi-English code-mixed humour and sarcasm detection,"Debajyoti Mazumder, Aakash Kumar, Jasabanta Patro","In this paper, we reported our experiments with various strategies to improve code-mixed humour and sarcasm detection. We did all of our experiments for Hindi-English code-mixed scenario, as we have the linguistic expertise for the same. We experimented with three approaches, namely (i) native sample mixing, (ii) multi-task learning (MTL), and (iii) prompting very large multilingual language models (VMLMs). In native sample mixing, we added monolingual task samples in code-mixed training sets. In MTL learning, we relied on native and code-mixed samples of a semantically related task (hate detection in our case). Finally, in our third approach, we evaluated the efficacy of VMLMs via few-shot context prompting. Some interesting findings we got are (i) adding native samples improved humor (raising the F1-score up to 6.76%) and sarcasm (raising the F1-score up to 8.64%) detection, (ii) training MLMs in an MTL framework boosted performance for both humour (raising the F1-score up to 10.67%) and sarcasm (increment up to 12.35% in F1-score) detection, and (iii) prompting VMLMs couldn't outperform the other approaches. Finally, our ablation studies and error analysis discovered the cases where our model is yet to improve. We provided our code for reproducibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12761v1,2024-12
Your Next State-of-the-Art Could Come from Another Domain: A Cross-Domain Analysis of Hierarchical Text Classification,"Nan Li, Bo Kang, Tijl De Bie","Text classification with hierarchical labels is a prevalent and challenging task in natural language processing. Examples include assigning ICD codes to patient records, tagging patents into IPC classes, assigning EUROVOC descriptors to European legal texts, and more. Despite its widespread applications, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art methods across different domains has been lacking. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive cross-domain overview with empirical analysis of state-of-the-art methods. We propose a unified framework that positions each method within a common structure to facilitate research. Our empirical analysis yields key insights and guidelines, confirming the necessity of learning across different research areas to design effective methods. Notably, under our unified evaluation pipeline, we achieved new state-of-the-art results by applying techniques beyond their original domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12744v1,2024-12
GIRAFFE: Design Choices for Extending the Context Length of Visual Language Models,"Mukai Li, Lei Li, Shansan Gong, Qi Liu","Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in processing multimodal inputs, yet applications such as visual agents, which require handling multiple images and high-resolution videos, demand enhanced long-range modeling. Moreover, existing open-source VLMs lack systematic exploration into extending their context length, and commercial models often provide limited details. To tackle this, we aim to establish an effective solution that enhances long context performance of VLMs while preserving their capacities in short context scenarios. Towards this goal, we make the best design choice through extensive experiment settings from data curation to context window extending and utilizing: (1) we analyze data sources and length distributions to construct ETVLM - a data recipe to balance the performance across scenarios; (2) we examine existing position extending methods, identify their limitations and propose M-RoPE++ as an enhanced approach; we also choose to solely instruction-tune the backbone with mixed-source data; (3) we discuss how to better utilize extended context windows and propose hybrid-resolution training. Built on the Qwen-VL series model, we propose Giraffe, which is effectively extended to 128K lengths. Evaluated on extensive long context VLM benchmarks such as VideoMME and Viusal Haystacks, our Giraffe achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly sized open-source long VLMs and is competitive with commercial model GPT-4V. We will open-source the code, data, and models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12735v1,2024-12
EventFull: Complete and Consistent Event Relation Annotation,"Alon Eirew, Eviatar Nachshoni, Aviv Slobodkin, Ido Dagan","Event relation detection is a fundamental NLP task, leveraged in many downstream applications, whose modeling requires datasets annotated with event relations of various types. However, systematic and complete annotation of these relations is costly and challenging, due to the quadratic number of event pairs that need to be considered. Consequently, many current event relation datasets lack systematicity and completeness. In response, we introduce \textit{EventFull}, the first tool that supports consistent, complete and efficient annotation of temporal, causal and coreference relations via a unified and synergetic process. A pilot study demonstrates that EventFull accelerates and simplifies the annotation process while yielding high inter-annotator agreement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12733v1,2024-12
SentiQNF: A Novel Approach to Sentiment Analysis Using Quantum Algorithms and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems,"Kshitij Dave, Nouhaila Innan, Bikash K. Behera, Zahid Mumtaz, Saif Al-Kuwari, Ahmed Farouk","Sentiment analysis is an essential component of natural language processing, used to analyze sentiments, attitudes, and emotional tones in various contexts. It provides valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and user experiences. Researchers have developed various classical machine learning and neuro-fuzzy approaches to address the exponential growth of data and the complexity of language structures in sentiment analysis. However, these approaches often fail to determine the optimal number of clusters, interpret results accurately, handle noise or outliers efficiently, and scale effectively to high-dimensional data. Additionally, they are frequently insensitive to input variations. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach for sentiment analysis called the Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (QFNN), which leverages quantum properties and incorporates a fuzzy layer to overcome the limitations of classical sentiment analysis algorithms. In this study, we test the proposed approach on two Twitter datasets: the Coronavirus Tweets Dataset (CVTD) and the General Sentimental Tweets Dataset (GSTD), and compare it with classical and hybrid algorithms. The results demonstrate that QFNN outperforms all classical, quantum, and hybrid algorithms, achieving 100% and 90% accuracy in the case of CVTD and GSTD, respectively. Furthermore, QFNN demonstrates its robustness against six different noise models, providing the potential to tackle the computational complexity associated with sentiment analysis on a large scale in a noisy environment. The proposed approach expedites sentiment data processing and precisely analyses different forms of textual data, thereby enhancing sentiment classification and insights associated with sentiment analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12731v1,2024-12
Enhancing Naturalness in LLM-Generated Utterances through Disfluency Insertion,"Syed Zohaib Hassan, Pierre Lison, Pål Halvorsen","Disfluencies are a natural feature of spontaneous human speech but are typically absent from the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). This absence can diminish the perceived naturalness of synthesized speech, which is an important criteria when building conversational agents that aim to mimick human behaviours. We show how the insertion of disfluencies can alleviate this shortcoming. The proposed approach involves (1) fine-tuning an LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to incorporate various types of disfluencies into LLM-generated utterances and (2) synthesizing those utterances using a text-to-speech model that supports the generation of speech phenomena such as disfluencies. We evaluated the quality of the generated speech across two metrics: intelligibility and perceived spontaneity. We demonstrate through a user study that the insertion of disfluencies significantly increase the perceived spontaneity of the generated speech. This increase came, however, along with a slight reduction in intelligibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12710v1,2024-12
"More Tokens, Lower Precision: Towards the Optimal Token-Precision Trade-off in KV Cache Compression","Jiebin Zhang, Dawei Zhu, Yifan Song, Wenhao Wu, Chuqiao Kuang, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Sujian Li","As large language models (LLMs) process increasing context windows, the memory usage of KV cache has become a critical bottleneck during inference. The mainstream KV compression methods, including KV pruning and KV quantization, primarily focus on either token or precision dimension and seldom explore the efficiency of their combination. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. Experiments demonstrate that storing more tokens in the KV cache with lower precision, i.e., quantized pruning, can significantly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs. Furthermore, in-depth analysis regarding token-precision trade-off from a series of key aspects exhibit that, quantized pruning achieves substantial improvements in retrieval-related tasks and consistently performs well across varying input lengths. Moreover, quantized pruning demonstrates notable stability across different KV pruning methods, quantization strategies, and model scales. These findings provide valuable insights into the token-precision trade-off in KV cache compression. We plan to release our code in the near future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12706v1,2024-12
Trigger$^3$: Refining Query Correction via Adaptive Model Selector,"Kepu Zhang, Zhongxiang Sun, Xiao Zhang, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Jun Xu","In search scenarios, user experience can be hindered by erroneous queries due to typos, voice errors, or knowledge gaps. Therefore, query correction is crucial for search engines. Current correction models, usually small models trained on specific data, often struggle with queries beyond their training scope or those requiring contextual understanding. While the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a potential solution, they are still limited by their pre-training data and inference cost, particularly for complex queries, making them not always effective for query correction. To tackle these, we propose Trigger$^3$, a large-small model collaboration framework that integrates the traditional correction model and LLM for query correction, capable of adaptively choosing the appropriate correction method based on the query and the correction results from the traditional correction model and LLM. Trigger$^3$ first employs a correction trigger to filter out correct queries. Incorrect queries are then corrected by the traditional correction model. If this fails, an LLM trigger is activated to call the LLM for correction. Finally, for queries that no model can correct, a fallback trigger decides to return the original query. Extensive experiments demonstrate Trigger$^3$ outperforms correction baselines while maintaining efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12701v1,2024-12

To address this imbalance, we propose a probing method named XTransplant that explores cross-lingual latent interactions via cross-lingual feed-forward transplantation during inference stage, with the hope of enabling the model to leverage the strengths of both English and non-English languages. Through extensive pilot experiments, we empirically prove that both the multilingual capabilities and cultural adaptability of LLMs hold the potential to be significantly improved by XTransplant, respectively from En -> non-En and non-En -> En, highlighting the underutilization of current LLMs' multilingual potential. And the patterns observed in these pilot experiments further motivate an offline scaling inference strategy, which demonstrates consistent performance improvements in multilingual and culture-aware tasks, sometimes even surpassing multilingual supervised fine-tuning. And we do hope our further analysis and discussion could help gain deeper insights into XTransplant mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12686v1,2024-12
Detecting Document-level Paraphrased Machine Generated Content: Mimicking Human Writing Style and Involving Discourse Features,"Yupei Li, Manuel Milling, Lucia Specia, Björn W. Schuller","The availability of high-quality APIs for Large Language Models (LLMs) has facilitated the widespread creation of Machine-Generated Content (MGC), posing challenges such as academic plagiarism and the spread of misinformation. Existing MGC detectors often focus solely on surface-level information, overlooking implicit and structural features. This makes them susceptible to deception by surface-level sentence patterns, particularly for longer texts and in texts that have been subsequently paraphrased.   To overcome these challenges, we introduce novel methodologies and datasets. Besides the publicly available dataset Plagbench, we developed the paraphrased Long-Form Question and Answer (paraLFQA) and paraphrased Writing Prompts (paraWP) datasets using GPT and DIPPER, a discourse paraphrasing tool, by extending artifacts from their original versions. To address the challenge of detecting highly similar paraphrased texts, we propose MhBART, an encoder-decoder model designed to emulate human writing style while incorporating a novel difference score mechanism. This model outperforms strong classifier baselines and identifies deceptive sentence patterns. To better capture the structure of longer texts at document level, we propose DTransformer, a model that integrates discourse analysis through PDTB preprocessing to encode structural features. It results in substantial performance gains across both datasets -- 15.5\% absolute improvement on paraLFQA, 4\% absolute improvement on paraWP, and 1.5\% absolute improvement on M4 compared to SOTA approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12679v1,2024-12
Train More Parameters But Mind Their Placement: Insights into Language Adaptation with PEFT,Jenny Kunz,"Smaller LLMs still face significant challenges even in medium-resourced languages, particularly when it comes to language-specific knowledge -- a problem not easily resolved with machine-translated data. In this case study on Icelandic, we aim to enhance the generation performance of an LLM by specialising it using unstructured text corpora. A key focus is on preventing interference with the models' capabilities of handling longer context during this adaptation. Through ablation studies using various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and setups, we find that increasing the number of trainable parameters leads to better and more robust language adaptation. LoRAs placed in the feed-forward layers and bottleneck adapters show promising results with sufficient parameters, while prefix tuning and (IA)3 are not suitable. Although improvements are consistent in 0-shot summarisation, some adapted models struggle with longer context lengths, an issue that can be mitigated by adapting only the final layers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12674v1,2024-12
MedMax: Mixed-Modal Instruction Tuning for Training Biomedical Assistants,"Hritik Bansal, Daniel Israel, Siyan Zhao, Shufan Li, Tung Nguyen, Aditya Grover","Recent advancements in mixed-modal generative models have enabled flexible integration of information across image-text content. These models have opened new avenues for developing unified biomedical assistants capable of analyzing biomedical images, answering complex questions about them, and predicting the impact of medical procedures on a patient's health. However, existing resources face challenges such as limited data availability, narrow domain coverage, and restricted sources (e.g., medical papers). To address these gaps, we present MedMax, the first large-scale multimodal biomedical instruction-tuning dataset for mixed-modal foundation models. With 1.47 million instances, MedMax encompasses a diverse range of tasks, including multimodal content generation (interleaved image-text data), biomedical image captioning and generation, visual chatting, and report understanding. These tasks span diverse medical domains such as radiology and histopathology. Subsequently, we fine-tune a mixed-modal foundation model on the MedMax dataset, achieving significant performance improvements: a 26% gain over the Chameleon model and an 18.3% improvement over GPT-4o across 12 downstream biomedical visual question-answering tasks. Additionally, we introduce a unified evaluation suite for biomedical tasks, providing a robust framework to guide the development of next-generation mixed-modal biomedical AI assistants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12661v1,2024-12
ClustEm4Ano: Clustering Text Embeddings of Nominal Textual Attributes for Microdata Anonymization,"Robert Aufschläger, Sebastian Wilhelm, Michael Heigl, Martin Schramm","This work introduces ClustEm4Ano, an anonymization pipeline that can be used for generalization and suppression-based anonymization of nominal textual tabular data. It automatically generates value generalization hierarchies (VGHs) that, in turn, can be used to generalize attributes in quasi-identifiers. The pipeline leverages embeddings to generate semantically close value generalizations through iterative clustering. We applied KMeans and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering on $13$ different predefined text embeddings (both open and closed-source (via APIs)). Our approach is experimentally tested on a well-known benchmark dataset for anonymization: The UCI Machine Learning Repository's Adult dataset. ClustEm4Ano supports anonymization procedures by offering more possibilities compared to using arbitrarily chosen VGHs. Experiments demonstrate that these VGHs can outperform manually constructed ones in terms of downstream efficacy (especially for small $k$-anonymity ($2 \leq k \leq 30$)) and therefore can foster the quality of anonymized datasets. Our implementation is made public.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12649v1,2024-12
iPrOp: Interactive Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models with a Human in the Loop,"Jiahui Li, Roman Klinger","Prompt engineering has made significant contributions to the era of large language models, yet its effectiveness depends on the skills of a prompt author. Automatic prompt optimization can support the prompt development process, but requires annotated data. This paper introduces $\textit{iPrOp}$, a novel Interactive Prompt Optimization system, to bridge manual prompt engineering and automatic prompt optimization. With human intervention in the optimization loop, $\textit{iPrOp}$ offers users the flexibility to assess evolving prompts. We present users with prompt variations, selected instances, large language model predictions accompanied by corresponding explanations, and performance metrics derived from a subset of the training data. This approach empowers users to choose and further refine the provided prompts based on their individual preferences and needs. This system not only assists non-technical domain experts in generating optimal prompts tailored to their specific tasks or domains, but also enables to study the intrinsic parameters that influence the performance of prompt optimization. Our evaluation shows that our system has the capability to generate improved prompts, leading to enhanced task performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12644v1,2024-12
LLM-based Discriminative Reasoning for Knowledge Graph Question Answering,"Mufan Xu, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) based on generative pre-trained Transformer have achieved remarkable performance on knowledge graph question-answering (KGQA) tasks. However, LLMs often produce ungrounded subgraph planning or reasoning results in KGQA due to the hallucinatory behavior brought by the generative paradigm, which may hinder the advancement of the LLM-based KGQA model. To deal with the issue, we propose a novel LLM-based Discriminative Reasoning (LDR) method to explicitly model the subgraph retrieval and answer inference process. By adopting discriminative strategies, the proposed LDR method not only enhances the capability of LLMs to retrieve question-related subgraphs but also alleviates the issue of ungrounded reasoning brought by the generative paradigm of LLMs. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms multiple strong comparison methods, along with achieving state-of-the-art performance on two widely used WebQSP and CWQ benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12643v1,2024-12

In this work, we report the development of the Baichuan4-Finance series, including a comprehensive suite of foundational Baichuan4-Finance-Base and an aligned language model Baichuan4-Finance, which are built upon Baichuan4-Turbo base model and tailored for finance domain. Firstly, we have dedicated significant effort to building a detailed pipeline for improving data quality. Moreover, in the continual pre-training phase, we propose a novel domain self-constraint training strategy, which enables Baichuan4-Finance-Base to acquire financial knowledge without losing general capabilities. After Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and AI Feedback, the chat model Baichuan4-Finance is able to tackle various financial certification questions and real-world scenario applications. We evaluate Baichuan4-Finance on many widely used general datasets and two holistic financial benchmarks. The evaluation results show that Baichuan4-Finance-Base surpasses almost all competitive baselines on financial tasks by significant margins without sacrificing performance on general LLM benchmarks.

The Reliability Paradox: Exploring How Shortcut Learning Undermines Language Model Calibration,"Geetanjali Bihani, Julia Rayz","The advent of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has enabled significant performance gains in the field of natural language processing. However, recent studies have found PLMs to suffer from miscalibration, indicating a lack of accuracy in the confidence estimates provided by these models. Current evaluation methods for PLM calibration often assume that lower calibration error estimates indicate more reliable predictions. However, fine-tuned PLMs often resort to shortcuts, leading to overconfident predictions that create the illusion of enhanced performance but lack generalizability in their decision rules. The relationship between PLM reliability, as measured by calibration error, and shortcut learning, has not been thoroughly explored thus far. This paper aims to investigate this relationship, studying whether lower calibration error implies reliable decision rules for a language model. Our findings reveal that models with seemingly superior calibration portray higher levels of non-generalizable decision rules. This challenges the prevailing notion that well-calibrated models are inherently reliable. Our study highlights the need to bridge the current gap between language model calibration and generalization objectives, urging the development of comprehensive frameworks to achieve truly robust and reliable language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15269v1,2024-12
Falcon: Faster and Parallel Inference of Large Language Models through Enhanced Semi-Autoregressive Drafting and Custom-Designed Decoding Tree,"Xiangxiang Gao, Weisheng Xie, Yiwei Xiang, Feng Ji","Striking an optimal balance between minimal drafting latency and high speculation accuracy to enhance the inference speed of Large Language Models remains a significant challenge in speculative decoding. In this paper, we introduce Falcon, an innovative semi-autoregressive speculative decoding framework fashioned to augment both the drafter's parallelism and output quality. Falcon incorporates the Coupled Sequential Glancing Distillation technique, which fortifies inter-token dependencies within the same block, leading to increased speculation accuracy. We offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis to illuminate the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce a Custom-Designed Decoding Tree, which permits the drafter to generate multiple tokens in a single forward pass and accommodates multiple forward passes as needed, thereby boosting the number of drafted tokens and significantly improving the overall acceptance rate. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as MT-Bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K demonstrate Falcon's superior acceleration capabilities. The framework achieves a lossless speedup ratio ranging from 2.91x to 3.51x when tested on the Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat model series. These results outstrip existing speculative decoding methods for LLMs, including Eagle, Medusa, Lookahead, SPS, and PLD, while maintaining a compact drafter architecture equivalent to merely two Transformer layers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12639v2,2024-12
What External Knowledge is Preferred by LLMs? Characterizing and Exploring Chain of Evidence in Imperfect Context,"Zhiyuan Chang, Mingyang Li, Xiaojun Jia, Junjie Wang, Yuekai Huang, Qing Wang, Yihao Huang, Yang Liu","Incorporating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate outdated knowledge and hallucination in LLMs. However, external knowledge is often imperfect. In addition to useful knowledge, external knowledge is rich in irrelevant or misinformation in the context that can impair the reliability of LLM responses. This paper focuses on LLMs' preferred external knowledge in imperfect contexts when handling multi-hop QA. Inspired by criminal procedural law's Chain of Evidence (CoE), we characterize that knowledge preferred by LLMs should maintain both relevance to the question and mutual support among knowledge pieces. Accordingly, we propose an automated CoE discrimination approach and explore LLMs' preferences from their effectiveness, faithfulness and robustness, as well as CoE's usability in a naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) case. The evaluation on five LLMs reveals that CoE enhances LLMs through more accurate generation, stronger answer faithfulness, better robustness against knowledge conflict, and improved performance in a popular RAG case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12632v1,2024-12

Compared to other NLP tasks, multilingual and multi-label emotion evaluation tasks are under-explored in LLMs. In this paper, we present EthioEmo, a multi-label emotion classification dataset for four Ethiopian languages, namely, Amharic (amh), Afan Oromo (orm), Somali (som), and Tigrinya (tir). We perform extensive experiments with an additional English multi-label emotion dataset from SemEval 2018 Task 1. Our evaluation includes encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only language models. We compare zero and few-shot approaches of LLMs to fine-tuning smaller language models. The results show that accurate multi-label emotion classification is still insufficient even for high-resource languages such as English, and there is a large gap between the performance of high-resource and low-resource languages. The results also show varying performance levels depending on the language and model type. EthioEmo is available publicly to further improve the understanding of emotions in language models and how people convey emotions through various languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17837v2,2024-12
Make Imagination Clearer! Stable Diffusion-based Visual Imagination for Multimodal Machine Translation,"Andong Chen, Yuchen Song, Kehai Chen, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang","Visual information has been introduced for enhancing machine translation (MT), and its effectiveness heavily relies on the availability of large amounts of bilingual parallel sentence pairs with manual image annotations. In this paper, we introduce a stable diffusion-based imagination network into a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to explicitly generate an image for each source sentence, thereby advancing the multimodel MT. Particularly, we build heuristic human feedback with reinforcement learning to ensure the consistency of the generated image with the source sentence without the supervision of image annotation, which breaks the bottleneck of using visual information in MT. Furthermore, the proposed method enables imaginative visual information to be integrated into large-scale text-only MT in addition to multimodal MT. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms existing multimodal MT and text-only MT, especially achieving an average improvement of more than 14 BLEU points on Multi30K multimodal MT benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12627v2,2024-12
Jailbreaking? One Step Is Enough!,"Weixiong Zheng, Peijian Zeng, Yiwei Li, Hongyan Wu, Nankai Lin, Junhao Chen, Aimin Yang, Yongmei Zhou","Large language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to generate harmful outputs. Examining jailbreak prompts helps uncover the shortcomings of LLMs. However, current jailbreak methods and the target model's defenses are engaged in an independent and adversarial process, resulting in the need for frequent attack iterations and redesigning attacks for different models. To address these gaps, we propose a Reverse Embedded Defense Attack (REDA) mechanism that disguises the attack intention as the ""defense"". intention against harmful content. Specifically, REDA starts from the target response, guiding the model to embed harmful content within its defensive measures, thereby relegating harmful content to a secondary role and making the model believe it is performing a defensive task. The attacking model considers that it is guiding the target model to deal with harmful content, while the target model thinks it is performing a defensive task, creating an illusion of cooperation between the two. Additionally, to enhance the model's confidence and guidance in ""defensive"" intentions, we adopt in-context learning (ICL) with a small number of attack examples and construct a corresponding dataset of attack examples. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the REDA method enables cross-model attacks without the need to redesign attack strategies for different models, enables successful jailbreak in one iteration, and outperforms existing methods on both open-source and closed-source models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12621v1,2024-12

While substantial research has been dedicated to natural language to SQL query generation (Text2SQL), the analogous problem for graph databases referred to as Text2Cypher remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce SynthCypher, a fully synthetic and automated data generation pipeline designed to address this gap. SynthCypher employs a novel LLMSupervised Generation-Verification framework, ensuring syntactically and semantically correct Cypher queries across diverse domains and query complexities. Using this pipeline, we create SynthCypher Dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing 29.8k Text2Cypher instances. Fine-tuning open-source large language models (LLMs), including LLaMa-3.1- 8B, Mistral-7B, and QWEN-7B, on SynthCypher yields significant performance improvements of up to 40% on the Text2Cypher test set and 30% on the SPIDER benchmark adapted for graph databases. This work demonstrates that high-quality synthetic data can effectively advance the state-of-the-art in Text2Cypher tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12612v1,2024-12
MultiLingPoT: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning with Multilingual Program Fine-tuning,"Nianqi Li, Zujie Liang, Siyu Yuan, Jiaqing Liang, Feng Wei, Yanghua Xiao","Program-of-Thought (PoT), which aims to use programming language instead of natural language as an intermediate step in reasoning, is an important way for LLMs to solve mathematical problems. Since different programming languages excel in different areas, it is natural to use the most suitable language for solving specific problems. However, current PoT research only focuses on single language PoT, ignoring the differences between different programming languages. Therefore, this paper proposes an multilingual program reasoning method, MultiLingPoT. This method allows the model to answer questions using multiple programming languages by fine-tuning on multilingual data. Additionally, prior and posterior hybrid methods are used to help the model select the most suitable language for each problem. Our experimental results show that the training of MultiLingPoT improves each program's mathematical reasoning by about 2.5\%. Moreover, with proper mixing, the performance of MultiLingPoT can be further improved, achieving a 6\% increase compared to the single-language PoT with the data augmentation.Resources of this paper can be found at https://github.com/Nianqi-Li/MultiLingPoT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12609v1,2024-12
Multi-Dimensional Insights: Benchmarking Real-World Personalization in Large Multimodal Models,"YiFan Zhang, Shanglin Lei, Runqi Qiao, Zhuoma GongQue, Xiaoshuai Song, Guanting Dong, Qiuna Tan, Zhe Wei, Peiqing Yang, Ye Tian, Yadong Xue, Xiaofei Wang, Honggang Zhang","The rapidly developing field of large multimodal models (LMMs) has led to the emergence of diverse models with remarkable capabilities. However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively, objectively and accurately evaluate whether LMMs align with the diverse needs of humans in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-Dimensional Insights (MDI) benchmark, which includes over 500 images covering six common scenarios of human life. Notably, the MDI-Benchmark offers two significant advantages over existing evaluations: (1) Each image is accompanied by two types of questions: simple questions to assess the model's understanding of the image, and complex questions to evaluate the model's ability to analyze and reason beyond basic content. (2) Recognizing that people of different age groups have varying needs and perspectives when faced with the same scenario, our benchmark stratifies questions into three age categories: young people, middle-aged people, and older people. This design allows for a detailed assessment of LMMs' capabilities in meeting the preferences and needs of different age groups. With MDI-Benchmark, the strong model like GPT-4o achieve 79% accuracy on age-related tasks, indicating that existing LMMs still have considerable room for improvement in addressing real-world applications. Looking ahead, we anticipate that the MDI-Benchmark will open new pathways for aligning real-world personalization in LMMs. The MDI-Benchmark data and evaluation code are available at https://mdi-benchmark.github.io/",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12606v1,2024-12
LLMs are Also Effective Embedding Models: An In-depth Overview,"Chongyang Tao, Tao Shen, Shen Gao, Junshuo Zhang, Zhen Li, Zhengwei Tao, Shuai Ma","Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Recently, their effectiveness as embedding models has gained attention, marking a paradigm shift from traditional encoder-only models like ELMo and BERT to decoder-only, large-scale LLMs such as GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral. This survey provides an in-depth overview of this transition, beginning with foundational techniques before the LLM era, followed by LLM-based embedding models through two main strategies to derive embeddings from LLMs. 1) Direct prompting: We mainly discuss the prompt designs and the underlying rationale for deriving competitive embeddings. 2) Data-centric tuning: We cover extensive aspects that affect tuning an embedding model, including model architecture, training objectives, data constructions, etc. Upon the above, we also cover advanced methods, such as handling longer texts, and multilingual and cross-modal data. Furthermore, we discuss factors affecting choices of embedding models, such as performance/efficiency comparisons, dense vs sparse embeddings, pooling strategies, and scaling law. Lastly, the survey highlights the limitations and challenges in adapting LLMs for embeddings, including cross-task embedding quality, trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, low-resource, long-context, data bias, robustness, etc. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners by synthesizing current advancements, highlighting key challenges, and offering a comprehensive framework for future work aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs as embedding models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12591v1,2024-12
PerSphere: A Comprehensive Framework for Multi-Faceted Perspective Retrieval and Summarization,"Yun Luo, Yingjie Li, Xiangkun Hu, Qinglin Qi, Fang Guo, Qipeng Guo, Zheng Zhang, Yue Zhang","As online platforms and recommendation algorithms evolve, people are increasingly trapped in echo chambers, leading to biased understandings of various issues. To combat this issue, we have introduced PerSphere, a benchmark designed to facilitate multi-faceted perspective retrieval and summarization, thus breaking free from these information silos. For each query within PerSphere, there are two opposing claims, each supported by distinct, non-overlapping perspectives drawn from one or more documents. Our goal is to accurately summarize these documents, aligning the summaries with the respective claims and their underlying perspectives. This task is structured as a two-step end-to-end pipeline that includes comprehensive document retrieval and multi-faceted summarization. Furthermore, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the retrieval and summarization content. Experimental results on various counterparts for the pipeline show that recent models struggle with such a complex task. Analysis shows that the main challenge lies in long context and perspective extraction, and we propose a simple but effective multi-agent summarization system, offering a promising solution to enhance performance on PerSphere.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12588v1,2024-12
Enhancing LLM-based Hatred and Toxicity Detection with Meta-Toxic Knowledge Graph,"Yibo Zhao, Jiapeng Zhu, Can Xu, Xiang Li","The rapid growth of social media platforms has raised significant concerns regarding online content toxicity. When Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for toxicity detection, two key challenges emerge: 1) the absence of domain-specific toxic knowledge leads to false negatives; 2) the excessive sensitivity of LLMs to toxic speech results in false positives, limiting freedom of speech. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called MetaTox, leveraging graph search on a meta-toxic knowledge graph to enhance hatred and toxicity detection. First, we construct a comprehensive meta-toxic knowledge graph by utilizing LLMs to extract toxic information through a three-step pipeline, with toxic benchmark datasets serving as corpora. Second, we query the graph via retrieval and ranking processes to supplement accurate, relevant toxic knowledge. Extensive experiments and in-depth case studies across multiple datasets demonstrate that our MetaTox significantly decreases the false positive rate while boosting overall toxicity detection performance. Our code will be available soon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15268v2,2024-12
Process-Supervised Reward Models for Clinical Note Generation: A Scalable Approach Guided by Domain Expertise,"Hanyin Wang, Qiping Xu, Bolun Liu, Guleid Hussein, Hariprasad Korsapati, Mohamad El Labban, Kingsley Iheasirim, Mohamed Hassan, Gokhan Anil, Brian Bartlett, Jimeng Sun","Process-supervised reward models (PRMs), which verify large language model (LLM) outputs step-by-step, have achieved significant success in mathematical and coding problems. However, their application to other domains remains largely unexplored. In this work, we train a PRM to provide step-level reward signals for clinical notes generated by LLMs from patient-doctor dialogues. Guided by real-world clinician expertise, we carefully designed step definitions for clinical notes and utilized Gemini-Pro 1.5 to automatically generate process supervision data at scale. Our proposed PRM, trained on the LLaMA-3.1 8B instruct model, demonstrated superior performance compared to Gemini-Pro 1.5 and an outcome-supervised reward model (ORM) across two key evaluations: (1) the accuracy of selecting gold-reference samples from error-containing samples, achieving 98.8% (versus 61.3% for ORM and 93.8% for Gemini-Pro 1.5), and (2) the accuracy of selecting physician-preferred notes, achieving 56.2% (compared to 51.2% for ORM and 50.0% for Gemini-Pro 1.5). Additionally, we conducted ablation studies to determine optimal loss functions and data selection strategies, along with physician reader studies to explore predictors of downstream Best-of-N performance. Our promising results suggest the potential of PRMs to extend beyond the clinical domain, offering a scalable and effective solution for diverse generative tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12583v1,2024-12
Quantifying Lexical Semantic Shift via Unbalanced Optimal Transport,"Ryo Kishino, Hiroaki Yamagiwa, Ryo Nagata, Sho Yokoi, Hidetoshi Shimodaira","Lexical semantic change detection aims to identify shifts in word meanings over time. While existing methods using embeddings from a diachronic corpus pair estimate the degree of change for target words, they offer limited insight into changes at the level of individual usage instances. To address this, we apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) to sets of contextualized word embeddings, capturing semantic change through the excess and deficit in the alignment between usage instances. In particular, we propose Sense Usage Shift (SUS), a measure that quantifies changes in the usage frequency of a word sense at each usage instance. By leveraging SUS, we demonstrate that several challenges in semantic change detection can be addressed in a unified manner, including quantifying instance-level semantic change and word-level tasks such as measuring the magnitude of semantic change and the broadening or narrowing of meaning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12569v1,2024-12
FCMR: Robust Evaluation of Financial Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning,"Seunghee Kim, Changhyeon Kim, Taeuk Kim","Real-world decision-making often requires integrating and reasoning over information from multiple modalities. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in such tasks, their ability to perform multi-hop reasoning across diverse sources remains insufficiently evaluated. Existing benchmarks, such as MMQA, face challenges due to (1) data contamination and (2) a lack of complex queries that necessitate operations across more than two modalities, hindering accurate performance assessment. To address this, we present Financial Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning (FCMR), a benchmark created to analyze the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs by urging them to combine information from textual reports, tables, and charts within the financial domain. FCMR is categorized into three difficulty levels-Easy, Medium, and Hard-facilitating a step-by-step evaluation. In particular, problems at the Hard level require precise cross-modal three-hop reasoning and are designed to prevent the disregard of any modality. Experiments on this new benchmark reveal that even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle, with the best-performing model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) achieving only 30.4% accuracy on the most challenging tier. We also conduct analysis to provide insights into the inner workings of the models, including the discovery of a critical bottleneck in the information retrieval phase.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12567v1,2024-12
Evaluating Zero-Shot Multilingual Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models,"Chengyan Wu, Bolei Ma, Zheyu Zhang, Ningyuan Deng, Yanqing He, Yun Xue","Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), a sequence labeling task, has attracted increasing attention in multilingual contexts. While previous research has focused largely on fine-tuning or training models specifically for ABSA, we evaluate large language models (LLMs) under zero-shot conditions to explore their potential to tackle this challenge with minimal task-specific adaptation. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of a series of LLMs on multilingual ABSA tasks, investigating various prompting strategies, including vanilla zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), self-improvement, self-debate, and self-consistency, across nine different models. Results indicate that while LLMs show promise in handling multilingual ABSA, they generally fall short of fine-tuned, task-specific models. Notably, simpler zero-shot prompts often outperform more complex strategies, especially in high-resource languages like English. These findings underscore the need for further refinement of LLM-based approaches to effectively address ABSA task across diverse languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12564v2,2024-12
Task-Agnostic Language Model Watermarking via High Entropy Passthrough Layers,"Vaden Masrani, Mohammad Akbari, David Ming Xuan Yue, Ahmad Rezaei, Yong Zhang","In the era of costly pre-training of large language models, ensuring the intellectual property rights of model owners, and insuring that said models are responsibly deployed, is becoming increasingly important. To this end, we propose model watermarking via passthrough layers, which are added to existing pre-trained networks and trained using a self-supervised loss such that the model produces high-entropy output when prompted with a unique private key, and acts normally otherwise. Unlike existing model watermarking methods, our method is fully task-agnostic, and can be applied to both classification and sequence-to-sequence tasks without requiring advanced access to downstream fine-tuning datasets. We evaluate the proposed passthrough layers on a wide range of downstream tasks, and show experimentally our watermarking method achieves a near-perfect watermark extraction accuracy and false-positive rate in most cases without damaging original model performance. Additionally, we show our method is robust to both downstream fine-tuning, fine-pruning, and layer removal attacks, and can be trained in a fraction of the time required to train the original model. Code is available in the paper.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12563v1,2024-12
EXIT: Context-Aware Extractive Compression for Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Taeho Hwang, Sukmin Cho, Soyeong Jeong, Hoyun Song, SeungYoon Han, Jong C. Park","We introduce EXIT, an extractive context compression framework that enhances both the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (QA). Current RAG systems often struggle when retrieval models fail to rank the most relevant documents, leading to the inclusion of more context at the expense of latency and accuracy. While abstractive compression methods can drastically reduce token counts, their token-by-token generation process significantly increases end-to-end latency. Conversely, existing extractive methods reduce latency but rely on independent, non-adaptive sentence selection, failing to fully utilize contextual information. EXIT addresses these limitations by classifying sentences from retrieved documents - while preserving their contextual dependencies - enabling parallelizable, context-aware extraction that adapts to query complexity and retrieval quality. Our evaluations on both single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks show that EXIT consistently surpasses existing compression methods and even uncompressed baselines in QA accuracy, while also delivering substantial reductions in inference time and token count. By improving both effectiveness and efficiency, EXIT provides a promising direction for developing scalable, high-quality QA solutions in RAG pipelines.

LLMCL-GEC: Advancing Grammatical Error Correction with LLM-Driven Curriculum Learning,"Tao Fang, Derek F. Wong, Lusheng Zhang, Keyan Jin, Qiang Zhang, Tianjiao Li, Jinlong Hou, Lidia S. Chao","While large-scale language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in specific natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they may still lack proficiency compared to specialized models in certain domains, such as grammatical error correction (GEC). Drawing inspiration from the concept of curriculum learning, we have delved into refining LLMs into proficient GEC experts by devising effective curriculum learning (CL) strategies. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, termed LLM-based curriculum learning, which capitalizes on the robust semantic comprehension and discriminative prowess inherent in LLMs to gauge the complexity of GEC training data. Unlike traditional curriculum learning techniques, our method closely mirrors human expert-designed curriculums. Leveraging the proposed LLM-based CL method, we sequentially select varying levels of curriculums ranging from easy to hard, and iteratively train and refine using the pretrianed T5 and LLaMA series models. Through rigorous testing and analysis across diverse benchmark assessments in English GEC, including the CoNLL14 test, BEA19 test, and BEA19 development sets, our approach showcases a significant performance boost over baseline models and conventional curriculum learning methodologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12541v1,2024-12
Toxicity Detection towards Adaptability to Changing Perturbations,"Hankun Kang, Jianhao Chen, Yongqi Li, Xin Miao, Mayi Xu, Ming Zhong, Yuanyuan Zhu, Tieyun Qian","Toxicity detection is crucial for maintaining the peace of the society. While existing methods perform well on normal toxic contents or those generated by specific perturbation methods, they are vulnerable to evolving perturbation patterns. However, in real-world scenarios, malicious users tend to create new perturbation patterns for fooling the detectors. For example, some users may circumvent the detector of large language models (LLMs) by adding `I am a scientist' at the beginning of the prompt. In this paper, we introduce a novel problem, i.e., continual learning jailbreak perturbation patterns, into the toxicity detection field. To tackle this problem, we first construct a new dataset generated by 9 types of perturbation patterns, 7 of them are summarized from prior work and 2 of them are developed by us. We then systematically validate the vulnerability of current methods on this new perturbation pattern-aware dataset via both the zero-shot and fine tuned cross-pattern detection. Upon this, we present the domain incremental learning paradigm and the corresponding benchmark to ensure the detector's robustness to dynamically emerging types of perturbed toxic text. Our code and dataset are provided in the appendix and will be publicly available at GitHub, by which we wish to offer new research opportunities for the security-relevant communities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15267v2,2024-12
"When to Speak, When to Abstain: Contrastive Decoding with Abstention","Hyuhng Joon Kim, Youna Kim, Sang-goo Lee, Taeuk Kim","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across diverse tasks by leveraging both pre-trained knowledge (i.e., parametric knowledge) and external knowledge (i.e., contextual knowledge). While substantial efforts have been made to leverage both forms of knowledge, scenarios in which the model lacks any relevant knowledge remain underexplored. Such limitations can result in issues like hallucination, causing reduced reliability and potential risks in high-stakes applications. To address such limitations, this paper extends the task scope to encompass cases where the user's request cannot be fulfilled due to the lack of relevant knowledge. To this end, we introduce Contrastive Decoding with Abstention (CDA), a training-free decoding method that empowers LLMs to generate responses when relevant knowledge is available and to abstain otherwise. CDA evaluates the relevance of each knowledge for a given query, adaptively determining which knowledge to prioritize or which to completely ignore. Extensive experiments with four LLMs on three question-answering datasets demonstrate that CDA can effectively perform accurate generation and abstention simultaneously. These findings highlight CDA's potential to broaden the applicability of LLMs, enhancing reliability and preserving user trust.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12527v1,2024-12
On the Structural Memory of LLM Agents,"Ruihong Zeng, Jinyuan Fang, Siwei Liu, Zaiqiao Meng","Memory plays a pivotal role in enabling large language model~(LLM)-based agents to engage in complex and long-term interactions, such as question answering (QA) and dialogue systems. While various memory modules have been proposed for these tasks, the impact of different memory structures across tasks remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates how memory structures and memory retrieval methods affect the performance of LLM-based agents. Specifically, we evaluate four types of memory structures, including chunks, knowledge triples, atomic facts, and summaries, along with mixed memory that combines these components. In addition, we evaluate three widely used memory retrieval methods: single-step retrieval, reranking, and iterative retrieval. Extensive experiments conducted across four tasks and six datasets yield the following key insights: (1) Different memory structures offer distinct advantages, enabling them to be tailored to specific tasks; (2) Mixed memory structures demonstrate remarkable resilience in noisy environments; (3) Iterative retrieval consistently outperforms other methods across various scenarios. Our investigation aims to inspire further research into the design of memory systems for LLM-based agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15266v1,2024-12
Solid-SQL: Enhanced Schema-linking based In-context Learning for Robust Text-to-SQL,"Geling Liu, Yunzhi Tan, Ruichao Zhong, Yuanzhen Xie, Lingchen Zhao, Qian Wang, Bo Hu, Zang Li","Recently, large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the performance of text-to-SQL systems. Nevertheless, many state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches have overlooked the critical aspect of system robustness. Our experiments reveal that while LLM-driven methods excel on standard datasets, their accuracy is notably compromised when faced with adversarial perturbations. To address this challenge, we propose a robust text-to-SQL solution, called Solid-SQL, designed to integrate with various LLMs. We focus on the pre-processing stage, training a robust schema-linking model enhanced by LLM-based data augmentation. Additionally, we design a two-round, structural similarity-based example retrieval strategy for in-context learning. Our method achieves SOTA SQL execution accuracy levels of 82.1% and 58.9% on the general Spider and Bird benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, experimental results show that Solid-SQL delivers an average improvement of 11.6% compared to baselines on the perturbed Spider-Syn, Spider-Realistic, and Dr. Spider benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12522v1,2024-12

An MBTI Personality Detection Dataset Aligned with Population Traits,"Bohan Li, Jiannan Guan, Longxu Dou, Yunlong Feng, Dingzirui Wang, Yang Xu, Enbo Wang, Qiguang Chen, Bichen Wang, Xiao Xu, Yimeng Zhang, Libo Qin, Yanyan Zhao, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che","The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is one of the most influential personality theories reflecting individual differences in thinking, feeling, and behaving. MBTI personality detection has garnered considerable research interest and has evolved significantly over the years. However, this task tends to be overly optimistic, as it currently does not align well with the natural distribution of population personality traits. Specifically, (1) the self-reported labels in existing datasets result in incorrect labeling issues, and (2) the hard labels fail to capture the full range of population personality distributions. In this paper, we optimize the task by constructing MBTIBench, the first manually annotated high-quality MBTI personality detection dataset with soft labels, under the guidance of psychologists. As for the first challenge, MBTIBench effectively solves the incorrect labeling issues, which account for 29.58% of the data. As for the second challenge, we estimate soft labels by deriving the polarity tendency of samples. The obtained soft labels confirm that there are more people with non-extreme personality traits. Experimental results not only highlight the polarized predictions and biases in LLMs as key directions for future research, but also confirm that soft labels can provide more benefits to other psychological tasks than hard labels.

Can You Trust LLM Judgments? Reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge,"Kayla Schroeder, Zach Wood-Doughty","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, but their stochastic nature poses challenges to the reliability of their outputs. While deterministic settings can improve consistency, they do not guarantee reliability, as a single sample from the model's probability distribution can still be misleading. Building upon the concept of LLM-as-a-judge, we introduce a novel framework for rigorously evaluating the reliability of LLM judgments, leveraging McDonald's omega. We evaluate the reliability of LLMs when judging the outputs of other LLMs on standard single-turn and multi-turn benchmarks, simultaneously investigating the impact of temperature on reliability. By analyzing these results, we demonstrate the limitations of fixed randomness and the importance of considering multiple samples, which we show has significant implications for downstream applications. Our findings highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of LLM reliability and the potential risks associated with over-reliance on single-shot evaluations.

Unleashing the Potential of Model Bias for Generalized Category Discovery,"Wenbin An, Haonan Lin, Jiahao Nie, Feng Tian, Wenkai Shi, Yaqiang Wu, Qianying Wang, Ping Chen","Generalized Category Discovery is a significant and complex task that aims to identify both known and undefined novel categories from a set of unlabeled data, leveraging another labeled dataset containing only known categories. The primary challenges stem from model bias induced by pre-training on only known categories and the lack of precise supervision for novel ones, leading to category bias towards known categories and category confusion among different novel categories, which hinders models' ability to identify novel categories effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Self-Debiasing Calibration (SDC). Unlike prior methods that regard model bias towards known categories as an obstacle to novel category identification, SDC provides a novel insight into unleashing the potential of the bias to facilitate novel category learning. Specifically, the output of the biased model serves two key purposes. First, it provides an accurate modeling of category bias, which can be utilized to measure the degree of bias and debias the output of the current training model. Second, it offers valuable insights for distinguishing different novel categories by transferring knowledge between similar categories. Based on these insights, SDC dynamically adjusts the output logits of the current training model using the output of the biased model. This approach produces less biased logits to effectively address the issue of category bias towards known categories, and generates more accurate pseudo labels for unlabeled data, thereby mitigating category confusion for novel categories. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that SDC outperforms SOTA methods, especially in the identification of novel categories. Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/Lackel/SDC}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12501v1,2024-12
Beyond Data Quantity: Key Factors Driving Performance in Multilingual Language Models,"Sina Bagheri Nezhad, Ameeta Agrawal, Rhitabrat Pokharel","Multilingual language models (MLLMs) are crucial for handling text across various languages, yet they often show performance disparities due to differences in resource availability and linguistic characteristics. While the impact of pre-train data percentage and model size on performance is well-known, our study reveals additional critical factors that significantly influence MLLM effectiveness. Analyzing a wide range of features, including geographical, linguistic, and resource-related aspects, we focus on the SIB-200 dataset for classification and the Flores-200 dataset for machine translation, using regression models and SHAP values across 204 languages. Our findings identify token similarity and country similarity as pivotal factors, alongside pre-train data and model size, in enhancing model performance.

Fundamentally, the safety of large language models is closely linked to the accuracy, comprehensiveness, and clarity of their understanding of safety knowledge, particularly in domains such as law, policy and ethics. This factuality ability is crucial in determining whether these models can be deployed and applied safely and compliantly within specific regions. To address these challenges and better evaluate the factuality ability of LLMs to answer short questions, we introduce the Chinese SafetyQA benchmark. Chinese SafetyQA has several properties (i.e., Chinese, Diverse, High-quality, Static, Easy-to-evaluate, Safety-related, Harmless). Based on Chinese SafetyQA, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on the factuality abilities of existing LLMs and analyze how these capabilities relate to LLM abilities, e.g., RAG ability and robustness against attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15265v2,2024-12
LinguaLIFT: An Effective Two-stage Instruction Tuning Framework for Low-Resource Language Tasks,"Hongbin Zhang, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Yang Xiang, Min Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive multilingual understanding and reasoning capabilities, driven by extensive pre-training multilingual corpora and fine-tuning instruction data. However, a performance gap persists between high-resource and low-resource language tasks due to language imbalance in the pre-training corpus, even using more low-resource data during fine-tuning. To alleviate this issue, we propose LinguaLIFT, a two-stage instruction tuning framework for advancing low-resource language tasks. An additional language alignment layer is first integrated into the LLM to adapt a pre-trained multilingual encoder, thereby enhancing multilingual alignment through code-switched fine-tuning. The second stage fine-tunes LLM with English-only instruction data while freezing the language alignment layer, allowing LLM to transfer task-specific capabilities from English to low-resource language tasks. Additionally, we introduce the Multilingual Math World Problem (MMWP) benchmark, which spans 21 low-resource, 17 medium-resource, and 10 high-resource languages, enabling comprehensive evaluation of multilingual reasoning.

NLSR: Neuron-Level Safety Realignment of Large Language Models Against Harmful Fine-Tuning,"Xin Yi, Shunfan Zheng, Linlin Wang, Gerard de Melo, Xiaoling Wang, Liang He","The emergence of finetuning-as-a-service has revealed a new vulnerability in large language models (LLMs). A mere handful of malicious data uploaded by users can subtly manipulate the finetuning process, resulting in an alignment-broken model. Existing methods to counteract fine-tuning attacks typically require substantial computational resources. Even with parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA, gradient updates remain essential. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{N}euron-\textbf{L}evel \textbf{S}afety \textbf{R}ealignment (\textbf{NLSR}), a training-free framework that restores the safety of LLMs based on the similarity difference of safety-critical neurons before and after fine-tuning. The core of our framework is first to construct a safety reference model from an initially aligned model to amplify safety-related features in neurons. We then utilize this reference model to identify safety-critical neurons, which we prepare as patches. Finally, we selectively restore only those neurons that exhibit significant similarity differences by transplanting these prepared patches, thereby minimally altering the fine-tuned model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant safety enhancements in fine-tuned models across multiple downstream tasks, while greatly maintaining task-level accuracy. Our findings suggest regions of some safety-critical neurons show noticeable differences after fine-tuning, which can be effectively corrected by transplanting neurons from the reference model without requiring additional training.

Boosting Long-Context Management via Query-Guided Activation Refilling,"Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Zhicheng Dou, Defu Lian","Processing long contexts poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to their inherent context-window limitations and the computational burden of extensive key-value (KV) activations, which severely impact efficiency. For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to these dynamic information needs.   In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided Activation Refilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed and localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism integrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thus improving answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context information-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving improvements in both performance and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12486v2,2024-12
Human-in-the-Loop Generation of Adversarial Texts: A Case Study on Tibetan Script,"Xi Cao, Yuan Sun, Jiajun Li, Quzong Gesang, Nuo Qun, Tashi Nyima","DNN-based language models perform excellently on various tasks, but even SOTA LLMs are susceptible to textual adversarial attacks. Adversarial texts play crucial roles in multiple subfields of NLP. However, current research has the following issues. (1) Most textual adversarial attack methods target rich-resourced languages. How do we generate adversarial texts for less-studied languages? (2) Most textual adversarial attack methods are prone to generating invalid or ambiguous adversarial texts. How do we construct high-quality adversarial robustness benchmarks? (3) New language models may be immune to part of previously generated adversarial texts. How do we update adversarial robustness benchmarks? To address the above issues, we introduce HITL-GAT, a system based on a general approach to human-in-the-loop generation of adversarial texts. HITL-GAT contains four stages in one pipeline: victim model construction, adversarial example generation, high-quality benchmark construction, and adversarial robustness evaluation. Additionally, we utilize HITL-GAT to make a case study on Tibetan script which can be a reference for the adversarial research of other less-studied languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12478v1,2024-12
RareAgents: Autonomous Multi-disciplinary Team for Rare Disease Diagnosis and Treatment,"Xuanzhong Chen, Ye Jin, Xiaohao Mao, Lun Wang, Shuyang Zhang, Ting Chen","Rare diseases, despite their low individual incidence, collectively impact around 300 million people worldwide due to the huge number of diseases. The complexity of symptoms and the shortage of specialized doctors with relevant experience make diagnosing and treating rare diseases more challenging than common diseases. Recently, agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable improvements across various domains. In the medical field, some agent methods have outperformed direct prompts in question-answering tasks from medical exams. However, current agent frameworks lack adaptation for real-world clinical scenarios, especially those involving the intricate demands of rare diseases. To address these challenges, we present RareAgents, the first multi-disciplinary team of LLM-based agents tailored to the complex clinical context of rare diseases. RareAgents integrates advanced planning capabilities, memory mechanisms, and medical tools utilization, leveraging Llama-3.1-8B/70B as the base model. Experimental results show that RareAgents surpasses state-of-the-art domain-specific models, GPT-4o, and existing agent frameworks in both differential diagnosis and medication recommendation for rare diseases. Furthermore, we contribute a novel dataset, MIMIC-IV-Ext-Rare, derived from MIMIC-IV, to support further advancements in this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12475v1,2024-12
Knowledge Boundary of Large Language Models: A Survey,"Moxin Li, Yong Zhao, Yang Deng, Wenxuan Zhang, Shuaiyi Li, Wenya Xie, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua","Although large language models (LLMs) store vast amount of knowledge in their parameters, they still have limitations in the memorization and utilization of certain knowledge, leading to undesired behaviors such as generating untruthful and inaccurate responses. This highlights the critical need to understand the knowledge boundary of LLMs, a concept that remains inadequately defined in existing research. In this survey, we propose a comprehensive definition of the LLM knowledge boundary and introduce a formalized taxonomy categorizing knowledge into four distinct types. Using this foundation, we systematically review the field through three key lenses: the motivation for studying LLM knowledge boundaries, methods for identifying these boundaries, and strategies for mitigating the challenges they present. Finally, we discuss open challenges and potential research directions in this area. We aim for this survey to offer the community a comprehensive overview, facilitate access to key issues, and inspire further advancements in LLM knowledge research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12472v1,2024-12
ReXTrust: A Model for Fine-Grained Hallucination Detection in AI-Generated Radiology Reports,"Romain Hardy, Sung Eun Kim, Pranav Rajpurkar","The increasing adoption of AI-generated radiology reports necessitates robust methods for detecting hallucinations--false or unfounded statements that could impact patient care. We present ReXTrust, a novel framework for fine-grained hallucination detection in AI-generated radiology reports. Our approach leverages sequences of hidden states from large vision-language models to produce finding-level hallucination risk scores. We evaluate ReXTrust on a subset of the MIMIC-CXR dataset and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing approaches, achieving an AUROC of 0.8751 across all findings and 0.8963 on clinically significant findings. Our results show that white-box approaches leveraging model hidden states can provide reliable hallucination detection for medical AI systems, potentially improving the safety and reliability of automated radiology reporting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15264v2,2024-12
Core Context Aware Attention for Long Context Language Modeling,"Yaofo Chen, Zeng You, Shuhai Zhang, Haokun Li, Yirui Li, Yaowei Wang, Mingkui Tan","Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks primarily attributed to self-attention mechanism, which requires a token to consider all preceding tokens as its context to compute the attention score. However, when the context length L becomes very large (e.g., 32K), more redundant context information will be included w.r.t. any tokens, making the self-attention suffer from two main limitations: 1) The computational and memory complexity scales quadratically w.r.t. L; 2) The presence of redundant context information may hamper the model to capture dependencies among crucial tokens, which may degrade the representation performance. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play Core Context Aware (CCA) Attention for efficient long-range context modeling, which consists of two components: 1) Globality-pooling attention that divides input tokens into groups and then dynamically merges tokens within each group into one core token based on their significance; 2) Locality-preserved attention that incorporates neighboring tokens into the attention calculation. The two complementary attentions will then be fused to the final attention, maintaining comprehensive modeling ability as the full self-attention. In this way, the core context information w.r.t. a given token will be automatically focused and strengthened, while the context information in redundant groups will be diminished during the learning process. As a result, the computational and memory complexity will be significantly reduced. More importantly, the CCA-Attention can improve the long-context modeling ability by diminishing the redundant context information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our CCA-Attention significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of computational efficiency and long-context modeling ability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12465v1,2024-12
LITA: An Efficient LLM-assisted Iterative Topic Augmentation Framework,"Chia-Hsuan Chang, Jui-Tse Tsai, Yi-Hang Tsai, San-Yih Hwang","Topic modeling is widely used for uncovering thematic structures within text corpora, yet traditional models often struggle with specificity and coherence in domain-focused applications. Guided approaches, such as SeededLDA and CorEx, incorporate user-provided seed words to improve relevance but remain labor-intensive and static. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for dynamic topic refinement and discovery, yet their application often incurs high API costs. To address these challenges, we propose the LLM-assisted Iterative Topic Augmentation framework (LITA), an LLM-assisted approach that integrates user-provided seeds with embedding-based clustering and iterative refinement. LITA identifies a small number of ambiguous documents and employs an LLM to reassign them to existing or new topics, minimizing API costs while enhancing topic quality. Experiments on two datasets across topic quality and clustering performance metrics demonstrate that LITA outperforms five baseline models, including LDA, SeededLDA, CorEx, BERTopic, and PromptTopic. Our work offers an efficient and adaptable framework for advancing topic modeling and text clustering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12459v1,2024-12
"Graph Learning in the Era of LLMs: A Survey from the Perspective of Data, Models, and Tasks","Xunkai Li, Zhengyu Wu, Jiayi Wu, Hanwen Cui, Jishuo Jia, Rong-Hua Li, Guoren Wang","With the increasing prevalence of cross-domain Text-Attributed Graph (TAG) Data (e.g., citation networks, recommendation systems, social networks, and ai4science), the integration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) into a unified Model architecture (e.g., LLM as enhancer, LLM as collaborators, LLM as predictor) has emerged as a promising technological paradigm. The core of this new graph learning paradigm lies in the synergistic combination of GNNs' ability to capture complex structural relationships and LLMs' proficiency in understanding informative contexts from the rich textual descriptions of graphs. Therefore, we can leverage graph description texts with rich semantic context to fundamentally enhance Data quality, thereby improving the representational capacity of model-centric approaches in line with data-centric machine learning principles. By leveraging the strengths of these distinct neural network architectures, this integrated approach addresses a wide range of TAG-based Task (e.g., graph learning, graph reasoning, and graph question answering), particularly in complex industrial scenarios (e.g., supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings). In other words, we can treat text as a medium to enable cross-domain generalization of graph learning Model, allowing a single graph model to effectively handle the diversity of downstream graph-based Task across different data domains. This work serves as a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners looking to advance graph learning methodologies in the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM.

PERC: Plan-As-Query Example Retrieval for Underrepresented Code Generation,"Jaeseok Yoo, Hojae Han, Youngwon Lee, Jaejin Kim, Seung-won Hwang","Code generation with large language models has shown significant promise, especially when employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with few-shot examples. However, selecting effective examples that enhance generation quality remains a challenging task, particularly when the target programming language (PL) is underrepresented. In this study, we present two key findings: (1) retrieving examples whose presented algorithmic plans can be referenced for generating the desired behavior significantly improves generation accuracy, and (2) converting code into pseudocode effectively captures such algorithmic plans, enhancing retrieval quality even when the source and the target PLs are different. Based on these findings, we propose Plan-as-query Example Retrieval for few-shot prompting in Code generation (PERC), a novel framework that utilizes algorithmic plans to identify and retrieve effective examples. We validate the effectiveness of PERC through extensive experiments on the CodeContests, HumanEval and MultiPL-E benchmarks: PERC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art RAG methods in code generation, both when the source and target programming languages match or differ, highlighting its adaptability and robustness in diverse coding environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12447v2,2024-12
Persona-SQ: A Personalized Suggested Question Generation Framework For Real-world Documents,"Zihao Lin, Zichao Wang, Yuanting Pan, Varun Manjunatha, Ryan Rossi, Angela Lau, Lifu Huang, Tong Sun","Suggested questions (SQs) provide an effective initial interface for users to engage with their documents in AI-powered reading applications. In practical reading sessions, users have diverse backgrounds and reading goals, yet current SQ features typically ignore such user information, resulting in homogeneous or ineffective questions. We introduce a pipeline that generates personalized SQs by incorporating reader profiles (professions and reading goals) and demonstrate its utility in two ways: 1) as an improved SQ generation pipeline that produces higher quality and more diverse questions compared to current baselines, and 2) as a data generator to fine-tune extremely small models that perform competitively with much larger models on SQ generation. Our approach can not only serve as a drop-in replacement in current SQ systems to immediately improve their performance but also help develop on-device SQ models that can run locally to deliver fast and private SQ experience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12445v2,2024-12
Refining Dimensions for Improving Clustering-based Cross-lingual Topic Models,"Chia-Hsuan Chang, Tien-Yuan Huang, Yi-Hang Tsai, Chia-Ming Chang, San-Yih Hwang","Recent works in clustering-based topic models perform well in monolingual topic identification by introducing a pipeline to cluster the contextualized representations. However, the pipeline is suboptimal in identifying topics across languages due to the presence of language-dependent dimensions (LDDs) generated by multilingual language models. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, SVD-based dimension refinement component into the pipeline of the clustering-based topic model. This component effectively neutralizes the negative impact of LDDs, enabling the model to accurately identify topics across languages. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate that the updated pipeline with the dimension refinement component generally outperforms other state-of-the-art cross-lingual topic models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12433v1,2024-12
Assessing the Limitations of Large Language Models in Clinical Fact Decomposition,"Monica Munnangi, Akshay Swaminathan, Jason Alan Fries, Jenelle Jindal, Sanjana Narayanan, Ivan Lopez, Lucia Tu, Philip Chung, Jesutofunmi A. Omiye, Mehr Kashyap, Nigam Shah","Verifying factual claims is critical for using large language models (LLMs) in healthcare. Recent work has proposed fact decomposition, which uses LLMs to rewrite source text into concise sentences conveying a single piece of information, as an approach for fine-grained fact verification. Clinical documentation poses unique challenges for fact decomposition due to dense terminology and diverse note types. To explore these challenges, we present FactEHR, a dataset consisting of full document fact decompositions for 2,168 clinical notes spanning four types from three hospital systems. Our evaluation, including review by clinicians, highlights significant variability in the quality of fact decomposition for four commonly used LLMs, with some LLMs generating 2.6x more facts per sentence than others. The results underscore the need for better LLM capabilities to support factual verification in clinical text.

"Bridging the Gap: Enhancing LLM Performance for Low-Resource African Languages with New Benchmarks, Fine-Tuning, and Cultural Adjustments","Tuka Alhanai, Adam Kasumovic, Mohammad Ghassemi, Aven Zitzelberger, Jessica Lundin, Guillaume Chabot-Couture","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various tasks, yet significant disparities remain for non-English languages, and especially native African languages. This paper addresses these disparities by creating approximately 1 million human-translated words of new benchmark data in 8 low-resource African languages, covering a population of over 160 million speakers of: Amharic, Bambara, Igbo, Sepedi (Northern Sotho), Shona, Sesotho (Southern Sotho), Setswana, and Tsonga. Our benchmarks are translations of Winogrande and three sections of MMLU: college medicine, clinical knowledge, and virology. Using the translated benchmarks, we report previously unknown performance gaps between state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs in English and African languages. Finally, using results from over 400 fine-tuned models, we explore several methods to reduce the LLM performance gap, including high-quality dataset fine-tuning (using an LLM-as-an-Annotator), cross-lingual transfer, and cultural appropriateness adjustments. Key findings include average mono-lingual improvements of 5.6% with fine-tuning (with 5.4% average mono-lingual improvements when using high-quality data over low-quality data), 2.9% average gains from cross-lingual transfer, and a 3.0% out-of-the-box performance boost on culturally appropriate questions.

Interpretable LLM-based Table Question Answering,"Giang, Nguyen, Ivan Brugere, Shubham Sharma, Sanjay Kariyappa, Anh Totti Nguyen, Freddy Lecue","Interpretability for Table Question Answering (Table QA) is critical, particularly in high-stakes industries like finance or healthcare. Although recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved Table QA performance, their explanations for how the answers are generated are ambiguous. To fill this gap, we introduce Plan-of-SQLs ( or POS), an interpretable, effective, and efficient approach to Table QA that answers an input query solely with SQL executions. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations with human and LLM judges, we show that POS is most preferred among explanation methods, helps human users understand model decision boundaries, and facilitates model success and error identification. Furthermore, when evaluated in standard benchmarks (TabFact, WikiTQ, and FetaQA), POS achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, while maintaining greater efficiency by requiring significantly fewer LLM calls and database queries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12386v1,2024-12

LLaVA Steering: Visual Instruction Tuning with 500x Fewer Parameters through Modality Linear Representation-Steering,"Jinhe Bi, Yujun Wang, Haokun Chen, Xun Xiao, Artur Hecker, Volker Tresp, Yunpu Ma","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced visual tasks by integrating visual representations into large language models (LLMs). The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, equips MLLMs with abilities like instruction following and in-context learning. In contrast, the visual modality enhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initially reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalance occurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring a direction for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReS effectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, where the key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformations in the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, we composed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReS method. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering models require, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs while still achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight visual question-answering tasks. Last, we present the LLaVA Steering Factory, an in-house developed platform that enables researchers to quickly customize various MLLMs with component-based architecture for seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art models, and evaluate their intrinsic modality imbalance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12359v2,2024-12

Investigating the Feasibility of Mitigating Potential Copyright Infringement via Large Language Model Unlearning,Guangyao Dou,"Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but also pose risks by learning and generating copyrighted material, leading to significant legal and ethical concerns. In a potential real-world scenario, model owners may need to continuously address copyright infringement in order to address requests for content removal that emerge at different time points. One potential way of addressing this is via sequential unlearning, where copyrighted content is removed sequentially as new requests arise. Despite its practical relevance, sequential unlearning in the context of copyright infringement has not been rigorously explored in existing literature. To address this gap, we propose Stable Sequential Unlearning (SSU), a novel framework designed to unlearn copyrighted content from LLMs over multiple time steps. Our approach works by identifying and removing specific weight updates in the model's parameters that correspond to copyrighted content using task vectors. We improve unlearning efficacy by introducing random labeling loss and ensuring the model retains its general-purpose knowledge by adjusting targeted parameters with gradient-based weight saliency. Extensive experimental results show that SSU sometimes achieves an effective trade-off between unlearning efficacy and general-purpose language abilities, outperforming existing baselines, but it's not a cure-all for unlearning copyrighted material.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18621v1,2024-12

Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation Framework,"Shuzhou Yuan, Jingyi Sun, Ran Zhang, Michael Färber, Steffen Eger, Pepa Atanasova, Isabelle Augenstein","Natural language explanations (NLEs) are commonly used to provide plausible free-text explanations of a model's reasoning about its predictions. However, recent work has questioned the faithfulness of NLEs, as they may not accurately reflect the model's internal reasoning process regarding its predicted answer. In contrast, highlight explanations -- input fragments identified as critical for the model's predictions -- exhibit measurable faithfulness, which has been incrementally improved through existing research. Building on this foundation, we propose G-Tex, a Graph-Guided Textual Explanation Generation framework designed to enhance the faithfulness of NLEs by leveraging highlight explanations. Specifically, highlight explanations are extracted as highly faithful cues representing the model's reasoning and are subsequently encoded through a graph neural network layer, which explicitly guides the NLE generation process. This alignment ensures that the generated explanations closely reflect the model's underlying reasoning. Experiments on T5 and BART using three reasoning datasets show that G-Tex improves NLE faithfulness by up to 17.59% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, G-Tex generates NLEs with greater semantic and lexical similarity to human-written ones. Human evaluations show that G-Tex can decrease redundant content and enhance the overall quality of NLEs. As our work introduces a novel method for explicitly guiding NLE generation to improve faithfulness, we hope it will serve as a stepping stone for addressing additional criteria for NLE and generated text overall.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12318v1,2024-12

One practical objective for an Arabic LLM is to utilize an Arabic-specific vocabulary for the tokenizer that could speed up decoding. However, using a different vocabulary often leads to a degradation of learned knowledge since many words are initially out-of-vocabulary (OOV) when training starts. Inspired by the vocabulary learning during Second Language (Arabic) Acquisition for humans, the released AraLLaMA employs progressive vocabulary expansion, which is implemented by a modified BPE algorithm that progressively extends the Arabic subwords in its dynamic vocabulary during training, thereby balancing the OOV ratio at every stage. The ablation study demonstrated the effectiveness of Progressive Vocabulary Expansion. Moreover, AraLLaMA achieves decent performance comparable to the best Arabic LLMs across a variety of Arabic benchmarks.

Emergence of Abstractions: Concept Encoding and Decoding Mechanism for In-Context Learning in Transformers,"Seungwook Han, Jinyeop Song, Jeff Gore, Pulkit Agrawal","Humans distill complex experiences into fundamental abstractions that enable rapid learning and adaptation.

In this paper, we propose concept encoding-decoding mechanism to explain ICL by studying how transformers form and use internal abstractions in their representations. On synthetic ICL tasks, we analyze the training dynamics of a small transformer and report the coupled emergence of concept encoding and decoding. As the model learns to encode different latent concepts (e.g., ``Finding the first noun in a sentence."") into distinct, separable representations, it concureently builds conditional decoding algorithms and improve its ICL performance. We validate the existence of this mechanism across pretrained models of varying scales (Gemma-2 2B/9B/27B, Llama-3.1 8B/70B). Further, through mechanistic interventions and controlled finetuning, we demonstrate that the quality of concept encoding is causally related and predictive of ICL performance. Our empirical insights shed light into better understanding the success and failure modes of large language models via their representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12276v2,2024-12
SepLLM: Accelerate Large Language Models by Compressing One Segment into One Separator,"Guoxuan Chen, Han Shi, Jiawei Li, Yihang Gao, Xiaozhe Ren, Yimeng Chen, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Weiyang Liu, Chao Huang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12094v3,2024-12
Making FETCH! Happen: Finding Emergent Dog Whistles Through Common Habitats,"Kuleen Sasse, Carlos Aguirre, Isabel Cachola, Sharon Levy, Mark Dredze","WARNING: This paper contains content that maybe upsetting or offensive to some readers. Dog whistles are coded expressions with dual meanings: one intended for the general public (outgroup) and another that conveys a specific message to an intended audience (ingroup). Often, these expressions are used to convey controversial political opinions while maintaining plausible deniability and slip by content moderation filters. Identification of dog whistles relies on curated lexicons, which have trouble keeping up to date. We introduce \textbf{FETCH!}, a task for finding novel dog whistles in massive social media corpora. We find that state-of-the-art systems fail to achieve meaningful results across three distinct social media case studies. We present \textbf{EarShot}, a novel system that combines the strengths of vector databases and Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently and effectively identify new dog whistles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12072v1,2024-12
Semi-automated analysis of audio-recorded lessons: The case of teachers' engaging messages,"Samuel Falcon, Carmen Alvarez-Alvarez, Jaime Leon","Engaging messages delivered by teachers are a key aspect of the classroom discourse that influences student outcomes. However, improving this communication is challenging due to difficulties in obtaining observations. This study presents a methodology for efficiently extracting actual observations of engaging messages from audio-recorded lessons. We collected 2,477 audio-recorded lessons from 75 teachers over two academic years. Using automatic transcription and keyword-based filtering analysis, we identified and classified engaging messages. This method reduced the information to be analysed by 90%, optimising the time and resources required compared to traditional manual coding. Subsequent descriptive analysis revealed that the most used messages emphasised the future benefits of participating in school activities. In addition, the use of engaging messages decreased as the academic year progressed. This study offers insights for researchers seeking to extract information from teachers' discourse in naturalistic settings and provides useful information for designing interventions to improve teachers' communication strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12062v1,2024-12
Virtual Agent-Based Communication Skills Training to Facilitate Health Persuasion Among Peers,"Farnaz Nouraei, Keith Rebello, Mina Fallah, Prasanth Murali, Haley Matuszak, Valerie Jap, Andrea Parker, Michael Paasche-Orlow, Timothy Bickmore","Many laypeople are motivated to improve the health behavior of their family or friends but do not know where to start, especially if the health behavior is potentially stigmatizing or controversial. We present an approach that uses virtual agents to coach community-based volunteers in health counseling techniques, such as motivational interviewing, and allows them to practice these skills in role-playing scenarios. We use this approach in a virtual agent-based system to increase COVID-19 vaccination by empowering users to influence their social network. In a between-subjects comparative design study, we test the effects of agent system interactivity and role-playing functionality on counseling outcomes, with participants evaluated by standardized patients and objective judges. We find that all versions are effective at producing peer counselors who score adequately on a standardized measure of counseling competence, and that participants were significantly more satisfied with interactive virtual agents compared to passive viewing of the training material. We discuss design implications for interpersonal skills training systems based on our findings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12061v1,2024-12
How Private are Language Models in Abstractive Summarization?,"Anthony Hughes, Nikolaos Aletras, Ning Ma","Language models (LMs) have shown outstanding performance in text summarization including sensitive domains such as medicine and law. In these settings, it is important that personally identifying information (PII) included in the source document should not leak in the summary. Prior efforts have mostly focused on studying how LMs may inadvertently elicit PII from training data. However, to what extent LMs can provide privacy-preserving summaries given a non-private source document remains under-explored. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study across two closed- and three open-weight LMs of different sizes and families. We experiment with prompting and fine-tuning strategies for privacy-preservation across a range of summarization datasets across three domains. Our extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis including human evaluation shows that LMs often cannot prevent PII leakage on their summaries and that current widely-used metrics cannot capture context dependent privacy risks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12040v1,2024-12
Can LLM Prompting Serve as a Proxy for Static Analysis in Vulnerability Detection,"Ira Ceka, Feitong Qiao, Anik Dey, Aastha Valechia, Gail Kaiser, Baishakhi Ray","Despite their remarkable success, large language models (LLMs) have shown limited ability on applied tasks such as vulnerability detection. We investigate various prompting strategies for vulnerability detection and, as part of this exploration, propose a prompting strategy that integrates natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities with a contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning approach, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities. On a high-quality vulnerability detection dataset such as SVEN, our prompting strategies can improve accuracies, F1-scores, and pairwise accuracies by 23%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12039v1,2024-12
SpeechPrune: Context-aware Token Pruning for Speech Information Retrieval,"Yueqian Lin, Yuzhe Fu, Jingyang Zhang, Yudong Liu, Jianyi Zhang, Jingwei Sun, Hai ""Helen"" Li, Yiran Chen","We introduce Speech Information Retrieval (SIR), a new long-context task for Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs), and present SPIRAL, a 1,012-sample benchmark testing models' ability to extract critical details from approximately 90-second spoken inputs. While current Speech LLMs excel at short-form tasks, they struggle with the computational and representational demands of longer audio sequences. To address this limitation, we propose SpeechPrune, a training-free token pruning strategy that uses speech-text similarity and approximated attention scores to efficiently discard irrelevant tokens. In SPIRAL, SpeechPrune achieves accuracy improvements of 29% and up to 47% over the original model and the random pruning model at a pruning rate of 20%, respectively. SpeechPrune can maintain network performance even at a pruning level of 80%.

The Open Source Advantage in Large Language Models (LLMs),"Jiya Manchanda, Laura Boettcher, Matheus Westphalen, Jasser Jasser","Large language models (LLMs) mark a key shift in natural language processing (NLP), having advanced text generation, translation, and domain-specific reasoning. Closed-source models like GPT-4, powered by proprietary datasets and extensive computational resources, lead with state-of-the-art performance today. However, they face criticism for their ""black box"" nature and for limiting accessibility in a manner that hinders reproducibility and equitable AI development. By contrast, open-source initiatives like LLaMA and BLOOM prioritize democratization through community-driven development and computational efficiency. These models have significantly reduced performance gaps, particularly in linguistic diversity and domain-specific applications, while providing accessible tools for global researchers and developers. Notably, both paradigms rely on foundational architectural innovations, such as the Transformer framework by Vaswani et al. (2017). Closed-source models excel by scaling effectively, while open-source models adapt to real-world applications in underrepresented languages and domains. Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and instruction-tuning datasets enable open-source models to achieve competitive results despite limited resources. To be sure, the tension between closed-source and open-source approaches underscores a broader debate on transparency versus proprietary control in AI. Ethical considerations further highlight this divide. Closed-source systems restrict external scrutiny, while open-source models promote reproducibility and collaboration but lack standardized auditing documentation frameworks to mitigate biases. Hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both paradigms are likely to shape the future of LLM innovation, ensuring accessibility, competitive technical performance, and ethical deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12004v1,2024-12
LLM-RG4: Flexible and Factual Radiology Report Generation across Diverse Input Contexts,"Zhuhao Wang, Yihua Sun, Zihan Li, Xuan Yang, Fang Chen, Hongen Liao","Drafting radiology reports is a complex task requiring flexibility, where radiologists tail content to available information and particular clinical demands. However, most current radiology report generation (RRG) models are constrained to a fixed task paradigm, such as predicting the full ``finding'' section from a single image, inherently involving a mismatch between inputs and outputs. The trained models lack the flexibility for diverse inputs and could generate harmful, input-agnostic hallucinations. To bridge the gap between current RRG models and the clinical demands in practice, we first develop a data generation pipeline to create a new MIMIC-RG4 dataset, which considers four common radiology report drafting scenarios and has perfectly corresponded input and output. Secondly, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) based RRG framework, namely LLM-RG4, which utilizes LLM's flexible instruction-following capabilities and extensive general knowledge. We further develop an adaptive token fusion module that offers flexibility to handle diverse scenarios with different input combinations, while minimizing the additional computational burden associated with increased input volumes. Besides, we propose a token-level loss weighting strategy to direct the model's attention towards positive and uncertain descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-RG4 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both clinical efficiency and natural language generation on the MIMIC-RG4 and MIMIC-CXR datasets. We quantitatively demonstrate that our model has minimal input-agnostic hallucinations, whereas current open-source models commonly suffer from this problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12001v1,2024-12

Existing evaluation benchmarks often employ static methods that do not fully capture the dynamic nature of real-world coding environments and face significant challenges, including limited context length, reliance on superficial evaluation metrics, and potential overfitting to training datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for enhancing code completion in software development through the creation of a repository-level benchmark ExecRepoBench and the instruction corpora Repo-Instruct, aim at improving the functionality of open-source large language models (LLMs) in real-world coding scenarios that involve complex interdependencies across multiple files. ExecRepoBench includes 1.2K samples from active Python repositories. Plus, we present a multi-level grammar-based completion methodology conditioned on the abstract syntax tree to mask code fragments at various logical units (e.g. statements, expressions, and functions). Then, we fine-tune the open-source LLM with 7B parameters on Repo-Instruct to produce a strong code completion baseline model Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct-C based on the open-source model. Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct-C is rigorously evaluated against existing benchmarks, including MultiPL-E and ExecRepoBench, which consistently outperforms prior baselines across all programming languages.

Multi-head attention debiasing and contrastive learning for mitigating Dataset Artifacts in Natural Language Inference,Karthik Sivakoti,"While Natural Language Inference (NLI) models have achieved high performances on benchmark datasets, there are still concerns whether they truly capture the intended task, or largely exploit dataset artifacts. Through detailed analysis of the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, we have uncovered complex patterns of various types of artifacts and their interactions, leading to the development of our novel structural debiasing approach. Our fine-grained analysis of 9,782 validation examples reveals four major categories of artifacts: length-based patterns, lexical overlap, subset relationships, and negation patterns. Our multi-head debiasing architecture achieves substantial improvements across all bias categories: length bias accuracy improved from 86.03% to 90.06%, overlap bias from 91.88% to 93.13%, subset bias from 95.43% to 96.49%, and negation bias from 88.69% to 94.64%. Overall, our approach reduces the error rate from 14.19% to 10.42% while maintaining high performance on unbiased examples. Analysis of 1,026 error cases shows significant improvement in handling neutral relationships, traditionally one of the most challenging areas for NLI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16194v1,2024-12
SciFaultyQA: Benchmarking LLMs on Faulty Science Question Detection with a GAN-Inspired Approach to Synthetic Dataset Generation,Debarshi Kundu,"Consider the problem: ``If one man and one woman can produce one child in one year, how many children will be produced by one woman and three men in 0.5 years?"" Current large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-o1-preview, and Gemini Flash frequently answer ""0.5,"" which does not make sense. While these models sometimes acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the question, in many cases (8 out of 10 trials), they provide the nonsensical answer of ""0.5 child."" Additionally, temporal variation has been observed: if an LLM answers correctly once (by recognizing the faulty nature of the question), subsequent responses are more likely to also reflect this understanding. However, this is inconsistent.   These types of questions have motivated us to develop a dataset of science questions, SciFaultyQA, where the questions themselves are intentionally faulty. We observed that LLMs often proceed to answer these flawed questions without recognizing their inherent issues, producing results that are logically or scientifically invalid. By analyzing such patterns, we developed a novel method for generating synthetic datasets to evaluate and benchmark the performance of various LLMs in identifying these flawed questions. We have also developed novel approaches to reduce the errors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11988v1,2024-12

It is being made available for non-commercial use on the ELiT website. In designing this corpus we have sought to make it cover a wide-range of speaker attributes, from their L1 to their speaking ability, as well as providing manual annotations. This enables a range of language-learning tasks to be examined, such as assessing speaking proficiency or providing feedback on grammatical errors in a learner's speech. Additionally the data supports research into the underlying technology required for these tasks including automatic speech recognition (ASR) of low resource L2 learner English, disfluency detection or spoken grammatical error correction (GEC).

To reduce the costs of these essential controls, this paper investigates the use of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) to automate the validation process, examining for the first time the cost/quality trade-off in data acquisition. Experiments conducted on French, German, and Korean data demonstrate that SFM-based validation has the potential to reduce reliance on human validation, resulting in an estimated cost saving of over 40.0% without degrading final data quality.

Emma-X: An Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning,"Qi Sun, Pengfei Hong, Tej Deep Pala, Vernon Toh, U-Xuan Tan, Deepanway Ghosal, Soujanya Poria","Traditional reinforcement learning-based robotic control methods are often task-specific and fail to generalize across diverse environments or unseen objects and instructions. Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and planning capabilities but lack the ability to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, Emma-X. Emma-X leverages our constructed hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, containing 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories auto-annotated with grounded task reasoning and spatial guidance.

DARWIN 1.5: Large Language Models as Materials Science Adapted Learners,"Tong Xie, Yuwei Wan, Yixuan Liu, Yuchen Zeng, Wenjie Zhang, Chunyu Kit, Dongzhan Zhou, Bram Hoex","Materials discovery and design aim to find components and structures with desirable properties over highly complex and diverse search spaces. Traditional solutions, such as high-throughput simulations and machine learning (ML), often rely on complex descriptors, which hinder generalizability and transferability across tasks. Moreover, these descriptors may deviate from experimental data due to inevitable defects and purity issues in the real world, which may reduce their effectiveness in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose Darwin 1.5, an open-source large language model (LLM) tailored for materials science. By leveraging natural language as input, Darwin eliminates the need for task-specific descriptors and enables a flexible, unified approach to material property prediction and discovery. We employ a two-stage training strategy combining question-answering (QA) fine-tuning with multi-task learning (MTL) to inject domain-specific knowledge in various modalities and facilitate cross-task knowledge transfer. Through our strategic approach, we achieved a significant enhancement in the prediction accuracy of LLMs, with a maximum improvement of 60\% compared to LLaMA-7B base models. It further outperforms traditional machine learning models on various tasks in material science, showcasing the potential of LLMs to provide a more versatile and scalable foundation model for materials discovery and design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11970v1,2024-12
Inferring Functionality of Attention Heads from their Parameters,"Amit Elhelo, Mor Geva","Attention heads are one of the building blocks of large language models (LLMs). Prior work on investigating their operation mostly focused on analyzing their behavior during inference for specific circuits or tasks. In this work, we seek a comprehensive mapping of the operations they implement in a model. We propose MAPS (Mapping Attention head ParameterS), an efficient framework that infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, without any model training or inference. We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head's outputs during inference and are causally linked to the model's predictions. Moreover, its mappings reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases in LLMs. Next, we present an automatic pipeline and analysis that leverage MAPS to characterize the salient operations of a given head. Our pipeline produces plausible operation descriptions for most heads, as assessed by human judgment, while revealing diverse operations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11965v1,2024-12
The Impact of Token Granularity on the Predictive Power of Language Model Surprisal,"Byung-Doh Oh, William Schuler","Word-by-word language model surprisal is often used to model the incremental processing of human readers, which raises questions about how various choices in language modeling influence its predictive power. One factor that has been overlooked in cognitive modeling is the granularity of subword tokens, which explicitly encodes information about word length and frequency, and ultimately influences the quality of vector representations that are learned. This paper presents experiments that manipulate the token granularity and evaluate its impact on the ability of surprisal to account for processing difficulty of naturalistic text and garden-path constructions. Experiments with naturalistic reading times reveal a substantial influence of token granularity on surprisal, with tokens defined by a vocabulary size of 8,000 resulting in surprisal that is most predictive. In contrast, on garden-path constructions, language models trained on coarser-grained tokens generally assigned higher surprisal to critical regions, suggesting their increased sensitivity to syntax. Taken together, these results suggest a large role of token granularity on the quality of language model surprisal for cognitive modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11940v1,2024-12
SEAGraph: Unveiling the Whole Story of Paper Review Comments,"Jianxiang Yu, Jiaqi Tan, Zichen Ding, Jiapeng Zhu, Jiahao Li, Yao Cheng, Qier Cui, Yunshi Lan, Xiang Li","Peer review, as a cornerstone of scientific research, ensures the integrity and quality of scholarly work by providing authors with objective feedback for refinement. However, in the traditional peer review process, authors often receive vague or insufficiently detailed feedback, which provides limited assistance and leads to a more time-consuming review cycle. If authors can identify some specific weaknesses in their paper, they can not only address the reviewer's concerns but also improve their work. This raises the critical question of how to enhance authors' comprehension of review comments. In this paper, we present SEAGraph, a novel framework developed to clarify review comments by uncovering the underlying intentions behind them. We construct two types of graphs for each paper: the semantic mind graph, which captures the author's thought process, and the hierarchical background graph, which delineates the research domains related to the paper. A retrieval method is then designed to extract relevant content from both graphs, facilitating coherent explanations for the review comments. Extensive experiments show that SEAGraph excels in review comment understanding tasks, offering significant benefits to authors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11939v1,2024-12
Precise Length Control in Large Language Models,"Bradley Butcher, Michael O'Keefe, James Titchener","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in production systems, powering applications such as chatbots, summarization, and question answering. Despite their success, controlling the length of their response remains a significant challenge, particularly for tasks requiring structured outputs or specific levels of detail. In this work, we propose a method to adapt pre-trained decoder-only LLMs for precise control of response length. Our approach incorporates a secondary length-difference positional encoding (LDPE) into the input embeddings, which counts down to a user-set response termination length. Fine-tuning with LDPE allows the model to learn to terminate responses coherently at the desired length, achieving mean token errors of less than 3 tokens. We also introduce Max New Tokens++, an extension that enables flexible upper-bound length control, rather than an exact target. Experimental results on tasks such as question answering and document summarization demonstrate that our method enables precise length control without compromising response quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11937v1,2024-12

Explainable Procedural Mistake Detection,"Shane Storks, Itamar Bar-Yossef, Yayuan Li, Zheyuan Zhang, Jason J. Corso, Joyce Chai","Automated task guidance has recently attracted attention from the AI research community. Procedural mistake detection (PMD) is a challenging sub-problem of classifying whether a human user (observed through egocentric video) has successfully executed the task at hand (specified by a procedural text). Despite significant efforts in building resources and models for PMD, machine performance remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we recast PMD to an explanatory self-dialog of questions and answers, which serve as evidence for a decision. As this reformulation enables an unprecedented transparency, we leverage a fine-tuned natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated coherence metrics for generated explanations. Our results show that while open-source VLMs struggle with this task off-the-shelf, their accuracy, coherence, and dialog efficiency can be vastly improved by incorporating these coherence metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods. Furthermore, our multi-faceted metrics can visualize common outcomes at a glance, highlighting areas for improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11927v1,2024-12
PICLe: Pseudo-Annotations for In-Context Learning in Low-Resource Named Entity Detection,"Sepideh Mamooler, Syrielle Montariol, Alexander Mathis, Antoine Bosselut","In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks using few demonstrations, facilitating task adaptation when labeled examples are hard to obtain. However, ICL is sensitive to the choice of demonstrations, and it remains unclear which demonstration attributes enable in-context generalization. In this work, we conduct a perturbation study of in-context demonstrations for low-resource Named Entity Detection (NED). Our surprising finding is that in-context demonstrations with partially correct annotated entity mentions can be as effective for task transfer as fully correct demonstrations. Based off our findings, we propose Pseudo-annotated In-Context Learning (PICLe), a framework for in-context learning with noisy, pseudo-annotated demonstrations. PICLe leverages LLMs to annotate many demonstrations in a zero-shot first pass. We then cluster these synthetic demonstrations, sample specific sets of in-context demonstrations from each cluster, and predict entity mentions using each set independently. Finally, we use self-verification to select the final set of entity mentions. We evaluate PICLe on five biomedical NED datasets and show that, with zero human annotation, PICLe outperforms ICL in low-resource settings where limited gold examples can be used as in-context demonstrations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11923v1,2024-12
RetroLLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Retrieve Fine-grained Evidence within Generation,"Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Yujia Zhou, Yongkang Wu, Zhonghua Li, Qi Ye, Zhicheng Dou","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but often suffer from hallucinations. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an effective solution by incorporating external knowledge, but existing methods still face several limitations: additional deployment costs of separate retrievers, redundant input tokens from retrieved text chunks, and the lack of joint optimization of retrieval and generation. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RetroLLM}, a unified framework that integrates retrieval and generation into a single, cohesive process, enabling LLMs to directly generate fine-grained evidence from the corpus with constrained decoding. Moreover, to mitigate false pruning in the process of constrained evidence generation, we introduce (1) hierarchical FM-Index constraints, which generate corpus-constrained clues to identify a subset of relevant documents before evidence generation, reducing irrelevant decoding space; and (2) a forward-looking constrained decoding strategy, which considers the relevance of future sequences to improve evidence accuracy. Extensive experiments on five open-domain QA datasets demonstrate RetroLLM's superior performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.

However, existing benchmarks fail to ensure a robust evaluation as they often only involve a single character category or evaluate limited dimensions. Moreover, the sparsity of character features in responses makes feature-focused generative evaluation both ineffective and inefficient. To address these issues, we propose CharacterBench, the largest bilingual generative benchmark, with 22,859 human-annotated samples covering 3,956 characters from 25 detailed character categories. We define 11 dimensions of 6 aspects, classified as sparse and dense dimensions based on whether character features evaluated by specific dimensions manifest in each response. We enable effective and efficient evaluation by crafting tailored queries for each dimension to induce characters' responses related to specific dimensions. Further, we develop CharacterJudge model for cost-effective and stable evaluations. Experiments show its superiority over SOTA automatic judges (e.g., GPT-4) and our benchmark's potential to optimize LLMs' character customization.

Can Language Models Rival Mathematics Students? Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning through Textual Manipulation and Human Experiments,"Andrii Nikolaiev, Yiannos Stathopoulos, Simone Teufel","In this paper we look at the ability of recent large language models (LLMs) at solving mathematical problems in combinatorics. We compare models LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3.1, GPT-4, and Mixtral against each other and against human pupils and undergraduates with prior experience in mathematical olympiads. To facilitate these comparisons we introduce the Combi-Puzzles dataset, which contains 125 problem variants based on 25 combinatorial reasoning problems. Each problem is presented in one of five distinct forms, created by systematically manipulating the problem statements through adversarial additions, numeric parameter changes, and linguistic obfuscation. Our variations preserve the mathematical core and are designed to measure the generalisability of LLM problem-solving abilities, while also increasing confidence that problems are submitted to LLMs in forms that have not been seen as training instances. We found that a model based on GPT-4 outperformed all other models in producing correct responses, and performed significantly better in the mathematical variation of the problems than humans. We also found that modifications to problem statements significantly impact the LLM's performance, while human performance remains unaffected.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11908v1,2024-12
Classification of Spontaneous and Scripted Speech for Multilingual Audio,"Shahar Elisha, Andrew McDowell, Mariano Beguerisse-Díaz, Emmanouil Benetos","Distinguishing scripted from spontaneous speech is an essential tool for better understanding how speech styles influence speech processing research. It can also improve recommendation systems and discovery experiences for media users through better segmentation of large recorded speech catalogues. This paper addresses the challenge of building a classifier that generalises well across different formats and languages. We systematically evaluate models ranging from traditional, handcrafted acoustic and prosodic features to advanced audio transformers, utilising a large, multilingual proprietary podcast dataset for training and validation. We break down the performance of each model across 11 language groups to evaluate cross-lingual biases. Our experimental analysis extends to publicly available datasets to assess the models' generalisability to non-podcast domains. Our results indicate that transformer-based models consistently outperform traditional feature-based techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing between scripted and spontaneous speech across various languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11896v1,2024-12
Using Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models to Identify Indicators of Vulnerability in Police Incident Narratives,"Sam Relins, Daniel Birks, Charlie Lloyd","Objectives: Compare qualitative coding of instruction tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) against human coders in classifying the presence or absence of vulnerability in routinely collected unstructured text that describes police-public interactions. Evaluate potential bias in IT-LLM codings. Methods: Analyzing publicly available text narratives of police-public interactions recorded by Boston Police Department, we provide humans and IT-LLMs with qualitative labelling codebooks and compare labels generated by both, seeking to identify situations associated with (i) mental ill health; (ii) substance misuse; (iii) alcohol dependence; and (iv) homelessness. We explore multiple prompting strategies and model sizes, and the variability of labels generated by repeated prompts. Additionally, to explore model bias, we utilize counterfactual methods to assess the impact of two protected characteristics - race and gender - on IT-LLM classification. Results: Results demonstrate that IT-LLMs can effectively support human qualitative coding of police incident narratives. While there is some disagreement between LLM and human generated labels, IT-LLMs are highly effective at screening narratives where no vulnerabilities are present, potentially vastly reducing the requirement for human coding. Counterfactual analyses demonstrate that manipulations to both gender and race of individuals described in narratives have very limited effects on IT-LLM classifications beyond those expected by chance. Conclusions: IT-LLMs offer effective means to augment human qualitative coding in a way that requires much lower levels of resource to analyze large unstructured datasets. Moreover, they encourage specificity in qualitative coding, promote transparency, and provide the opportunity for more standardized, replicable approaches to analyzing large free-text police data sources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11878v1,2024-12
GeoX: Geometric Problem Solving Through Unified Formalized Vision-Language Pre-training,"Renqiu Xia, Mingsheng Li, Hancheng Ye, Wenjie Wu, Hongbin Zhou, Jiakang Yuan, Tianshuo Peng, Xinyu Cai, Xiangchao Yan, Bin Wang, Conghui He, Botian Shi, Tao Chen, Junchi Yan, Bo Zhang","Despite their proficiency in general tasks, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with automatic Geometry Problem Solving (GPS), which demands understanding diagrams, interpreting symbols, and performing complex reasoning. This limitation arises from their pre-training on natural images and texts, along with the lack of automated verification in the problem-solving process. Besides, current geometric specialists are limited by their task-specific designs, making them less effective for broader geometric problems. To this end, we present GeoX, a multi-modal large model focusing on geometric understanding and reasoning tasks. Given the significant differences between geometric diagram-symbol and natural image-text, we introduce unimodal pre-training to develop a diagram encoder and symbol decoder, enhancing the understanding of geometric images and corpora. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-language alignment, an effective pre-training paradigm that bridges the modality gap between unimodal geometric experts. We propose a Generator-And-Sampler Transformer (GS-Former) to generate discriminative queries and eliminate uninformative representations from unevenly distributed geometric signals. Finally, GeoX benefits from visual instruction tuning, empowering it to take geometric images and questions as input and generate verifiable solutions. Experiments show that GeoX outperforms both generalists and geometric specialists on publicly recognized benchmarks, such as GeoQA, UniGeo, Geometry3K, and PGPS9k.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11863v1,2024-12
A Benchmark and Robustness Study of In-Context-Learning with Large Language Models in Music Entity Detection,"Simon Hachmeier, Robert Jäschke","Detecting music entities such as song titles or artist names is a useful application to help use cases like processing music search queries or analyzing music consumption on the web. Recent approaches incorporate smaller language models (SLMs) like BERT and achieve high results. However, further research indicates a high influence of entity exposure during pre-training on the performance of the models. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), these outperform SLMs in a variety of downstream tasks. However, researchers are still divided if this is applicable to tasks like entity detection in texts due to issues like hallucination. In this paper, we provide a novel dataset of user-generated metadata and conduct a benchmark and a robustness study using recent LLMs with in-context-learning (ICL). Our results indicate that LLMs in the ICL setting yield higher performance than SLMs. We further uncover the large impact of entity exposure on the best performing LLM in our study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11851v1,2024-12
Analyzing Images of Legal Documents: Toward Multi-Modal LLMs for Access to Justice,"Hannes Westermann, Jaromir Savelka","Interacting with the legal system and the government requires the assembly and analysis of various pieces of information that can be spread across different (paper) documents, such as forms, certificates and contracts (e.g. leases). This information is required in order to understand one's legal rights, as well as to fill out forms to file claims in court or obtain government benefits. However, finding the right information, locating the correct forms and filling them out can be challenging for laypeople. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful technology that has the potential to address this gap, but still rely on the user to provide the correct information, which may be challenging and error-prone if the information is only available in complex paper documents. We present an investigation into utilizing multi-modal LLMs to analyze images of handwritten paper forms, in order to automatically extract relevant information in a structured format. Our initial results are promising, but reveal some limitations (e.g., when the image quality is low). Our work demonstrates the potential of integrating multi-modal LLMs to support laypeople and self-represented litigants in finding and assembling relevant information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15260v1,2024-12

Wonderful Matrices: Combining for a More Efficient and Effective Foundation Model Architecture,"Jingze Shi, Bingheng Wu","In order to make the foundation model more efficient and effective, our idea is combining sequence transformation and state transformation. First, we prove the availability of rotary position embedding in the state space duality algorithm, which reduces the perplexity of the hybrid quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality by more than 4%, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation unifies position encoding. Second, we propose dynamic mask attention, which maintains 100% accuracy in the more challenging multi-query associative recall task, improving by more than 150% compared to quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation selectively filters relevant information. Third, we design cross domain mixture of experts, which makes the computational speed of expert retrieval with more than 1024 experts 8 to 10 times faster than the mixture of experts, to ensure that the combining state transformation quickly retrieval mixture. Finally, we summarize these matrix algorithms that can form the foundation model: Wonderful Matrices, which can be a competitor to popular model architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11834v3,2024-12
"Are You Doubtful? Oh, It Might Be Difficult Then! Exploring the Use of Model Uncertainty for Question Difficulty Estimation","Leonidas Zotos, Hedderik van Rijn, Malvina Nissim","In an educational setting, an estimate of the difficulty of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), a commonly used strategy to assess learning progress, constitutes very useful information for both teachers and students. Since human assessment is costly from multiple points of view, automatic approaches to MCQ item difficulty estimation are investigated, yielding however mixed success until now. Our approach to this problem takes a different angle from previous work: asking various Large Language Models to tackle the questions included in two different MCQ datasets, we leverage model uncertainty to estimate item difficulty. By using both model uncertainty features as well as textual features in a Random Forest regressor, we show that uncertainty features contribute substantially to difficulty prediction, where difficulty is inversely proportional to the number of students who can correctly answer a question. In addition to showing the value of our approach, we also observe that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEA publicly available dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11831v1,2024-12
Advancements and Challenges in Bangla Question Answering Models: A Comprehensive Review,"Md Iftekhar Islam Tashik, Abdullah Khondoker, Enam Ahmed Taufik, Antara Firoz Parsa, S M Ishtiak Mahmud","The domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has experienced notable progress in the evolution of Bangla Question Answering (QA) systems. This paper presents a comprehensive review of seven research articles that contribute to the progress in this domain. These research studies explore different aspects of creating question-answering systems for the Bangla language. They cover areas like collecting data, preparing it for analysis, designing models, conducting experiments, and interpreting results. The papers introduce innovative methods like using LSTM-based models with attention mechanisms, context-based QA systems, and deep learning techniques based on prior knowledge. However, despite the progress made, several challenges remain, including the lack of well-annotated data, the absence of high-quality reading comprehension datasets, and difficulties in understanding the meaning of words in context.

EventSum: A Large-Scale Event-Centric Summarization Dataset for Chinese Multi-News Documents,"Mengna Zhu, Kaisheng Zeng, Mao Wang, Kaiming Xiao, Lei Hou, Hongbin Huang, Juanzi Li","In real life, many dynamic events, such as major disasters and large-scale sports events, evolve continuously over time. Obtaining an overview of these events can help people quickly understand the situation and respond more effectively. This is challenging because the key information of the event is often scattered across multiple documents, involving complex event knowledge understanding and reasoning, which is under-explored in previous work. Therefore, we proposed the Event-Centric Multi-Document Summarization (ECS) task, which aims to generate concise and comprehensive summaries of a given event based on multiple related news documents. Based on this, we constructed the EventSum dataset, which was constructed using Baidu Baike entries and underwent extensive human annotation, to facilitate relevant research. It is the first large scale Chinese multi-document summarization dataset, containing 5,100 events and a total of 57,984 news documents, with an average of 11.4 input news documents and 13,471 characters per event. To ensure data quality and mitigate potential data leakage, we adopted a multi-stage annotation approach for manually labeling the test set. Given the complexity of event-related information, existing metrics struggle to comprehensively assess the quality of generated summaries. We designed specific metrics including Event Recall, Argument Recall, Causal Recall, and Temporal Recall along with corresponding calculation methods for evaluation. We conducted comprehensive experiments on EventSum to evaluate the performance of advanced long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) on this task. Our experimental results indicate that: 1) The event-centric multi-document summarization task remains challenging for existing long-context LLMs; 2) The recall metrics we designed are crucial for evaluating the comprehensiveness of the summary information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11814v2,2024-12
UAlign: Leveraging Uncertainty Estimations for Factuality Alignment on Large Language Models,"Boyang Xue, Fei Mi, Qi Zhu, Hongru Wang, Rui Wang, Sheng Wang, Erxin Yu, Xuming Hu, Kam-Fai Wong","Despite demonstrating impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) still often struggle to accurately express the factual knowledge they possess, especially in cases where the LLMs' knowledge boundaries are ambiguous. To improve LLMs' factual expressions, we propose the UAlign framework, which leverages Uncertainty estimations to represent knowledge boundaries, and then explicitly incorporates these representations as input features into prompts for LLMs to Align with factual knowledge. First, we prepare the dataset on knowledge question-answering (QA) samples by calculating two uncertainty estimations, including confidence score and semantic entropy, to represent the knowledge boundaries for LLMs. Subsequently, using the prepared dataset, we train a reward model that incorporates uncertainty estimations and then employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for factuality alignment on LLMs. Experimental results indicate that, by integrating uncertainty representations in LLM alignment, the proposed UAlign can significantly enhance the LLMs' capacities to confidently answer known questions and refuse unknown questions on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, showing reliability improvements and good generalizability over various prompt- and training-based baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11803v1,2024-12
ProsodyFM: Unsupervised Phrasing and Intonation Control for Intelligible Speech Synthesis,"Xiangheng He, Junjie Chen, Zixing Zhang, Björn W. Schuller","Prosody contains rich information beyond the literal meaning of words, which is crucial for the intelligibility of speech. Current models still fall short in phrasing and intonation; they not only miss or misplace breaks when synthesizing long sentences with complex structures but also produce unnatural intonation. We propose ProsodyFM, a prosody-aware text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) model with a flow-matching (FM) backbone that aims to enhance the phrasing and intonation aspects of prosody. ProsodyFM introduces two key components: a Phrase Break Encoder to capture initial phrase break locations, followed by a Duration Predictor for the flexible adjustment of break durations; and a Terminal Intonation Encoder which learns a bank of intonation shape tokens combined with a novel Pitch Processor for more robust modeling of human-perceived intonation change. ProsodyFM is trained with no explicit prosodic labels and yet can uncover a broad spectrum of break durations and intonation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that ProsodyFM can effectively improve the phrasing and intonation aspects of prosody, thereby enhancing the overall intelligibility compared to four state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Out-of-distribution experiments show that this prosody improvement can further bring ProsodyFM superior generalizability for unseen complex sentences and speakers. Our case study intuitively illustrates the powerful and fine-grained controllability of ProsodyFM over phrasing and intonation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11795v2,2024-12
A Method for Detecting Legal Article Competition for Korean Criminal Law Using a Case-augmented Mention Graph,"Seonho An, Young Yik Rhim, Min-Soo Kim","As social systems become increasingly complex, legal articles are also growing more intricate, making it progressively harder for humans to identify any potential competitions among them, particularly when drafting new laws or applying existing laws. Despite this challenge, no method for detecting such competitions has been proposed so far. In this paper, we propose a new legal AI task called Legal Article Competition Detection (LACD), which aims to identify competing articles within a given law. Our novel retrieval method, CAM-Re2, outperforms existing relevant methods, reducing false positives by 20.8% and false negatives by 8.3%, while achieving a 98.2% improvement in precision@5, for the LACD task.

To this end, we introduce QUENCH, a novel text-based English Quizzing Benchmark manually curated and transcribed from YouTube quiz videos. QUENCH possesses masked entities and rationales for the LLMs to predict via generation. At the intersection of geographical context and common sense reasoning, QUENCH helps assess world knowledge and deduction capabilities of LLMs via a zero-shot, open-domain quizzing setup. We perform an extensive evaluation on 7 LLMs and 4 metrics, investigating the influence of model size, prompting style, geographical context, and gold-labeled rationale generation. The benchmarking concludes with an error analysis to which the LLMs are prone.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11763v1,2024-12
SCITAT: A Question Answering Benchmark for Scientific Tables and Text Covering Diverse Reasoning Types,"Xuanliang Zhang, Dingzirui Wang, Baoxin Wang, Longxu Dou, Xinyuan Lu, Keyan Xu, Dayong Wu, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che","Scientific question answering (SQA) is an important task aimed at answering questions based on papers. However, current SQA datasets have limited reasoning types and neglect the relevance between tables and text, creating a significant gap with real scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a QA benchmark for scientific tables and text with diverse reasoning types (SciTaT). To cover more reasoning types, we summarize various reasoning types from real-world questions. To involve both tables and text, we require the questions to incorporate tables and text as much as possible. Based on SciTaT, we propose a strong baseline (CaR), which combines various reasoning methods to address different reasoning types and process tables and text at the same time. CaR brings average improvements of 12.9% over other baselines on SciTaT, validating its effectiveness. Error analysis reveals the challenges of SciTaT, such as complex numerical calculations and domain knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11757v1,2024-12
"Common Ground, Diverse Roots: The Difficulty of Classifying Common Examples in Spanish Varieties","Javier A. Lopetegui, Arij Riabi, Djamé Seddah","Variations in languages across geographic regions or cultures are crucial to address to avoid biases in NLP systems designed for culturally sensitive tasks, such as hate speech detection or dialog with conversational agents. In languages such as Spanish, where varieties can significantly overlap, many examples can be valid across them, which we refer to as common examples. Ignoring these examples may cause misclassifications, reducing model accuracy and fairness. Therefore, accounting for these common examples is essential to improve the robustness and representativeness of NLP systems trained on such data. In this work, we address this problem in the context of Spanish varieties. We use training dynamics to automatically detect common examples or errors in existing Spanish datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of using predicted label confidence for our Datamaps \cite{swayamdipta-etal-2020-dataset} implementation for the identification of hard-to-classify examples, especially common examples, enhancing model performance in variety identification tasks. Additionally, we introduce a Cuban Spanish Variety Identification dataset with common examples annotations developed to facilitate more accurate detection of Cuban and Caribbean Spanish varieties. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset focused on identifying the Cuban, or any other Caribbean, Spanish variety.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11750v1,2024-12
Beyond Dataset Creation: Critical View of Annotation Variation and Bias Probing of a Dataset for Online Radical Content Detection,"Arij Riabi, Virginie Mouilleron, Menel Mahamdi, Wissam Antoun, Djamé Seddah","The proliferation of radical content on online platforms poses significant risks, including inciting violence and spreading extremist ideologies. Despite ongoing research, existing datasets and models often fail to address the complexities of multilingual and diverse data. To bridge this gap, we introduce a publicly available multilingual dataset annotated with radicalization levels, calls for action, and named entities in English, French, and Arabic. This dataset is pseudonymized to protect individual privacy while preserving contextual information. Beyond presenting our freely available dataset, we analyze the annotation process, highlighting biases and disagreements among annotators and their implications for model performance. Additionally, we use synthetic data to investigate the influence of socio-demographic traits on annotation patterns and model predictions.

CSR:Achieving 1 Bit Key-Value Cache via Sparse Representation,"Hongxuan Zhang, Yao Zhao, Jiaqi Zheng, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu, Guihai Chen","The emergence of long-context text applications utilizing large language models (LLMs) has presented significant scalability challenges, particularly in memory footprint. The linear growth of the Key-Value (KV) cache responsible for storing attention keys and values to minimize redundant computations can lead to substantial increases in memory consumption, potentially causing models to fail to serve with limited memory resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Cache Sparse Representation (CSR), which converts the KV cache by transforming the dense Key-Value cache tensor into sparse indexes and weights, offering a more memory-efficient representation during LLM inference. Furthermore, we introduce NeuralDict, a novel neural network-based method for automatically generating the dictionary used in our sparse representation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CSR achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization algorithms while maintaining robust functionality in memory-constrained environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11741v1,2024-12
Personalized LLM for Generating Customized Responses to the Same Query from Different Users,"Hang Zeng, Chaoyue Niu, Fan Wu, Chengfei Lv, Guihai Chen","Existing work on large language model (LLM) personalization assigned different responding roles to LLM, but overlooked the diversity of questioners. In this work, we propose a new form of questioner-aware LLM personalization, generating different responses even for the same query from different questioners. We design a dual-tower model architecture with a cross-questioner general encoder and a questioner-specific encoder. We further apply contrastive learning with multi-view augmentation, pulling close the dialogue representations of the same questioner, while pulling apart those of different questioners. To mitigate the impact of question diversity on questioner-contrastive learning, we cluster the dialogues based on question similarity and restrict the scope of contrastive learning within each cluster. We also build a multi-questioner dataset from English and Chinese scripts and WeChat records, called MQDialog, containing 173 questioners and 12 responders. Extensive evaluation with different metrics shows a significant improvement in the quality of personalized response generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11736v1,2024-12

LLMs Can Simulate Standardized Patients via Agent Coevolution,"Zhuoyun Du, Lujie Zheng, Renjun Hu, Yuyang Xu, Xiawei Li, Ying Sun, Wei Chen, Jian Wu, Haolei Cai, Haohao Ying","Training medical personnel using standardized patients (SPs) remains a complex challenge, requiring extensive domain expertise and role-specific practice. Most research on Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulated patients focuses on improving data retrieval accuracy or adjusting prompts through human feedback. However, this focus has overlooked the critical need for patient agents to learn a standardized presentation pattern that transforms data into human-like patient responses through unsupervised simulations. To address this gap, we propose EvoPatient, a novel simulated patient framework in which a patient agent and doctor agents simulate the diagnostic process through multi-turn dialogues, simultaneously gathering experience to improve the quality of both questions and answers, ultimately enabling human doctor training. Extensive experiments on various cases demonstrate that, by providing only overall SP requirements, our framework improves over existing reasoning methods by more than 10% in requirement alignment and better human preference, while achieving an optimal balance of resource consumption after evolving over 200 cases for 10 hours, with excellent generalizability.

Seeker: Towards Exception Safety Code Generation with Intermediate Language Agents Framework,"Xuanming Zhang, Yuxuan Chen, Yiming Zheng, Zhexin Zhang, Yuan Yuan, Minlie Huang","In real world software development, improper or missing exception handling can severely impact the robustness and reliability of code. Exception handling mechanisms require developers to detect, capture, and manage exceptions according to high standards, but many developers struggle with these tasks, leading to fragile code. This problem is particularly evident in open-source projects and impacts the overall quality of the software ecosystem. To address this challenge, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to improve exception handling in code. Through extensive analysis, we identify three key issues: Insensitive Detection of Fragile Code, Inaccurate Capture of Exception Block, and Distorted Handling Solution. These problems are widespread across real world repositories, suggesting that robust exception handling practices are often overlooked or mishandled. In response, we propose Seeker, a multi-agent framework inspired by expert developer strategies for exception handling. Seeker uses agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler to assist LLMs in detecting, capturing, and resolving exceptions more effectively. Our work is the first systematic study on leveraging LLMs to enhance exception handling practices in real development scenarios, providing valuable insights for future improvements in code reliability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11713v1,2024-12
MiMoTable: A Multi-scale Spreadsheet Benchmark with Meta Operations for Table Reasoning,"Zheng Li, Yang Du, Mao Zheng, Mingyang Song","Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for table reasoning and has significantly improved the performance on existing benchmarks. However, tables and user questions in real-world applications are more complex and diverse, presenting an unignorable gap compared to the existing benchmarks. To fill the gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ult\textbf{i}-scale spreadsheet benchmark with \textbf{M}eta \textbf{o}perations for \textbf{Table} reasoning, named as MiMoTable. Specifically, MiMoTable incorporates two key features. First, the tables in MiMoTable are all spreadsheets used in real-world scenarios, which cover seven domains and contain different types. Second, we define a new criterion with six categories of meta operations for measuring the difficulty of each question in MiMoTable, simultaneously as a new perspective for measuring the difficulty of the existing benchmarks. Experimental results show that Claude-3.5-Sonnet achieves the best performance with 77.4\% accuracy, indicating that there is still significant room to improve for LLMs on MiMoTable. Furthermore, we grade the difficulty of existing benchmarks according to our new criteria. Experiments have shown that the performance of LLMs decreases as the difficulty of benchmarks increases, thereby proving the effectiveness of our proposed new criterion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11711v2,2024-12
Context Filtering with Reward Modeling in Question Answering,"Sangryul Kim, James Thorne","Question Answering (QA) in NLP is the task of finding answers to a query within a relevant context retrieved by a retrieval system. Yet, the mix of relevant and irrelevant information in these contexts can hinder performance enhancements in QA tasks. To address this, we introduce a context filtering approach that removes non-essential details, summarizing crucial content through Reward Modeling. This method emphasizes keeping vital data while omitting the extraneous during summarization model training. We offer a framework for developing efficient QA models by discerning useful information from dataset pairs, bypassing the need for costly human evaluation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can significantly outperform the baseline, as evidenced by a 6.8-fold increase in the EM Per Token (EPT) metric, which we propose as a measure of token efficiency, indicating a notable token-efficiency boost for low-resource settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11707v1,2024-12
Vocabulary Expansion of Chat Models with Unlabeled Target Language Data,"Atsuki Yamaguchi, Terufumi Morishita, Aline Villavicencio, Nikolaos Aletras","Chat models (i.e. language models trained to follow instructions through conversation with humans) outperform base models (i.e. trained solely on unlabeled data) in both conversation and general task-solving abilities. These models are generally English-centric and require further adaptation for languages that are underrepresented in or absent from their training data. A common technique for adapting base models is to extend the model's vocabulary with target language tokens, i.e. vocabulary expansion (VE), and then continually pre-train it on language-specific data. Using chat data is ideal for chat model adaptation, but often, either this does not exist or is costly to construct. Alternatively, adapting chat models with unlabeled data is a possible solution, but it could result in catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we investigate the impact of using unlabeled target language data for VE on chat models for the first time. We first show that off-the-shelf VE generally performs well across target language tasks and models in 71% of cases, though it underperforms in scenarios where source chat models are already strong. To further improve adapted models, we propose post-hoc techniques that inject information from the source model without requiring any further training. Experiments reveal the effectiveness of our methods, helping the adapted models to achieve performance improvements in 87% of cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11704v2,2024-12

Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in solving mathematical problems, with code-based solutions proving particularly effective. However, the best practice to leverage coding instruction data to enhance mathematical reasoning remains underexplored. This study investigates three key questions: (1) How do different coding styles of mathematical code-based rationales impact LLMs' learning performance? (2) Can general-domain coding instructions improve performance? (3) How does integrating textual rationales with code-based ones during training enhance mathematical reasoning abilities? Our findings reveal that code-based rationales with concise comments, descriptive naming, and hardcoded solutions are beneficial, while improvements from general-domain coding instructions and textual rationales are relatively minor. Based on these insights, we propose CoinMath, a learning strategy designed to enhance mathematical reasoning by diversifying the coding styles of code-based rationales. CoinMath generates a variety of code-based rationales incorporating concise comments, descriptive naming conventions, and hardcoded solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that CoinMath significantly outperforms its baseline model, MAmmoTH, one of the SOTA math LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11699v1,2024-12
From Specific-MLLM to Omni-MLLM: A Survey about the MLLMs alligned with Multi-Modality,"Shixin Jiang, Jiafeng Liang, Ming Liu, Bing Qin","From the Specific-MLLM, which excels in single-modal tasks, to the Omni-MLLM, which extends the range of general modalities, this evolution aims to achieve understanding and generation of multimodal information. Omni-MLLM treats the features of different modalities as different ""foreign languages,"" enabling cross-modal interaction and understanding within a unified space. To promote the advancement of related research, we have compiled 47 relevant papers to provide the community with a comprehensive introduction to Omni-MLLM. We first explain the four core components of Omni-MLLM for unified modeling and interaction of multiple modalities. Next, we introduce the effective integration achieved through ""alignment pretraining"" and ""instruction fine-tuning,"" and discuss open-source datasets and testing of interaction capabilities. Finally, we summarize the main challenges facing current Omni-MLLM and outline future directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11694v1,2024-12
Multilingual and Explainable Text Detoxification with Parallel Corpora,"Daryna Dementieva, Nikolay Babakov, Amit Ronen, Abinew Ali Ayele, Naquee Rizwan, Florian Schneider, Xintong Wang, Seid Muhie Yimam, Daniil Moskovskiy, Elisei Stakovskii, Eran Kaufman, Ashraf Elnagar, Animesh Mukherjee, Alexander Panchenko","Even with various regulations in place across countries and social media platforms (Government of India, 2021; European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2022, digital abusive speech remains a significant issue. One potential approach to address this challenge is automatic text detoxification, a text style transfer (TST) approach that transforms toxic language into a more neutral or non-toxic form. To date, the availability of parallel corpora for the text detoxification task (Logachevavet al., 2022; Atwell et al., 2022; Dementievavet al., 2024a) has proven to be crucial for state-of-the-art approaches. With this work, we extend parallel text detoxification corpus to new languages -- German, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, and Amharic -- testing in the extensive multilingual setup TST baselines. Next, we conduct the first of its kind an automated, explainable analysis of the descriptive features of both toxic and non-toxic sentences, diving deeply into the nuances, similarities, and differences of toxicity and detoxification across 9 languages. Finally, based on the obtained insights, we experiment with a novel text detoxification method inspired by the Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning approach, enhancing the prompting process through clustering on relevant descriptive attributes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11691v1,2024-12
DisEmbed: Transforming Disease Understanding through Embeddings,Salman Faroz,"The medical domain is vast and diverse, with many existing embedding models focused on general healthcare applications. However, these models often struggle to capture a deep understanding of diseases due to their broad generalization across the entire medical field. To address this gap, I present DisEmbed, a disease-focused embedding model. DisEmbed is trained on a synthetic dataset specifically curated to include disease descriptions, symptoms, and disease-related Q\&A pairs, making it uniquely suited for disease-related tasks. For evaluation, I benchmarked DisEmbed against existing medical models using disease-specific datasets and the triplet evaluation method. My results demonstrate that DisEmbed outperforms other models, particularly in identifying disease-related contexts and distinguishing between similar diseases. This makes DisEmbed highly valuable for disease-specific use cases, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tasks, where its performance is particularly robust.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15258v1,2024-12
Bias Vector: Mitigating Biases in Language Models with Task Arithmetic Approach,"Daiki Shirafuji, Makoto Takenaka, Shinya Taguchi","The use of language models (LMs) has increased considerably in recent years, and the biases and stereotypes in training data that are reflected in the LM outputs are causing social problems. In this paper, inspired by the task arithmetic, we propose the ``Bias Vector'' method for the mitigation of these LM biases. The Bias Vector method does not require manually created debiasing data. The three main steps of our approach involve: (1) continual training the pre-trained LMs on biased data using masked language modeling; (2) constructing the Bias Vector as the difference between the weights of the biased LMs and those of pre-trained LMs; and (3) subtracting the Bias Vector from the weights of the pre-trained LMs for debiasing. We evaluated the Bias Vector method on the SEAT across three LMs and confirmed an average improvement of 0.177 points. We demonstrated that the Bias Vector method does not degrade the LM performance on downstream tasks in the GLUE benchmark. In addition, we examined the impact of scaling factors, which control the magnitudes of Bias Vectors, with effect sizes on the SEAT and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our debiased LMs across both the SEAT and GLUE benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11679v1,2024-12
BioBridge: Unified Bio-Embedding with Bridging Modality in Code-Switched EMR,"Jangyeong Jeon, Sangyeon Cho, Dongjoon Lee, Changhee Lee, Junyeong Kim","Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) overcrowding presents a significant global challenge, prompting the need for efficient solutions. This paper introduces the BioBridge framework, a novel approach that applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) in written free-text form to enhance decision-making in PED. In non-English speaking countries, such as South Korea, EMR data is often written in a Code-Switching (CS) format that mixes the native language with English, with most code-switched English words having clinical significance. The BioBridge framework consists of two core modules: ""bridging modality in context"" and ""unified bio-embedding."" The ""bridging modality in context"" module improves the contextual understanding of bilingual and code-switched EMRs. In the ""unified bio-embedding"" module, the knowledge of the model trained in the medical domain is injected into the encoder-based model to bridge the gap between the medical and general domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BioBridge significantly performance traditional machine learning and pre-trained encoder-based models on several metrics, including F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and Brier score. Specifically, BioBridge-XLM achieved enhancements of 0.85% in F1 score, 0.75% in AUROC, and 0.76% in AUPRC, along with a notable 3.04% decrease in the Brier score, demonstrating marked improvements in accuracy, reliability, and prediction calibration over the baseline XLM model. The source code will be made publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11671v1,2024-12
C3oT: Generating Shorter Chain-of-Thought without Compromising Effectiveness,"Yu Kang, Xianghui Sun, Liangyu Chen, Wei Zou","Generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before deriving the answer can effectively improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and significantly improve the accuracy of the generated answer. However, in most cases, the length of the generated CoT is much longer than the desired final answer, which results in additional decoding costs. Furthermore, existing research has discovered that shortening the reasoning steps in CoT, even while preserving the key information, diminishes LLMs' abilities. These phenomena make it difficult to use LLMs and CoT in many real-world applications that only require the final answer and are sensitive to latency, such as search and recommendation. To reduce the costs of model decoding and shorten the length of the generated CoT, this paper presents $\textbf{C}$onditioned $\textbf{C}$ompressed $\textbf{C}$hain-of-$\textbf{T}$hought (C3oT), a CoT compression framework that involves a compressor to compress an original longer CoT into a shorter CoT while maintaining key information and interpretability, a conditioned training method to train LLMs with both longer CoT and shorter CoT simultaneously to learn the corresponding relationships between them, and a conditioned inference method to gain the reasoning ability learned from longer CoT by generating shorter CoT. We conduct experiments over four datasets from arithmetic and commonsense scenarios, showing that the proposed method is capable of compressing the length of generated CoT by up to more than 50% without compromising its effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11664v1,2024-12
Self-Adaptive Paraphrasing and Preference Learning for Improved Claim Verifiability,"Amelie Wührl, Roman Klinger","In fact-checking, structure and phrasing of claims critically influence a model's ability to predict verdicts accurately. Social media content in particular rarely serves as optimal input for verification systems, which necessitates pre-processing to extract the claim from noisy context before fact checking. Prior work suggests extracting a claim representation that humans find to be checkworthy and verifiable. This has two limitations: (1) the format may not be optimal for a fact-checking model, and (2), it requires annotated data to learn the extraction task from. We address both issues and propose a method to extract claims that is not reliant on labeled training data. Instead, our self-adaptive approach only requires a black-box fact checking model and a generative language model (LM). Given a tweet, we iteratively optimize the LM to generate a claim paraphrase that increases the performance of a fact checking model. By learning from preference pairs, we align the LM to the fact checker using direct preference optimization. We show that this novel setup extracts a claim paraphrase that is more verifiable than their original social media formulations, and is on par with competitive baselines. For refuted claims, our method consistently outperforms all baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11653v1,2024-12
SE-GCL: An Event-Based Simple and Effective Graph Contrastive Learning for Text Representation,"Tao Meng, Wei Ai, Jianbin Li, Ze Wang, Yuntao Shou, Keqin Li","Text representation learning is significant as the cornerstone of natural language processing. In recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has been widely used in text representation learning due to its ability to represent and capture complex text information in a self-supervised setting. However, current mainstream graph contrastive learning methods often require the incorporation of domain knowledge or cumbersome computations to guide the data augmentation process, which significantly limits the application efficiency and scope of GCL. Additionally, many methods learn text representations only by constructing word-document relationships, which overlooks the rich contextual semantic information in the text. To address these issues and exploit representative textual semantics, we present an event-based, simple, and effective graph contrastive learning (SE-GCL) for text representation. Precisely, we extract event blocks from text and construct internal relation graphs to represent inter-semantic interconnections, which can ensure that the most critical semantic information is preserved. Then, we devise a streamlined, unsupervised graph contrastive learning framework to leverage the complementary nature of the event semantic and structural information for intricate feature data capture. In particular, we introduce the concept of an event skeleton for core representation semantics and simplify the typically complex data augmentation techniques found in existing graph contrastive learning to boost algorithmic efficiency. We employ multiple loss functions to prompt diverse embeddings to converge or diverge within a confined distance in the vector space, ultimately achieving a harmonious equilibrium. We conducted experiments on the proposed SE-GCL on four standard data sets (AG News, 20NG, SougouNews, and THUCNews) to verify its effectiveness in text representation learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11652v1,2024-12
On Crowdsourcing Task Design for Discourse Relation Annotation,"Frances Yung, Vera Demberg","Interpreting implicit discourse relations involves complex reasoning, requiring the integration of semantic cues with background knowledge, as overt connectives like because or then are absent. These relations often allow multiple interpretations, best represented as distributions. In this study, we compare two established methods that crowdsource English implicit discourse relation annotation by connective insertion: a free-choice approach, which allows annotators to select any suitable connective, and a forced-choice approach, which asks them to select among a set of predefined options. Specifically, we re-annotate the whole DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus -- initially annotated with the free-choice method -- using the forced-choice approach. The free-choice approach allows for flexible and intuitive insertion of various connectives, which are context-dependent. Comparison among over 130,000 annotations, however, shows that the free-choice strategy produces less diverse annotations, often converging on common labels. Analysis of the results reveals the interplay between task design and the annotators' abilities to interpret and produce discourse relations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11637v1,2024-12
"Fool Me, Fool Me: User Attitudes Toward LLM Falsehoods","Diana Bar-Or Nirman, Ariel Weizman, Amos Azaria","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become central tools in various fields, they often provide inaccurate or false information. This study examines user preferences regarding falsehood responses from LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate preferences for LLM responses where false statements are explicitly marked versus unmarked responses and preferences for confident falsehoods compared to LLM disclaimers acknowledging a lack of knowledge. Additionally, we investigate how requiring users to assess the truthfulness of statements influences these preferences.   Surprisingly, 61\% of users prefer unmarked falsehood responses over marked ones, and 69\% prefer confident falsehoods over LLMs admitting lack of knowledge. In all our experiments, a total of 300 users participated, contributing valuable data to our analysis and conclusions. When users are required to evaluate the truthfulness of statements, preferences for unmarked and falsehood responses decrease slightly but remain high. These findings suggest that user preferences, which influence LLM training via feedback mechanisms, may inadvertently encourage the generation of falsehoods. Future research should address the ethical and practical implications of aligning LLM behavior with such preferences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11625v1,2024-12
DLF: Disentangled-Language-Focused Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Pan Wang, Qiang Zhou, Yawen Wu, Tianlong Chen, Jingtong Hu","Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) leverages heterogeneous modalities, such as language, vision, and audio, to enhance the understanding of human sentiment. While existing models often focus on extracting shared information across modalities or directly fusing heterogeneous modalities, such approaches can introduce redundancy and conflicts due to equal treatment of all modalities and the mutual transfer of information between modality pairs. To address these issues, we propose a Disentangled-Language-Focused (DLF) multimodal representation learning framework, which incorporates a feature disentanglement module to separate modality-shared and modality-specific information. To further reduce redundancy and enhance language-targeted features, four geometric measures are introduced to refine the disentanglement process. A Language-Focused Attractor (LFA) is further developed to strengthen language representation by leveraging complementary modality-specific information through a language-guided cross-attention mechanism. The framework also employs hierarchical predictions to improve overall accuracy. Extensive experiments on two popular MSA datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate the significant performance gains achieved by the proposed DLF framework. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the feature disentanglement module, language-focused attractor, and hierarchical predictions.

MT-LENS: An all-in-one Toolkit for Better Machine Translation Evaluation,"Javier García Gilabert, Carlos Escolano, Audrey Mash, Xixian Liao, Maite Melero","We introduce MT-LENS, a framework designed to evaluate Machine Translation (MT) systems across a variety of tasks, including translation quality, gender bias detection, added toxicity, and robustness to misspellings. While several toolkits have become very popular for benchmarking the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing evaluation tools often lack the ability to thoroughly assess the diverse aspects of MT performance. MT-LENS addresses these limitations by extending the capabilities of LM-eval-harness for MT, supporting state-of-the-art datasets and a wide range of evaluation metrics. It also offers a user-friendly platform to compare systems and analyze translations with interactive visualizations. MT-LENS aims to broaden access to evaluation strategies that go beyond traditional translation quality evaluation, enabling researchers and engineers to better understand the performance of a NMT model and also easily measure system's biases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11615v1,2024-12
SPaR: Self-Play with Tree-Search Refinement to Improve Instruction-Following in Large Language Models,"Jiale Cheng, Xiao Liu, Cunxiang Wang, Xiaotao Gu, Yida Lu, Dan Zhang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang","Instruction-following is a fundamental capability of language models, requiring the model to recognize even the most subtle requirements in the instructions and accurately reflect them in its output. Such an ability is well-suited for and often optimized by preference learning. However, existing methods often directly sample multiple independent responses from the model when creating preference pairs. Such practice can introduce content variations irrelevant to whether the instruction is precisely followed (e.g., different expressions about the same semantic), interfering with the goal of teaching models to recognize the key differences that lead to improved instruction following. In light of this, we introduce SPaR, a self-play framework integrating tree-search self-refinement to yield valid and comparable preference pairs free from distractions. By playing against itself, an LLM employs a tree-search strategy to refine its previous responses with respect to the instruction while minimizing unnecessary variations. Our experiments show that a LLaMA3-8B model, trained over three iterations guided by SPaR, surpasses GPT-4-Turbo on the IFEval benchmark without losing general capabilities. Furthermore, SPaR demonstrates promising scalability and transferability, greatly enhancing models like GLM-4-9B and LLaMA3-70B. We also identify how inference scaling in tree search would impact model performance.

AUEB-Archimedes at RIRAG-2025: Is obligation concatenation really all you need?,"Ioannis Chasandras, Odysseas S. Chlapanis, Ion Androutsopoulos","This paper presents the systems we developed for RIRAG-2025, a shared task that requires answering regulatory questions by retrieving relevant passages. The generated answers are evaluated using RePASs, a reference-free and model-based metric. Our systems use a combination of three retrieval models and a reranker. We show that by exploiting a neural component of RePASs that extracts important sentences ('obligations') from the retrieved passages, we achieve a dubiously high score (0.947), even though the answers are directly extracted from the retrieved passages and are not actually generated answers. We then show that by selecting the answer with the best RePASs among a few generated alternatives and then iteratively refining this answer by reducing contradictions and covering more obligations, we can generate readable, coherent answers that achieve a more plausible and relatively high score (0.639).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11567v1,2024-12
The Role of Natural Language Processing Tasks in Automatic Literary Character Network Construction,"Arthur Amalvy, Vincent Labatut, Richard Dufour","The automatic extraction of character networks from literary texts is generally carried out using natural language processing (NLP) cascading pipelines. While this approach is widespread, no study exists on the impact of low-level NLP tasks on their performance. In this article, we conduct such a study on a literary dataset, focusing on the role of named entity recognition (NER) and coreference resolution when extracting co-occurrence networks. To highlight the impact of these tasks' performance, we start with gold-standard annotations, progressively add uniformly distributed errors, and observe their impact in terms of character network quality. We demonstrate that NER performance depends on the tested novel and strongly affects character detection. We also show that NER-detected mentions alone miss a lot of character co-occurrences, and that coreference resolution is needed to prevent this. Finally, we present comparison points with 2 methods based on large language models (LLMs), including a fully end-to-end one, and show that these models are outperformed by traditional NLP pipelines in terms of recall.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11560v1,2024-12
Token Prepending: A Training-Free Approach for Eliciting Better Sentence Embeddings from LLMs,"Yuchen Fu, Zifeng Cheng, Zhiwei Jiang, Zhonghui Wang, Yafeng Yin, Zhengliang Li, Qing Gu","Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction, as LLMs have demonstrated stronger semantic understanding capabilities. Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence information into the embedding of the last token. However, LLMs are mostly decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token. To this end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each layer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next layer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence information under the causal attention mechanism. The proposed TP technique is a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly integrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and autoregressive LLMs. Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our proposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing prompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring negligible additional inference cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11556v1,2024-12

We observe that these ensembles often suffer from low robustness against weak ensemble components due to error accumulation. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient ensemble-selection approach that avoids error accumulation. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms each individual model as well as previous ensemble techniques. Additionally, our experiments show that the proposed ensemble-selection method significantly enhances the performance and robustness of our ensemble, surpassing previously proposed strategies, which have not accounted for error diversity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11543v1,2024-12

Let your LLM generate a few tokens and you will reduce the need for retrieval,Hervé Déjean,"In this paper, we investigate how efficiently large language models (LLM) can be trained to check whether an answer is already stored in their parametric memory. We distill an LLM-as-a-judge to compute the IK (I Know) score. We found that this method is particularly beneficial in the context of retrieval-assisted augmented generation (RAG), with a respectable accuracy of 80%. It enables a significant reduction (more than 50%) in the number of search and reranking steps required for certain data sets. We have also introduced the IK score, which serves as a useful tool for characterising datasets by facilitating the classification task. Interestingly, through the inclusion of response tokens as input, our results suggest that only about 20,000 training samples are required to achieve good performance. The central element of this work is the use of a teacher model - the LLM as a judge - to generate training data. We also assess the robustness of the IK classifier by evaluating it with various types of teachers, including both string-based methods and LLMs, with the latter providing better results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11536v1,2024-12
DART: An AIGT Detector using AMR of Rephrased Text,"Hyeonchu Park, Byungjun Kim, Bugeun Kim","As large language models (LLMs) generate more human-like texts, concerns about the side effects of AI-generated texts (AIGT) have grown. So, researchers have developed methods for detecting AIGT. However, two challenges remain. First, the performance on detecting black-box LLMs is low, because existing models have focused on syntactic features. Second, most AIGT detectors have been tested on a single-candidate setting, which assumes that we know the origin of an AIGT and may deviate from the real-world scenario. To resolve these challenges, we propose DART, which consists of four steps: rephrasing, semantic parsing, scoring, and multiclass classification. We conducted several experiments to test the performance of DART by following previous work. The experimental result shows that DART can discriminate multiple black-box LLMs without using syntactic features and knowing the origin of AIGT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11517v1,2024-12
Glimpse: Enabling White-Box Methods to Use Proprietary Models for Zero-Shot LLM-Generated Text Detection,"Guangsheng Bao, Yanbin Zhao, Juncai He, Yue Zhang","Advanced large language models (LLMs) can generate text almost indistinguishable from human-written text, highlighting the importance of LLM-generated text detection. However, current zero-shot techniques face challenges as white-box methods are restricted to use weaker open-source LLMs, and black-box methods are limited by partial observation from stronger proprietary LLMs. It seems impossible to enable white-box methods to use proprietary models because API-level access to the models neither provides full predictive distributions nor inner embeddings. To traverse the divide, we propose Glimpse, a probability distribution estimation approach, predicting the full distributions from partial observations. Despite the simplicity of Glimpse, we successfully extend white-box methods like Entropy, Rank, Log-Rank, and Fast-DetectGPT to latest proprietary models. Experiments show that Glimpse with Fast-DetectGPT and GPT-3.5 achieves an average AUROC of about 0.95 in five latest source models, improving the score by 51% relative to the remaining space of the open source baseline (Table 1). It demonstrates that the latest LLMs can effectively detect their own outputs, suggesting that advanced LLMs may be the best shield against themselves.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11506v1,2024-12

However, the huge computation overhead during inference hinders the deployment in industrial applications. Many works leverage traditional compression approaches to boost model inference, but these always introduce additional training costs to restore the performance and the pruning results typically show noticeable performance drops compared to the original model when aiming for a specific level of acceleration. To address these issues, we propose a fine-grained token-wise pruning approach for the LLMs, which presents a learnable router to adaptively identify the less important tokens and skip them across model blocks to reduce computational cost during inference. To construct the router efficiently, we present a search-based sparsity scheduler for pruning sparsity allocation, a trainable router combined with our proposed four low-dimensional factors as input and three proposed losses. We conduct extensive experiments across different benchmarks on different LLMs to demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) pruning results, surpassing other existing pruning methods. For instance, our method outperforms BlockPruner and ShortGPT by approximately 10 points on both LLaMA2-7B and Qwen1.5-7B in accuracy retention at comparable token sparsity levels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11494v1,2024-12
NoteContrast: Contrastive Language-Diagnostic Pretraining for Medical Text,"Prajwal Kailas, Max Homilius, Rahul C. Deo, Calum A. MacRae","Accurate diagnostic coding of medical notes is crucial for enhancing patient care, medical research, and error-free billing in healthcare organizations. Manual coding is a time-consuming task for providers, and diagnostic codes often exhibit low sensitivity and specificity, whereas the free text in medical notes can be a more precise description of a patients status. Thus, accurate automated diagnostic coding of medical notes has become critical for a learning healthcare system. Recent developments in long-document transformer architectures have enabled attention-based deep-learning models to adjudicate medical notes. In addition, contrastive loss functions have been used to jointly pre-train large language and image models with noisy labels. To further improve the automated adjudication of medical notes, we developed an approach based on i) models for ICD-10 diagnostic code sequences using a large real-world data set, ii) large language models for medical notes, and iii) contrastive pre-training to build an integrated model of both ICD-10 diagnostic codes and corresponding medical text. We demonstrate that a contrastive approach for pre-training improves performance over prior state-of-the-art models for the MIMIC-III-50, MIMIC-III-rare50, and MIMIC-III-full diagnostic coding tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11477v1,2024-12
Understanding Knowledge Hijack Mechanism in In-context Learning through Associative Memory,"Shuo Wang, Issei Sato","In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks without fine-tuning by leveraging contextual information provided within a prompt. However, ICL relies not only on contextual clues but also on the global knowledge acquired during pretraining for the next token prediction. Analyzing this process has been challenging due to the complex computational circuitry of LLMs. This paper investigates the balance between in-context information and pretrained bigram knowledge in token prediction, focusing on the induction head mechanism, a key component in ICL. Leveraging the fact that a two-layer transformer can implement the induction head mechanism with associative memories, we theoretically analyze the logits when a two-layer transformer is given prompts generated by a bigram model. In the experiments, we design specific prompts to evaluate whether the outputs of a two-layer transformer align with the theoretical results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11459v1,2024-12
Towards Better Multi-task Learning: A Framework for Optimizing Dataset Combinations in Large Language Models,"Zaifu Zhan, Rui Zhang","To efficiently select optimal dataset combinations for enhancing multi-task learning (MTL) performance in large language models, we proposed a novel framework that leverages a neural network to predict the best dataset combinations. The framework iteratively refines the selection, greatly improving efficiency, while being model-, dataset-, and domain-independent. Through experiments on 12 biomedical datasets across four tasks - named entity recognition, relation extraction, event extraction, and text classification-we demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies better combinations, even for tasks that may seem unpromising from a human perspective. This verifies that our framework provides a promising solution for maximizing MTL potential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11455v1,2024-12
ACE-$M^3$: Automatic Capability Evaluator for Multimodal Medical Models,"Xiechi Zhang, Shunfan Zheng, Linlin Wang, Gerard de Melo, Zhu Cao, Xiaoling Wang, Liang He","As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) gain prominence in the medical field, the need for precise evaluation methods to assess their effectiveness has become critical. While benchmarks provide a reliable means to evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs, traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU employed for open domain evaluation only focus on token overlap and may not align with human judgment. Although human evaluation is more reliable, it is labor-intensive, costly, and not scalable. LLM-based evaluation methods have proven promising, but to date, there is still an urgent need for open-source multimodal LLM-based evaluators in the medical field. To address this issue, we introduce ACE-$M^3$, an open-sourced \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{C}apability \textbf{E}valuator for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{M}edical \textbf{M}odels specifically designed to assess the question answering abilities of medical MLLMs. It first utilizes a branch-merge architecture to provide both detailed analysis and a concise final score based on standard medical evaluation criteria. Subsequently, a reward token-based direct preference optimization (RTDPO) strategy is incorporated to save training time without compromising performance of our model. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our ACE-$M^3$ model\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/collections/AIUSRTMP/ace-m3-67593297ff391b93e3e5d068}} in evaluating the capabilities of medical MLLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11453v1,2024-12
Whisper-GPT: A Hybrid Representation Audio Large Language Model,Prateek Verma,"We propose WHISPER-GPT: A generative large language model (LLM) for speech and music that allows us to work with continuous audio representations and discrete tokens simultaneously as part of a single architecture. There has been a huge surge in generative audio, speech, and music models that utilize discrete audio tokens derived from neural compression algorithms, e.g. ENCODEC. However, one of the major drawbacks of this approach is handling the context length. It blows up for high-fidelity generative architecture if one has to account for all the audio contents at various frequencies for the next token prediction. By combining continuous audio representation like the spectrogram and discrete acoustic tokens, we retain the best of both worlds: Have all the information needed from the audio at a specific time instance in a single token, yet allow LLM to predict the future token to allow for sampling and other benefits discrete space provides. We show how our architecture improves the perplexity and negative log-likelihood scores for the next token prediction compared to a token-based LLM for speech and music.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11449v1,2024-12

This survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within multimodal learning through the lens of NTP.

Optimized Quran Passage Retrieval Using an Expanded QA Dataset and Fine-Tuned Language Models,"Mohamed Basem, Islam Oshallah, Baraa Hikal, Ali Hamdi, Ammar Mohamed","Understanding the deep meanings of the Qur'an and bridging the language gap between modern standard Arabic and classical Arabic is essential to improve the question-and-answer system for the Holy Qur'an. The Qur'an QA 2023 shared task dataset had a limited number of questions with weak model retrieval. To address this challenge, this work updated the original dataset and improved the model accuracy. The original dataset, which contains 251 questions, was reviewed and expanded to 629 questions with question diversification and reformulation, leading to a comprehensive set of 1895 categorized into single-answer, multi-answer, and zero-answer types. Extensive experiments fine-tuned transformer models, including AraBERT, RoBERTa, CAMeLBERT, AraELECTRA, and BERT. The best model, AraBERT-base, achieved a MAP@10 of 0.36 and MRR of 0.59, representing improvements of 63% and 59%, respectively, compared to the baseline scores (MAP@10: 0.22, MRR: 0.37). Additionally, the dataset expansion led to improvements in handling ""no answer"" cases, with the proposed approach achieving a 75% success rate for such instances, compared to the baseline's 25%. These results demonstrate the effect of dataset improvement and model architecture optimization in increasing the performance of QA systems for the Holy Qur'an, with higher accuracy, recall, and precision.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11431v1,2024-12
ConceptEdit: Conceptualization-Augmented Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models for Commonsense Reasoning,"Liyu Zhang, Weiqi Wang, Tianqing Fang, Yangqiu Song","Knowledge Editing (KE) aims to adjust a Large Language Model's (LLM) internal representations and parameters to correct inaccuracies and improve output consistency without incurring the computational expense of re-training the entire model. However, editing commonsense knowledge still faces difficulties, including limited knowledge coverage in existing resources, the infeasibility of annotating labels for an overabundance of commonsense knowledge, and the strict knowledge formats of current editing methods. In this paper, we address these challenges by presenting ConceptEdit, a framework that integrates conceptualization and instantiation into the KE pipeline for LLMs to enhance their commonsense reasoning capabilities. ConceptEdit dynamically diagnoses implausible commonsense knowledge within an LLM using another verifier LLM and augments the source knowledge to be edited with conceptualization for stronger generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs enhanced with ConceptEdit successfully generate commonsense knowledge with improved plausibility compared to other baselines and achieve stronger performance across multiple question answering benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11418v1,2024-12
Look Ahead Text Understanding and LLM Stitching,"Junlin Julian Jiang, Xin Li","This paper proposes a look ahead text understanding problem with look ahead section identification (LASI) as an example. This problem may appear in generative AI as well as human interactions, where we want to understand the direction of a developing text or conversation. We tackle the problem using transformer-based LLMs. We show that LASI is more challenging than classic section identification (SI). We argue that both bidirectional contextual information (e.g., BERT) and unidirectional predictive ability (e.g., GPT) will benefit the task. We propose two approaches to stitch together BERT and GPT. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the established models, especially when there is noise in the text (which is often the case for developing text in generative AI). Our paper sheds light on other look ahead text understanding tasks that are important to social media, such as look ahead sentiment classification, and points out the opportunities to leverage pre-trained LLMs through stitching.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17836v1,2024-12
Biased or Flawed? Mitigating Stereotypes in Generative Language Models by Addressing Task-Specific Flaws,"Akshita Jha, Sanchit Kabra, Chandan K. Reddy","Recent studies have shown that generative language models often reflect and amplify societal biases in their outputs. However, these studies frequently conflate observed biases with other task-specific shortcomings, such as comprehension failure. For example, when a model misinterprets a text and produces a response that reinforces a stereotype, it becomes difficult to determine whether the issue arises from inherent bias or from a misunderstanding of the given content. In this paper, we conduct a multi-faceted evaluation that distinctly disentangles bias from flaws within the reading comprehension task. We propose a targeted stereotype mitigation framework that implicitly mitigates observed stereotypes in generative models through instruction-tuning on general-purpose datasets. We reduce stereotypical outputs by over 60% across multiple dimensions -- including nationality, age, gender, disability, and physical appearance -- by addressing comprehension-based failures, and without relying on explicit debiasing techniques. We evaluate several state-of-the-art generative models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach while maintaining the overall utility. Our findings highlight the need to critically disentangle the concept of `bias' from other types of errors to build more targeted and effective mitigation strategies.

Attention with Dependency Parsing Augmentation for Fine-Grained Attribution,"Qiang Ding, Lvzhou Luo, Yixuan Cao, Ping Luo","To assist humans in efficiently validating RAG-generated content, developing a fine-grained attribution mechanism that provides supporting evidence from retrieved documents for every answer span is essential. Existing fine-grained attribution methods rely on model-internal similarity metrics between responses and documents, such as saliency scores and hidden state similarity. However, these approaches suffer from either high computational complexity or coarse-grained representations. Additionally, a common problem shared by the previous works is their reliance on decoder-only Transformers, limiting their ability to incorporate contextual information after the target span. To address the above problems, we propose two techniques applicable to all model-internals-based methods. First, we aggregate token-wise evidence through set union operations, preserving the granularity of representations. Second, we enhance the attributor by integrating dependency parsing to enrich the semantic completeness of target spans. For practical implementation, our approach employs attention weights as the similarity metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms all prior works.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11404v1,2024-12
Structured Extraction of Real World Medical Knowledge using LLMs for Summarization and Search,"Edward Kim, Manil Shrestha, Richard Foty, Tom DeLay, Vicki Seyfert-Margolis","Creation and curation of knowledge graphs can accelerate disease discovery and analysis in real-world data. While disease ontologies aid in biological data annotation, codified categories (SNOMED-CT, ICD10, CPT) may not capture patient condition nuances or rare diseases. Multiple disease definitions across data sources complicate ontology mapping and disease clustering. We propose creating patient knowledge graphs using large language model extraction techniques, allowing data extraction via natural language rather than rigid ontological hierarchies. Our method maps to existing ontologies (MeSH, SNOMED-CT, RxNORM, HPO) to ground extracted entities.   Using a large ambulatory care EHR database with 33.6M patients, we demonstrate our method through the patient search for Dravet syndrome, which received ICD10 recognition in October 2020. We describe our construction of patient-specific knowledge graphs and symptom-based patient searches. Using confirmed Dravet syndrome ICD10 codes as ground truth, we employ LLM-based entity extraction to characterize patients in grounded ontologies. We then apply this method to identify Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) patients, demonstrating real-world discovery where no ground truth exists.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15256v1,2024-12
"INTERACT: Enabling Interactive, Question-Driven Learning in Large Language Models","Aum Kendapadi, Kerem Zaman, Rakesh R. Menon, Shashank Srivastava","Large language models (LLMs) excel at answering questions but remain passive learners--absorbing static data without the ability to question and refine knowledge. This paper explores how LLMs can transition to interactive, question-driven learning through student-teacher dialogues. We introduce INTERACT (INTEReractive Learning for Adaptive Concept Transfer), a framework in which a ""student"" LLM engages a ""teacher"" LLM through iterative inquiries to acquire knowledge across 1,347 contexts, including song lyrics, news articles, movie plots, academic papers, and images. Our experiments show that across a wide range of scenarios and LLM architectures, interactive learning consistently enhances performance, achieving up to a 25% improvement, with 'cold-start' student models matching static learning baselines in as few as five dialogue turns. Interactive setups can also mitigate the disadvantages of weaker teachers, showcasing the robustness of question-driven learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11388v1,2024-12
"Why Does ChatGPT ""Delve"" So Much? Exploring the Sources of Lexical Overrepresentation in Large Language Models","Tom S. Juzek, Zina B. Ward","Scientific English is currently undergoing rapid change, with words like ""delve,"" ""intricate,"" and ""underscore"" appearing far more frequently than just a few years ago. It is widely assumed that scientists' use of large language models (LLMs) is responsible for such trends. We develop a formal, transferable method to characterize these linguistic changes. Application of our method yields 21 focal words whose increased occurrence in scientific abstracts is likely the result of LLM usage. We then pose ""the puzzle of lexical overrepresentation"": WHY are such words overused by LLMs? We fail to find evidence that lexical overrepresentation is caused by model architecture, algorithm choices, or training data. To assess whether reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) contributes to the overuse of focal words, we undertake comparative model testing and conduct an exploratory online study. While the model testing is consistent with RLHF playing a role, our experimental results suggest that participants may be reacting differently to ""delve"" than to other focal words. With LLMs quickly becoming a driver of global language change, investigating these potential sources of lexical overrepresentation is important. We note that while insights into the workings of LLMs are within reach, a lack of transparency surrounding model development remains an obstacle to such research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11385v1,2024-12
ChatTime: A Unified Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model Bridging Numerical and Textual Data,"Chengsen Wang, Qi Qi, Jingyu Wang, Haifeng Sun, Zirui Zhuang, Jinming Wu, Lei Zhang, Jianxin Liao","Human experts typically integrate numerical and textual multimodal information to analyze time series. However, most traditional deep learning predictors rely solely on unimodal numerical data, using a fixed-length window for training and prediction on a single dataset, and cannot adapt to different scenarios. The powered pre-trained large language model has introduced new opportunities for time series analysis. Yet, existing methods are either inefficient in training, incapable of handling textual information, or lack zero-shot forecasting capability. In this paper, we innovatively model time series as a foreign language and construct ChatTime, a unified framework for time series and text processing. As an out-of-the-box multimodal time series foundation model, ChatTime provides zero-shot forecasting capability and supports bimodal input/output for both time series and text. We design a series of experiments to verify the superior performance of ChatTime across multiple tasks and scenarios, and create four multimodal datasets to address data gaps. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and utility of ChatTime.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11376v1,2024-12
Codenames as a Benchmark for Large Language Models,"Matthew Stephenson, Matthew Sidji, Benoît Ronval","In this paper, we propose the use of the popular word-based board game Codenames as a suitable benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Codenames presents a highly interesting challenge for achieving successful AI performance, requiring both a sophisticated understanding of language, theory of mind, and epistemic reasoning capabilities. Prior attempts to develop agents for Codenames have largely relied on word embedding techniques, which have a limited vocabulary range and perform poorly when paired with differing approaches. LLMs have demonstrated enhanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities for language-based tasks, but can still suffer in lateral thinking challenges. We evaluate the capabilities of several state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3.1, across a variety of board setups. Our results indicate that while certain LLMs perform better than others overall, different models exhibit varying emergent behaviours during gameplay and excel at specific roles. We also evaluate the performance of different combinations of LLMs when playing cooperatively together, demonstrating that LLM agents are more generalisable to a wider range of teammates than prior techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11373v1,2024-12
Can AI Extract Antecedent Factors of Human Trust in AI?

One such area is Trust in AI, where factors contributing to human trust in artificial intelligence applications are studied. The relationships of these factors with human trust in such applications are complex. We hence explore this space from the lens of information extraction where, with the input of domain experts, we carefully design annotation guidelines, create the first annotated English dataset in this domain, investigate an LLM-guided annotation, and benchmark it with state-of-the-art methods using large language models in named entity and relation extraction.

Segment-Level Diffusion: A Framework for Controllable Long-Form Generation with Diffusion Language Models,"Xiaochen Zhu, Georgi Karadzhov, Chenxi Whitehouse, Andreas Vlachos","Diffusion models have shown promise in text generation but often struggle with generating long, coherent, and contextually accurate text. Token-level diffusion overlooks word-order dependencies and enforces short output windows, while passage-level diffusion struggles with learning robust representation for long-form text. To address these challenges, we propose Segment-Level Diffusion (SLD), a framework that enhances diffusion-based text generation through text segmentation, robust representation training with adversarial and contrastive learning, and improved latent-space guidance. By segmenting long-form outputs into separate latent representations and decoding them with an autoregressive decoder, SLD simplifies diffusion predictions and improves scalability. Experiments on XSum, ROCStories, DialogSum, and DeliData demonstrate that SLD achieves competitive or superior performance in fluency, coherence, and contextual compatibility across automatic and human evaluation metrics comparing with other diffusion and autoregressive baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our segmentation and representation learning strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11333v1,2024-12
Finding a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing: Combating Adversarial Text-To-Image Prompts with Text Summarization,"Portia Cooper, Harshita Narnoli, Mihai Surdeanu","Text-to-image models are vulnerable to the stepwise ""Divide-and-Conquer Attack"" (DACA) that utilize a large language model to obfuscate inappropriate content in prompts by wrapping sensitive text in a benign narrative. To mitigate stepwise DACA attacks, we propose a two-layer method involving text summarization followed by binary classification. We assembled the Adversarial Text-to-Image Prompt (ATTIP) dataset ($N=940$), which contained DACA-obfuscated and non-obfuscated prompts. From the ATTIP dataset, we created two summarized versions: one generated by a small encoder model and the other by a large language model. Then, we used an encoder classifier and a GPT-4o classifier to perform content moderation on the summarized and unsummarized prompts. When compared with a classifier that operated over the unsummarized data, our method improved F1 score performance by 31%. Further, the highest recorded F1 score achieved (98%) was produced by the encoder classifier on a summarized ATTIP variant. This study indicates that pre-classification text summarization can inoculate content detection models against stepwise DACA obfuscations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12212v1,2024-12
Generics are puzzling. Can language models find the missing piece?,"Gustavo Cilleruelo Calderón, Emily Allaway, Barry Haddow, Alexandra Birch","Generic sentences express generalisations about the world without explicit quantification. Although generics are central to everyday communication, building a precise semantic framework has proven difficult, in part because speakers use generics to generalise properties with widely different statistical prevalence. In this work, we study the implicit quantification and context-sensitivity of generics by leveraging language models as models of language. We create ConGen, a dataset of 2873 naturally occurring generic and quantified sentences in context, and define p-acceptability, a metric based on surprisal that is sensitive to quantification. Our experiments show generics are more context-sensitive than determiner quantifiers and about 20% of naturally occurring generics we analyze express weak generalisations.

Sequence-Level Analysis of Leakage Risk of Training Data in Large Language Models,"Trishita Tiwari, G. Edward Suh","This work advocates for the use of sequence level probabilities for quantifying the risk of extraction training data from Large Language Models (LLMs) as they provide much finer-grained information than has been previously obtained. We re-analyze the effects of decoding schemes, model-size, prefix length, partial sequence leakages, and token positions to uncover new insights that have were not possible in prior work due to their choice of metrics. We perform this study on two pre-trained models, LLaMa and OPT, trained on the Common Crawl and Pile respectively. We discover that 1) Extraction rate, the predominant metric used in prior quantification work, underestimates the threat of leakage of training data in randomized LLMs by as much as 2.14x. 2) Though, on average, larger models and longer prefixes can extract more data, this is not true with a substantial portion of individual sequences. 30.4-41.5% of our sequences are easier to extract with either shorter prefixes or smaller models. 3) Contrary to prior belief, partial leakage in the commonly used decoding schemes like top-k and top-p are not easier than leaking verbatim training data. 4) Extracting later tokens in a sequence is as much as 912% easier than extracting earlier tokens. The insights gained from our analysis show that it is important to look at leakage of training data on a per-sequence basis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11302v1,2024-12
Data Laundering: Artificially Boosting Benchmark Results through Knowledge Distillation,"Jonibek Mansurov, Akhmed Sakip, Alham Fikri Aji","In this paper, we show that knowledge distillation can be subverted to manipulate language model benchmark scores, revealing a critical vulnerability in current evaluation practices. We introduce ""Data Laundering,"" a three-phase process analogous to financial money laundering, that enables the covert transfer of benchmark-specific knowledge through seemingly legitimate intermediate training steps. Through extensive experiments with a 2-layer BERT student model, we show how this approach can achieve substantial improvements in benchmark accuracy (up to 75\% on GPQA) without developing genuine reasoning capabilities. Notably, this method can be exploited intentionally or even unintentionally, as researchers may inadvertently adopt this method that inflates scores using knowledge distillation without realizing the implications. While our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we present them as a cautionary tale highlighting the urgent need for more robust evaluation methods in AI. This work aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion about evaluation integrity in AI development and the need for benchmarks that more accurately reflect true model capabilities.

"CATER: Leveraging LLM to Pioneer a Multidimensional, Reference-Independent Paradigm in Translation Quality Evaluation","Kurando IIDA, Kenjiro MIMURA","This paper introduces the Comprehensive AI-assisted Translation Edit Ratio (CATER), a novel and fully prompt-driven framework for evaluating machine translation (MT) quality. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) via a carefully designed prompt-based protocol, CATER expands beyond traditional reference-bound metrics, offering a multidimensional, reference-independent evaluation that addresses linguistic accuracy, semantic fidelity, contextual coherence, stylistic appropriateness, and information completeness. CATER's unique advantage lies in its immediate implementability: by providing the source and target texts along with a standardized prompt, an LLM can rapidly identify errors, quantify edit effort, and produce category-level and overall scores. This approach eliminates the need for pre-computed references or domain-specific resources, enabling instant adaptation to diverse languages, genres, and user priorities through adjustable weights and prompt modifications. CATER's LLM-enabled strategy supports more nuanced assessments, capturing phenomena such as subtle omissions, hallucinations, and discourse-level shifts that increasingly challenge contemporary MT systems. By uniting the conceptual rigor of frameworks like MQM and DQF with the scalability and flexibility of LLM-based evaluation, CATER emerges as a valuable tool for researchers, developers, and professional translators worldwide. The framework and example prompts are openly available, encouraging community-driven refinement and further empirical validation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11261v1,2024-12
Beyond Discrete Personas: Personality Modeling Through Journal Intensive Conversations,"Sayantan Pal, Souvik Das, Rohini K. Srihari","Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved personalized conversational capabilities. However, existing datasets like Persona Chat, Synthetic Persona Chat, and Blended Skill Talk rely on static, predefined personas. This approach often results in dialogues that fail to capture human personalities' fluid and evolving nature. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel dataset with around 400,000 dialogues and a framework for generating personalized conversations using long-form journal entries from Reddit. Our approach clusters journal entries for each author and filters them by selecting the most representative cluster, ensuring that the retained entries best reflect the author's personality. We further refine the data by capturing the Big Five personality traits --openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism --ensuring that dialogues authentically reflect an individual's personality. Using Llama 3 70B, we generate high-quality, personality-rich dialogues grounded in these journal entries. Fine-tuning models on this dataset leads to an 11% improvement in capturing personality traits on average, outperforming existing approaches in generating more coherent and personality-driven dialogues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11250v1,2024-12
TrimLLM: Progressive Layer Dropping for Domain-Specific LLMs,"Lanxiang Hu, Tajana Rosing, Hao Zhang","Specializing large language models (LLMs) for local deployment in domain-specific use cases is necessary for strong performance while meeting latency and privacy constraints. However, conventional task-specific adaptation approaches do not show simultaneous memory saving and inference speedup at deployment time. Practical compression techniques like quantization and pruning require dedicated hardware or kernel support to achieve measured inference speedup. We develop TrimLLM based on the layer-wise specialization phenomenon we empirically observed and verified on contemporary LLMs. TrimLLM reduces the depth of LLMs via progressive layer dropping. We show it retains LLMs' capacity in specific domains and achieves inference speedup irrespective of hardware and deep learning frameworks. We evaluated TrimLLM on LLMs of various sizes for inference; models adapted on medical, legal, and financial datasets all demonstrate $2.1-5.7\times$ inference speedup on consumer GPUs and up to $3.1\times$ speedup on A100 when compared to state-of-the-art model compression algorithms, with no loss in accuracy at 50$\sim$60\% model compression ratio.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11242v2,2024-12
Smaller Language Models Are Better Instruction Evolvers,"Tingfeng Hui, Lulu Zhao, Guanting Dong, Yaqi Zhang, Hua Zhou, Sen Su","Instruction tuning has been widely used to unleash the complete potential of large language models. Notably, complex and diverse instructions are of significant importance as they can effectively align models with various downstream tasks. However, current approaches to constructing large-scale instructions predominantly favour powerful models such as GPT-4 or those with over 70 billion parameters, under the empirical presumption that such larger language models (LLMs) inherently possess enhanced capabilities. In this study, we question this prevalent assumption and conduct an in-depth exploration into the potential of smaller language models (SLMs) in the context of instruction evolution. Extensive experiments across three scenarios of instruction evolution reveal that smaller language models (SLMs) can synthesize more effective instructions than LLMs. Further analysis demonstrates that SLMs possess a broader output space during instruction evolution, resulting in more complex and diverse variants. We also observe that the existing metrics fail to focus on the impact of the instructions. Thus, we propose Instruction Complex-Aware IFD (IC-IFD), which introduces instruction complexity in the original IFD score to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction data more accurately.

To tackle this issue, we introduce RIRO, a novel two-layer architecture designed to improve performance in data-scarce environments. The first layer leverages advanced prompt engineering to reformulate inputs, ensuring better alignment with training data, while the second layer focuses on refining outputs to minimize inconsistencies.

Although they offer considerable advantages, LLMs also present significant risks, such as hallucination, which hinder their widespread deployment in industry. Moreover, low-resource languages such as African ones are still underrepresented in these systems limiting their performance in these languages. In this paper, we illustrate a more classical approach based on modular architectures of Task-oriented Dialog Systems (ToDS) offering better control over outputs. We propose a chatbot generation engine based on the Rasa framework and a robust methodology for projecting annotations onto the Wolof language using an in-house machine translation system. After evaluating a generated chatbot trained on the Amazon Massive dataset, our Wolof Intent Classifier performs similarly to the one obtained for French, which is a resource-rich language. We also show that this approach is extensible to other low-resource languages, thanks to the intent classifier's language-agnostic pipeline, simplifying the design of chatbots in these languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11203v1,2024-12
Drawing the Line: Enhancing Trustworthiness of MLLMs Through the Power of Refusal,"Yuhao Wang, Zhiyuan Zhu, Heyang Liu, Yusheng Liao, Hongcheng Liu, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at multimodal perception and understanding, yet their tendency to generate hallucinated or inaccurate responses undermines their trustworthiness. Existing methods have largely overlooked the importance of refusal responses as a means of enhancing MLLMs reliability. To bridge this gap, we present the Information Boundary-aware Learning Framework (InBoL), a novel approach that empowers MLLMs to refuse to answer user queries when encountering insufficient information. To the best of our knowledge, InBoL is the first framework that systematically defines the conditions under which refusal is appropriate for MLLMs using the concept of information boundaries proposed in our paper. This framework introduces a comprehensive data generation pipeline and tailored training strategies to improve the model's ability to deliver appropriate refusal responses. To evaluate the trustworthiness of MLLMs, we further propose a user-centric alignment goal along with corresponding metrics. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in refusal accuracy without noticeably compromising the model's helpfulness, establishing InBoL as a pivotal advancement in building more trustworthy MLLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11196v1,2024-12
Leveraging Large Language Models for Active Merchant Non-player Characters,"Byungjun Kim, Minju Kim, Dayeon Seo, Bugeun Kim","We highlight two significant issues leading to the passivity of current merchant non-player characters (NPCs): pricing and communication. While immersive interactions have been a focus, negotiations between merchant NPCs and players on item prices have not received sufficient attention. First, we define passive pricing as the limited ability of merchants to modify predefined item prices. Second, passive communication means that merchants can only interact with players in a scripted manner. To tackle these issues and create an active merchant NPC, we propose a merchant framework based on large language models (LLMs), called MART, which consists of an appraiser module and a negotiator module. We conducted two experiments to guide game developers in selecting appropriate implementations by comparing different training methods and LLM sizes. Our findings indicate that finetuning methods, such as supervised finetuning (SFT) and knowledge distillation (KD), are effective in using smaller LLMs to implement active merchant NPCs. Additionally, we found three irregular cases arising from the responses of LLMs. We expect our findings to guide developers in using LLMs for developing active merchant NPCs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11189v2,2024-12
Analyzing the Attention Heads for Pronoun Disambiguation in Context-aware Machine Translation Models,"Paweł Mąka, Yusuf Can Semerci, Jan Scholtes, Gerasimos Spanakis","In this paper, we investigate the role of attention heads in Context-aware Machine Translation models for pronoun disambiguation in the English-to-German and English-to-French language directions. We analyze their influence by both observing and modifying the attention scores corresponding to the plausible relations that could impact a pronoun prediction. Our findings reveal that while some heads do attend the relations of interest, not all of them influence the models' ability to disambiguate pronouns. We show that certain heads are underutilized by the models, suggesting that model performance could be improved if only the heads would attend one of the relations more strongly. Furthermore, we fine-tune the most promising heads and observe the increase in pronoun disambiguation accuracy of up to 5 percentage points which demonstrates that the improvements in performance can be solidified into the models' parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11187v1,2024-12
Transliterated Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Han Zhu, Gaofeng Cheng, Qingwei Zhao, Pengyuan Zhang","The performance of automatic speech recognition models often degenerates on domains not covered by the training data. Domain adaptation can address this issue, assuming the availability of the target domain data in the target language. However, such assumption does not stand in many real-world applications. To make domain adaptation more applicable, we address the problem of zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA), where target domain data is unavailable in the target language. Instead, we transfer the target domain knowledge from another source language where the target domain data is more accessible. To do that, we first perform cross-lingual pre-training (XLPT) to share domain knowledge across languages, then use target language fine-tuning to build the final model. One challenge in this practice is that the pre-trained knowledge can be forgotten during fine-tuning, resulting in sub-optimal adaptation performance. To address this issue, we propose transliterated ZSDA to achieve consistent pre-training and fine-tuning labels, leading to maximum preservation of the pre-trained knowledge. Experimental results show that transliterated ZSDA relatively decreases the word error rate by 9.2% compared with a wav2vec 2.0 baseline. Moreover, transliterated ZSDA consistently outperforms self-supervised ZSDA and performs on par with supervised ZSDA, proving the superiority of transliteration-based pre-training labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11185v1,2024-12
Unpacking the Resilience of SNLI Contradiction Examples to Attacks,"Chetan Verma, Archit Agarwal","Pre-trained models excel on NLI benchmarks like SNLI and MultiNLI, but their true language understanding remains uncertain. Models trained only on hypotheses and labels achieve high accuracy, indicating reliance on dataset biases and spurious correlations. To explore this issue, we applied the Universal Adversarial Attack to examine the model's vulnerabilities. Our analysis revealed substantial drops in accuracy for the entailment and neutral classes, whereas the contradiction class exhibited a smaller decline. Fine-tuning the model on an augmented dataset with adversarial examples restored its performance to near-baseline levels for both the standard and challenge sets. Our findings highlight the value of adversarial triggers in identifying spurious correlations and improving robustness while providing insights into the resilience of the contradiction class to adversarial attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11172v1,2024-12
Using Machine Learning to Distinguish Human-written from Machine-generated Creative Fiction,"Andrea Cristina McGlinchey, Peter J Barclay","Following the universal availability of generative AI systems with the release of ChatGPT, automatic detection of deceptive text created by Large Language Models has focused on domains such as academic plagiarism and ""fake news"". However, generative AI also poses a threat to the livelihood of creative writers, and perhaps to literary culture in general, through reduction in quality of published material. Training a Large Language Model on writers' output to generate ""sham books"" in a particular style seems to constitute a new form of plagiarism. This problem has been little researched. In this study, we trained Machine Learning classifier models to distinguish short samples of human-written from machine-generated creative fiction, focusing on classic detective novels. Our results show that a Naive Bayes and a Multi-Layer Perceptron classifier achieved a high degree of success (accuracy > 95%), significantly outperforming human judges (accuracy < 55%). This approach worked well with short text samples (around 100 words), which previous research has shown to be difficult to classify. We have deployed an online proof-of-concept classifier tool, AI Detective, as a first step towards developing lightweight and reliable applications for use by editors and publishers, with the aim of protecting the economic and cultural contribution of human authors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15253v1,2024-12
Cultural Palette: Pluralising Culture Alignment via Multi-agent Palette,"Jiahao Yuan, Zixiang Di, Shangzixin Zhao, Usman Naseem","Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in aligning with diverse cultural values despite their remarkable performance in generation, which stems from inherent monocultural biases and difficulties in capturing nuanced cultural semantics. Existing methods lack adaptability to unkown culture after finetuning. Inspired by cultural geography across five continents, we propose Cultural Palette, a multi-agent framework for cultural alignment. We first introduce the Pentachromatic Cultural Palette Dataset synthesized using LLMs to capture diverse cultural values from social dialogues across five continents. Building on this, Cultural Palette integrates five continent-level alignment agents with a meta-agent using our superior Cultural MoErges alignment technique by dynamically activating relevant cultural expertise based on user prompts to adapting new culture, which outperforms other joint and merging alignment strategies in overall cultural value alignment. Each continent agent generates a cultural draft, which is then refined and self-regulated by the meta-agent to produce the final culturally aligned response. Experiments across various countries demonstrate that Cultural Palette surpasses existing baselines in cultural alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11167v1,2024-12
GaLore$+$: Boosting Low-Rank Adaptation for LLMs with Cross-Head Projection,"Xutao Liao, Shaohui Li, Yuhui Xu, Zhi Li, Yu Liu, You He","Recent low-rank training methods, such as GaLore, have significantly reduced the memory required to optimize large language models (LLMs). However, these methods often suffer from time-consuming low-rank projection estimations. In particular, the singular value decomposition (SVD) in GaLore can consume more than 80\% of the total training time. To address this issue, we propose GaLore$+$, which uses cross-head low-rank projection to reduce the substantial time consumption in estimating low-rank projections for multi-head attention. In addition, we employ randomized subspace iteration to achieve fast SVD. To further enhance performance, we propose sparsely coded residuals to reduce the errors caused by low-rank approximation on the first- and second-order moments of the optimizers and weight updates. We evaluate GaLore$+$ on arithmetic reasoning and natural language generation datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that GaLore$+$ delivers superior performance while achieving approximately $4\times$ fine-tuning speed compared to vanilla GaLore.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19820v1,2024-12
SEE: Sememe Entanglement Encoding for Transformer-bases Models Compression,"Jing Zhang, Shuzhen Sun, Peng Zhang, Guangxing Cao, Hui Gao, Xindian Ma, Nan Xu, Yuexian Hou","Transformer-based large language models exhibit groundbreaking capabilities, but their storage and computational costs are prohibitively high, limiting their application in resource-constrained scenarios. An effective approach is to eliminate redundant model parameters and computational costs while incorporating efficient expert-derived knowledge structures to achieve a balance between compression and performance. Therefore, we propose the \textit{Sememe Entanglement Encoding (SEE)} algorithm. Guided by expert prior knowledge, the model is compressed through the low-rank approximation idea. In Entanglement Embedding, basic semantic units such as sememes are represented as low-dimensional vectors, and then reconstructed into high-dimensional word embeddings through the combination of generalized quantum entanglement. We adapt the Sememe Entanglement Encoding algorithm to transformer-based models of different magnitudes. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves stable performance while compressing model parameters and computational costs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12204v1,2024-12
The Superalignment of Superhuman Intelligence with Large Language Models,"Minlie Huang, Yingkang Wang, Shiyao Cui, Pei Ke, Jie Tang","We have witnessed superhuman intelligence thanks to the fast development of large language models and multimodal language models. As the application of such superhuman models becomes more and more popular, a critical question arises here: how can we ensure superhuman models are still safe, reliable and aligned well to human values? In this position paper, we discuss the concept of superalignment from the learning perspective to answer this question by outlining the learning paradigm shift from large-scale pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, to alignment training. We define superalignment as designing effective and efficient alignment algorithms to learn from noisy-labeled data (point-wise samples or pair-wise preference data) in a scalable way when the task becomes very complex for human experts to annotate and the model is stronger than human experts. We highlight some key research problems in superalignment, namely, weak-to-strong generalization, scalable oversight, and evaluation. We then present a conceptual framework for superalignment, which consists of three modules: an attacker which generates adversary queries trying to expose the weaknesses of a learner model; a learner which will refine itself by learning from scalable feedbacks generated by a critic model along with minimal human experts; and a critic which generates critics or explanations for a given query-response pair, with a target of improving the learner by criticizing. We discuss some important research problems in each component of this framework and highlight some interesting research ideas that are closely related to our proposed framework, for instance, self-alignment, self-play, self-refinement, and more. Last, we highlight some future research directions for superalignment, including identification of new emergent risks and multi-dimensional alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11145v2,2024-12
AD-LLM: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Anomaly Detection,"Tiankai Yang, Yi Nian, Shawn Li, Ruiyao Xu, Yuangang Li, Jiaqi Li, Zhuo Xiao, Xiyang Hu, Ryan Rossi, Kaize Ding, Xia Hu, Yue Zhao","Anomaly detection (AD) is an important machine learning task with many real-world uses, including fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and industrial monitoring. Within natural language processing (NLP), AD helps detect issues like spam, misinformation, and unusual user activity. Although large language models (LLMs) have had a strong impact on tasks such as text generation and summarization, their potential in AD has not been studied enough. This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11142v1,2024-12
Feature engineering vs. deep learning for paper section identification: Toward applications in Chinese medical literature,"Sijia Zhou, Xin Li","Section identification is an important task for library science, especially knowledge management. Identifying the sections of a paper would help filter noise in entity and relation extraction. In this research, we studied the paper section identification problem in the context of Chinese medical literature analysis, where the subjects, methods, and results are more valuable from a physician's perspective. Based on previous studies on English literature section identification, we experiment with the effective features to use with classic machine learning algorithms to tackle the problem. It is found that Conditional Random Fields, which consider sentence interdependency, is more effective in combining different feature sets, such as bag-of-words, part-of-speech, and headings, for Chinese literature section identification. Moreover, we find that classic machine learning algorithms are more effective than generic deep learning models for this problem. Based on these observations, we design a novel deep learning model, the Structural Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) model, which models word and sentence interdependency together with the contextual information. Experiments on a human-curated asthma literature dataset show that our approach outperforms the traditional machine learning methods and other deep learning methods and achieves close to 90% precision and recall in the task. The model shows good potential for use in other text mining tasks. The research has significant methodological and practical implications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11125v1,2024-12
Hanprome: Modified Hangeul for Expression of foreign language pronunciation,"Wonchan Kim, Michelle Meehyun Kim","Hangeul was created as a phonetic alphabet and is known to have the best 1:1 correspondence between letters and pronunciation among existing alphabets. In this paper, we examine the possibility of modifying the basic form of Hangeul and using it as a kind of phonetic symbol. The core concept of this approach is to preserve the basic form of the alphabet, modifying only the shape of a stroke rather than the letter itself. To the best of our knowledge, no previous attempts in any language have been made to express pronunciations of an alphabet different from the original simply by changing the shape of the alphabet strokes, and this paper is probably the first attempt in this direction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11090v2,2024-12
NER- RoBERTa: Fine-Tuning RoBERTa for Named Entity Recognition (NER) within low-resource languages,"Abdulhady Abas Abdullah, Srwa Hasan Abdulla, Dalia Mohammad Toufiq, Halgurd S. Maghdid, Tarik A. Rashid, Pakshan F. Farho, Shadan Sh. Sabr, Akar H. Taher, Darya S. Hamad, Hadi Veisi, Aras T. Asaad","Nowadays, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important tool for most people's daily life routines, ranging from understanding speech, translation, named entity recognition (NER), and text categorization, to generative text models such as ChatGPT. Due to the existence of big data and consequently large corpora for widely used languages like English, Spanish, Turkish, Persian, and many more, these applications have been developed accurately. However, the Kurdish language still requires more corpora and large datasets to be included in NLP applications. This is because Kurdish has a rich linguistic structure, varied dialects, and a limited dataset, which poses unique challenges for Kurdish NLP (KNLP) application development. While several studies have been conducted in KNLP for various applications, Kurdish NER (KNER) remains a challenge for many KNLP tasks, including text analysis and classification. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing a methodology for fine-tuning the pre-trained RoBERTa model for KNER. To this end, we first create a Kurdish corpus, followed by designing a modified model architecture and implementing the training procedures. To evaluate the trained model, a set of experiments is conducted to demonstrate the performance of the KNER model using different tokenization methods and trained models. The experimental results show that fine-tuned RoBERTa with the SentencePiece tokenization method substantially improves KNER performance, achieving a 12.8% improvement in F1-score compared to traditional models, and consequently establishes a new benchmark for KNLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15252v1,2024-12
LAW: Legal Agentic Workflows for Custody and Fund Services Contracts,"William Watson, Nicole Cho, Nishan Srishankar, Zhen Zeng, Lucas Cecchi, Daniel Scott, Suchetha Siddagangappa, Rachneet Kaur, Tucker Balch, Manuela Veloso","Legal contracts in the custody and fund services domain govern critical aspects such as key provider responsibilities, fee schedules, and indemnification rights. However, it is challenging for an off-the-shelf Large Language Model (LLM) to ingest these contracts due to the lengthy unstructured streams of text, limited LLM context windows, and complex legal jargon. To address these challenges, we introduce LAW (Legal Agentic Workflows for Custody and Fund Services Contracts). LAW features a modular design that responds to user queries by orchestrating a suite of domain-specific tools and text agents. Our experiments demonstrate that LAW, by integrating multiple specialized agents and tools, significantly outperforms the baseline. LAW excels particularly in complex tasks such as calculating a contract's termination date, surpassing the baseline by 92.9% points. Furthermore, LAW offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional fine-tuned legal LLMs by leveraging reusable, domain-specific tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11063v1,2024-12
NITRO: LLM Inference on Intel Laptop NPUs,"Anthony Fei, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential tools in natural language processing, finding large usage in chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini, and are a central area of research. A particular area of interest includes designing hardware specialized for these AI applications, with one such example being the neural processing unit (NPU). In 2023, Intel released the Intel Core Ultra processor with codename Meteor Lake, featuring a CPU, GPU, and NPU system-on-chip. However, official software support for the NPU through Intel's OpenVINO framework is limited to static model inference. The dynamic nature of autoregressive token generation in LLMs is therefore not supported out of the box. To address this shortcoming, we present NITRO (NPU Inference for Transformers Optimization), a Python-based framework built on top of OpenVINO to support text and chat generation on NPUs. In this paper, we discuss in detail the key modifications made to the transformer architecture to enable inference, some performance benchmarks, and future steps towards improving the package.

AgentPS: Agentic Process Supervision for Multi-modal Content Quality Assurance through Multi-round QA,"Gorden Liu, Yu Sun, Ruixiao Sun, Xin Dong, Hongyu Xiong","The advanced processing and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven substantial progress in vision-language (VL) understanding tasks. However, while effective for tasks governed by straightforward logic, MLLMs often encounter challenges when reasoning over complex, interdependent logic structures. To address this limitation, we introduce \textit{AgentPS}, a novel framework that integrates Agentic Process Supervision into MLLMs via multi-round question answering during fine-tuning. \textit{AgentPS} demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline MLLMs on proprietary TikTok datasets, due to its integration of process supervision and structured sequential reasoning. Furthermore, we show that replacing human-annotated labels with LLM-generated labels retains much of the performance gain, highlighting the framework's practical scalability in industrial applications. These results position \textit{AgentPS} as a highly effective and efficient architecture for multimodal classification tasks. Its adaptability and scalability, especially when enhanced by automated annotation generation, make it a powerful tool for handling large-scale, real-world challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15251v1,2024-12
Separate the Wheat from the Chaff: A Post-Hoc Approach to Safety Re-Alignment for Fine-Tuned Language Models,"Di Wu, Xin Lu, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin","Although large language models (LLMs) achieve effective safety alignment at the time of release, they still face various safety challenges. A key issue is that fine-tuning often compromises the safety alignment of LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a method named \textbf{IRR} (\textbf{I}dentify, \textbf{R}emove, and \textbf{R}ecalibrate for Safety Realignment) that performs safety realignment for LLMs. The core of IRR is to identify and remove unsafe delta parameters from the fine-tuned models, while recalibrating the retained ones. We evaluate the effectiveness of IRR across various datasets, including both full fine-tuning and LoRA methods. Our results demonstrate that IRR significantly enhances the safety performance of fine-tuned models on safety benchmarks, such as harmful queries and jailbreak attacks, while maintaining their performance on downstream tasks.

An Enhanced Text Compression Approach Using Transformer-based Language Models,"Chowdhury Mofizur Rahman, Mahbub E Sobhani, Anika Tasnim Rodela, Swakkhar Shatabda","Text compression shrinks textual data while keeping crucial information, eradicating constraints on storage, bandwidth, and computational efficacy. The integration of lossless compression techniques with transformer-based text decompression has received negligible attention, despite the increasing volume of English text data in communication. The primary barrier in advancing text compression and restoration involves optimizing transformer-based approaches with efficient pre-processing and integrating lossless compression algorithms, that remained unresolved in the prior attempts. Here, we propose a transformer-based method named RejuvenateForme for text decompression, addressing prior issues by harnessing a new pre-processing technique and a lossless compression method. Our meticulous pre-processing technique incorporating the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm achieves compression ratios of 12.57, 13.38, and 11.42 on the BookCorpus, EN-DE, and EN-FR corpora, thus showing state-of-the-art compression ratios compared to other deep learning and traditional approaches. Furthermore, the RejuvenateForme achieves a BLEU score of 27.31, 25.78, and 50.45 on the EN-DE, EN-FR, and BookCorpus corpora, showcasing its comprehensive efficacy. In contrast, the pre-trained T5-Small exhibits better performance over prior state-of-the-art models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15250v1,2024-12
A Contextualized BERT model for Knowledge Graph Completion,"Haji Gul, Abdul Ghani Naim, Ajaz A. Bhat","Knowledge graphs (KGs) are valuable for representing structured, interconnected information across domains, enabling tasks like semantic search, recommendation systems and inference. A pertinent challenge with KGs, however, is that many entities (i.e., heads, tails) or relationships are unknown. Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) addresses this by predicting these missing nodes or links, enhancing the graph's informational depth and utility. Traditional methods like TransE and ComplEx predict tail entities but struggle with unseen entities. Textual-based models leverage additional semantics but come with high computational costs, semantic inconsistencies, and data imbalance issues. Recent LLM-based models show improvement but overlook contextual information and rely heavily on entity descriptions. In this study, we introduce a contextualized BERT model for KGC that overcomes these limitations by utilizing the contextual information from neighbouring entities and relationships to predict tail entities. Our model eliminates the need for entity descriptions and negative triplet sampling, reducing computational demands while improving performance. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets, improving Hit@1 by 5.3% and 4.88% on FB15k-237 and WN18RR respectively, setting a new benchmark in KGC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11016v1,2024-12
Dual Traits in Probabilistic Reasoning of Large Language Models,"Shenxiong Li, Huaxia Rui","We conducted three experiments to investigate how large language models (LLMs) evaluate posterior probabilities. Our results reveal the coexistence of two modes in posterior judgment among state-of-the-art models: a normative mode, which adheres to Bayes' rule, and a representative-based mode, which relies on similarity -- paralleling human System 1 and System 2 thinking. Additionally, we observed that LLMs struggle to recall base rate information from their memory, and developing prompt engineering strategies to mitigate representative-based judgment may be challenging. We further conjecture that the dual modes of judgment may be a result of the contrastive loss function employed in reinforcement learning from human feedback. Our findings underscore the potential direction for reducing cognitive biases in LLMs and the necessity for cautious deployment of LLMs in critical areas.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11009v1,2024-12
LLMs for Literature Review: Are we there yet?,"Shubham Agarwal, Gaurav Sahu, Abhay Puri, Issam H. Laradji, Krishnamurthy DJ Dvijotham, Jason Stanley, Laurent Charlin, Christopher Pal","Literature reviews are an essential component of scientific research, but they remain time-intensive and challenging to write, especially due to the recent influx of research papers. This paper explores the zero-shot abilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in assisting with the writing of literature reviews based on an abstract. We decompose the task into two components: 1. Retrieving related works given a query abstract, and 2. Writing a literature review based on the retrieved results. We analyze how effective LLMs are for both components. For retrieval, we introduce a novel two-step search strategy that first uses an LLM to extract meaningful keywords from the abstract of a paper and then retrieves potentially relevant papers by querying an external knowledge base. Additionally, we study a prompting-based re-ranking mechanism with attribution and show that re-ranking doubles the normalized recall compared to naive search methods, while providing insights into the LLM's decision-making process. In the generation phase, we propose a two-step approach that first outlines a plan for the review and then executes steps in the plan to generate the actual review. To evaluate different LLM-based literature review methods, we create test sets from arXiv papers using a protocol designed for rolling use with newly released LLMs to avoid test set contamination in zero-shot evaluations. We release this evaluation protocol to promote additional research and development in this regard. Our empirical results suggest that LLMs show promising potential for writing literature reviews when the task is decomposed into smaller components of retrieval and planning. Further, we demonstrate that our planning-based approach achieves higher-quality reviews by minimizing hallucinated references in the generated review by 18-26% compared to existing simpler LLM-based generation methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15249v1,2024-12
Entropy-Regularized Process Reward Model,"Hanning Zhang, Pengcheng Wang, Shizhe Diao, Yong Lin, Rui Pan, Hanze Dong, Dylan Zhang, Pavlo Molchanov, Tong Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in performing complex multi-step reasoning, yet they continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, often making systematic errors. A promising solution is reinforcement learning (RL) guided by reward models, particularly those focusing on process rewards, which score each intermediate step rather than solely evaluating the final outcome. This approach is more effective at guiding policy models towards correct reasoning trajectories. In this work, we propose an entropy-regularized process reward model (ER-PRM) that integrates KL-regularized Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to balance policy optimization with the need to prevent the policy from shifting too far from its initial distribution. We derive a novel reward construction method based on the theoretical results. Our theoretical analysis shows that we could derive the optimal reward model from the initial policy sampling. Our empirical experiments on the MATH and GSM8K benchmarks demonstrate that ER-PRM consistently outperforms existing process reward models, achieving 1% improvement on GSM8K and 2-3% improvement on MATH under best-of-N evaluation, and more than 1% improvement under RLHF. These results highlight the efficacy of entropy-regularization in enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11006v1,2024-12

For underrepresented dialects like Levantine Arabic, detecting hate speech presents unique cultural, ethical, and linguistic challenges. This paper explores the complex sociopolitical and linguistic landscape of Levantine Arabic and critically examines the limitations of current datasets used in hate speech detection. We highlight the scarcity of publicly available, diverse datasets and analyze the consequences of dialectal bias within existing resources. By emphasizing the need for culturally and contextually informed natural language processing (NLP) tools, we advocate for a more nuanced and inclusive approach to hate speech detection in the Arab world.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10991v1,2024-12
Can LLMs Help Create Grammar?: Automating Grammar Creation for Endangered Languages with In-Context Learning,"Piyapath T Spencer, Nanthipat Kongborrirak","Yes! In the present-day documenting and preserving endangered languages, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a promising approach. This paper explores how LLMs, particularly through in-context learning, can assist in generating grammatical information for low-resource languages with limited amount of data. We takes Moklen as a case study to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in producing coherent grammatical rules and lexical entries using only bilingual dictionaries and parallel sentences of the unknown language without building the model from scratch. Our methodology involves organising the existing linguistic data and prompting to efficiently enable to generate formal XLE grammar. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can successfully capture key grammatical structures and lexical information, although challenges such as the potential for English grammatical biases remain. This study highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance language documentation efforts, providing a cost-effective solution for generating linguistic data and contributing to the preservation of endangered languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10960v1,2024-12
RoundTripOCR: A Data Generation Technique for Enhancing Post-OCR Error Correction in Low-Resource Devanagari Languages,"Harshvivek Kashid, Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has revolutionized the digitization of printed text, enabling efficient data extraction and analysis across various domains.

We propose an approach for synthetic data generation for Devanagari languages, RoundTripOCR, that tackles the scarcity of the post-OCR Error Correction datasets for low-resource languages. We release post-OCR text correction datasets for Hindi, Marathi, Bodo, Nepali, Konkani and Sanskrit. We also present a novel approach for OCR error correction by leveraging techniques from machine translation. Our method involves translating erroneous OCR output into a corrected form by treating the OCR errors as mistranslations in a parallel text corpus, employing pre-trained transformer models to learn the mapping from erroneous to correct text pairs, effectively correcting OCR errors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15248v1,2024-12
Human-Centric NLP or AI-Centric Illusion?: A Critical Investigation,Piyapath T Spencer,"Human-Centric NLP often claims to prioritise human needs and values, yet many implementations reveal an underlying AI-centric focus. Through an analysis of case studies in language modelling, behavioural testing, and multi-modal alignment, this study identifies a significant gap between the ideas of human-centricity and actual practices. Key issues include misalignment with human-centred design principles, the reduction of human factors to mere benchmarks, and insufficient consideration of real-world impacts. The discussion explores whether Human-Centric NLP embodies true human-centred design, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and ethical considerations. The paper advocates for a redefinition of Human-Centric NLP, urging a broader focus on real-world utility and societal implications to ensure that language technologies genuinely serve and empower users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10939v1,2024-12
Enhancing Discoverability in Enterprise Conversational Systems with Proactive Question Suggestions,"Xiaobin Shen, Daniel Lee, Sumit Ranjan, Sai Sree Harsha, Pawan Sevak, Yunyao Li","Enterprise conversational AI systems are becoming increasingly popular to assist users in completing daily tasks such as those in marketing and customer management. However, new users often struggle to ask effective questions, especially in emerging systems with unfamiliar or evolving capabilities. This paper proposes a framework to enhance question suggestions in conversational enterprise AI systems by generating proactive, context-aware questions that try to address immediate user needs while improving feature discoverability. Our approach combines periodic user intent analysis at the population level with chat session-based question generation. We evaluate the framework using real-world data from the AI Assistant for Adobe Experience Platform (AEP), demonstrating the improved usefulness and system discoverability of the AI Assistant.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10933v1,2024-12
"Tokens, the oft-overlooked appetizer: Large language models, the distributional hypothesis, and meaning","Julia Witte Zimmerman, Denis Hudon, Kathryn Cramer, Alejandro J. Ruiz, Calla Beauregard, Ashley Fehr, Mikaela Irene Fudolig, Bradford Demarest, Yoshi Meke Bird, Milo Z. Trujillo, Christopher M. Danforth, Peter Sheridan Dodds","Tokenization is a necessary component within the current architecture of many language models, including the transformer-based large language models (LLMs) of Generative AI, yet its impact on the model's cognition is often overlooked. We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens motivates linguistically-informed interventions in existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokenization pretraining can be a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10924v3,2024-12
LLMs-in-the-Loop Part 2: Expert Small AI Models for Anonymization and De-identification of PHI Across Multiple Languages,"Murat Gunay, Bunyamin Keles, Raife Hizlan","The rise of chronic diseases and pandemics like COVID-19 has emphasized the need for effective patient data processing while ensuring privacy through anonymization and de-identification of protected health information (PHI). Anonymized data facilitates research without compromising patient confidentiality. This paper introduces expert small AI models developed using the LLM-in-the-loop methodology to meet the demand for domain-specific de-identification NER models. These models overcome the privacy risks associated with large language models (LLMs) used via APIs by eliminating the need to transmit or store sensitive data. More importantly, they consistently outperform LLMs in de-identification tasks, offering superior performance and reliability. Our de-identification NER models, developed in eight languages (English, German, Italian, French, Romanian, Turkish, Spanish, and Arabic) achieved f1-micro score averages of 0.966, 0.975, 0.976, 0.970, 0.964, 0.974, 0.978, and 0.953 respectively. These results establish them as the most accurate healthcare anonymization solutions, surpassing existing small models and even general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4o. While Part-1 of this series introduced the LLM-in-the-loop methodology for bio-medical document translation, this second paper showcases its success in developing cost-effective expert small NER models in de-identification tasks. Our findings lay the groundwork for future healthcare AI innovations, including biomedical entity and relation extraction, demonstrating the value of specialized models for domain-specific challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10918v1,2024-12
Quantifying Extreme Opinions on Reddit Amidst the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,"Alessio Guerra, Marcello Lepre, Oktay Karakus","This study investigates the dynamics of extreme opinions on social media during the 2023 Israeli-Palestinian conflict, utilising a comprehensive dataset of over 450,000 posts from four Reddit subreddits (r/Palestine, r/Judaism, r/IsraelPalestine, and r/worldnews). A lexicon-based, unsupervised methodology was developed to measure ""extreme opinions"" by considering factors such as anger, polarity, and subjectivity. The analysis identifies significant peaks in extremism scores that correspond to pivotal real-life events, such as the IDF's bombings of Al Quds Hospital and the Jabalia Refugee Camp, and the end of a ceasefire following a terrorist attack. Additionally, this study explores the distribution and correlation of these scores across different subreddits and over time, providing insights into the propagation of polarised sentiments in response to conflict events. By examining the quantitative effects of each score on extremism and analysing word cloud similarities through Jaccard indices, the research offers a nuanced understanding of the factors driving extreme online opinions. This approach underscores the potential of social media analytics in capturing the complex interplay between real-world events and online discourse, while also highlighting the limitations and challenges of measuring extremism in social media contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10913v1,2024-12
SusGen-GPT: A Data-Centric LLM for Financial NLP and Sustainability Report Generation,"Qilong Wu, Xiaoneng Xiang, Hejia Huang, Xuan Wang, Yeo Wei Jie, Ranjan Satapathy, Ricardo Shirota Filho, Bharadwaj Veeravalli","The rapid growth of the financial sector and the rising focus on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations highlight the need for advanced NLP tools. However, open-source LLMs proficient in both finance and ESG domains remain scarce. To address this gap, we introduce SusGen-30K, a category-balanced dataset comprising seven financial NLP tasks and ESG report generation, and propose TCFD-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating sustainability report generation. Leveraging this dataset, we developed SusGen-GPT, a suite of models achieving state-of-the-art performance across six adapted and two off-the-shelf tasks, trailing GPT-4 by only 2% despite using 7-8B parameters compared to GPT-4's 1,700B. Based on this, we propose the SusGen system, integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to assist in sustainability report generation.

Streamlining Systematic Reviews: A Novel Application of Large Language Models,"Fouad Trad, Ryan Yammine, Jana Charafeddine, Marlene Chakhtoura, Maya Rahme, Ghada El-Hajj Fuleihan, Ali Chehab","Systematic reviews (SRs) are essential for evidence-based guidelines but are often limited by the time-consuming nature of literature screening. We propose and evaluate an in-house system based on Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating both title/abstract and full-text screening, addressing a critical gap in the literature. Using a completed SR on Vitamin D and falls (14,439 articles), the LLM-based system employed prompt engineering for title/abstract screening and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for full-text screening. The system achieved an article exclusion rate (AER) of 99.5%, specificity of 99.6%, a false negative rate (FNR) of 0%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. After screening, only 78 articles required manual review, including all 20 identified by traditional methods, reducing manual screening time by 95.5%. For comparison, Rayyan, a commercial tool for title/abstract screening, achieved an AER of 72.1% and FNR of 5% when including articles Rayyan considered as undecided or likely to include. Lowering Rayyan's inclusion thresholds improved FNR to 0% but increased screening time. By addressing both screening phases, the LLM-based system significantly outperformed Rayyan and traditional methods, reducing total screening time to 25.5 hours while maintaining high accuracy. These findings highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in SR workflows by offering a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution, particularly for the full-text screening phase, which has lacked automation tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15247v1,2024-12

Leveraging Gemma-2's multilingual capabilities and over 100 billion tokens of Bulgarian and English text data, our models demonstrate strong performance in Bulgarian language tasks, setting a new standard for language-specific AI models. Our approach maintains the robust capabilities of the original Gemma-2 models, ensuring that the English language performance remains intact.

We provide detailed insights into our methodology, including the release of model weights with a commercial-friendly license, enabling broader adoption by researchers, companies, and hobbyists. Further, we establish a comprehensive set of benchmarks based on non-public educational data sources to evaluate models on Bulgarian language tasks as well as safety and chat capabilities.

A Novel End-To-End Event Geolocation Method Leveraging Hyperbolic Space and Toponym Hierarchies,"Yaqiong Qiao, Guojun Huang","Timely detection and geolocation of events based on social data can provide critical information for applications such as crisis response and resource allocation. However, most existing methods are greatly affected by event detection errors, leading to insufficient geolocation accuracy. To this end, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end event geolocation method (GTOP) leveraging Hyperbolic space and toponym hierarchies. Specifically, the proposed method contains one event detection module and one geolocation module. The event detection module constructs a heterogeneous information networks based on social data, and then constructs a homogeneous message graph and combines it with the text and time feature of the message to learning initial features of nodes. Node features are updated in Hyperbolic space and then fed into a classifier for event detection. To reduce the geolocation error, this paper proposes a noise toponym filtering algorithm (HIST) based on the hierarchical structure of toponyms. HIST analyzes the hierarchical structure of toponyms mentioned in the event cluster, taking the highly frequent city-level locations as the coarse-grained locations for events. By comparing the hierarchical structure of the toponyms within the cluster against those of the coarse-grained locations of events, HIST filters out noisy toponyms. To further improve the geolocation accuracy, we propose a fine-grained pseudo toponyms generation algorithm (FIT) based on the output of HIST, and combine generated pseudo toponyms with filtered toponyms to locate events based on the geographic center points of the combined toponyms. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Chinese dataset constructed in this paper and another public English dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10870v1,2024-12
CRENER: A Character Relation Enhanced Chinese NER Model,"Yaqiong Qiao, Shixuan Peng","Chinese Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task in information extraction, which has a significant impact on downstream applications. Due to the lack of natural separators in Chinese, previous NER methods mostly relied on external dictionaries to enrich the semantic and boundary information of Chinese words. However, such methods may introduce noise that affects the accuracy of named entity recognition. To this end, we propose a character relation enhanced Chinese NER model (CRENER). This model defines four types of tags that reflect the relationships between characters, and proposes a fine-grained modeling of the relationships between characters based on three types of relationships: adjacency relations between characters, relations between characters and tags, and relations between tags, to more accurately identify entity boundaries and improve Chinese NER accuracy. Specifically, we transform the Chinese NER task into a character-character relationship classification task, ensuring the accuracy of entity boundary recognition through joint modeling of relation tags. To enhance the model's ability to understand contextual information, WRENER further constructed an adapted transformer encoder that combines unscaled direction-aware and distance-aware masked self-attention mechanisms. Moreover, a relationship representation enhancement module was constructed to model predefined relationship tags, effectively mining the relationship representations between characters and tags. Experiments conducted on four well-known Chinese NER benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The ablation experiment also demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10858v1,2024-12
Superhuman performance of a large language model on the reasoning tasks of a physician,"Peter G. Brodeur, Thomas A. Buckley, Zahir Kanjee, Ethan Goh, Evelyn Bin Ling, Priyank Jain, Stephanie Cabral, Raja-Elie Abdulnour, Adrian Haimovich, Jason A. Freed, Andrew Olson, Daniel J. Morgan, Jason Hom, Robert Gallo, Eric Horvitz, Jonathan Chen, Arjun K. Manrai, Adam Rodman","Performance of large language models (LLMs) on medical tasks has traditionally been evaluated using multiple choice question benchmarks. However, such benchmarks are highly constrained, saturated with repeated impressive performance by LLMs, and have an unclear relationship to performance in real clinical scenarios. Clinical reasoning, the process by which physicians employ critical thinking to gather and synthesize clinical data to diagnose and manage medical problems, remains an attractive benchmark for model performance. Prior LLMs have shown promise in outperforming clinicians in routine and complex diagnostic scenarios. We sought to evaluate OpenAI's o1-preview model, a model developed to increase run-time via chain of thought processes prior to generating a response. We characterize the performance of o1-preview with five experiments including differential diagnosis generation, display of diagnostic reasoning, triage differential diagnosis, probabilistic reasoning, and management reasoning, adjudicated by physician experts with validated psychometrics. Our primary outcome was comparison of the o1-preview output to identical prior experiments that have historical human controls and benchmarks of previous LLMs. Significant improvements were observed with differential diagnosis generation and quality of diagnostic and management reasoning. No improvements were observed with probabilistic reasoning or triage differential diagnosis. This study highlights o1-preview's ability to perform strongly on tasks that require complex critical thinking such as diagnosis and management while its performance on probabilistic reasoning tasks was similar to past models. New robust benchmarks and scalable evaluation of LLM capabilities compared to human physicians are needed along with trials evaluating AI in real clinical settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10849v1,2024-12
Large Language Models for Medical Forecasting -- Foresight 2,"Zeljko Kraljevic, Joshua Au Yeung, Daniel Bean, James Teo, Richard J. Dobson","Foresight 2 (FS2) is a large language model fine-tuned on hospital data for modelling patient timelines (GitHub 'removed for anon'). It can understand patients' clinical notes and predict SNOMED codes for a wide range of biomedical use cases, including diagnosis suggestions, risk forecasting, and procedure and medication recommendations. FS2 is trained on the free text portion of the MIMIC-III dataset, firstly through extracting biomedical concepts and then creating contextualised patient timelines, upon which the model is then fine-tuned. The results show significant improvement over the previous state-of-the-art for the next new biomedical concept prediction (P/R - 0.73/0.66 vs 0.52/0.32) and a similar improvement specifically for the next new disorder prediction (P/R - 0.69/0.62 vs 0.46/0.25). Finally, on the task of risk forecast, we compare our model to GPT-4-turbo (and a range of open-source biomedical LLMs) and show that FS2 performs significantly better on such tasks (P@5 - 0.90 vs 0.65). This highlights the need to incorporate hospital data into LLMs and shows that small models outperform much larger ones when fine-tuned on high-quality, specialised data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10848v1,2024-12
Rethinking Chain-of-Thought from the Perspective of Self-Training,"Zongqian Wu, Baoduo Xu, Ruochen Cui, Mengmeng Zhan, Xiaofeng Zhu, Lei Feng","Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as an effective approach for activating latent capabilities in large language models (LLMs). We observe that CoT shares significant similarities with self-training in terms of their learning processes. Motivated by these parallels, this paper explores the underlying relationship between CoT and self-training, demonstrating how insights from self-training can enhance CoT performance. Specifically, our study first reveals that CoT, like self-training, follows the principle of semantic entropy minimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel CoT framework that incorporates two key components: (i) a task-specific prompt module designed to guide LLMs in generating high-quality initial reasoning processes, and (ii) an adaptive reasoning iteration module for progressively refining the reasoning process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10827v1,2024-12
FinGPT: Enhancing Sentiment-Based Stock Movement Prediction with Dissemination-Aware and Context-Enriched LLMs,"Yixuan Liang, Yuncong Liu, Boyu Zhang, Christina Dan Wang, Hongyang Yang","Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding the influence of news on stock prices. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted for this purpose due to their advanced text analysis capabilities. However, these models often only consider the news content itself, ignoring its dissemination, which hampers accurate prediction of short-term stock movements. Additionally, current methods often lack sufficient contextual data and explicit instructions in their prompts, limiting LLMs' ability to interpret news. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach that enhances LLM-powered sentiment-based stock movement predictions by incorporating news dissemination breadth, contextual data, and explicit instructions. We cluster recent company-related news to assess its reach and influence, enriching prompts with more specific data and precise instructions. This data is used to construct an instruction tuning dataset to fine-tune an LLM for predicting short-term stock price movements. Our experimental results show that our approach improves prediction accuracy by 8\% compared to existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10823v1,2024-12
Are Language Models Agnostic to Linguistically Grounded Perturbations? A Case Study of Indic Languages,"Poulami Ghosh, Raj Dabre, Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are known to be susceptible to perturbations to the input text, but existing works do not explicitly focus on linguistically grounded attacks, which are subtle and more prevalent in nature. In this paper, we study whether PLMs are agnostic to linguistically grounded attacks or not. To this end, we offer the first study addressing this, investigating different Indic languages and various downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that although PLMs are susceptible to linguistic perturbations, when compared to non-linguistic attacks, PLMs exhibit a slightly lower susceptibility to linguistic attacks. This highlights that even constrained attacks are effective. Moreover, we investigate the implications of these outcomes across a range of languages, encompassing diverse language families and different scripts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10805v1,2024-12
WEPO: Web Element Preference Optimization for LLM-based Web Navigation,"Jiarun Liu, Jia Hao, Chunhong Zhang, Zheng Hu","The rapid advancement of autonomous web navigation has significantly benefited from grounding pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents. However, current research has yet to fully leverage the redundancy of HTML elements for contrastive training. This paper introduces a novel approach to LLM-based web navigation tasks, called Web Element Preference Optimization (WEPO). WEPO utilizes unsupervised preference learning by sampling distance-based non-salient web elements as negative samples, optimizing maximum likelihood objective within Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We evaluate WEPO on the Mind2Web benchmark and empirically demonstrate that WEPO aligns user high-level intent with output actions more effectively. The results show that our method achieved the state-of-the-art, with an improvement of 13.8% over WebAgent and 5.3% over the visual language model CogAgent baseline.

"Towards Effective, Efficient and Unsupervised Social Event Detection in the Hyperbolic Space","Xiaoyan Yu, Yifan Wei, Shuaishuai Zhou, Zhiwei Yang, Li Sun, Hao Peng, Liehuang Zhu, Philip S. Yu","The vast, complex, and dynamic nature of social message data has posed challenges to social event detection (SED). Despite considerable effort, these challenges persist, often resulting in inadequately expressive message representations (ineffective) and prolonged learning durations (inefficient). In response to the challenges, this work introduces an unsupervised framework, HyperSED (Hyperbolic SED). Specifically, the proposed framework first models social messages into semantic-based message anchors, and then leverages the structure of the anchor graph and the expressiveness of the hyperbolic space to acquire structure- and geometry-aware anchor representations. Finally, HyperSED builds the partitioning tree of the anchor message graph by incorporating differentiable structural information as the reflection of the detected events. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate HyperSED's competitive performance, along with a substantial improvement in efficiency compared to the current state-of-the-art unsupervised paradigm. Statistically, HyperSED boosts incremental SED by an average of 2%, 2%, and 25% in NMI, AMI, and ARI, respectively; enhancing efficiency by up to 37.41 times and at least 12.10 times, illustrating the advancement of the proposed framework.

Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Derrick Quinn, Mohammad Nouri, Neel Patel, John Salihu, Alireza Salemi, Sukhan Lee, Hamed Zamani, Mohammad Alian","An evolving solution to address hallucination and enhance accuracy in large language models (LLMs) is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which involves augmenting LLMs with information retrieved from an external knowledge source, such as the web. This paper profiles several RAG execution pipelines and demystifies the complex interplay between their retrieval and generation phases. We demonstrate that while exact retrieval schemes are expensive, they can reduce inference time compared to approximate retrieval variants because an exact retrieval model can send a smaller but more accurate list of documents to the generative model while maintaining the same end-to-end accuracy. This observation motivates the acceleration of the exact nearest neighbor search for RAG.   In this work, we design Intelligent Knowledge Store (IKS), a type-2 CXL device that implements a scale-out near-memory acceleration architecture with a novel cache-coherent interface between the host CPU and near-memory accelerators. IKS offers 13.4-27.9x faster exact nearest neighbor search over a 512GB vector database compared with executing the search on Intel Sapphire Rapids CPUs. This higher search performance translates to 1.7-26.3x lower end-to-end inference time for representative RAG applications. IKS is inherently a memory expander; its internal DRAM can be disaggregated and used for other applications running on the server to prevent DRAM, which is the most expensive component in today's servers, from being stranded.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15246v1,2024-12
Efficient Adaptation of Multilingual Models for Japanese ASR,"Mark Bajo, Haruka Fukukawa, Ryuji Morita, Yuma Ogasawara","This study explores fine-tuning multilingual ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models, specifically OpenAI's Whisper-Tiny, to improve performance in Japanese. While multilingual models like Whisper offer versatility, they often lack precision in specific languages. Conversely, monolingual models like ReazonSpeech excel in language-specific tasks but are less adaptable. Using Japanese-specific datasets and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) along with end-to-end (E2E) training, we fine-tuned Whisper-Tiny to bridge this gap. Our results show that fine-tuning reduced Whisper-Tiny's Character Error Rate (CER) from 32.7 to 20.8 with LoRA and to 14.7 with end-to-end fine-tuning, surpassing Whisper-Base's CER of 20.2. However, challenges with domain-specific terms remain, highlighting the need for specialized datasets. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuning multilingual models can achieve strong language-specific performance while retaining their flexibility. This approach provides a scalable solution for improving ASR in resource-constrained environments and languages with complex writing systems like Japanese.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10705v1,2024-12
VisDoM: Multi-Document QA with Visually Rich Elements Using Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Manan Suri, Puneet Mathur, Franck Dernoncourt, Kanika Goswami, Ryan A. Rossi, Dinesh Manocha","Understanding information from a collection of multiple documents, particularly those with visually rich elements, is important for document-grounded question answering. This paper introduces VisDoMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate QA systems in multi-document settings with rich multimodal content, including tables, charts, and presentation slides. We propose VisDoMRAG, a novel multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that simultaneously utilizes visual and textual RAG, combining robust visual retrieval capabilities with sophisticated linguistic reasoning. VisDoMRAG employs a multi-step reasoning process encompassing evidence curation and chain-of-thought reasoning for concurrent textual and visual RAG pipelines. A key novelty of VisDoMRAG is its consistency-constrained modality fusion mechanism, which aligns the reasoning processes across modalities at inference time to produce a coherent final answer. This leads to enhanced accuracy in scenarios where critical information is distributed across modalities and improved answer verifiability through implicit context attribution. Through extensive experiments involving open-source and proprietary large language models, we benchmark state-of-the-art document QA methods on VisDoMBench. Extensive results show that VisDoMRAG outperforms unimodal and long-context LLM baselines for end-to-end multimodal document QA by 12-20%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10704v1,2024-12

We utilize this dataset to fine-tune the lightweight open-source model Llama-3-8B-Instruct, optimizing resource efficiency while maintaining high performance. Our experimental results reveal that the model trained on extensive LLM-generated datasets surpasses that trained on smaller human-annotated datasets when evaluated using human-generated test sets.

Inference Scaling for Bridging Retrieval and Augmented Generation,"Youngwon Lee, Seung-won Hwang, Daniel Campos, Filip Graliński, Zhewei Yao, Yuxiong He","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular approach to steering the output of a large language model (LLM) by incorporating retrieved contexts as inputs. However, existing work observed the generator bias, such that improving the retrieval results may negatively affect the outcome. In this work, we show such bias can be mitigated, from inference scaling, aggregating inference calls from the permuted order of retrieved contexts. The proposed Mixture-of-Intervention (MOI) explicitly models the debiased utility of each passage with multiple forward passes to construct a new ranking. We also show that MOI can leverage the retriever's prior knowledge to reduce the computational cost by minimizing the number of permutations considered and lowering the cost per LLM call. We showcase the effectiveness of MOI on diverse RAG tasks, improving ROUGE-L on MS MARCO and EM on HotpotQA benchmarks by ~7 points.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10684v1,2024-12
"Chasing Progress, Not Perfection: Revisiting Strategies for End-to-End LLM Plan Generation","Sukai Huang, Trevor Cohn, Nir Lipovetzky","The capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to plan remains a topic of debate. Some critics argue that strategies to boost LLMs' reasoning skills are ineffective in planning tasks, while others report strong outcomes merely from training models on a planning corpus. This study reassesses recent strategies by developing an end-to-end LLM planner and employing diverse metrics for a thorough evaluation. We find that merely fine-tuning LLMs on a corpus of planning instances does not lead to robust planning skills, as indicated by poor performance on out-of-distribution test sets. At the same time, we find that various strategies, including Chain-of-Thought, do enhance the probability of a plan being executable. This indicates progress towards better plan quality, despite not directly enhancing the final validity rate. Among the strategies we evaluated, reinforcement learning with our novel `Longest Contiguous Common Subsequence' reward emerged as the most effective, contributing to both plan validity and executability. Overall, our research addresses key misconceptions in the LLM-planning literature; we validate incremental progress in plan executability, although plan validity remains a challenge. Hence, future strategies should focus on both these aspects, drawing insights from our findings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10675v1,2024-12
Thinking with Knowledge Graphs: Enhancing LLM Reasoning Through Structured Data,"Xue Wu, Kostas Tsioutsiouliklis","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, they often struggle with complex reasoning tasks and are prone to hallucination. Recent research has shown promising results in leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance LLM performance. KGs provide a structured representation of entities and their relationships, offering a rich source of information that can enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. For this work, we have developed different techniques that tightly integrate KG structures and semantics into LLM representations. Our results show that we are able to significantly improve the performance of LLMs in complex reasoning scenarios, and ground the reasoning process with KGs. We are the first to represent KGs with programming language and fine-tune pretrained LLMs with KGs.

BinarySelect to Improve Accessibility of Black-Box Attack Research,"Shatarupa Ghosh, Jonathan Rusert","Adversarial text attack research is useful for testing the robustness of NLP models, however, the rise of transformers has greatly increased the time required to test attacks. Especially when researchers do not have access to adequate resources (e.g. GPUs). This can hinder attack research, as modifying one example for an attack can require hundreds of queries to a model, especially for black-box attacks. Often these attacks remove one token at a time to find the ideal one to change, requiring $n$ queries (the length of the text) right away. We propose a more efficient selection method called BinarySelect which combines binary search and attack selection methods to greatly reduce the number of queries needed to find a token. We find that BinarySelect only needs $\text{log}_2(n) * 2$ queries to find the first token compared to $n$ queries. We also test BinarySelect in an attack setting against 5 classifiers across 3 datasets and find a viable tradeoff between number of queries saved and attack effectiveness. For example, on the Yelp dataset, the number of queries is reduced by 32% (72 less) with a drop in attack effectiveness of only 5 points. We believe that BinarySelect can help future researchers study adversarial attacks and black-box problems more efficiently and opens the door for researchers with access to less resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10617v1,2024-12
Evaluation of GPT-4o & GPT-4o-mini's Vision Capabilities for Salt Evaporite Identification,"Deven B. Dangi, Beni B. Dangi, Oliver Steinbock","Identifying salts from images of their 'stains' has diverse practical applications.

WHAT-IF: Exploring Branching Narratives by Meta-Prompting Large Language Models,"Runsheng ""Anson"" Huang, Lara J. Martin, Chris Callison-Burch","WHAT-IF -- Writing a Hero's Alternate Timeline through Interactive Fiction -- is a system that uses zero-shot meta-prompting to create branching narratives from a prewritten story. Played as an interactive fiction (IF) game, WHAT-IF lets the player choose between decisions that the large language model (LLM) GPT-4 generates as possible branches in the story. Starting with an existing linear plot as input, a branch is created at each key decision taken by the main character. By meta-prompting the LLM to consider the major plot points from the story, the system produces coherent and well-structured alternate storylines. WHAT-IF stores the branching plot tree in a graph which helps it to both keep track of the story for prompting and maintain the structure for the final IF system.

Evidence Contextualization and Counterfactual Attribution for Conversational QA over Heterogeneous Data with RAG Systems,"Rishiraj Saha Roy, Joel Schlotthauer, Chris Hinze, Andreas Foltyn, Luzian Hahn, Fabian Kuech","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) works as a backbone for interacting with an enterprise's own data via Conversational Question Answering (ConvQA). In a RAG system, a retriever fetches passages from a collection in response to a question, which are then included in the prompt of a large language model (LLM) for generating a natural language (NL) answer. However, several RAG systems today suffer from two shortcomings: (i) retrieved passages usually contain their raw text and lack appropriate document context, negatively impacting both retrieval and answering quality; and (ii) attribution strategies that explain answer generation typically rely only on similarity between the answer and the retrieved passages, thereby only generating plausible but not causal explanations. In this work, we demonstrate RAGONITE, a RAG system that remedies the above concerns by: (i) contextualizing evidence with source metadata and surrounding text; and (ii) computing counterfactual attribution, a causal explanation approach where the contribution of an evidence to an answer is determined by the similarity of the original response to the answer obtained by removing that evidence. To evaluate our proposals, we release a new benchmark ConfQuestions: it has 300 hand-created conversational questions, each in English and German, coupled with ground truth URLs, completed questions, and answers from 215 public Confluence pages. These documents are typical of enterprise wiki spaces with heterogeneous elements. Experiments with RAGONITE on ConfQuestions show the viability of our ideas: contextualization improves RAG performance, and counterfactual explanations outperform standard attribution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10571v3,2024-12
Too Big to Fool: Resisting Deception in Language Models,"Mohammad Reza Samsami, Mats Leon Richter, Juan Rodriguez, Megh Thakkar, Sarath Chandar, Maxime Gasse","Large language models must balance their weight-encoded knowledge with in-context information from prompts to generate accurate responses. This paper investigates this interplay by analyzing how models of varying capacities within the same family handle intentionally misleading in-context information. Our experiments demonstrate that larger models exhibit higher resilience to deceptive prompts, showcasing an advanced ability to interpret and integrate prompt information with their internal knowledge. Furthermore, we find that larger models outperform smaller ones in following legitimate instructions, indicating that their resilience is not due to disregarding in-context information. We also show that this phenomenon is likely not a result of memorization but stems from the models' ability to better leverage implicit task-relevant information from the prompt alongside their internally stored knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10558v1,2024-12
RAGServe: Fast Quality-Aware RAG Systems with Configuration Adaptation,"Siddhant Ray, Rui Pan, Zhuohan Gu, Kuntai Du, Ganesh Ananthanarayanan, Ravi Netravali, Junchen Jiang","RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) allows LLMs (large language models) to generate better responses with external knowledge, but using more external knowledge often improves generation quality at the expense of response delay. Prior work either reduces the response delay (through better scheduling of RAG queries) or strives to maximize quality (which involves tuning the RAG workflow), but they fall short in optimizing the tradeoff between the delay and quality of RAG responses. This paper presents RAGServe, the first RAG system that jointly schedules queries and adapts the key RAG configurations of each query, such as the number of retrieved text chunks and synthesis methods, in order to balance quality optimization and response delay reduction. Using 4 popular RAG-QA datasets, we show that compared with the state-of-the-art RAG optimization schemes, RAGServe reduces the generation latency by $1.64-2.54\times$ without sacrificing generation quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10543v1,2024-12
Exploring Text Representations for Online Misinformation,Martins Samuel Dogo,"Mis- and disinformation, commonly collectively called fake news, continue to menace society. Perhaps, the impact of this age-old problem is presently most plain in politics and healthcare. However, fake news is affecting an increasing number of domains. It takes many different forms and continues to shapeshift as technology advances. Though it arguably most widely spreads in textual form, e.g., through social media posts and blog articles. Thus, it is imperative to thwart the spread of textual misinformation, which necessitates its initial detection. This thesis contributes to the creation of representations that are useful for detecting misinformation. Firstly, it develops a novel method for extracting textual features from news articles for misinformation detection. These features harness the disparity between the thematic coherence of authentic and false news stories. In other words, the composition of themes discussed in both groups significantly differs as the story progresses. Secondly, it demonstrates the effectiveness of topic features for fake news detection, using classification and clustering. Clustering is particularly useful because it alleviates the need for a labelled dataset, which can be labour-intensive and time-consuming to amass. More generally, it contributes towards a better understanding of misinformation and ways of detecting it using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18618v1,2024-12
On Adversarial Robustness and Out-of-Distribution Robustness of Large Language Models,"April Yang, Jordan Tab, Parth Shah, Paul Kotchavong","The increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) for diverse applications necessitates a thorough understanding of their robustness to adversarial perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. In this study, we investigate the correlation between adversarial robustness and OOD robustness in LLMs, addressing a critical gap in robustness evaluation. By applying methods originally designed to improve one robustness type across both contexts, we analyze their performance on adversarial and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets. The input of the model consists of text samples, with the output prediction evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in various natural language inference tasks.   Our findings highlight nuanced interactions between adversarial robustness and OOD robustness, with results indicating limited transferability between the two robustness types. Through targeted ablations, we evaluate how these correlations evolve with different model sizes and architectures, uncovering model-specific trends: smaller models like LLaMA2-7b exhibit neutral correlations, larger models like LLaMA2-13b show negative correlations, and Mixtral demonstrates positive correlations, potentially due to domain-specific alignment. These results underscore the importance of hybrid robustness frameworks that integrate adversarial and OOD strategies tailored to specific models and domains. Further research is needed to evaluate these interactions across larger models and varied architectures, offering a pathway to more reliable and generalizable LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10535v1,2024-12
Solving the Inverse Alignment Problem for Efficient RLHF,"Shambhavi Krishna, Aishwarya Sahoo","Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the 'inverse alignment problem' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10529v1,2024-12
DEFAME: Dynamic Evidence-based FAct-checking with Multimodal Experts,"Tobias Braun, Mark Rothermel, Marcus Rohrbach, Anna Rohrbach","The proliferation of disinformation presents a growing threat to societal trust and democracy, necessitating robust and scalable Fact-Checking systems. In this work, we present Dynamic Evidence-based FAct-checking with Multimodal Experts (DEFAME), a modular, zero-shot MLLM pipeline for open-domain, text-image claim verification. DEFAME frames the problem of fact-checking as a six-stage process, dynamically deciding about the usage of external tools for the retrieval of textual and visual evidence. In addition to the claim's veracity, DEFAME returns a justification accompanied by a comprehensive, multimodal fact-checking report. While most alternatives either focus on sub-tasks of fact-checking, lack explainability or are limited to text-only inputs, DEFAME solves the problem of fact-checking end-to-end, including claims with images or those that require visual evidence. Evaluation on the popular benchmarks VERITE, AVeriTeC, and MOCHEG shows that DEFAME surpasses all previous methods, establishing it as the new state-of-the-art fact-checking system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10510v1,2024-12
Do Large Language Models Show Biases in Causal Learning?,"Maria Victoria Carro, Francisca Gauna Selasco, Denise Alejandra Mester, Margarita Gonzales, Mario A. Leiva, Maria Vanina Martinez, Gerardo I. Simari","Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice, stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this research, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) develop causal illusions, both in real-world and controlled laboratory contexts of causal learning and inference. To this end, we built a dataset of over 2K samples including purely correlational cases, situations with null contingency, and cases where temporal information excludes the possibility of causality by placing the potential effect before the cause. We then prompted the models to make statements or answer causal questions to evaluate their tendencies to infer causation erroneously in these structured settings. Our findings show a strong presence of causal illusion bias in LLMs. Specifically, in open-ended generation tasks involving spurious correlations, the models displayed bias at levels comparable to, or even lower than, those observed in similar studies on human subjects. However, when faced with null-contingency scenarios or temporal cues that negate causal relationships, where it was required to respond on a 0-100 scale, the models exhibited significantly higher bias. These findings suggest that the models have not uniformly, consistently, or reliably internalized the normative principles essential for accurate causal learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10509v1,2024-12
A Grounded Typology of Word Classes,"Coleman Haley, Sharon Goldwater, Edoardo Ponti","We propose a grounded approach to meaning in language typology. We treat data from perceptual modalities, such as images, as a language-agnostic representation of meaning. Hence, we can quantify the function--form relationship between images and captions across languages. Inspired by information theory, we define ""groundedness"", an empirical measure of contextual semantic contentfulness (formulated as a difference in surprisal) which can be computed with multilingual multimodal language models. As a proof of concept, we apply this measure to the typology of word classes. Our measure captures the contentfulness asymmetry between functional (grammatical) and lexical (content) classes across languages, but contradicts the view that functional classes do not convey content. Moreover, we find universal trends in the hierarchy of groundedness (e.g., nouns > adjectives > verbs), and show that our measure partly correlates with psycholinguistic concreteness norms in English. We release a dataset of groundedness scores for 30 languages. Our results suggest that the grounded typology approach can provide quantitative evidence about semantic function in language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10369v1,2024-12
AdvPrefix: An Objective for Nuanced LLM Jailbreaks,"Sicheng Zhu, Brandon Amos, Yuandong Tian, Chuan Guo, Ivan Evtimov","Many jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) rely on a common objective: making the model respond with the prefix ""Sure, here is (harmful request)"". While straightforward, this objective has two limitations: limited control over model behaviors, often resulting in incomplete or unrealistic responses, and a rigid format that hinders optimization. To address these limitations, we introduce AdvPrefix, a new prefix-forcing objective that enables more nuanced control over model behavior while being easy to optimize. Our objective leverages model-dependent prefixes, automatically selected based on two criteria: high prefilling attack success rates and low negative log-likelihood. It can further simplify optimization by using multiple prefixes for a single user request. AdvPrefix can integrate seamlessly into existing jailbreak attacks to improve their performance for free. For example, simply replacing GCG attack's target prefixes with ours on Llama-3 improves nuanced attack success rates from 14% to 80%, suggesting that current alignment struggles to generalize to unseen prefixes. Our work demonstrates the importance of jailbreak objectives in achieving nuanced jailbreaks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10321v1,2024-12
SCBench: A KV Cache-Centric Analysis of Long-Context Methods,"Yucheng Li, Huiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Surin Ahn, Chengruidong Zhang, Amir H. Abdi, Dongsheng Li, Jianfeng Gao, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu","Long-context LLMs have enabled numerous downstream applications but also introduced significant challenges related to computational and memory efficiency. To address these challenges, optimizations for long-context inference have been developed, centered around the KV cache. However, existing benchmarks often evaluate in single-request, neglecting the full lifecycle of the KV cache in real-world use. This oversight is particularly critical, as KV cache reuse has become widely adopted in LLMs inference frameworks, such as vLLM and SGLang, as well as by LLM providers, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Anthropic. To address this gap, we introduce SCBench(SharedContextBench), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cachecentric perspective: 1) KV cache generation, 2) KV cache compression, 3) KV cache retrieval, 4) KV cache loading. Specifically, SCBench uses test examples with shared context, ranging 12 tasks with two shared context modes, covering four categories of long-context capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information, and multi-task. With it, we provide an extensive KV cache-centric analysis of eight categories long-context solutions, including Gated Linear RNNs, Mamba-Attention hybrids, and efficient methods such as sparse attention, KV cache dropping, quantization, retrieval, loading, and prompt compression. The evaluation is conducted on 8 long-context LLMs. Our findings show that sub-O(n) memory methods suffer in multi-turn scenarios, while sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly. Dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns, and layer-level sparsity in hybrid architectures reduces memory usage with strong performance. Additionally, we identify attention distribution shift issues in long-generation scenarios. https://aka.ms/SCBench.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10319v1,2024-12
Interlocking-free Selective Rationalization Through Genetic-based Learning,"Federico Ruggeri, Gaetano Signorelli","A popular end-to-end architecture for selective rationalization is the select-then-predict pipeline, comprising a generator to extract highlights fed to a predictor. Such a cooperative system suffers from suboptimal equilibrium minima due to the dominance of one of the two modules, a phenomenon known as interlocking. While several contributions aimed at addressing interlocking, they only mitigate its effect, often by introducing feature-based heuristics, sampling, and ad-hoc regularizations. We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned. GenSPP avoids interlocking by performing disjoint training of the generator and predictor via genetic global search. Experiments on a synthetic and a real-world benchmark show that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10312v1,2024-12

Benchmarking Linguistic Diversity of Large Language Models,"Yanzhu Guo, Guokan Shang, Chloé Clavel","The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has primarily focused on their task-solving capabilities, with recent models even surpassing human performance in some areas. However, this focus often neglects whether machine-generated language matches the human level of diversity, in terms of vocabulary choice, syntactic construction, and expression of meaning, raising questions about whether the fundamentals of language generation have been fully addressed. This paper emphasizes the importance of examining the preservation of human linguistic richness by language models, given the concerning surge in online content produced or aided by LLMs. We propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs from various linguistic diversity perspectives including lexical, syntactic, and semantic dimensions. Using this framework, we benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs across all diversity dimensions, and conduct an in-depth case study for syntactic diversity.

Reasoner Outperforms: Generative Stance Detection with Rationalization for Social Media,"Jiaqing Yuan, Ruijie Xi, Munindar P. Singh","Stance detection is crucial for fostering a human-centric Web by analyzing user-generated content to identify biases and harmful narratives that undermine trust. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing approaches treat stance detection as a classification problem, providing robust methodologies for modeling complex group interactions and advancing capabilities in natural language tasks. However, these methods often lack interpretability, limiting their ability to offer transparent and understandable justifications for predictions. This study adopts a generative approach, where stance predictions include explicit, interpretable rationales, and integrates them into smaller language models through single-task and multitask learning. We find that incorporating reasoning into stance detection enables the smaller model (FlanT5) to outperform GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance, achieving an improvement of up to 9.57%. Moreover, our results show that reasoning capabilities enhance multitask learning performance but may reduce effectiveness in single-task settings. Crucially, we demonstrate that faithful rationales improve rationale distillation into SLMs, advancing efforts to build interpretable, trustworthy systems for addressing discrimination, fostering trust, and promoting equitable engagement on social media.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10266v1,2024-12
Targeted Angular Reversal of Weights (TARS) for Knowledge Removal in Large Language Models,"Harry J. Davies, Giorgos Iacovides, Danilo P. Mandic","The sheer scale of data required to train modern large language models (LLMs) poses significant risks, as models are likely to gain knowledge of sensitive topics such as bio-security, as well the ability to replicate copyrighted works. Methods designed to remove such knowledge must do so from all prompt directions, in a multi-lingual capacity and without degrading general model performance. To this end, we introduce the targeted angular reversal (TARS) method of knowledge removal from LLMs. The TARS method firstly leverages the LLM in combination with a detailed prompt to aggregate information about a selected concept in the internal representation space of the LLM. It then refines this approximate concept vector to trigger the concept token with high probability, by perturbing the approximate concept vector with noise and transforming it into token scores with the language model head. The feedforward weight vectors in the LLM which operate directly on the internal representation space, and have the highest cosine similarity with this targeting vector, are then replaced by a reversed targeting vector, thus limiting the ability of the concept to propagate through the model. The modularity of the TARS method allows for a sequential removal of concepts from Llama 3.1 8B, such as the famous literary detective Sherlock Holmes, and the planet Saturn. It is demonstrated that the probability of triggering target concepts can be reduced to 0.00 with as few as 1 TARS edit, whilst simultaneously removing the knowledge bi-directionally. Moreover, knowledge is shown to be removed across all languages despite only being targeted in English. Importantly, TARS has minimal impact on the general model capabilities, as after removing 5 diverse concepts in a modular fashion, there is minimal KL divergence in the next token probabilities of the LLM on large corpora of Wikipedia text (median of 0.0015).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10257v2,2024-12
Efficient Continual Pre-training of LLMs for Low-resource Languages,"Arijit Nag, Soumen Chakrabarti, Animesh Mukherjee, Niloy Ganguly","Open-source Large Language models (OsLLMs) propel the democratization of natural language research by giving the flexibility to augment or update model parameters for performance improvement. Nevertheless, like proprietary LLMs, Os-LLMs offer poorer performance on low-resource languages (LRLs) than high-resource languages (HRLs), owing to smaller amounts of training data and underrepresented vocabulary. On the other hand, continual pre-training (CPT) with large amounts of language-specific data is a costly proposition in terms of data acquisition and computational resources. Our goal is to drastically reduce CPT cost. To that end, we first develop a new algorithm to select a subset of texts from a larger corpus. We show the effectiveness of our technique using very little CPT data. In search of further improvement, we design a new algorithm to select tokens to include in the LLM vocabulary. We experiment with the recent Llama-3 model and nine Indian languages with diverse scripts and extent of resource availability. For evaluation, we use IndicGenBench, a generation task benchmark dataset for Indic languages. We experiment with various CPT corpora and augmented vocabulary size and offer insights across language families.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10244v1,2024-12

In this work we propose a framework and explore several automated metrics to evaluate LLM-generated narratives for explanations of tabular classification tasks. We apply our approach to compare several state-of-the-art LLMs across different datasets and prompt types.

Retrieval-Augmented Semantic Parsing: Using Large Language Models to Improve Generalization,"Xiao Zhang, Qianru Meng, Johan Bos","Open-domain semantic parsing remains a challenging task, as models often rely on heuristics and struggle to handle unseen concepts. In this paper, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) for this task and introduce Retrieval-Augmented Semantic Parsing (RASP), a simple yet effective approach that integrates external lexical knowledge into the parsing process. Our experiments not only show that LLMs outperform previous encoder-decoder baselines for semantic parsing, but that RASP further enhances their ability to predict unseen concepts, nearly doubling the performance of previous models on out-of-distribution concepts.

MPPO: Multi Pair-wise Preference Optimization for LLMs with Arbitrary Negative Samples,"Shuo Xie, Fangzhi Zhu, Jiahui Wang, Lulu Wen, Wei Dai, Xiaowei Chen, Junxiong Zhu, Kai Zhou, Bo Zheng","Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human feedback is crucial for their development. Existing preference optimization methods such as DPO and KTO, while improved based on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are inherently derived from PPO, requiring a reference model that adds GPU memory resources and relies heavily on abundant preference data. Meanwhile, current preference optimization research mainly targets single-question scenarios with two replies, neglecting optimization with multiple replies, which leads to a waste of data in the application. This study introduces the MPPO algorithm, which leverages the average likelihood of model responses to fit the reward function and maximizes the utilization of preference data. Through a comparison of Point-wise, Pair-wise, and List-wise implementations, we found that the Pair-wise approach achieves the best performance, significantly enhancing the quality of model responses. Experimental results demonstrate MPPO's outstanding performance across various benchmarks. On MT-Bench, MPPO outperforms DPO, ORPO, and SimPO. Notably, on Arena-Hard, MPPO surpasses DPO and ORPO by substantial margins. These achievements underscore the remarkable advantages of MPPO in preference optimization tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15244v1,2024-12

TACOMORE: Leveraging the Potential of LLMs in Corpus-based Discourse Analysis with Prompt Engineering,"Bingru Li, Han Wang","The capacity of LLMs to carry out automated qualitative analysis has been questioned by corpus linguists, and it has been argued that corpus-based discourse analysis incorporating LLMs is hindered by issues of unsatisfying performance, hallucination, and irreproducibility. Our proposed method, TACOMORE, aims to address these concerns by serving as an effective prompting framework in this domain. The framework consists of four principles, i.e., Task, Context, Model and Reproducibility, and specifies five fundamental elements of a good prompt, i.e., Role Description, Task Definition, Task Procedures, Contextual Information and Output Format. We conduct experiments on three LLMs, i.e., GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro and Gemini-1.5.Flash, and find that TACOMORE helps improve LLM performance in three representative discourse analysis tasks, i.e., the analysis of keywords, collocates and concordances, based on an open corpus of COVID-19 research articles. Our findings show the efficacy of the proposed prompting framework TACOMORE in corpus-based discourse analysis in terms of Accuracy, Ethicality, Reasoning, and Reproducibility, and provide novel insights into the application and evaluation of LLMs in automated qualitative studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10139v1,2024-12
ROUTE: Robust Multitask Tuning and Collaboration for Text-to-SQL,"Yang Qin, Chao Chen, Zhihang Fu, Ze Chen, Dezhong Peng, Peng Hu, Jieping Ye","Despite the significant advancements in Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL) facilitated by large language models (LLMs), the latest state-of-the-art techniques are still trapped in the in-context learning of closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), which limits their applicability in open scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel RObust mUltitask Tuning and collaboration mEthod (ROUTE) to improve the comprehensive capabilities of open-source LLMs for Text2SQL, thereby providing a more practical solution. Our approach begins with multi-task supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using various synthetic training data related to SQL generation. Unlike existing SFT-based Text2SQL methods, we introduced several additional SFT tasks, including schema linking, noise correction, and continuation writing. Engaging in a variety of SQL generation tasks enhances the model's understanding of SQL syntax and improves its ability to generate high-quality SQL queries. Additionally, inspired by the collaborative modes of LLM agents, we introduce a Multitask Collaboration Prompting (MCP) strategy. This strategy leverages collaboration across several SQL-related tasks to reduce hallucinations during SQL generation, thereby maximizing the potential of enhancing Text2SQL performance through explicit multitask capabilities. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses have been performed on eight open-source LLMs and five widely-used benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our proposal outperforms the latest Text2SQL methods and yields leading performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10138v1,2024-12
Can LLMs Convert Graphs to Text-Attributed Graphs?,"Zehong Wang, Sidney Liu, Zheyuan Zhang, Tianyi Ma, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye","Graphs are ubiquitous data structures found in numerous real-world applications, such as drug discovery, recommender systems, and social network analysis. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool to learn node embeddings through message passing on these structures. However, a significant challenge arises when applying GNNs to multiple graphs with different feature spaces, as existing GNN architectures are not designed for cross-graph feature alignment. To address this, recent approaches introduce text-attributed graphs, where each node is associated with a textual description, enabling the use of a shared textual encoder to project nodes from different graphs into a unified feature space. While promising, this method relies heavily on the availability of text-attributed data, which can be difficult to obtain in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method named Topology-Aware Node description Synthesis (TANS), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically convert existing graphs into text-attributed graphs. The key idea is to integrate topological information with each node's properties, enhancing the LLMs' ability to explain how graph topology influences node semantics. We evaluate our TANS on text-rich, text-limited, and text-free graphs, demonstrating that it enables a single GNN to operate across diverse graphs. Notably, on text-free graphs, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches that manually design node features, showcasing the potential of LLMs for preprocessing graph-structured data, even in the absence of textual information. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/TANS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10136v1,2024-12
ASLoRA: Adaptive Sharing Low-Rank Adaptation Across Layers,"Junyan Hu, Xue Xiao, Mengqi Zhang, Yao Chen, Zhaochun Ren, Zhumin Chen, Pengjie Ren","As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, traditional full fine-tuning becomes increasingly impractical due to its high computational and storage costs. Although popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, have significantly reduced the number of tunable parameters, there is still room for further optimization. In this work, we propose ASLoRA, a cross-layer parameter-sharing strategy combining global sharing with partial adaptive sharing. Specifically, we share the low-rank matrix A across all layers and adaptively merge matrix B during training. This sharing mechanism not only mitigates overfitting effectively but also captures inter-layer dependencies, significantly enhancing the model's representational capability. We conduct extensive experiments on various NLP tasks, showing that ASLoRA outperforms LoRA while using less than 25% of the parameters, highlighting its flexibility and superior parameter efficiency. Furthermore, in-depth analyses of the adaptive sharing strategy confirm its significant advantages in enhancing both model flexibility and task adaptability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10135v2,2024-12
Familiarity: Better Evaluation of Zero-Shot Named Entity Recognition by Quantifying Label Shifts in Synthetic Training Data,"Jonas Golde, Patrick Haller, Max Ploner, Fabio Barth, Nicolaas Jedema, Alan Akbik","Zero-shot named entity recognition (NER) is the task of detecting named entities of specific types (such as 'Person' or 'Medicine') without any training examples. Current research increasingly relies on large synthetic datasets, automatically generated to cover tens of thousands of distinct entity types, to train zero-shot NER models. However, in this paper, we find that these synthetic datasets often contain entity types that are semantically highly similar to (or even the same as) those in standard evaluation benchmarks. Because of this overlap, we argue that reported F1 scores for zero-shot NER overestimate the true capabilities of these approaches. Further, we argue that current evaluation setups provide an incomplete picture of zero-shot abilities since they do not quantify the label shift (i.e., the similarity of labels) between training and evaluation datasets. To address these issues, we propose Familiarity, a novel metric that captures both the semantic similarity between entity types in training and evaluation, as well as their frequency in the training data, to provide an estimate of label shift. It allows researchers to contextualize reported zero-shot NER scores when using custom synthetic training datasets. Further, it enables researchers to generate evaluation setups of various transfer difficulties for fine-grained analysis of zero-shot NER.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10121v1,2024-12
Label-template based Few-Shot Text Classification with Contrastive Learning,"Guanghua Hou, Shuhui Cao, Deqiang Ouyang, Ning Wang","As an algorithmic framework for learning to learn, meta-learning provides a promising solution for few-shot text classification. However, most existing research fail to give enough attention to class labels. Traditional basic framework building meta-learner based on prototype networks heavily relies on inter-class variance, and it is easily influenced by noise. To address these limitations, we proposes a simple and effective few-shot text classification framework. In particular, the corresponding label templates are embed into input sentences to fully utilize the potential value of class labels, guiding the pre-trained model to generate more discriminative text representations through the semantic information conveyed by labels. With the continuous influence of label semantics, supervised contrastive learning is utilized to model the interaction information between support samples and query samples. Furthermore, the averaging mechanism is replaced with an attention mechanism to highlight vital semantic information. To verify the proposed scheme, four typical datasets are employed to assess the performance of different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance enhancements and outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on few-shot text classification tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10110v1,2024-12
"MALAMUTE: A Multilingual, Highly-granular, Template-free, Education-based Probing Dataset","Sagi Shaier, George Arthur Baker, Chiranthan Sridhar, Lawrence E Hunter, Katharina von der Wense","Language models (LMs) have excelled in various broad domains. However, to ensure their safe and effective integration into real-world educational settings, they must demonstrate proficiency in specific, granular areas of knowledge. Existing cloze-style benchmarks, commonly used to evaluate LMs' knowledge, have three major limitations. They: 1) do not cover the educational domain; 2) typically focus on low-complexity, generic knowledge or broad domains, which do not adequately assess the models' knowledge in specific subjects; and 3) often rely on templates that can bias model predictions. Here, we introduce MALAMUTE, a multilingual, template-free, and highly granular probing dataset comprising expert-written, peer-reviewed probes from 71 university-level textbooks across three languages (English, Spanish, and Polish). MALAMUTE is the first education-based cloze-style dataset. It covers eight domains, each with up to 14 subdomains, further broken down into concepts and concept-based prompts, totaling 33,361 university curriculum concepts and 116,887 prompts. MALAMUTE's fine granularity, educational focus, and inclusion of both sentence-level and paragraph-level prompts make it an ideal tool for evaluating LMs' course-related knowledge. Our evaluation of masked and causal LMs on MALAMUTE shows that despite overall proficiency, they have significant gaps in knowledge when examined closely on specific subjects, hindering their safe use in classrooms and underscoring the need for further development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10105v1,2024-12
RETQA: A Large-Scale Open-Domain Tabular Question Answering Dataset for Real Estate Sector,"Zhensheng Wang, Wenmian Yang, Kun Zhou, Yiquan Zhang, Weijia Jia","The real estate market relies heavily on structured data, such as property details, market trends, and price fluctuations. However, the lack of specialized Tabular Question Answering datasets in this domain limits the development of automated question-answering systems. To fill this gap, we introduce RETQA, the first large-scale open-domain Chinese Tabular Question Answering dataset for Real Estate. RETQA comprises 4,932 tables and 20,762 question-answer pairs across 16 sub-fields within three major domains: property information, real estate company finance information and land auction information. Compared with existing tabular question answering datasets, RETQA poses greater challenges due to three key factors: long-table structures, open-domain retrieval, and multi-domain queries. To tackle these challenges, we propose the SLUTQA framework, which integrates large language models with spoken language understanding tasks to enhance retrieval and answering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLUTQA significantly improves the performance of large language models on RETQA by in-context learning. RETQA and SLUTQA provide essential resources for advancing tabular question answering research in the real estate domain, addressing critical challenges in open-domain and long-table question-answering. The dataset and code are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/jensen-w/RETQA}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10104v1,2024-12
AMuSeD: An Attentive Deep Neural Network for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection Incorporating Bi-modal Data Augmentation,"Xiyuan Gao, Shubhi Bansal, Kushaan Gowda, Zhu Li, Shekhar Nayak, Nagendra Kumar, Matt Coler","Detecting sarcasm effectively requires a nuanced understanding of context, including vocal tones and facial expressions. The progression towards multimodal computational methods in sarcasm detection, however, faces challenges due to the scarcity of data. To address this, we present AMuSeD (Attentive deep neural network for MUltimodal Sarcasm dEtection incorporating bi-modal Data augmentation). This approach utilizes the Multimodal Sarcasm Detection Dataset (MUStARD) and introduces a two-phase bimodal data augmentation strategy. The first phase involves generating varied text samples through Back Translation from several secondary languages. The second phase involves the refinement of a FastSpeech 2-based speech synthesis system, tailored specifically for sarcasm to retain sarcastic intonations. Alongside a cloud-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) service, this Fine-tuned FastSpeech 2 system produces corresponding audio for the text augmentations. We also investigate various attention mechanisms for effectively merging text and audio data, finding self-attention to be the most efficient for bimodal integration. Our experiments reveal that this combined augmentation and attention approach achieves a significant F1-score of 81.0% in text-audio modalities, surpassing even models that use three modalities from the MUStARD dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10103v1,2024-12
HiTZ at VarDial 2025 NorSID: Overcoming Data Scarcity with Language Transfer and Automatic Data Annotation,"Jaione Bengoetxea, Mikel Zubillaga, Ekhi Azurmendi, Maite Heredia, Julen Etxaniz, Markel Ferro, Jeremy Barnes","In this paper we present our submission for the NorSID Shared Task as part of the 2025 VarDial Workshop (Scherrer et al., 2025), consisting of three tasks: Intent Detection, Slot Filling and Dialect Identification, evaluated using data in different dialects of the Norwegian language. For Intent Detection and Slot Filling, we have fine-tuned a multitask model in a cross-lingual setting, to leverage the xSID dataset available in 17 languages. In the case of Dialect Identification, our final submission consists of a model fine-tuned on the provided development set, which has obtained the highest scores within our experiments. Our final results on the test set show that our models do not drop in performance compared to the development set, likely due to the domain-specificity of the dataset and the similar distribution of both subsets. Finally, we also report an in-depth analysis of the provided datasets and their artifacts, as well as other sets of experiments that have been carried out but did not yield the best results. Additionally, we present an analysis on the reasons why some methods have been more successful than others; mainly the impact of the combination of languages and domain-specificity of the training data on the results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10095v2,2024-12
"Lost in the Middle, and In-Between: Enhancing Language Models' Ability to Reason Over Long Contexts in Multi-Hop QA","George Arthur Baker, Ankush Raut, Sagi Shaier, Lawrence E Hunter, Katharina von der Wense","Previous work finds that recent long-context language models fail to make equal use of information in the middle of their inputs, preferring pieces of information located at the tail ends which creates an undue bias in situations where we would like models to be equally capable of using different parts of the input. Thus far, the problem has mainly only been considered in settings with single pieces of critical information, leading us to question what happens when multiple necessary pieces of information are spread out over the inputs. Here, we demonstrate the effects of the ""lost in the middle"" problem in the multi-hop question answering setting -- in which multiple reasoning ""hops"" over disconnected documents are required -- and show that performance degrades not only with respect to the distance of information from the edges of the context, but also between pieces of information. Additionally, we experiment with means of alleviating the problem by reducing superfluous document contents through knowledge graph triple extraction and summarization, and prompting models to reason more thoroughly using chain-of-thought prompting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10079v1,2024-12
"Script-Based Dialog Policy Planning for LLM-Powered Conversational Agents: A Basic Architecture for an ""AI Therapist""","Robert Wasenmüller, Kevin Hilbert, Christoph Benzmüller","Large Language Model (LLM)-Powered Conversational Agents have the potential to provide users with scaled behavioral healthcare support, and potentially even deliver full-scale ""AI therapy'"" in the future. While such agents can already conduct fluent and proactive emotional support conversations, they inherently lack the ability to (a) consistently and reliably act by predefined rules to align their conversation with an overarching therapeutic concept and (b) make their decision paths inspectable for risk management and clinical evaluation -- both essential requirements for an ""AI Therapist"".   In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for dialog policy planning in conversational agents enabling them to (a) act according to an expert-written ""script"" that outlines the therapeutic approach and (b) explicitly transition through a finite set of states over the course of the conversation. The script acts as a deterministic component, constraining the LLM's behavior in desirable ways and establishing a basic architecture for an AI Therapist.   We implement two variants of Script-Based Dialog Policy Planning using different prompting techniques and synthesize a total of 100 conversations with LLM-simulated patients. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this new technology and provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of different implementation variants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15242v1,2024-12
GAOKAO-Eval: Does high scores truly reflect strong capabilities in LLMs?,"Zhikai Lei, Tianyi Liang, Hanglei Hu, Jin Zhang, Yunhua Zhou, Yunfan Shao, Linyang Li, Chenchui Li, Changbo Wang, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo","Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated using human-crafted benchmarks, under the premise that higher scores implicitly reflect stronger human-like performance. However, there is growing concern that LLMs may ``game"" these benchmarks due to data leakage, achieving high scores while struggling with tasks simple for humans. To substantively address the problem, we create GAOKAO-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark based on China's National College Entrance Examination (Gaokao), and conduct ``closed-book"" evaluations for representative models released prior to Gaokao. Contrary to prevailing consensus, even after addressing data leakage and comprehensiveness, GAOKAO-Eval reveals that high scores still fail to truly reflect human-aligned capabilities. To better understand this mismatch, We introduce the Rasch model from cognitive psychology to analyze LLM scoring patterns and identify two key discrepancies: 1) anomalous consistent performance across various question difficulties, and 2) high variance in performance on questions of similar difficulty. In addition, We identified inconsistent grading of LLM-generated answers among teachers and recurring mistake patterns. we find that the phenomenons are well-grounded in the motivations behind OpenAI o1, and o1's reasoning-as-difficulties can mitigate the mismatch. These results show that GAOKAO-Eval can reveal limitations in LLM capabilities not captured by current benchmarks and highlight the need for more LLM-aligned difficulty analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10056v1,2024-12
Unsupervised Named Entity Disambiguation for Low Resource Domains,"Debarghya Datta, Soumajit Pramanik","In the ever-evolving landscape of natural language processing and information retrieval, the need for robust and domain-specific entity linking algorithms has become increasingly apparent. It is crucial in a considerable number of fields such as humanities, technical writing and biomedical sciences to enrich texts with semantics and discover more knowledge. The use of Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) in such domains requires handling noisy texts, low resource settings and domain-specific KBs. Existing approaches are mostly inappropriate for such scenarios, as they either depend on training data or are not flexible enough to work with domain-specific KBs. Thus in this work, we present an unsupervised approach leveraging the concept of Group Steiner Trees (GST), which can identify the most relevant candidates for entity disambiguation using the contextual similarities across candidate entities for all the mentions present in a document. We outperform the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by more than 40\% (in avg.) in terms of Precision@1 across various domain-specific datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10054v1,2024-12
Quantifying Positional Biases in Text Embedding Models,"Samarth Goel, Reagan J. Lee, Kannan Ramchandran","Embedding models are crucial for tasks in Information Retrieval (IR) and semantic similarity measurement, yet their handling of longer texts and associated positional biases remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of content position and input size on text embeddings. Our experiments reveal that embedding models, irrespective of their positional encoding mechanisms, disproportionately prioritize the beginning of an input. Ablation studies demonstrate that insertion of irrelevant text or removal at the start of a document reduces cosine similarity between altered and original embeddings by up to 12.3% more than ablations at the end. Regression analysis further confirms this bias, with sentence importance declining as position moves further from the start, even with with content-agnosticity. We hypothesize that this effect arises from pre-processing strategies and chosen positional encoding techniques. These findings quantify the sensitivity of retrieval systems and suggest a new lens towards embedding model robustness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15241v3,2024-12
Automated Collection of Evaluation Dataset for Semantic Search in Low-Resource Domain Language,"Anastasia Zhukova, Christian E. Matt, Bela Gipp","Domain-specific languages that use a lot of specific terminology often fall into the category of low-resource languages. Collecting test datasets in a narrow domain is time-consuming and requires skilled human resources with domain knowledge and training for the annotation task. This study addresses the challenge of automated collecting test datasets to evaluate semantic search in low-resource domain-specific German language of the process industry. Our approach proposes an end-to-end annotation pipeline for automated query generation to the score reassessment of query-document pairs. To overcome the lack of text encoders trained in the German chemistry domain, we explore a principle of an ensemble of ""weak"" text encoders trained on common knowledge datasets. We combine individual relevance scores from diverse models to retrieve document candidates and relevance scores generated by an LLM, aiming to achieve consensus on query-document alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that the ensemble method significantly improves alignment with human-assigned relevance scores, outperforming individual models in both inter-coder agreement and accuracy metrics. These findings suggest that ensemble learning can effectively adapt semantic search systems for specialized, low-resource languages, offering a practical solution to resource limitations in domain-specific contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10008v1,2024-12
The role of inhibitory control in garden-path sentence processing: A Chinese-English bilingual perspective,"Xiaohui Rao, Haoze Li, Xiaofang Lin, Lijuan Liang","In reading garden-path sentences, people must resolve competing interpretations, though initial misinterpretations can linger despite reanalysis. This study examines the role of inhibitory control (IC) in managing these misinterpretations among Chinese-English bilinguals. Using self-paced reading tasks, we investigated how IC influences recovery from garden-path sentences in Chinese (L1) and its interaction with language proficiency during English (L2) processing. Results indicate that IC does not affect garden-path recovery in Chinese, suggesting reliance on semantic context may reduce the need for IC. In contrast, findings for English L2 learners reveal a complex relationship between language proficiency and IC: Participants with low L2 proficiency but high IC showed lingering misinterpretations, while those with high proficiency exhibited none. These results support and extend the Model of Cognitive Control (Ness et al., 2023). Moreover, our comparison of three Stroop task versions identifies L1 colour-word Stroop task as the preferred measure of IC in bilingual research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10006v1,2024-12
"A Comparative Study of LLMs, NMT Models, and Their Combination in Persian-English Idiom Translation","Sara Rezaeimanesh, Faezeh Hosseini, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh","Large language models (LLMs) have shown superior capabilities in translating figurative language compared to neural machine translation (NMT) systems. However, the impact of different prompting methods and LLM-NMT combinations on idiom translation has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This paper introduces two parallel datasets of sentences containing idiomatic expressions for Persian$\rightarrow$English and English$\rightarrow$Persian translations, with Persian idioms sampled from our PersianIdioms resource, a collection of 2,200 idioms and their meanings. Using these datasets, we evaluate various open- and closed-source LLMs, NMT models, and their combinations. Translation quality is assessed through idiom translation accuracy and fluency. We also find that automatic evaluation methods like LLM-as-a-judge, BLEU and BERTScore are effective for comparing different aspects of model performance. Our experiments reveal that Claude-3.5-Sonnet delivers outstanding results in both translation directions. For English$\rightarrow$Persian, combining weaker LLMs with Google Translate improves results, while Persian$\rightarrow$English translations benefit from single prompts for simpler models and complex prompts for advanced ones.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09993v1,2024-12
Small Language Model as Data Prospector for Large Language Model,"Shiwen Ni, Haihong Wu, Di Yang, Qiang Qu, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Min Yang","The quality of instruction data directly affects the performance of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). Previously, \cite{li2023one} proposed \texttt{NUGGETS}, which identifies and selects high-quality quality data from a large dataset by identifying those individual instruction examples that can significantly improve the performance of different tasks after being learnt as one-shot instances.

Our \texttt{SuperNUGGETS} uses a small language model (SLM) instead of a large language model (LLM) to filter the data for outstanding one-shot instances and refines the predefined set of tests. The experimental results show that the performance of \texttt{SuperNUGGETS} only decreases by 1-2% compared to \texttt{NUGGETS}, but the efficiency can be increased by a factor of 58.

ChainStream: An LLM-based Framework for Unified Synthetic Sensing,"Jiacheng Liu, Yuanchun Li, Liangyan Li, Yi Sun, Hao Wen, Xiangyu Li, Yao Guo, Yunxin Liu","Many applications demand context sensing to offer personalized and timely services. Yet, developing sensing programs can be challenging for developers and using them is privacy-concerning for end-users. In this paper, we propose to use natural language as the unified interface to process personal data and sense user context, which can effectively ease app development and make the data pipeline more transparent. Our work is inspired by large language models (LLMs) and other generative models, while directly applying them does not solve the problem - letting the model directly process the data cannot handle complex sensing requests and letting the model write the data processing program suffers error-prone code generation. We address the problem with 1) a unified data processing framework that makes context-sensing programs simpler and 2) a feedback-guided query optimizer that makes data query more informative. To evaluate the performance of natural language-based context sensing, we create a benchmark that contains 133 context sensing tasks.

Low-Resource Fast Text Classification Based on Intra-Class and Inter-Class Distance Calculation,"Yanxu Mao, Peipei Liu, Tiehan Cui, Congying Liu, Datao You","In recent years, text classification methods based on neural networks and pre-trained models have gained increasing attention and demonstrated excellent performance. However, these methods still have some limitations in practical applications: (1) They typically focus only on the matching similarity between sentences. However, there exists implicit high-value information both within sentences of the same class and across different classes, which is very crucial for classification tasks. (2) Existing methods such as pre-trained language models and graph-based approaches often consume substantial memory for training and text-graph construction. (3) Although some low-resource methods can achieve good performance, they often suffer from excessively long processing times. To address these challenges, we propose a low-resource and fast text classification model called LFTC. Our approach begins by constructing a compressor list for each class to fully mine the regularity information within intra-class data. We then remove redundant information irrelevant to the target classification to reduce processing time. Finally, we compute the similarity distance between text pairs for classification. We evaluate LFTC on 9 publicly available benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate significant improvements in performance and processing time, especially under limited computational and data resources, highlighting its superior advantages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09922v1,2024-12
Enhancing the Reasoning Capabilities of Small Language Models via Solution Guidance Fine-Tuning,"Jing Bi, Yuting Wu, Weiwei Xing, Zhenjie Wei","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. Advances in prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques have further enhanced their ability to address complex reasoning challenges. However, these advanced capabilities are often exclusive to models exceeding 100 billion parameters. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning methods have been explored for smaller models (under 10 billion parameters), they typically depend on extensive CoT training data, which can introduce inconsistencies and limit effectiveness in low-data settings. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduce a new reasoning strategy Solution Guidance (SG) and a plug-and-play training paradigm Solution-Guidance Fine-Tuning (SGFT) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of small language models. SG focuses on problem understanding and decomposition at the semantic and logical levels, rather than specific computations, which can effectively improve the SLMs' generalization and reasoning abilities. With only a small amount of SG training data, SGFT can fine-tune a SLM to produce accurate problem-solving guidances, which can then be flexibly fed to any SLM as prompts, enabling it to generate correct answers directly. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of SLMs on various reasoning tasks, enhancing both their practicality and efficiency within resource-constrained environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09906v1,2024-12
Analyzing Fairness of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing Models,"Ahmed Rashed, Abdelkrim Kallich, Mohamed Eltayeb","Machine learning (ML) algorithms play a crucial role in decision making across diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, education, and law enforcement. Despite their widespread adoption, these systems raise ethical and social concerns due to potential biases and fairness issues. This study focuses on evaluating and improving the fairness of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models applied to unstructured datasets, emphasizing how biased predictions can reinforce existing systemic inequalities. A publicly available dataset from Kaggle was utilized to simulate a practical scenario for examining fairness in ML workflows. To address and mitigate biases, the study employed two leading fairness libraries: Fairlearn by Microsoft, and AIF360 by IBM. These tools offer comprehensive frameworks for fairness analysis, including metrics evaluation, result visualization, and bias mitigation techniques. The research aims to measure bias levels in ML models, compare the effectiveness of these fairness libraries, and provide actionable recommendations for practitioners. The results demonstrate that each library possesses distinct strengths and limitations in evaluating and mitigating fairness. By systematically analyzing these tools, the study contributes valuable insights to the growing field of ML fairness, offering practical guidance for integrating fairness solutions into real world applications.

HashEvict: A Pre-Attention KV Cache Eviction Strategy using Locality-Sensitive Hashing,"Minghui Liu, Tahseen Rabbani, Tony O'Halloran, Ananth Sankaralingam, Mary-Anne Hartley, Brian Gravelle, Furong Huang, Cornelia Fermüller, Yiannis Aloimonos","Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) use the key-value (KV) cache to significantly accelerate inference by storing the key and value embeddings of past tokens. However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce HashEvict, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. HashEvict quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, HashEvict makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, HashEvict is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that HashEvict can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16187v2,2024-12
Benchmarking Table Comprehension In The Wild,"Yikang Pan, Yi Zhu, Rand Xie, Yizhi Liu","Large Language Models (LLMs), while being increasingly dominant on a myriad of knowledge-intensive activities, have only had limited success understanding lengthy table-text mixtures, such as academic papers and financial reports. Recent advances of long-context LLMs have opened up new possibilities for this field. Nonetheless, we identify two roadblocks: (1) Prior benchmarks of table question answering (TableQA) have focused on isolated tables without context, making it hard to evaluate models in real-world scenarios. (2) Prior benchmarks have focused on some narrow skill sets of table comprehension such as table recognition, data manipulation/calculation, table summarization etc., while a skilled human employs those skills collectively. In this work, we introduce TableQuest, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the holistic table comprehension capabilities of LLMs in the natural table-rich context of financial reports. We employ a rigorous data processing and filtering procedure to ensure that the question-answer pairs are logical, reasonable, and diverse. We experiment with 7 state-of-the-art models, and find that despite reasonable accuracy in locating facts, they often falter when required to execute more sophisticated reasoning or multi-step calculations. We conclude with a qualitative study of the failure modes and discuss the challenges of constructing a challenging benchmark. We make the evaluation data, judging procedure and results of this study publicly available to facilitate research in this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09884v1,2024-12
On the Limit of Language Models as Planning Formalizers,"Cassie Huang, Li Zhang","Large Language Models have been shown to fail to create executable and verifiable plans in grounded environments. An emerging line of work shows success in using LLM as a formalizer to generate a formal representation (e.g., PDDL) of the planning domain, which can be deterministically solved to find a plan. We systematically evaluate this methodology while bridging some major gaps. While previous work only generates a partial PDDL representation given templated and thus unrealistic environment descriptions, we generate the complete representation given descriptions of various naturalness levels. Among an array of observations critical to improve LLMs' formal planning ability, we note that large enough models can effectively formalize descriptions as PDDL, outperforming those directly generating plans, while being robust to lexical perturbation. As the descriptions become more natural-sounding, we observe a decrease in performance and provide detailed error analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09879v1,2024-12
Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens,"Artidoro Pagnoni, Ram Pasunuru, Pedro Rodriguez, John Nguyen, Benjamin Muller, Margaret Li, Chunting Zhou, Lili Yu, Jason Weston, Luke Zettlemoyer, Gargi Ghosh, Mike Lewis, Ari Holtzman, Srinivasan Iyer","We introduce the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level LLM architecture that, for the first time, matches tokenization-based LLM performance at scale with significant improvements in inference efficiency and robustness. BLT encodes bytes into dynamically sized patches, which serve as the primary units of computation. Patches are segmented based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute and model capacity where increased data complexity demands it. We present the first FLOP controlled scaling study of byte-level models up to 8B parameters and 4T training bytes. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of scaling models trained on raw bytes without a fixed vocabulary. Both training and inference efficiency improve due to dynamically selecting long patches when data is predictable, along with qualitative improvements on reasoning and long tail generalization. Overall, for fixed inference costs, BLT shows significantly better scaling than tokenization-based models, by simultaneously growing both patch and model size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09871v1,2024-12

Financial Sentiment Analysis: Leveraging Actual and Synthetic Data for Supervised Fine-tuning,Abraham Atsiwo,"The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) highlights the essence of financial news in stock price movement. Financial news comes in the form of corporate announcements, news titles, and other forms of digital text. The generation of insights from financial news can be done with sentiment analysis. General-purpose language models are too general for sentiment analysis in finance. Curated labeled data for fine-tuning general-purpose language models are scare, and existing fine-tuned models for sentiment analysis in finance do not capture the maximum context width. We hypothesize that using actual and synthetic data can improve performance. We introduce BertNSP-finance to concatenate shorter financial sentences into longer financial sentences, and finbert-lc to determine sentiment from digital text. The results show improved performance on the accuracy and the f1 score for the financial phrasebank data with $50\%$ and $100\%$ agreement levels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09859v1,2024-12
Modeling Story Expectations to Understand Engagement: A Generative Framework Using LLMs,"Hortense Fong, George Gui","Understanding when and why consumers engage with stories is crucial for content creators and platforms. While existing theories suggest that audience beliefs of what is going to happen should play an important role in engagement decisions, empirical work has mostly focused on developing techniques to directly extract features from actual content, rather than capturing forward-looking beliefs, due to the lack of a principled way to model such beliefs in unstructured narrative data. To complement existing feature extraction techniques, this paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models to model audience forward-looking beliefs about how stories might unfold. Our method generates multiple potential continuations for each story and extracts features related to expectations, uncertainty, and surprise using established content analysis techniques. Applying our method to over 30,000 book chapters from Wattpad, we demonstrate that our framework complements existing feature engineering techniques by amplifying their marginal explanatory power on average by 31%. The results reveal that different types of engagement-continuing to read, commenting, and voting-are driven by distinct combinations of current and anticipated content features. Our framework provides a novel way to study and explore how audience forward-looking beliefs shape their engagement with narrative media, with implications for marketing strategy in content-focused industries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15239v1,2024-12
Low-Rank Adaptation with Task-Relevant Feature Enhancement for Fine-tuning Language Models,"Changqun Li, Chaofan Ding, Kexin Luan, Xinhan Di","Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. LoRA is one of the most widely used methods, which assumes that the optimization process is essentially low dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, there remains a significant performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning when learning new tasks. In this work, we propose Low-Rank Adaptation with Task-Relevant Feature Enhancement(LoRATRF) for enhancing task-relevant features from the perspective of editing neural network representations. To prioritize task-relevant features, a task-aware filter that selectively extracts valuable knowledge from hidden representations for the target or current task is designed. As the experiments on a vareity of datasets including NLU, commonsense reasoning and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrates, our method reduces 33.71% parameters and achieves better performance on a variety of datasets in comparison with SOTA low-rank methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09827v1,2024-12

Enhancing Multimodal Large Language Models Complex Reason via Similarity Computation,"Xiaofeng Zhang, Fanshuo Zeng, Yihao Quan, Zheng Hui, Jiawei Yao","Multimodal large language models have experienced rapid growth, and numerous different models have emerged. The interpretability of LVLMs remains an under-explored area. Especially when faced with more complex tasks such as chain-of-thought reasoning, its internal mechanisms still resemble a black box that is difficult to decipher. By studying the interaction and information flow between images and text, we noticed that in models such as LLaVA1.5, image tokens that are semantically related to text are more likely to have information flow convergence in the LLM decoding layer, and these image tokens receive higher attention scores. However, those image tokens that are less relevant to the text do not have information flow convergence, and they only get very small attention scores. To efficiently utilize the image information, we propose a new image token reduction method, Simignore, which aims to improve the complex reasoning ability of LVLMs by computing the similarity between image and text embeddings and ignoring image tokens that are irrelevant and unimportant to the text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for complex reasoning tasks.

ScaleOT: Privacy-utility-scalable Offsite-tuning with Dynamic LayerReplace and Selective Rank Compression,"Kai Yao, Zhaorui Tan, Tiandi Ye, Lichun Li, Yuan Zhao, Wenyan Liu, Wei Wang, Jianke Zhu","Offsite-tuning is a privacy-preserving method for tuning large language models (LLMs) by sharing a lossy compressed emulator from the LLM owners with data owners for downstream task tuning. This approach protects the privacy of both the model and data owners. However, current offsite tuning methods often suffer from adaptation degradation, high computational costs, and limited protection strength due to uniformly dropping LLM layers or relying on expensive knowledge distillation. To address these issues, we propose ScaleOT, a novel privacy-utility-scalable offsite-tuning framework that effectively balances privacy and utility. ScaleOT introduces a novel layerwise lossy compression algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to obtain the importance of each layer. It employs lightweight networks, termed harmonizers, to replace the raw LLM layers. By combining important original LLM layers and harmonizers in different ratios, ScaleOT generates emulators tailored for optimal performance with various model scales for enhanced privacy protection. Additionally, we present a rank reduction method to further compress the original LLM layers, significantly enhancing privacy with negligible impact on utility. Comprehensive experiments show that ScaleOT can achieve nearly lossless offsite tuning performance compared with full fine-tuning while obtaining better model privacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09812v1,2024-12
LLM Distillation for Efficient Few-Shot Multiple Choice Question Answering,"Patrick Sutanto, Joan Santoso, Esther Irawati Setiawan, Aji Prasetya Wibawa","Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is an important problem with numerous real-world applications, such as medicine, law, and education. The high cost of building MCQA datasets makes few-shot learning pivotal in this domain. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can enable few-shot learning, their direct application in real-world scenarios is often hindered by their high computational cost. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that uses LLMs for data generation and scoring. Our approach utilizes LLMs to create MCQA data which contains questions and choices, and to assign probability scores to the generated choices. We then use the generated data and LLM-assigned scores to finetune a smaller and more efficient encoder-only model, DeBERTa-v3-base by leveraging distillation loss. Extensive experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark demonstrate that our method improves accuracy from 28.9% to 39.3%, representing a gain of over 10% compared to a baseline finetuned directly on 5-shot examples. This shows the effectiveness of LLM-driven data generation and knowledge distillation for few-shot MCQA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09807v2,2024-12
AutoPatent: A Multi-Agent Framework for Automatic Patent Generation,"Qiyao Wang, Shiwen Ni, Huaren Liu, Shule Lu, Guhong Chen, Xi Feng, Chi Wei, Qiang Qu, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Yuan Lin, Min Yang","As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, the field of patent processing has garnered increased attention within the natural language processing community. However, the majority of research has been concentrated on classification tasks, such as patent categorization and examination, or on short text generation tasks like patent summarization and patent quizzes. In this paper, we introduce a novel and practical task known as Draft2Patent, along with its corresponding D2P benchmark, which challenges LLMs to generate full-length patents averaging 17K tokens based on initial drafts. Patents present a significant challenge to LLMs due to their specialized nature, standardized terminology, and extensive length. We propose a multi-agent framework called AutoPatent which leverages the LLM-based planner agent, writer agents, and examiner agent with PGTree and RRAG to generate lengthy, intricate, and high-quality complete patent documents. The experimental results demonstrate that our AutoPatent framework significantly enhances the ability to generate comprehensive patents across various LLMs. Furthermore, we have discovered that patents generated solely with the AutoPatent framework based on the Qwen2.5-7B model outperform those produced by larger and more powerful LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-72B, and LLAMA3.1-70B, in both objective metrics and human evaluations.

Semi-IIN: Semi-supervised Intra-inter modal Interaction Learning Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Jinhao Lin, Yifei Wang, Yanwu Xu, Qi Liu","Despite multimodal sentiment analysis being a fertile research ground that merits further investigation, current approaches take up high annotation cost and suffer from label ambiguity, non-amicable to high-quality labeled data acquisition. Furthermore, choosing the right interactions is essential because the significance of intra- or inter-modal interactions can differ among various samples. To this end, we propose Semi-IIN, a Semi-supervised Intra-inter modal Interaction learning Network for multimodal sentiment analysis. Semi-IIN integrates masked attention and gating mechanisms, enabling effective dynamic selection after independently capturing intra- and inter-modal interactive information. Combined with the self-training approach, Semi-IIN fully utilizes the knowledge learned from unlabeled data.

Model-diff: A Tool for Comparative Study of Language Models in the Input Space,"Weitang Liu, Yuelei Li, Ying Wai Li, Zihan Wang, Jingbo Shang","Comparing two (large) language models (LMs) side-by-side and pinpointing their prediction similarities and differences on the same set of inputs are crucial in many real-world scenarios, e.g., one can test if a licensed model was potentially plagiarized by another. Traditional analysis compares the LMs' outputs on some benchmark datasets, which only cover a limited number of inputs of designed perspectives for the intended applications. The benchmark datasets cannot prepare data to cover the test cases from unforeseen perspectives which can help us understand differences between models unbiasedly. In this paper, we propose a new model comparative analysis setting that considers a large input space where brute-force enumeration would be infeasible. The input space can be simply defined as all token sequences that a LM would produce low perplexity on -- we follow this definition in the paper as it would produce the most human-understandable inputs. We propose a novel framework \our that uses text generation by sampling and deweights the histogram of sampling statistics to estimate prediction differences between two LMs in this input space efficiently and unbiasedly. Our method achieves this by drawing and counting the inputs at each prediction difference value in negative log-likelihood. Experiments reveal for the first time the quantitative prediction differences between LMs in a large input space, potentially facilitating the model analysis for applications such as model plagiarism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12177v1,2024-12
Memory Layers at Scale,"Vincent-Pierre Berges, Barlas Oğuz, Daniel Haziza, Wen-tau Yih, Luke Zettlemoyer, Gargi Ghosh","Memory layers use a trainable key-value lookup mechanism to add extra parameters to a model without increasing FLOPs. Conceptually, sparsely activated memory layers complement compute-heavy dense feed-forward layers, providing dedicated capacity to store and retrieve information cheaply. This work takes memory layers beyond proof-of-concept, proving their utility at contemporary scale. On downstream tasks, language models augmented with our improved memory layer outperform dense models with more than twice the computation budget, as well as mixture-of-expert models when matched for both compute and parameters. We find gains are especially pronounced for factual tasks. We provide a fully parallelizable memory layer implementation, demonstrating scaling laws with up to 128B memory parameters, pretrained to 1 trillion tokens, comparing to base models with up to 8B parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09764v2,2024-12
Explore Theory of Mind: Program-guided adversarial data generation for theory of mind reasoning,"Melanie Sclar, Jane Yu, Maryam Fazel-Zarandi, Yulia Tsvetkov, Yonatan Bisk, Yejin Choi, Asli Celikyilmaz","Do large language models (LLMs) have theory of mind? A plethora of papers and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate if current models have been able to develop this key ability of social intelligence. However, all rely on limited datasets with simple patterns that can potentially lead to problematic blind spots in evaluation and an overestimation of model capabilities. We introduce ExploreToM, the first framework to allow large-scale generation of diverse and challenging theory of mind data for robust training and evaluation. Our approach leverages an A* search over a custom domain-specific language to produce complex story structures and novel, diverse, yet plausible scenarios to stress test the limits of LLMs. Our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-70B and GPT-4o, show accuracies as low as 0% and 9% on ExploreToM-generated data, highlighting the need for more robust theory of mind evaluation. As our generations are a conceptual superset of prior work, fine-tuning on our data yields a 27-point accuracy improvement on the classic ToMi benchmark (Le et al., 2019). ExploreToM also enables uncovering underlying skills and factors missing for models to show theory of mind, such as unreliable state tracking or data imbalances, which may contribute to models' poor performance on benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12175v1,2024-12
GReaTer: Gradients over Reasoning Makes Smaller Language Models Strong Prompt Optimizers,"Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Ryo Kamoi, Bo Pang, Yusen Zhang, Caiming Xiong, Rui Zhang","The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to the design of prompts, making prompt optimization essential for enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Many existing approaches to automating prompt engineering rely exclusively on textual feedback, refining prompts based solely on inference errors identified by large, computationally expensive LLMs. Unfortunately, smaller models struggle to generate high-quality feedback, resulting in complete dependence on large LLM judgment. Moreover, these methods fail to leverage more direct and finer-grained information, such as gradients, due to operating purely in text space. To this end, we introduce GReaTer, a novel prompt optimization technique that directly incorporates gradient information over task-specific reasoning. By utilizing task loss gradients, GReaTer enables self-optimization of prompts for open-source, lightweight language models without the need for costly closed-source LLMs. This allows high-performance prompt optimization without dependence on massive LLMs, closing the gap between smaller models and the sophisticated reasoning often needed for prompt refinement. Extensive evaluations across diverse reasoning tasks including BBH, GSM8k, and FOLIO demonstrate that GReaTer consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, even those reliant on powerful LLMs. Additionally, GReaTer-optimized prompts frequently exhibit better transferability and, in some cases, boost task performance to levels comparable to or surpassing those achieved by larger language models, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt optimization guided by gradients over reasoning.

Human vs. AI: A Novel Benchmark and a Comparative Study on the Detection of Generated Images and the Impact of Prompts,"Philipp Moeßner, Heike Adel","With the advent of publicly available AI-based text-to-image systems, the process of creating photorealistic but fully synthetic images has been largely democratized. This can pose a threat to the public through a simplified spread of disinformation. Machine detectors and human media expertise can help to differentiate between AI-generated (fake) and real images and counteract this danger. Although AI generation models are highly prompt-dependent, the impact of the prompt on the fake detection performance has rarely been investigated yet. This work therefore examines the influence of the prompt's level of detail on the detectability of fake images, both with an AI detector and in a user study. For this purpose, we create a novel dataset, COCOXGEN, which consists of real photos from the COCO dataset as well as images generated with SDXL and Fooocus using prompts of two standardized lengths. Our user study with 200 participants shows that images generated with longer, more detailed prompts are detected significantly more easily than those generated with short prompts. Similarly, an AI-based detection model achieves better performance on images generated with longer prompts. However, humans and AI models seem to pay attention to different details, as we show in a heat map analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09715v1,2024-12
Formal Languages and TQFTs with Defects,"Luisa Boateng, Matilde Marcolli","A construction that assigns a Boolean 1D TQFT with defects to a finite state automaton was recently developed by Gustafson, Im, Kaldawy, Khovanov, and Lihn. We show that the construction is functorial with respect to the category of finite state automata with transducers as morphisms. Certain classes of subregular languages correspond to additional cohomological structures on the associated TQFTs. We also show that the construction generalizes to context-free grammars through a categorical version of the Chomsky-Sch\""utzenberger representation theorem, due to Melli\`es and Zeilberger. The corresponding TQFTs are then described as morphisms of colored operads on an operad of cobordisms with defects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09688v1,2024-12
Context Canvas: Enhancing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Knowledge Graph-Based RAG,"Kavana Venkatesh, Yusuf Dalva, Ismini Lourentzou, Pinar Yanardag","We introduce a novel approach to enhance the capabilities of text-to-image models by incorporating a graph-based RAG. Our system dynamically retrieves detailed character information and relational data from the knowledge graph, enabling the generation of visually accurate and contextually rich images. This capability significantly improves upon the limitations of existing T2I models, which often struggle with the accurate depiction of complex or culturally specific subjects due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-correcting mechanism for text-to-image models to ensure consistency and fidelity in visual outputs, leveraging the rich context from the graph to guide corrections. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Context Canvas significantly enhances the capabilities of popular models such as Flux, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E, and improves the functionality of ControlNet for fine-grained image editing tasks. To our knowledge, Context Canvas represents the first application of graph-based RAG in enhancing T2I models, representing a significant advancement for producing high-fidelity, context-aware multi-faceted images.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09614v1,2024-12

AgentTrek: Agent Trajectory Synthesis via Guiding Replay with Web Tutorials,"Yiheng Xu, Dunjie Lu, Zhennan Shen, Junli Wang, Zekun Wang, Yuchen Mao, Caiming Xiong, Tao Yu","Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents hold great potential for automating complex tasks across diverse digital environments, from web applications to desktop software. However, the development of such agents is hindered by the lack of high-quality, multi-step trajectory data required for effective training. Existing approaches rely on expensive and labor-intensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. To address this challenge, we propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality GUI agent trajectories by leveraging web tutorials. Our method automatically gathers tutorial-like texts from the internet, transforms them into task goals with step-by-step instructions, and employs a visual-language model agent to simulate their execution in a real digital environment. A VLM-based evaluator ensures the correctness of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with these synthesized trajectories significantly improves their grounding and planning performance over the current models.

TimeRefine: Temporal Grounding with Time Refining Video LLM,"Xizi Wang, Feng Cheng, Ziyang Wang, Huiyu Wang, Md Mohaiminul Islam, Lorenzo Torresani, Mohit Bansal, Gedas Bertasius, David Crandall","Video temporal grounding aims to localize relevant temporal boundaries in a video given a textual prompt. Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to perform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal timestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains challenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction. Our proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of directly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal grounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough predictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment. This refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model progressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to enhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an auxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment deviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make closer and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be integrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on the ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively.

Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in open-world understanding. However, the challenge of continuous and simultaneous streaming perception, memory, and reasoning remains largely unexplored. Current MLLMs are constrained by their sequence-to-sequence architecture, which limits their ability to process inputs and generate responses simultaneously, akin to being unable to think while perceiving. Furthermore, relying on long contexts to store historical data is impractical for long-term interactions, as retaining all information becomes costly and inefficient. Therefore, rather than relying on a single foundation model to perform all functions, this project draws inspiration from the concept of the Specialized Generalist AI and introduces disentangled streaming perception, reasoning, and memory mechanisms, enabling real-time interaction with streaming video and audio input. The proposed framework InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive (IXC2.5-OL) consists of three key modules: (1) Streaming Perception Module: Processes multimodal information in real-time, storing key details in memory and triggering reasoning in response to user queries. (2) Multi-modal Long Memory Module: Integrates short-term and long-term memory, compressing short-term memories into long-term ones for efficient retrieval and improved accuracy. (3) Reasoning Module: Responds to queries and executes reasoning tasks, coordinating with the perception and memory modules.

DISHONEST: Dissecting misInformation Spread using Homogeneous sOcial NEtworks and Semantic Topic classification,"Caleb Stam, Emily Saldanha, Mahantesh Halappanavar, Anurag Acharya","The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant rise in the spread of misinformation on online platforms such as Twitter. Oftentimes this growth is blamed on the idea of the ""echo chamber."" However, the behavior said to characterize these echo chambers exists in two dimensions. The first is in a user's social interactions, where they are said to stick with the same clique of like-minded users. The second is in the content of their posts, where they are said to repeatedly espouse homogeneous ideas. In this study, we link the two by using Twitter's network of retweets to study social interactions and topic modeling to study tweet content. In order to measure the diversity of a user's interactions over time, we develop a novel metric to track the speed at which they travel through the social network. The application of these analysis methods to misinformation-focused data from the pandemic demonstrates correlation between social behavior and tweet content. We believe this correlation supports the common intuition about how antisocial users behave, and further suggests that it holds even in subcommunities already rife with misinformation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09578v1,2024-12
DiverseAgentEntropy: Quantifying Black-Box LLM Uncertainty through Diverse Perspectives and Multi-Agent Interaction,"Yu Feng, Phu Mon Htut, Zheng Qi, Wei Xiao, Manuel Mager, Nikolaos Pappas, Kishaloy Halder, Yang Li, Yassine Benajiba, Dan Roth","Quantifying the uncertainty in the factual parametric knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in a black-box setting, poses a significant challenge. Existing methods, which gauge a model's uncertainty through evaluating self-consistency in responses to the original query, do not always capture true uncertainty. Models might respond consistently to the origin query with a wrong answer, yet respond correctly to varied questions from different perspectives about the same query, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, DiverseAgentEntropy, for evaluating a model's uncertainty using multi-agent interaction under the assumption that if a model is certain, it should consistently recall the answer to the original query across a diverse collection of questions about the same original query. We further implement an abstention policy to withhold responses when uncertainty is high.

Additionally, it demonstrates that existing models often fail to consistently retrieve the correct answer to the same query under diverse varied questions even when knowing the correct answer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09572v1,2024-12
JuStRank: Benchmarking LLM Judges for System Ranking,"Ariel Gera, Odellia Boni, Yotam Perlitz, Roy Bar-Haim, Lilach Eden, Asaf Yehudai","Given the rapid progress of generative AI, there is a pressing need to systematically compare and choose between the numerous models and configurations available. The scale and versatility of such evaluations make the use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge. Crucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM judge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based ranking. Beyond overall judge assessment, our analysis provides a fine-grained characterization of judge behavior, including their decisiveness and bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09569v1,2024-12
Does Representation Matter? Exploring Intermediate Layers in Large Language Models,"Oscar Skean, Md Rifat Arefin, Yann LeCun, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv","Understanding what defines a good representation in large language models (LLMs) is fundamental to both theoretical understanding and practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the quality of intermediate representations in various LLM architectures, including Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs). We find that intermediate layers often yield more informative representations for downstream tasks than the final layers. To measure the representation quality, we adapt and apply a suite of metrics - such as prompt entropy, curvature, and augmentation-invariance - originally proposed in other contexts. Our empirical study reveals significant architectural differences, how representations evolve throughout training, and how factors like input randomness and prompt length affect each layer. Notably, we observe a bimodal pattern in the entropy of some intermediate layers and consider potential explanations tied to training data. Overall, our results illuminate the internal mechanics of LLMs and guide strategies for architectural optimization and training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09563v1,2024-12
Foundational Large Language Models for Materials Research,"Vaibhav Mishra, Somaditya Singh, Dhruv Ahlawat, Mohd Zaki, Vaibhav Bihani, Hargun Singh Grover, Biswajit Mishra, Santiago Miret, Mausam, N. M. Anoop Krishnan","Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09560v1,2024-12
MGM: Global Understanding of Audience Overlap Graphs for Predicting the Factuality and the Bias of News Media,"Muhammad Arslan Manzoor, Ruihong Zeng, Dilshod Azizov, Preslav Nakov, Shangsong Liang","In the current era of rapidly growing digital data, evaluating the political bias and factuality of news outlets has become more important for seeking reliable information online. In this work, we study the classification problem of profiling news media from the lens of political bias and factuality. Traditional profiling methods, such as Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results, but they face notable challenges. PLMs focus solely on textual features, causing them to overlook the complex relationships between entities, while GNNs often struggle with media graphs containing disconnected components and insufficient labels. To address these limitations, we propose MediaGraphMind (MGM), an effective solution within a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. Instead of relying on limited neighboring nodes, MGM leverages features, structural patterns, and label information from globally similar nodes. Such a framework not only enables GNNs to capture long-range dependencies for learning expressive node representations but also enhances PLMs by integrating structural information and therefore improving the performance of both models. The extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and achieve new state-of-the-art results. Further, we share our repository1 which contains the dataset, code, and documentation",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10467v1,2024-12
"Systematic Analysis of LLM Contributions to Planning: Solver, Verifier, Heuristic","Haoming Li, Zhaoliang Chen, Songyuan Liu, Yiming Lu, Fei Liu","In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of how large language models (LLMs) contribute to solving planning problems. In particular, we examine how LLMs perform when they are used as problem solver, solution verifier, and heuristic guidance to improve intermediate solutions. Our analysis reveals that although it is difficult for LLMs to generate correct plans out-of-the-box, LLMs are much better at providing feedback signals to intermediate/incomplete solutions in the form of comparative heuristic functions. This evaluation framework provides insights into how future work may design better LLM-based tree-search algorithms to solve diverse planning and reasoning problems. We also propose a novel benchmark to evaluate LLM's ability to learn user preferences on the fly, which has wide applications in practical settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09666v1,2024-12
Dipper: Diversity in Prompts for Producing Large Language Model Ensembles in Reasoning tasks,"Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, Wenyang Hu, Diwen Liu, Jizhuo Chen, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","Large Language Models still encounter substantial challenges in reasoning tasks, especially for smaller models, which many users may be restricted to due to resource constraints (e.g. GPU memory restrictions). Inference-time methods to boost LLM performance, such as prompting methods to invoke certain reasoning pathways in responses, have been shown effective in past works, though they largely rely on sequential queries. The ensemble method, which consists of multiple constituent models running in parallel, is a promising approach to achieving better inference-time performance, especially given recent developments that enabled significant speed-ups in LLM batch inference. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free LLM ensemble framework where a single LLM model is fed an optimized, diverse set of prompts in parallel, effectively producing an ensemble at inference time to achieve performance improvement in reasoning tasks. We empirically demonstrate that our method leads to significant gains on math reasoning tasks, e.g., on MATH, where our ensemble consisting of a few small models (e.g., three Qwen2-MATH-1.5B-it models) can outperform a larger model (e.g., Qwen2-MATH-7B-it).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15238v1,2024-12
Audios Don't Lie: Multi-Frequency Channel Attention Mechanism for Audio Deepfake Detection,Yangguang Feng,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, the application of deepfake technology in the audio field has gradually increased, resulting in a wide range of security risks. Especially in the financial and social security fields, the misuse of deepfake audios has raised serious concerns. To address this challenge, this study proposes an audio deepfake detection method based on multi-frequency channel attention mechanism (MFCA) and 2D discrete cosine transform (DCT). By processing the audio signal into a melspectrogram, using MobileNet V2 to extract deep features, and combining it with the MFCA module to weight different frequency channels in the audio signal, this method can effectively capture the fine-grained frequency domain features in the audio signal and enhance the Classification capability of fake audios. Experimental results show that compared with traditional methods, the model proposed in this study shows significant advantages in accuracy, precision,recall, F1 score and other indicators. Especially in complex audio scenarios, this method shows stronger robustness and generalization capabilities and provides a new idea for audio deepfake detection and has important practical application value. In the future, more advanced audio detection technologies and optimization strategies will be explored to further improve the accuracy and generalization capabilities of audio deepfake detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09467v1,2024-12

Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments.

Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles, which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor responses grounded in student mistakes or confusion in the mathematical domain. We release MRBench -- a new evaluation benchmark containing 192 conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 LLM as an evaluator and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering systems.

Despite its active development, Luxembourgish faces a digital data scarcity, exacerbated by Luxembourg's multilingual context. We propose a novel text generation model based on the T5 architecture, combining limited Luxembourgish data with equal amounts, in terms of size and type, of German and French data. We hypothesise that a model trained on Luxembourgish, German, and French will improve the model's cross-lingual transfer learning capabilities and outperform monolingual and large multilingual models. To verify this, the study at hand explores whether multilingual or monolingual training is more beneficial for Luxembourgish language generation.

These systems typically engage in an extended thinking process before responding to a query, allowing them to generate more thorough, accurate, and well-reasoned solutions. These systems are primarily developed and maintained by industry, with their core techniques not publicly disclosed. In response, an increasing number of studies from the research community aim to explore the technical foundations underlying these powerful reasoning systems. Building on these prior efforts, this paper presents a reproduction report on implementing o1-like reasoning systems. We introduce an ``imitate, explore, and self-improve'' framework, denoted as \textbf{STILL-2}, as our primary technical approach to train the reasoning model. In the initial phase, we use distilled long-form thought data to fine-tune the reasoning model, enabling it to invoke a slow-thinking mode. The model is then encouraged to explore challenging problems by generating multiple rollouts, which can result in increasingly more high-quality trajectories that lead to correct answers. Furthermore, the model undergoes self-improvement by iteratively refining its training dataset. To verify the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks.

A NotSo Simple Way to Beat Simple Bench,"Soham Sane, Angus McLean","This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging iterative reasoning and feedback-driven methodologies. Building on the limitations identified in the SimpleBench benchmark, a dataset designed to evaluate logical coherence and real-world reasoning, we propose a multi-step prompting strategy coupled with global consistency checks to improve model accuracy and robustness. Through comparative analysis of state-of-the-art models, including Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5, GPT- 4o, and o1-preview, we demonstrate that iterative reasoning significantly enhances model performance, with improvements observed in both standard accuracy metrics (AVG@5) and a newly introduced metric, Extreme Averaging (EAG@5). Our results reveal model-specific strengths: Claude excels in maintaining logical consistency, while GPT-4o exhibits exploratory creativity but struggles with ambiguous prompts. By analyzing case studies and identifying gaps in spatial and temporal reasoning, we highlight areas for further refinement. The findings underscore the potential of structured reasoning frameworks to address inherent model limitations, irrespective of pretraining methodologies. This study lays the groundwork for integrating dynamic feedback mechanisms, adaptive restart strategies, and diverse evaluation metrics to advance LLM reasoning capabilities across complex and multi-domain problem spaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12173v1,2024-12

Word Sense Linking: Disambiguating Outside the Sandbox,"Andrei Stefan Bejgu, Edoardo Barba, Luigi Procopio, Alberte Fernández-Castro, Roberto Navigli","Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the task of associating a word in a given context with its most suitable meaning among a set of possible candidates. While the task has recently witnessed renewed interest, with systems achieving performances above the estimated inter-annotator agreement, at the time of writing it still struggles to find downstream applications. We argue that one of the reasons behind this is the difficulty of applying WSD to plain text. Indeed, in the standard formulation, models work under the assumptions that a) all the spans to disambiguate have already been identified, and b) all the possible candidate senses of each span are provided, both of which are requirements that are far from trivial. In this work, we present a new task called Word Sense Linking (WSL) where, given an input text and a reference sense inventory, systems have to both identify which spans to disambiguate and then link them to their most suitable meaning.We put forward a transformer-based architecture for the task and thoroughly evaluate both its performance and those of state-of-the-art WSD systems scaled to WSL, iteratively relaxing the assumptions of WSD. We hope that our work will foster easier integration of lexical semantics into downstream applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09370v1,2024-12
Falcon-UI: Understanding GUI Before Following User Instructions,"Huawen Shen, Chang Liu, Gengluo Li, Xinlong Wang, Yu Zhou, Can Ma, Xiangyang Ji","Pursuing human-like interaction for Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents requires understanding the GUI context and following user instructions. However, existing works typically couple these two aspects and focus more on instruct-following abilities, while ignoring the importance of understanding the GUI context. In this paper, we introduce an instruction-free GUI navigation dataset, termed Insight-UI Dataset, to enhance model comprehension of GUI environments. Insight-UI Dataset is automatically generated from the Common Crawl corpus, simulating various platforms -- including iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux -- across multiple resolutions on 312K domains. Although GUI interactions vary by context, diverse interfaces share common internal patterns, such as clicking an item to view its details. It implies the feasibility of independent GUI operation learning, followed by joint optimization with instruction tuning. Thereby, we develop the GUI agent model Falcon-UI, which is initially pretrained on Insight-UI Dataset and subsequently fine-tuned on Android and Web GUI datasets, including AITW, AITZ, Android Control, and Mind2Web. With 7 billion parameters, Falcon-UI achieves accuracy comparable to the 72 billion-parameter Qwen2VL on AITZ, validating the alignment between GUI context comprehension and agent performance.

Causal Graphical Models for Vision-Language Compositional Understanding,"Fiorenzo Parascandolo, Nicholas Moratelli, Enver Sangineto, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara","Recent work has empirically shown that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to fully understand the compositional properties of the human language, usually modeling an image caption as a ""bag of words"". As a result, they perform poorly on compositional tasks, which require a deeper understanding of the different entities of a sentence (subject, verb, etc.) jointly with their mutual relationships in order to be solved. In this paper, we model the dependency relations among textual and visual tokens using a Causal Graphical Model (CGM), built using a dependency parser, and we train a decoder conditioned by the VLM visual encoder. Differently from standard autoregressive or parallel predictions, our decoder's generative process is partially-ordered following the CGM structure. This structure encourages the decoder to learn only the main causal dependencies in a sentence discarding spurious correlations. Using extensive experiments on five compositional benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art compositional approaches by a large margin, and it also improves over methods trained using much larger datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09353v1,2024-12

CRVQ: Channel-relaxed Vector Quantization for Extreme Compression of LLMs,"Yuzhuang Xu, Shiyu Ji, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che","Powerful large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to be deployed with lower computational costs, enabling their capabilities on resource-constrained devices. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a star approach to achieve this ambition, with best methods compressing weights to less than 2 bit on average. In this paper, we propose Channel-Relaxed Vector Quantization (CRVQ), a novel technique that significantly improves the performance of PTQ baselines at the cost of only minimal additional bits. This state-of-the-art extreme compression method achieves its results through two key innovations: (1) carefully selecting and reordering a very small subset of critical weight channels, and (2) leveraging multiple codebooks to relax the constraint of critical channels. With our method, we demonstrate a 38.9% improvement over the current strongest sub-2-bit PTQ baseline, enabling nearer lossless 1-bit compression.

We find that the math problems to be challenging for LLMs, when involving complex domain-specific rules and knowledge documents, rather than simple formulations of terminologies. Therefore, we propose a pipeline to solve the domain-specific calculation problems with Knowledge-Intensive Programs Generator more effectively, named as KIPG. It generates knowledge-intensive programs according to the domain-specific documents. For each query, key variables are extracted, then outcomes which are dependent on domain knowledge are calculated with the programs. By iterative preference alignment, the code generator learns to improve the logic consistency with the domain knowledge.

The approach is evaluated in both cross-domain (irony detection) and cross-lingual (English) settings. Results show that the debiasing method enhances the robustness and generalizability of the models for satire and irony detection tasks in Turkish and English.

ReFF: Reinforcing Format Faithfulness in Language Models across Varied Tasks,"Jiashu Yao, Heyan Huang, Zeming Liu, Haoyu Wen, Wei Su, Boao Qian, Yuhang Guo","Following formatting instructions to generate well-structured content is a fundamental yet often unmet capability for large language models (LLMs). To study this capability, which we refer to as format faithfulness, we present FormatBench, a comprehensive format-related benchmark. Compared to previous format-related benchmarks, FormatBench involves a greater variety of tasks in terms of application scenes (traditional NLP tasks, creative works, autonomous agency tasks), human-LLM interaction styles (single-turn instruction, multi-turn chat), and format types (inclusion, wrapping, length, coding). Moreover, each task in FormatBench is attached with a format checker program. Extensive experiments on the benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LLMs still suffer from severe deficiency in format faithfulness. By virtue of the decidable nature of formats, we propose to Reinforce Format Faithfulness (ReFF) to help LLMs generate formatted output as instructed without compromising general quality. Without any annotated data, ReFF can substantially improve the format faithfulness rate (e.g., from 21.6% in original LLaMA3 to 95.0% on caption segmentation task), while keep the general quality comparable (e.g., from 47.3 to 46.4 in F1 scores). Combined with labeled training data, ReFF can simultaneously improve both format faithfulness (e.g., from 21.6% in original LLaMA3 to 75.5%) and general quality (e.g., from 47.3 to 61.6 in F1 scores). We further offer an interpretability analysis to explain how ReFF improves both format faithfulness and general quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09173v1,2024-12
When Text Embedding Meets Large Language Model: A Comprehensive Survey,"Zhijie Nie, Zhangchi Feng, Mingxin Li, Cunwang Zhang, Yanzhao Zhang, Dingkun Long, Richong Zhang","Text embedding has become a foundational technology in natural language processing (NLP) during the deep learning era, driving advancements across a wide array of downstream tasks. While many natural language understanding challenges can now be modeled using generative paradigms and leverage the robust generative and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerous practical applications, such as semantic matching, clustering, and information retrieval, continue to rely on text embeddings for their efficiency and effectiveness. In this survey, we categorize the interplay between LLMs and text embeddings into three overarching themes: (1) LLM-augmented text embedding, enhancing traditional embedding methods with LLMs; (2) LLMs as text embedders, utilizing their innate capabilities for embedding generation; and (3) Text embedding understanding with LLMs, leveraging LLMs to analyze and interpret embeddings. By organizing these efforts based on interaction patterns rather than specific downstream applications, we offer a novel and systematic overview of contributions from various research and application domains in the era of LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight the unresolved challenges that persisted in the pre-LLM era with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and explore the emerging obstacles brought forth by LLMs. Building on this analysis, we outline prospective directions for the evolution of text embedding, addressing both theoretical and practical opportunities in the rapidly advancing landscape of NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09165v1,2024-12
PolyIPA -- Multilingual Phoneme-to-Grapheme Conversion Model,Davor Lauc,"This paper presents PolyIPA, a novel multilingual phoneme-to-grapheme conversion model designed for multilingual name transliteration, onomastic research, and information retrieval. The model leverages two helper models developed for data augmentation: IPA2vec for finding soundalikes across languages, and similarIPA for handling phonetic notation variations. Evaluated on a test set that spans multiple languages and writing systems, the model achieves a mean Character Error Rate of 0.055 and a character-level BLEU score of 0.914, with particularly strong performance on languages with shallow orthographies. The implementation of beam search further improves practical utility, with top-3 candidates reducing the effective error rate by 52.7\% (to CER: 0.026), demonstrating the model's effectiveness for cross-linguistic applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09102v1,2024-12
Filter-then-Generate: Large Language Models with Structure-Text Adapter for Knowledge Graph Completion,"Ben Liu, Jihai Zhang, Fangquan Lin, Cheng Yang, Min Peng","Large Language Models (LLMs) present massive inherent knowledge and superior semantic comprehension capability, which have revolutionized various tasks in natural language processing. Despite their success, a critical gap remains in enabling LLMs to perform knowledge graph completion (KGC). Empirical evidence suggests that LLMs consistently perform worse than conventional KGC approaches, even through sophisticated prompt design or tailored instruction-tuning. Fundamentally, applying LLMs on KGC introduces several critical challenges, including a vast set of entity candidates, hallucination issue of LLMs, and under-exploitation of the graph structure. To address these challenges, we propose a novel instruction-tuning-based method, namely FtG. Specifically, we present a \textit{filter-then-generate} paradigm and formulate the KGC task into a multiple-choice question format. In this way, we can harness the capability of LLMs while mitigating the issue casused by hallucinations. Moreover, we devise a flexible ego-graph serialization prompt and employ a structure-text adapter to couple structure and text information in a contextualized manner. Experimental results demonstrate that FtG achieves substantial performance gain compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The instruction dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/LB0828/FtG}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09094v2,2024-12
Evaluating Pixel Language Models on Non-Standardized Languages,"Alberto Muñoz-Ortiz, Verena Blaschke, Barbara Plank","We explore the potential of pixel-based models for transfer learning from standard languages to dialects. These models convert text into images that are divided into patches, enabling a continuous vocabulary representation that proves especially useful for out-of-vocabulary words common in dialectal data. Using German as a case study, we compare the performance of pixel-based models to token-based models across various syntactic and semantic tasks. Our results show that pixel-based models outperform token-based models in part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and intent detection for zero-shot dialect evaluation by up to 26 percentage points in some scenarios, though not in Standard German. However, pixel-based models fall short in topic classification. These findings emphasize the potential of pixel-based models for handling dialectal data, though further research should be conducted to assess their effectiveness in various linguistic contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09084v1,2024-12
Forest-of-Thought: Scaling Test-Time Compute for Enhancing LLM Reasoning,"Zhenni Bi, Kai Han, Chuanjian Liu, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities across various language tasks, but solving complex reasoning problems remains a challenge. While existing methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) enhance reasoning by decomposing problems or structuring prompts, they typically perform a single pass of reasoning and may fail to revisit flawed paths, compromising accuracy. To address this, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Forest-of-Thought (FoT), which integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making for solving complex logical problems. FoT utilizes sparse activation strategies to select the most relevant reasoning paths, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic self-correction strategy that enables real-time error correction and learning from past mistakes, as well as consensus-guided decision making strategies to optimize correctness and computational resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the FoT framework, combined with these strategies, significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to solve complex tasks with greater precision and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09078v1,2024-12
Dial-In LLM: Human-Aligned Dialogue Intent Clustering with LLM-in-the-loop,"Mengze Hong, Yuanfeng Song, Di Jiang, Wailing Ng, Yanjie Sun, Chen Jason Zhang","The discovery of customer intention from dialogue plays an important role in automated support system. However, traditional text clustering methods are poorly aligned with human perceptions due to the shift from embedding distance to semantic distance, and existing quantitative metrics for text clustering may not accurately reflect the true quality of intent clusters. In this paper, we leverage the superior language understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for designing better-calibrated intent clustering algorithms. We first establish the foundation by verifying the robustness of fine-tuned LLM utility in semantic coherence evaluation and cluster naming, resulting in an accuracy of 97.50% and 94.40%, respectively, when compared to the human-labeled ground truth. Then, we propose an iterative clustering algorithm that facilitates cluster-level refinement and the continuous discovery of high-quality intent clusters. Furthermore, we present several LLM-in-the-loop semi-supervised clustering techniques tailored for intent discovery from customer service dialogue. Experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset comprising 1,507 intent clusters demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The methods outperformed existing counterparts, achieving 6.25% improvement in quantitative metrics and 12% enhancement in application-level performance when constructing an intent classifier.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09049v1,2024-12
Multi-Task Learning with LLMs for Implicit Sentiment Analysis: Data-level and Task-level Automatic Weight Learning,"Wenna Lai, Haoran Xie, Guandong Xu, Qing Li","Implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) presents significant challenges due to the absence of salient cue words. Previous methods have struggled with insufficient data and limited reasoning capabilities to infer underlying opinions. Integrating multi-task learning (MTL) with large language models (LLMs) offers the potential to enable models of varying sizes to reliably perceive and recognize genuine opinions in ISA. However, existing MTL approaches are constrained by two sources of uncertainty: data-level uncertainty, arising from hallucination problems in LLM-generated contextual information, and task-level uncertainty, stemming from the varying capacities of models to process contextual information. To handle these uncertainties, we introduce MT-ISA, a novel MTL framework that enhances ISA by leveraging the generation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs through automatic MTL. Specifically, MT-ISA constructs auxiliary tasks using generative LLMs to supplement sentiment elements and incorporates automatic MTL to fully exploit auxiliary data. We introduce data-level and task-level automatic weight learning (AWL), which dynamically identifies relationships and prioritizes more reliable data and critical tasks, enabling models of varying sizes to adaptively learn fine-grained weights based on their reasoning capabilities. We investigate three strategies for data-level AWL, while also introducing homoscedastic uncertainty for task-level AWL. Extensive experiments reveal that models of varying sizes achieve an optimal balance between primary prediction and auxiliary tasks in MT-ISA. This underscores the effectiveness and adaptability of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09046v1,2024-12
Mining Word Boundaries from Speech-Text Parallel Data for Cross-domain Chinese Word Segmentation,"Xuebin Wang, Lei Zhang, Zhenghua Li, Shilin Zhou, Chen Gong, Yang Hou","Inspired by early research on exploring naturally annotated data for Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS), and also by recent research on integration of speech and text processing, this work for the first time proposes to explicitly mine word boundaries from speech-text parallel data. We employ the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) toolkit to perform character-level alignment on speech-text data, giving pauses as candidate word boundaries. Based on detailed analysis of collected pauses, we propose an effective probability-based strategy for filtering unreliable word boundaries. To more effectively utilize word boundaries as extra training data, we also propose a robust complete-then-train (CTT) strategy. We conduct cross-domain CWS experiments on two target domains, i.e., ZX and AISHELL2. We have annotated about 1,000 sentences as the evaluation data of AISHELL2. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09045v1,2024-12
ZigZagkv: Dynamic KV Cache Compression for Long-context Modeling based on Layer Uncertainty,"Meizhi Zhong, Xikai Liu, Chen Zhang, Yikun Lei, Yan Gao, Yao Hu, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang","Large Language models (LLMs) have become a research hotspot. To accelerate the inference of LLMs, storing computed caches in memory has become the standard technique. However, as the inference length increases, growing KV caches might lead to out-of-memory issues. Many existing methods address this issue through KV cache compression, primarily by preserving key tokens throughout all layers to reduce information loss. Most of them allocate a uniform budget size for each layer to retain. However, we observe that the minimum budget sizes needed to retain essential information vary across layers and models based on the perspectives of attention and hidden state output. Building on this observation, this paper proposes a simple yet effective KV cache compression method that leverages layer uncertainty to allocate budget size for each layer. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce memory usage of the KV caches to only $\sim$20\% when compared to Full KV inference while achieving nearly lossless performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09036v1,2024-12

In this study, drawing inspiration from the success of large-scale pre-training, we introduce PPDS, an open-domain persona dialogue system that employs extensive generative pre-training on a persona dialogue dataset to enhance persona consistency. Specifically, we present a persona extraction model designed to autonomously and precisely generate vast persona dialogue datasets. Additionally, we unveil a pioneering persona augmentation technique to address the invalid persona bias inherent in the constructed dataset. Both quantitative and human evaluations consistently highlight the superior response quality and persona consistency of our proposed model, underscoring its effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09034v1,2024-12
Shiksha: A Technical Domain focused Translation Dataset and Model for Indian Languages,"Advait Joglekar, Srinivasan Umesh","Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models are typically trained on datasets with limited exposure to Scientific, Technical and Educational domains. Translation models thus, in general, struggle with tasks that involve scientific understanding or technical jargon. Their performance is found to be even worse for low-resource Indian languages. Finding a translation dataset that tends to these domains in particular, poses a difficult challenge. In this paper, we address this by creating a multilingual parallel corpus containing more than 2.8 million rows of English-to-Indic and Indic-to-Indic high-quality translation pairs across 8 Indian languages. We achieve this by bitext mining human-translated transcriptions of NPTEL video lectures. We also finetune and evaluate NMT models using this corpus and surpass all other publicly available models at in-domain tasks. We also demonstrate the potential for generalizing to out-of-domain translation tasks by improving the baseline by over 2 BLEU on average for these Indian languages on the Flores+ benchmark.

Improvement in Sign Language Translation Using Text CTC Alignment,"Sihan Tan, Taro Miyazaki, Nabeela Khan, Kazuhiro Nakadai","Current sign language translation (SLT) approaches often rely on gloss-based supervision with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), limiting their ability to handle non-monotonic alignments between sign language video and spoken text. In this work, we propose a novel method combining joint CTC/Attention and transfer learning. The joint CTC/Attention introduces hierarchical encoding and integrates CTC with the attention mechanism during decoding, effectively managing both monotonic and non-monotonic alignments. Meanwhile, transfer learning helps bridge the modality gap between vision and language in SLT. Experimental results on two widely adopted benchmarks, RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 T and CSL-Daily, show that our method achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art and outperforms the pure-attention baseline. Additionally, this work opens a new door for future research into gloss-free SLT using text-based CTC alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09014v4,2024-12
What Makes Cryptic Crosswords Challenging for LLMs?,"Abdelrahman Sadallah, Daria Kotova, Ekaterina Kochmar","Cryptic crosswords are puzzles that rely on general knowledge and the solver's ability to manipulate language on different levels, dealing with various types of wordplay. Previous research suggests that solving such puzzles is challenging even for modern NLP models, including Large Language Models (LLMs). However, there is little to no research on the reasons for their poor performance on this task. In this paper, we establish the benchmark results for three popular LLMs: Gemma2, LLaMA3 and ChatGPT, showing that their performance on this task is still significantly below that of humans. We also investigate why these models struggle to achieve superior performance.

The analysis focuses on the utilization of NLP for adverse media screening, a vital aspect of compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and combating financial terrorism (CFT) regulations. Additionally, it investigates the overall reception and obstacles related to the integration of AI in Bangladeshi banks. This report measures the effectiveness of NLP is promising with an accuracy around 94\%. NLP algorithms display substantial promise in accurately identifying adverse media content linked to financial crimes. The lack of progress in this aspect is visible in Bangladesh, whereas globally the technology is already being used to increase effectiveness and efficiency. Hence, it is clear there is an issue with the acceptance of AI in Bangladesh. Some AML \& CFT concerns are already being addressed by AI technology.

Assessing the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems in K-12 Educational Question Answering with Knowledge Discrepancies,"Tianshi Zheng, Weihan Li, Jiaxin Bai, Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have demonstrated remarkable potential as question answering systems in the K-12 Education domain, where knowledge is typically queried within the restricted scope of authoritative textbooks. However, the discrepancy between textbooks and the parametric knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) could undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate the robustness of RAG systems under such knowledge discrepancies, we present EduKDQA, a question answering dataset that simulates knowledge discrepancies in real applications by applying hypothetical knowledge updates in answers and source documents. EduKDQA includes 3,005 questions covering five subjects, under a comprehensive question typology from the perspective of context utilization and knowledge integration. We conducted extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance. We find that most RAG systems suffer from a substantial performance drop in question answering with knowledge discrepancies, while questions that require integration of contextual knowledge and parametric knowledge pose a challenge to LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08985v1,2024-12
RuleArena: A Benchmark for Rule-Guided Reasoning with LLMs in Real-World Scenarios,"Ruiwen Zhou, Wenyue Hua, Liangming Pan, Sitao Cheng, Xiaobao Wu, En Yu, William Yang Wang","This paper introduces RuleArena, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow complex, real-world rules in reasoning. Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. These results highlight significant challenges in advancing LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities in real-life applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08972v1,2024-12
Reasoning-Aware Query-Focused Summarization over Multi-Table Data,"Xiaochuan Lin, Xiangyong Chen","Query-focused summarization over multi-table data is a challenging yet critical task for extracting precise and relevant information from structured data.

Our method eliminates the need for intermediate serialization steps and directly generates query-relevant summaries. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that QueryTableSummarizer++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of BLEU, ROUGE, and F1-score. Additional analyses highlight its scalability, generalization across domains, and robust handling of complex queries. Human evaluation further validates the superior quality and practical applicability of the generated summaries, establishing QueryTableSummarizer++ as a highly effective solution for multi-table summarization tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08970v1,2024-12
"Align, Generate, Learn: A Novel Closed-Loop Framework for Cross-Lingual In-Context Learning","Mateo Alejandro Rojas, Rafael Carranza","Cross-lingual in-context learning (XICL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for leveraging large language models (LLMs) to tackle multilingual tasks, especially for low-resource languages.

In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework that harnesses the generative capabilities of LLMs to internally select and utilize task-relevant examples. Our method introduces two key objectives: a retrieval-generation alignment loss to optimize the quality of selected examples and a semantic coherence loss to ensure cross-lingual consistency. Through extensive experiments on multilingual benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Further analysis highlights its robustness across diverse language families and its ability to generalize to unseen tasks.

CareBot: A Pioneering Full-Process Open-Source Medical Language Model,"Lulu Zhao, Weihao Zeng, Xiaofeng Shi, Hua Zhou","Recently, both closed-source LLMs and open-source communities have made significant strides, outperforming humans in various general domains. However, their performance in specific professional domains such as medicine, especially within the open-source community, remains suboptimal due to the complexity of medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose CareBot, a bilingual medical LLM, which leverages a comprehensive approach integrating continuous pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). Our novel two-stage CPT method, comprising Stable CPT and Boost CPT, effectively bridges the gap between general and domain-specific data, facilitating a smooth transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and enhancing domain knowledge progressively. We also introduce DataRater, a model designed to assess data quality during CPT, ensuring that the training data is both accurate and relevant. For SFT, we develope a large and diverse bilingual dataset, along with ConFilter, a metric to enhance multi-turn dialogue quality, which is crucial to improving the model's ability to handle more complex dialogues. The combination of high-quality data sources and innovative techniques significantly improves CareBot's performance across a range of medical applications. Our rigorous evaluations on Chinese and English benchmarks confirm CareBot's effectiveness in medical consultation and education.

MoSLD: An Extremely Parameter-Efficient Mixture-of-Shared LoRAs for Multi-Task Learning,"Lulu Zhao, Weihao Zeng, Xiaofeng Shi, Hua Zhou","Recently, LoRA has emerged as a crucial technique for fine-tuning large pre-trained models, yet its performance in multi-task learning scenarios often falls short. In contrast, the MoE architecture presents a natural solution to this issue. However, it introduces challenges such as mutual interference of data across multiple domains and knowledge forgetting of various tasks. Additionally, MoE significantly increases the number of parameters, posing a computational cost challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MoSLD, a mixture-of-shared-LoRAs model with a dropout strategy. MoSLD addresses these challenges by sharing the upper projection matrix in LoRA among different experts, encouraging the model to learn general knowledge across tasks, while still allowing the lower projection matrix to focus on the unique features of each task.

From Text to Trajectory: Exploring Complex Constraint Representation and Decomposition in Safe Reinforcement Learning,"Pusen Dong, Tianchen Zhu, Yue Qiu, Haoyi Zhou, Jianxin Li","Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function.

In this paper, we propose the Graph-based Synthetic Data Pipeline (GSDP), an economical and scalable framework for high-quality reasoning data synthesis. Inspired by knowledge graphs, we extracted knowledge points from seed data and constructed a knowledge point relationships graph to explore their interconnections. By exploring the implicit relationships among knowledge, our method achieves $\times$255 data expansion.

OG-RAG: Ontology-Grounded Retrieval-Augmented Generation For Large Language Models,"Kartik Sharma, Peeyush Kumar, Yunqing Li","This paper presents OG-RAG, an Ontology-Grounded Retrieval Augmented Generation method designed to enhance LLM-generated responses by anchoring retrieval processes in domain-specific ontologies. While LLMs are widely used for tasks like question answering and search, they struggle to adapt to specialized knowledge, such as industrial workflows or knowledge work, without expensive fine-tuning or sub-optimal retrieval methods. Existing retrieval-augmented models, such as RAG, offer improvements but fail to account for structured domain knowledge, leading to suboptimal context generation. Ontologies, which conceptually organize domain knowledge by defining entities and their interrelationships, offer a structured representation to address this gap. OG-RAG constructs a hypergraph representation of domain documents, where each hyperedge encapsulates clusters of factual knowledge grounded using domain-specific ontology. An optimization algorithm then retrieves the minimal set of hyperedges that constructs a precise, conceptually grounded context for the LLM. This method enables efficient retrieval while preserving the complex relationships between entities. OG-RAG applies to domains where fact-based reasoning is essential, particularly in tasks that require workflows or decision-making steps to follow predefined rules and procedures. These include industrial workflows in healthcare, legal, and agricultural sectors, as well as knowledge-driven tasks such as news journalism, investigative research, consulting and more. Our evaluations demonstrate that OG-RAG increases the recall of accurate facts by 55% and improves response correctness by 40% across four different LLMs. Additionally, OG-RAG enables 30% faster attribution of responses to context and boosts fact-based reasoning accuracy by 27% compared to baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15235v1,2024-12
Exploring Large Language Models on Cross-Cultural Values in Connection with Training Methodology,"Minsang Kim, Seungjun Baek","Large language models (LLMs) closely interact with humans, and thus need an intimate understanding of the cultural values of human society. In this paper, we explore how open-source LLMs make judgments on diverse categories of cultural values across countries, and its relation to training methodology such as model sizes, training corpus, alignment, etc. Our analysis shows that LLMs can judge socio-cultural norms similar to humans but less so on social systems and progress. In addition, LLMs tend to judge cultural values biased toward Western culture, which can be improved with training on the multilingual corpus. We also find that increasing model size helps a better understanding of social values, but smaller models can be enhanced by using synthetic data. Our analysis reveals valuable insights into the design methodology of LLMs in connection with their understanding of cultural values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08846v1,2024-12

Costa-jussà, David Dale, Hady Elsahar, Kevin Heffernan, João Maria Janeiro, Tuan Tran, Christophe Ropers, Eduardo Sánchez, Robin San Roman, Alexandre Mourachko, Safiyyah Saleem, Holger Schwenk","LLMs have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and have emerged as the de-facto tool for many tasks. The current established technology of LLMs is to process input and generate output at the token level. This is in sharp contrast to humans who operate at multiple levels of abstraction, well beyond single words, to analyze information and to generate creative content. In this paper, we present an attempt at an architecture which operates on an explicit higher-level semantic representation, which we name a concept. Concepts are language- and modality-agnostic and represent a higher level idea or action in a flow. Hence, we build a ""Large Concept Model"". In this study, as proof of feasibility, we assume that a concept corresponds to a sentence, and use an existing sentence embedding space, SONAR, which supports up to 200 languages in both text and speech modalities.   The Large Concept Model is trained to perform autoregressive sentence prediction in an embedding space. We explore multiple approaches, namely MSE regression, variants of diffusion-based generation, and models operating in a quantized SONAR space. These explorations are performed using 1.6B parameter models and training data in the order of 1.3T tokens. We then scale one architecture to a model size of 7B parameters and training data of about 2.7T tokens. We perform an experimental evaluation on several generative tasks, namely summarization and a new task of summary expansion. Finally, we show that our model exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization performance to many languages, outperforming existing LLMs of the same size.

Greek2MathTex: A Greek Speech-to-Text Framework for LaTeX Equations Generation,"Evangelia Gkritzali, Panagiotis Kaliosis, Sofia Galanaki, Elisavet Palogiannidi, Theodoros Giannakopoulos","In the vast majority of the academic and scientific domains, LaTeX has established itself as the de facto standard for typesetting complex mathematical equations and formulae. However, LaTeX's complex syntax and code-like appearance present accessibility barriers for individuals with disabilities, as well as those unfamiliar with coding conventions. In this paper, we present a novel solution to this challenge through the development of a novel speech-to-LaTeX equations system specifically designed for the Greek language. We propose an end-to-end system that harnesses the power of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enable users to verbally dictate mathematical expressions and equations in natural language, which are subsequently converted into LaTeX format. We present the architecture and design principles of our system, highlighting key components such as the ASR engine, the LLM-based prompt-driven equations generation mechanism, as well as the application of a custom evaluation metric employed throughout the development process.

These models are widely used for tasks such as cross-modal information retrieval and multi-modal understanding. However, CLIP models often struggle with text-only tasks, underperforming compared to specialized text models. This performance disparity forces retrieval systems to rely on separate models for text-only and multi-modal tasks. In this work, we build upon our previous model, jina-clip-v1, by introducing a refined framework that utilizes multi-task, multi-stage contrastive learning across multiple languages, coupled with an improved training recipe to enhance text-only retrieval. The resulting model, jina-clip-v2, outperforms its predecessor on text-only and multimodal tasks, while adding multilingual support, better understanding of complex visual documents and efficiency gains thanks to Matryoshka Representation Learning and vector truncation. The model performs comparably to the state-of-the-art in both multilingual-multimodal and multilingual text retrieval benchmarks, addressing the challenge of unifying text-only and multi-modal retrieval systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08802v1,2024-12
Coverage-based Fairness in Multi-document Summarization,"Haoyuan Li, Yusen Zhang, Rui Zhang, Snigdha Chaturvedi","Fairness in multi-document summarization (MDS) measures whether a system can generate a summary fairly representing information from documents with different social attribute values. Fairness in MDS is crucial since a fair summary can offer readers a comprehensive view. Previous works focus on quantifying summary-level fairness using Proportional Representation, a fairness measure based on Statistical Parity. However, Proportional Representation does not consider redundancy in input documents and overlooks corpus-level unfairness. In this work, we propose a new summary-level fairness measure, Equal Coverage, which is based on coverage of documents with different social attribute values and considers the redundancy within documents. To detect the corpus-level unfairness, we propose a new corpus-level measure, Coverage Parity. Our human evaluations show that our measures align more with our definition of fairness. Using our measures, we evaluate the fairness of thirteen different LLMs. We find that Claude3-sonnet is the fairest among all evaluated LLMs. We also find that almost all LLMs overrepresent different social attribute values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08795v1,2024-12
Performance of a large language model-Artificial Intelligence based chatbot for counseling patients with sexually transmitted infections and genital diseases,"Nikhil Mehta, Sithira Ambepitiya, Thanveer Ahamad, Dinuka Wijesundara, Yudara Kularathne","Introduction: Global burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is rising out of proportion to specialists. Current chatbots like ChatGPT are not tailored for handling STI-related concerns out of the box. We developed Otiz, an Artificial Intelligence-based (AI-based) chatbot platform designed specifically for STI detection and counseling, and assessed its performance. Methods: Otiz employs a multi-agent system architecture based on GPT4-0613, leveraging large language model (LLM) and Deterministic Finite Automaton principles to provide contextually relevant, medically accurate, and empathetic responses. Its components include modules for general STI information, emotional recognition, Acute Stress Disorder detection, and psychotherapy. A question suggestion agent operates in parallel. Four STIs (anogenital warts, herpes, syphilis, urethritis/cervicitis) and 2 non-STIs (candidiasis, penile cancer) were evaluated using prompts mimicking patient language. Each prompt was independently graded by two venereologists conversing with Otiz as patient actors on 6 criteria using Numerical Rating Scale ranging from 0 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Results: Twenty-three venereologists did 60 evaluations of 30 prompts. Across STIs, Otiz scored highly on diagnostic accuracy (4.1-4.7), overall accuracy (4.3-4.6), correctness of information (5.0), comprehensibility (4.2-4.4), and empathy (4.5-4.8). However, relevance scores were lower (2.9-3.6), suggesting some redundancy. Diagnostic scores for non-STIs were lower (p=0.038). Inter-observer agreement was strong, with differences greater than 1 point occurring in only 12.7% of paired evaluations. Conclusions: AI conversational agents like Otiz can provide accurate, correct, discrete, non-judgmental, readily accessible and easily understandable STI-related information in an empathetic manner, and can alleviate the burden on healthcare systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12166v1,2024-12
BDA: Bangla Text Data Augmentation Framework,"Md. Tariquzzaman, Audwit Nafi Anam, Naimul Haque, Mohsinul Kabir, Hasan Mahmud, Md Kamrul Hasan","Data augmentation involves generating synthetic samples that resemble those in a given dataset. In resource-limited fields where high-quality data is scarce, augmentation plays a crucial role in increasing the volume of training data. This paper introduces a Bangla Text Data Augmentation (BDA) Framework that uses both pre-trained models and rule-based methods to create new variants of the text. A filtering process is included to ensure that the new text keeps the same meaning as the original while also adding variety in the words used. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the framework's effectiveness in Bangla text classification tasks. Our framework achieved significant improvement in F1 scores across five distinct datasets, delivering performance equivalent to models trained on 100% of the data while utilizing only 50% of the training dataset. Additionally, we explore the impact of data scarcity by progressively reducing the training data and augmenting it through BDA, resulting in notable F1 score enhancements. The study offers a thorough examination of BDA's performance, identifying key factors for optimal results and addressing its limitations through detailed analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08753v2,2024-12
In-Context Learning with Topological Information for Knowledge Graph Completion,"Udari Madhushani Sehwag, Kassiani Papasotiriou, Jared Vann, Sumitra Ganesh","Knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for representing and reasoning over structured information, supporting a wide range of applications such as information retrieval, question answering, and decision-making. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by incompleteness, limiting their potential for real-world impact. While knowledge graph completion (KGC) has been extensively studied in the literature, recent advances in generative AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have introduced new opportunities for innovation. In-context learning has recently emerged as a promising approach for leveraging pretrained knowledge of LLMs across a range of natural language processing tasks and has been widely adopted in both academia and industry. However, how to utilize in-context learning for effective KGC remains relatively underexplored. We develop a novel method that incorporates topological information through in-context learning to enhance KGC performance. By integrating ontological knowledge and graph structure into the context of LLMs, our approach achieves strong performance in the transductive setting i.e., nodes in the test graph dataset are present in the training graph dataset. Furthermore, we apply our approach to KGC in the more challenging inductive setting, i.e., nodes in the training graph dataset and test graph dataset are disjoint, leveraging the ontology to infer useful information about missing nodes which serve as contextual cues for the LLM during inference. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines on the ILPC-small and ILPC-large datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08742v1,2024-12
Euclid: Supercharging Multimodal LLMs with Synthetic High-Fidelity Visual Descriptions,"Jiarui Zhang, Ollie Liu, Tianyu Yu, Jinyi Hu, Willie Neiswanger","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress in recent years, yet continue to struggle with low-level visual perception (LLVP) -- particularly the ability to accurately describe the geometric details of an image. This capability is crucial for applications in areas such as robotics, medical image analysis, and manufacturing. In this paper, we first introduce Geoperception, a benchmark designed to evaluate an MLLM's ability to accurately transcribe 2D geometric information from an image. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate the limitations of leading MLLMs, and then conduct a comprehensive empirical study to explore strategies for improving their performance on geometric tasks. Our findings highlight the benefits of certain model architectures, training techniques, and data strategies, including the use of high-fidelity synthetic data and multi-stage training with a data curriculum. Notably, we find that a data curriculum enables models to learn challenging geometry understanding tasks which they fail to learn from scratch. Leveraging these insights, we develop Euclid, a family of models specifically optimized for strong low-level geometric perception. Although purely trained on synthetic multimodal data, Euclid shows strong generalization ability to novel geometry shapes. For instance, Euclid outperforms the best closed-source model, Gemini-1.5-Pro, by up to 58.56% on certain Geoperception benchmark tasks and 10.65% on average across all tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08737v1,2024-12
LatentQA: Teaching LLMs to Decode Activations Into Natural Language,"Alexander Pan, Lijie Chen, Jacob Steinhardt","Interpretability methods seek to understand language model representations, yet the outputs of most such methods -- circuits, vectors, scalars -- are not immediately human-interpretable. In response, we introduce LatentQA, the task of answering open-ended questions about model activations in natural language. Towards solving LatentQA, we propose Latent Interpretation Tuning (LIT), which finetunes a decoder LLM on a dataset of activations and associated question-answer pairs, similar to how visual instruction tuning trains on question-answer pairs associated with images. We use the decoder for diverse reading applications, such as extracting relational knowledge from representations or uncovering system prompts governing model behavior. Our decoder also specifies a differentiable loss that we use to control models, such as debiasing models on stereotyped sentences and controlling the sentiment of generations. Finally, we extend LatentQA to reveal harmful model capabilities, such as generating recipes for bioweapons and code for hacking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08686v1,2024-12
Fast Prompt Alignment for Text-to-Image Generation,"Khalil Mrini, Hanlin Lu, Linjie Yang, Weilin Huang, Heng Wang","Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly, yet aligning complex textual prompts with generated visuals remains challenging, especially with intricate object relationships and fine-grained details. This paper introduces Fast Prompt Alignment (FPA), a prompt optimization framework that leverages a one-pass approach, enhancing text-to-image alignment efficiency without the iterative overhead typical of current methods like OPT2I. FPA uses large language models (LLMs) for single-iteration prompt paraphrasing, followed by fine-tuning or in-context learning with optimized prompts to enable real-time inference, reducing computational demands while preserving alignment fidelity. Extensive evaluations on the COCO Captions and PartiPrompts datasets demonstrate that FPA achieves competitive text-image alignment scores at a fraction of the processing time, as validated through both automated metrics (TIFA, VQA) and human evaluation. A human study with expert annotators further reveals a strong correlation between human alignment judgments and automated scores, underscoring the robustness of FPA's improvements. The proposed method showcases a scalable, efficient alternative to iterative prompt optimization, enabling broader applicability in real-time, high-demand settings.

Multimodal Latent Language Modeling with Next-Token Diffusion,"Yutao Sun, Hangbo Bao, Wenhui Wang, Zhiliang Peng, Li Dong, Shaohan Huang, Jianyong Wang, Furu Wei","Multimodal generative models require a unified approach to handle both discrete data (e.g., text and code) and continuous data (e.g., image, audio, video). In this work, we propose Latent Language Modeling (LatentLM), which seamlessly integrates continuous and discrete data using causal Transformers. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to represent continuous data as latent vectors and introduce next-token diffusion for autoregressive generation of these vectors. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-VAE to address the challenges of variance collapse, which is crucial for autoregressive modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LatentLM across various modalities. In image generation, LatentLM surpasses Diffusion Transformers in both performance and scalability. When integrated into multimodal large language models, LatentLM provides a general-purpose interface that unifies multimodal generation and understanding. Experimental results show that LatentLM achieves favorable performance compared to Transfusion and vector quantized models in the setting of scaling up training tokens. In text-to-speech synthesis, LatentLM outperforms the state-of-the-art VALL-E 2 model in speaker similarity and robustness, while requiring 10x fewer decoding steps. The results establish LatentLM as a highly effective and scalable approach to advance large multimodal models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08635v1,2024-12
Exploiting the Index Gradients for Optimization-Based Jailbreaking on Large Language Models,"Jiahui Li, Yongchang Hao, Haoyu Xu, Xing Wang, Yu Hong","Despite the advancements in training Large Language Models (LLMs) with alignment techniques to enhance the safety of generated content, these models remain susceptible to jailbreak, an adversarial attack method that exposes security vulnerabilities in LLMs. Notably, the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) method has demonstrated the ability to automatically generate adversarial suffixes that jailbreak state-of-the-art LLMs. However, the optimization process involved in GCG is highly time-consuming, rendering the jailbreaking pipeline inefficient. In this paper, we investigate the process of GCG and identify an issue of Indirect Effect, the key bottleneck of the GCG optimization. To this end, we propose the Model Attack Gradient Index GCG (MAGIC), that addresses the Indirect Effect by exploiting the gradient information of the suffix tokens, thereby accelerating the procedure by having less computation and fewer iterations. Our experiments on AdvBench show that MAGIC achieves up to a 1.5x speedup, while maintaining Attack Success Rates (ASR) on par or even higher than other baselines. Our MAGIC achieved an ASR of 74% on the Llama-2 and an ASR of 54% when conducting transfer attacks on GPT-3.5.

Advancing Single- and Multi-task Text Classification through Large Language Model Fine-tuning,"Hang Zhao, Qile P. Chen, Yijing Barry Zhang, Gang Yang","Both encoder-only models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) and large language models (LLMs, e.g., Llama3) have been widely used for text classification tasks. However, there is a lack of systematic studies comparing the performance of encoder-based models and LLMs in text classification, particularly when fine-tuning is involved. This study employed a diverse range of models and methods, varying in size and architecture, and including both fine-tuned and pre-trained approaches. We first assessed the performances of these LLMs on the 20 Newsgroups (20NG) and MASSIVE datasets, comparing them to encoder-only RoBERTa models. Additionally, we explored the multi-task capabilities of both model types by combining multiple classification tasks, including intent detection and slot-filling, into a single model using data from both datasets. Our results indicate that fully fine-tuned Llama3-70B models outperform RoBERTa-large and other decoder LLMs across various classification tasks and datasets. Moreover, the consolidated multi-task fine-tuned LLMs matched the performance of dual-model setups in both tasks across both datasets. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive benchmark of encoder-only and LLM models on text classification tasks and demonstrates a method to combine two or more fully fine-tuned decoder LLMs for reduced latency and equivalent performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08587v1,2024-12

Our goal is to develop an efficient visual programming system without 1) using prompt-based LLMs at inference time and 2) a large set of program and answer annotations. We develop a synthetic data augmentation approach and alternative program generation method based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills called templates and the corresponding arguments.

Bilevel Joint Unsupervised and Supervised Training for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Xiaodong Cui, A F M Saif, Songtao Lu, Lisha Chen, Tianyi Chen, Brian Kingsbury, George Saon","In this paper, we propose a bilevel joint unsupervised and supervised training (BL-JUST) framework for automatic speech recognition. Compared to the conventional pre-training and fine-tuning strategy which is a disconnected two-stage process, BL-JUST tries to optimize an acoustic model such that it simultaneously minimizes both the unsupervised and supervised loss functions. Because BL-JUST seeks matched local optima of both loss functions, acoustic representations learned by the acoustic model strike a good balance between being generic and task-specific. We solve the BL-JUST problem using penalty-based bilevel gradient descent and evaluate the trained deep neural network acoustic models on various datasets with a variety of architectures and loss functions. We show that BL-JUST can outperform the widely-used pre-training and fine-tuning strategy and some other popular semi-supervised techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08548v1,2024-12

Continual Learning for Encoder-only Language Models via a Discrete Key-Value Bottleneck,"Andor Diera, Lukas Galke, Fabian Karl, Ansgar Scherp","Continual learning remains challenging across various natural language understanding tasks. When models are updated with new training data, they risk catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge. In the present work, we introduce a discrete key-value bottleneck for encoder-only language models, allowing for efficient continual learning by requiring only localized updates. Inspired by the success of a discrete key-value bottleneck in vision, we address new and NLP-specific challenges. We experiment with different bottleneck architectures to find the most suitable variants regarding language, and present a generic discrete key initialization technique for NLP that is task independent. We evaluate the discrete key-value bottleneck in four continual learning NLP scenarios and demonstrate that it alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

EMS: Adaptive Evict-then-Merge Strategy for Head-wise KV Cache Compression Based on Global-Local Importance,"Yingxin Li, Ye Li, Yuan Meng, Xinzhu Ma, Zihan Geng, Shutao Xia, Zhi Wang","As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the demand for higher quality and faster processing of long contexts across various applications is growing. KV cache is widely adopted as it stores previously generated key and value tokens, effectively reducing redundant computations during inference. However, as memory overhead becomes a significant concern, efficient compression of KV cache has gained increasing attention. Most existing methods perform compression from two perspectives: identifying important tokens and designing compression strategies. However, these approaches often produce biased distributions of important tokens due to the influence of accumulated attention scores or positional encoding. Furthermore, they overlook the sparsity and redundancy across different heads, which leads to difficulties in preserving the most effective information at the head level. To this end, we propose EMS to overcome these limitations, while achieving better KV cache compression under extreme compression ratios. Specifically, we introduce a Global-Local score that combines accumulated attention scores from both global and local KV tokens to better identify the token importance. For the compression strategy, we design an adaptive and unified Evict-then-Merge framework that accounts for the sparsity and redundancy of KV tokens across different heads. Additionally, we implement the head-wise parallel compression through a zero-class mechanism to enhance efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate our SOTA performance even under extreme compression ratios. EMS consistently achieves the lowest perplexity, improves scores by over 1.28 points across four LLMs on LongBench under a 256 cache budget, and preserves 95% retrieval accuracy with a cache budget less than 2% of the context length in the Needle-in-a-Haystack task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08521v1,2024-12

Bridging Relevance and Reasoning: Rationale Distillation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Pengyue Jia, Derong Xu, Xiaopeng Li, Zhaocheng Du, Xiangyang Li, Xiangyu Zhao, Yichao Wang, Yuhao Wang, Huifeng Guo, Ruiming Tang","The reranker and generator are two critical components in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (i.e., RAG) pipeline, responsible for ranking relevant documents and generating responses. However, due to differences in pre-training data and objectives, there is an inevitable gap between the documents ranked as relevant by the reranker and those required by the generator to support answering the query. To address this gap, we propose RADIO, a novel and practical preference alignment framework with RAtionale DIstillatiOn. Specifically, We first propose a rationale extraction method that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract the rationales necessary for answering the query. Subsequently, a rationale-based alignment process is designed to rerank the documents based on the extracted rationales, and fine-tune the reranker to align the preferences.

Comparative Opinion Mining in Product Reviews: Multi-perspective Prompt-based Learning,"Hai-Yen Thi Nguyen, Cam-Van Thi Nguyen","Comparative reviews are pivotal in understanding consumer preferences and influencing purchasing decisions. Comparative Quintuple Extraction (COQE) aims to identify five key components in text: the target entity, compared entities, compared aspects, opinions on these aspects, and polarity. Extracting precise comparative information from product reviews is challenging due to nuanced language and sequential task errors in traditional methods. To mitigate these problems, we propose MTP-COQE, an end-to-end model designed for COQE. Leveraging multi-perspective prompt-based learning, MTP-COQE effectively guides the generative model in comparative opinion mining tasks. Evaluation on the Camera-COQE (English) and VCOM (Vietnamese) datasets demonstrates MTP-COQE's efficacy in automating COQE, achieving superior performance with a 1.41% higher F1 score than the previous baseline models on the English dataset. Additionally, we designed a strategy to limit the generative model's creativity to ensure the output meets expectations. We also performed data augmentation to address data imbalance and to prevent the model from becoming biased towards dominant samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08508v1,2024-12
Multi-perspective Alignment for Increasing Naturalness in Neural Machine Translation,"Huiyuan Lai, Esther Ploeger, Rik van Noord, Antonio Toral","Neural machine translation (NMT) systems amplify lexical biases present in their training data, leading to artificially impoverished language in output translations. These language-level characteristics render automatic translations different from text originally written in a language and human translations, which hinders their usefulness in for example creating evaluation datasets. Attempts to increase naturalness in NMT can fall short in terms of content preservation, where increased lexical diversity comes at the cost of translation accuracy. Inspired by the reinforcement learning from human feedback framework, we introduce a novel method that rewards both naturalness and content preservation. We experiment with multiple perspectives to produce more natural translations, aiming at reducing machine and human translationese. We evaluate our method on English-to-Dutch literary translation, and find that our best model produces translations that are lexically richer and exhibit more properties of human-written language, without loss in translation accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08473v1,2024-12
Bootstrapping Language-Guided Navigation Learning with Self-Refining Data Flywheel,"Zun Wang, Jialu Li, Yicong Hong, Songze Li, Kunchang Li, Shoubin Yu, Yi Wang, Yu Qiao, Yali Wang, Mohit Bansal, Limin Wang","Creating high-quality data for training robust language-instructed agents is a long-lasting challenge in embodied AI. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08467v1,2024-12
Mitigating Out-of-Entity Errors in Named Entity Recognition: A Sentence-Level Strategy,"Guochao Jiang, Ziqin Luo, Chengwei Hu, Zepeng Ding, Deqing Yang","Many previous models of named entity recognition (NER) suffer from the problem of Out-of-Entity (OOE), i.e., the tokens in the entity mentions of the test samples have not appeared in the training samples, which hinders the achievement of satisfactory performance. To improve OOE-NER performance, in this paper, we propose a new framework, namely S+NER, which fully leverages sentence-level information. Our S+NER achieves better OOE-NER performance mainly due to the following two particular designs. 1) It first exploits the pre-trained language model's capability of understanding the target entity's sentence-level context with a template set. 2) Then, it refines the sentence-level representation based on the positive and negative templates, through a contrastive learning strategy and template pooling method, to obtain better NER results. Our extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets have demonstrated that, our S+NER outperforms some state-of-the-art OOE-NER models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08434v1,2024-12
Assessing Personalized AI Mentoring with Large Language Models in the Computing Field,"Xiao Luo, Sean O'Connell, Shamima Mithun","This paper provides an in-depth evaluation of three state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized career mentoring in the computing field, using three distinct student profiles that consider gender, race, and professional levels. We evaluated the performance of GPT-4, LLaMA 3, and Palm 2 using a zero-shot learning approach without human intervention. A quantitative evaluation was conducted through a custom natural language processing analytics pipeline to highlight the uniqueness of the responses and to identify words reflecting each student's profile, including race, gender, or professional level. The analysis of frequently used words in the responses indicates that GPT-4 offers more personalized mentoring compared to the other two LLMs. Additionally, a qualitative evaluation was performed to see if human experts reached similar conclusions. The analysis of survey responses shows that GPT-4 outperformed the other two LLMs in delivering more accurate and useful mentoring while addressing specific challenges with encouragement languages. Our work establishes a foundation for developing personalized mentoring tools based on LLMs, incorporating human mentors in the process to deliver a more impactful and tailored mentoring experience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08430v1,2024-12
Detecting Conversational Mental Manipulation with Intent-Aware Prompting,"Jiayuan Ma, Hongbin Na, Zimu Wang, Yining Hua, Yue Liu, Wei Wang, Ling Chen","Mental manipulation severely undermines mental wellness by covertly and negatively distorting decision-making. While there is an increasing interest in mental health care within the natural language processing community, progress in tackling manipulation remains limited due to the complexity of detecting subtle, covert tactics in conversations. In this paper, we propose Intent-Aware Prompting (IAP), a novel approach for detecting mental manipulations using large language models (LLMs), providing a deeper understanding of manipulative tactics by capturing the underlying intents of participants. Experimental results on the MentalManip dataset demonstrate superior effectiveness of IAP against other advanced prompting strategies. Notably, our approach substantially reduces false negatives, helping detect more instances of mental manipulation with minimal misjudgment of positive cases. The code of this paper is available at https://github.com/Anton-Jiayuan-MA/Manip-IAP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08414v1,2024-12
Learning to Reason via Self-Iterative Process Feedback for Small Language Models,"Kaiyuan Chen, Jin Wang, Xuejie Zhang","Small language models (SLMs) are more efficient, cost-effective, and customizable than large language models (LLMs), though they often underperform in specific areas like reasoning. Past methods for enhancing SLMs' reasoning, such as supervised fine-tuning and distillation, often depend on costly external signals, resulting in SLMs being overly confident with limited supervision signals, thus limiting their abilities. Therefore, this study enables SLMs to learn to reason from self-iterative feedback. By combining odds ratio preference optimization (ORPO), we fine-tune and align SLMs using positive and negative signals generated by themselves. Additionally, we introduce process supervision for rewards in preference alignment by sampling-based inference simulation and process reward models. Compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), our method improves the performance of Gemma-2B by 12.43 (Acc) on GSM8K and 3.95 (Pass@1) on MBPP. Furthermore, the proposed method also demonstrated superior out-of-domain generalization capabilities on MMLU_Math and HumanEval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08393v1,2024-12
The Roles of English in Evaluating Multilingual Language Models,"Wessel Poelman, Miryam de Lhoneux","Multilingual natural language processing is getting increased attention, with numerous models, benchmarks, and methods being released for many languages. English is often used in multilingual evaluation to prompt language models (LMs), mainly to overcome the lack of instruction tuning data in other languages. In this position paper, we lay out two roles of English in multilingual LM evaluations: as an interface and as a natural language. We argue that these roles have different goals: task performance versus language understanding. This discrepancy is highlighted with examples from datasets and evaluation setups. Numerous works explicitly use English as an interface to boost task performance. We recommend to move away from this imprecise method and instead focus on furthering language understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08392v1,2024-12
SweetieChat: A Strategy-Enhanced Role-playing Framework for Diverse Scenarios Handling Emotional Support Agent,"Jing Ye, Lu Xiang, Yaping Zhang, Chengqing Zong","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising potential in providing empathetic support during interactions. However, their responses often become verbose or overly formulaic, failing to adequately address the diverse emotional support needs of real-world scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative strategy-enhanced role-playing framework, designed to simulate authentic emotional support conversations. Specifically, our approach unfolds in two steps: (1) Strategy-Enhanced Role-Playing Interactions, which involve three pivotal roles -- Seeker, Strategy Counselor, and Supporter -- engaging in diverse scenarios to emulate real-world interactions and promote a broader range of dialogues; and (2) Emotional Support Agent Training, achieved through fine-tuning LLMs using our specially constructed dataset. Within this framework, we develop the \textbf{ServeForEmo} dataset, comprising an extensive collection of 3.7K+ multi-turn dialogues and 62.8K+ utterances. We further present \textbf{SweetieChat}, an emotional support agent capable of handling diverse open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments and human evaluations confirm the framework's effectiveness in enhancing emotional support, highlighting its unique ability to provide more nuanced and tailored assistance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08389v1,2024-12
NyayaAnumana & INLegalLlama: The Largest Indian Legal Judgment Prediction Dataset and Specialized Language Model for Enhanced Decision Analysis,"Shubham Kumar Nigam, Balaramamahanthi Deepak Patnaik, Shivam Mishra, Noel Shallum, Kripabandhu Ghosh, Arnab Bhattacharya","The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in legal judgment prediction (LJP) has the potential to transform the legal landscape, particularly in jurisdictions like India, where a significant backlog of cases burdens the legal system. This paper introduces NyayaAnumana, the largest and most diverse corpus of Indian legal cases compiled for LJP, encompassing a total of 7,02,945 preprocessed cases. NyayaAnumana, which combines the words ""Nyay"" (judgment) and ""Anuman"" (prediction or inference) respectively for most major Indian languages, includes a wide range of cases from the Supreme Court, High Courts, Tribunal Courts, District Courts, and Daily Orders and, thus, provides unparalleled diversity and coverage. Our dataset surpasses existing datasets like PredEx and ILDC, offering a comprehensive foundation for advanced AI research in the legal domain.   In addition to the dataset, we present INLegalLlama, a domain-specific generative large language model (LLM) tailored to the intricacies of the Indian legal system. It is developed through a two-phase training approach over a base LLaMa model. First, Indian legal documents are injected using continual pretraining. Second, task-specific supervised finetuning is done. This method allows the model to achieve a deeper understanding of legal contexts.   Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating diverse court data significantly boosts model accuracy, achieving approximately 90% F1-score in prediction tasks. INLegalLlama not only improves prediction accuracy but also offers comprehensible explanations, addressing the need for explainability in AI-assisted legal decisions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08385v1,2024-12
SmolTulu: Higher Learning Rate to Batch Size Ratios Can Lead to Better Reasoning in SLMs,Sultan Alrashed,"We present SmolTulu-1.7b-Instruct, referenced in this report as SmolTulu-DPO-1130, an instruction-tuned language model that adapts AllenAI's Tulu 3 post-training pipeline to enhance Huggingface's SmolLM2-1.7B base model. Through comprehensive empirical analysis using a 135M parameter model, we demonstrate that the relationship between learning rate and batch size significantly impacts model performance in a task-dependent manner. Our findings reveal a clear split: reasoning tasks like ARC and GSM8K benefit from higher learning rate to batch size ratios, while pattern recognition tasks such as HellaSwag and IFEval show optimal performance with lower ratios. These insights informed the development of SmolTulu, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among sub-2B parameter models on instruction following, scoring 67.7% on IFEval ($\Delta$11%), and mathematical reasoning with 51.6% on GSM8K ($\Delta$3.4%), with an alternate version achieving scoring 57.1% on ARC ($\Delta5.4%$). We release our model, training recipes, and ablation studies to facilitate further research in efficient model alignment, demonstrating that careful adaptation of optimization dynamics can help bridge the capability gap between small and large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08347v1,2024-12
BEIR-NL: Zero-shot Information Retrieval Benchmark for the Dutch Language,"Nikolay Banar, Ehsan Lotfi, Walter Daelemans","Zero-shot evaluation of information retrieval (IR) models is often performed using BEIR; a large and heterogeneous benchmark composed of multiple datasets, covering different retrieval tasks across various domains. Although BEIR has become a standard benchmark for the zero-shot setup, its exclusively English content reduces its utility for underrepresented languages in IR, including Dutch. To address this limitation and encourage the development of Dutch IR models, we introduce BEIR-NL by automatically translating the publicly accessible BEIR datasets into Dutch. Using BEIR-NL, we evaluated a wide range of multilingual dense ranking and reranking models, as well as the lexical BM25 method. Our experiments show that BM25 remains a competitive baseline, and is only outperformed by the larger dense models trained for retrieval. When combined with reranking models, BM25 achieves performance on par with the best dense ranking models. In addition, we explored the impact of translation on the data by back-translating a selection of datasets to English, and observed a performance drop for both dense and lexical methods, indicating the limitations of translation for creating benchmarks. BEIR-NL is publicly available on the Hugging Face hub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08329v1,2024-12
Large Language Models Still Face Challenges in Multi-Hop Reasoning with External Knowledge,Haotong Zhang,"We carry out a series of experiments to test large language models' multi-hop reasoning ability from three aspects: selecting and combining external knowledge, dealing with non-sequential reasoning tasks and generalising to data samples with larger numbers of hops. We test the GPT-3.5 model on four reasoning benchmarks with Chain-of-Thought prompting (and its variations). Our results reveal that despite the amazing performance achieved by large language models on various reasoning tasks, models still suffer from severe drawbacks which shows a large gap with humans.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08317v1,2024-12
Rumor Detection on Social Media with Temporal Propagation Structure Optimization,"Xingyu Peng, Junran Wu, Ruomei Liu, Ke Xu","Traditional methods for detecting rumors on social media primarily focus on analyzing textual content, often struggling to capture the complexity of online interactions. Recent research has shifted towards leveraging graph neural networks to model the hierarchical conversation structure that emerges during rumor propagation. However, these methods tend to overlook the temporal aspect of rumor propagation and may disregard potential noise within the propagation structure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates temporal information by constructing a weighted propagation tree, where the weight of each edge represents the time interval between connected posts. Drawing upon the theory of structural entropy, we transform this tree into a coding tree. This transformation aims to preserve the essential structure of rumor propagation while reducing noise. Finally, we introduce a recursive neural network to learn from the coding tree for rumor veracity prediction. Experimental results on two common datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08316v2,2024-12
What Makes In-context Learning Effective for Mathematical Reasoning: A Theoretical Analysis,"Jiayu Liu, Zhenya Huang, Chaokun Wang, Xunpeng Huang, Chengxiang Zhai, Enhong Chen","Owing to the capability of in-context learning, large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks. However, we find that few-shot demonstrations can sometimes bring negative performance and their effectiveness on LLMs' reasoning abilities remains unreliable. To this end, in this paper, we aim to theoretically analyze the impact of in-context demonstrations on LLMs' reasoning performance. We prove that the reasoning efficacy (measured by empirical prediction loss) can be bounded by a LLM-oriented semantic similarity and an inference stability of demonstrations, which is general for both one-shot and few-shot scenarios. Based on this finding, we propose a straightforward, generalizable, and low-complexity demonstration selection method named LMS3. It can adaptively facilitate to select the most pertinent samples for different LLMs and includes a novel demonstration rejection mechanism to automatically filter out samples that are unsuitable for few-shot learning. Through experiments on three representative benchmarks, two LLM backbones, and multiple few-shot settings, we verify that our LMS3 has superiority and achieves consistent improvements on all datasets, which existing methods have been unable to accomplish.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12157v1,2024-12

This taxonomy-based survey provides a comprehensive analysis of LLMs in the NL-PL domain, investigating how these models are utilized in coding tasks and examining their methodologies, architectures, and training processes. We propose a taxonomy-based framework that categorizes relevant concepts, providing a unified classification system to facilitate a deeper understanding of this rapidly evolving field. This survey offers insights into the current state and future directions of LLMs in coding tasks, including their applications and limitations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08291v1,2024-12
Adaptive Prompting for Continual Relation Extraction: A Within-Task Variance Perspective,"Minh Le, Tien Ngoc Luu, An Nguyen The, Thanh-Thien Le, Trang Nguyen, Tung Thanh Nguyen, Linh Ngo Van, Thien Huu Nguyen","To address catastrophic forgetting in Continual Relation Extraction (CRE), many current approaches rely on memory buffers to rehearse previously learned knowledge while acquiring new tasks. Recently, prompt-based methods have emerged as potent alternatives to rehearsal-based strategies, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, upon analyzing existing prompt-based approaches for CRE, we identified several critical limitations, such as inaccurate prompt selection, inadequate mechanisms for mitigating forgetting in shared parameters, and suboptimal handling of cross-task and within-task variances. To overcome these challenges, we draw inspiration from the relationship between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts, proposing a novel approach that employs a prompt pool for each task, capturing variations within each task while enhancing cross-task variances. Furthermore, we incorporate a generative model to consolidate prior knowledge within shared parameters, eliminating the need for explicit data storage. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art prompt-based and rehearsal-free methods in continual relation extraction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08285v4,2024-12
A Preliminary Analysis of Automatic Word and Syllable Prominence Detection in Non-Native Speech With Text-to-Speech Prosody Embeddings,"Anindita Mondal, Rangavajjala Sankara Bharadwaj, Jhansi Mallela, Anil Kumar Vuppala, Chiranjeevi Yarra","Automatic detection of prominence at the word and syllable-levels is critical for building computer-assisted language learning systems. It has been shown that prosody embeddings learned by the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-speech (TTS) systems could generate word- and syllable-level prominence in the synthesized speech as natural as in native speech. To understand the effectiveness of prosody embeddings from TTS for prominence detection under nonnative context, a comparative analysis is conducted on the embeddings extracted from native and non-native speech considering the prominence-related embeddings: duration, energy, and pitch from a SOTA TTS named FastSpeech2. These embeddings are extracted under two conditions considering: 1) only text, 2) both speech and text. For the first condition, the embeddings are extracted directly from the TTS inference mode, whereas for the second condition, we propose to extract from the TTS under training mode. Experiments are conducted on native speech corpus: Tatoeba, and non-native speech corpus: ISLE. For experimentation, word-level prominence locations are manually annotated for both corpora. The highest relative improvement on word \& syllable-level prominence detection accuracies with the TTS embeddings are found to be 13.7% & 5.9% and 16.2% & 6.9% compared to those with the heuristic-based features and self-supervised Wav2Vec-2.0 representations, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08283v1,2024-12
Y-NQ: English-Yorùbá Evaluation dataset for Open-Book Reading Comprehension and Text Generation,"Marta R. Costa-jussà, Joy Chen, Ifeoluwanimi Adebara, Joe Chuang, Christophe Ropers, Eduardo Sánchez","The purpose of this work is to share an English-Yor\`ub\'a evaluation dataset for open-book reading comprehension and text generation to assess the performance of models both in a high- and a low- resource language. The dataset contains 358 questions and answers on 338 English documents and 208 Yor\`ub\'a documents. The average document length is ~ 10k words for English and 430 words for Yor\`ub\'a. Experiments show a consistent disparity in performance between the two languages, with Yor\`ub\'a falling behind English for automatic metrics even if documents are much shorter for this language. For a small set of documents with comparable length, performance of Yor\`ub\'a drops by x2.5 times. When analyzing performance by length, we observe that Yor\`ub\'a decreases performance dramatically for documents that reach 1500 words while English performance is barely affected at that length. Our dataset opens the door to showcasing if English LLM reading comprehension capabilities extend to Yor\`ub\'a, which for the evaluated LLMs is not the case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08279v1,2024-12

LCFO: Long Context and Long Form Output Dataset and Benchmarking,"Marta R. Costa-jussà, Pierre Andrews, Mariano Coria Meglioli, Joy Chen, Joe Chuang, David Dale, Christophe Ropers, Alexandre Mourachko, Eduardo Sánchez, Holger Schwenk, Tuan Tran, Arina Turkatenko, Carleigh Wood","This paper presents the Long Context and Form Output (LCFO) benchmark, a novel evaluation framework for assessing gradual summarization and summary expansion capabilities across diverse domains. LCFO consists of long input documents (5k words average length), each of which comes with three summaries of different lengths (20%, 10%, and 5% of the input text), as well as approximately 15 questions and answers (QA) related to the input content. Notably, LCFO also provides alignments between specific QA pairs and corresponding summaries in 7 domains. The primary motivation behind providing summaries of different lengths is to establish a controllable framework for generating long texts from shorter inputs, i.e. summary expansion. To establish an evaluation metric framework for summarization and summary expansion, we provide human evaluation scores for human-generated outputs, as well as results from various state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). GPT-4o-mini achieves best human scores among automatic systems in both summarization and summary expansion tasks (~ +10% and +20%, respectively). It even surpasses human output quality in the case of short summaries (~ +7%). Overall automatic metrics achieve low correlations with human evaluation scores (~ 0.4) but moderate correlation on specific evaluation aspects such as fluency and attribution (~ 0.6).

Discrete Subgraph Sampling for Interpretable Graph based Visual Question Answering,"Pascal Tilli, Ngoc Thang Vu","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to make machine learning models more transparent. While many approaches focus on generating explanations post-hoc, interpretable approaches, which generate the explanations intrinsically alongside the predictions, are relatively rare. In this work, we integrate different discrete subset sampling methods into a graph-based visual question answering system to compare their effectiveness in generating interpretable explanatory subgraphs intrinsically. We evaluate the methods on the GQA dataset and show that the integrated methods effectively mitigate the performance trade-off between interpretability and answer accuracy, while also achieving strong co-occurrences between answer and question tokens. Furthermore, we conduct a human evaluation to assess the interpretability of the generated subgraphs using a comparative setting with the extended Bradley-Terry model, showing that the answer and question token co-occurrence metrics strongly correlate with human preferences. Our source code is publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08263v1,2024-12
Accurate Medical Named Entity Recognition Through Specialized NLP Models,"Jiacheng Hu, Runyuan Bao, Yang Lin, Hanchao Zhang, Yanlin Xiang","This study evaluated the effect of BioBERT in medical text processing for the task of medical named entity recognition.

TouchTTS: An Embarrassingly Simple TTS Framework that Everyone Can Touch,"Xingchen Song, Mengtao Xing, Changwei Ma, Shengqiang Li, Di Wu, Binbin Zhang, Fuping Pan, Dinghao Zhou, Yuekai Zhang, Shun Lei, Zhendong Peng, Zhiyong Wu","It is well known that LLM-based systems are data-hungry. Recent LLM-based TTS works typically employ complex data processing pipelines to obtain high-quality training data. These sophisticated pipelines require excellent models at each stage (e.g., speech denoising, speech enhancement, speaker diarization, and punctuation models), which themselves demand high-quality training data and are rarely open-sourced. Even with state-of-the-art models, issues persist, such as incomplete background noise removal and misalignment between punctuation and actual speech pauses. Moreover, the stringent filtering strategies often retain only 10-30\% of the original data, significantly impeding data scaling efforts. In this work, we leverage a noise-robust audio tokenizer (S3Tokenizer) to design a simplified yet effective TTS data processing pipeline that maintains data quality while substantially reducing data acquisition costs, achieving a data retention rate of over 50\%. Beyond data scaling challenges, LLM-based TTS systems also incur higher deployment costs compared to conventional approaches. Current systems typically use LLMs solely for text-to-token generation, while requiring separate models (e.g., flow matching models) for token-to-waveform generation, which cannot be directly executed by LLM inference engines, further complicating deployment. To address these challenges, we eliminate redundant modules in both LLM and flow components, replacing the flow model backbone with an LLM architecture. Building upon this simplified flow backbone, we propose a unified architecture for both streaming and non-streaming inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Finally, we explore the feasibility of unifying TTS and ASR tasks using the same data for training, thanks to the simplified pipeline and the S3Tokenizer that reduces the quality requirements for TTS training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08237v2,2024-12
DocSum: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training for Document Abstractive Summarization,"Phan Phuong Mai Chau, Souhail Bakkali, Antoine Doucet","Abstractive summarization has made significant strides in condensing and rephrasing large volumes of text into coherent summaries. However, summarizing administrative documents presents unique challenges due to domain-specific terminology, OCR-generated errors, and the scarcity of annotated datasets for model fine-tuning. Existing models often struggle to adapt to the intricate structure and specialized content of such documents. To address these limitations, we introduce DocSum, a domain-adaptive abstractive summarization framework tailored for administrative documents. Leveraging pre-training on OCR-transcribed text and fine-tuning with an innovative integration of question-answer pairs, DocSum enhances summary accuracy and relevance. This approach tackles the complexities inherent in administrative content, ensuring outputs that align with real-world business needs. To evaluate its capabilities, we define a novel downstream task setting-Document Abstractive Summarization-which reflects the practical requirements of business and organizational settings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate DocSum's effectiveness in producing high-quality summaries, showcasing its potential to improve decision-making and operational workflows across the public and private sectors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08196v1,2024-12
From communities to interpretable network and word embedding: an unified approach,"Thibault Prouteau, Nicolas Dugué, Simon Guillot","Modelling information from complex systems such as humans social interaction or words co-occurrences in our languages can help to understand how these systems are organized and function. Such systems can be modelled by networks, and network theory provides a useful set of methods to analyze them. Among these methods, graph embedding is a powerful tool to summarize the interactions and topology of a network in a vectorized feature space. When used in input of machine learning algorithms, embedding vectors help with common graph problems such as link prediction, graph matching, etc. Word embedding has the goal of representing the sense of words, extracting it from large text corpora. Despite differences in the structure of information in input of embedding algorithms, many graph embedding approaches are adapted and inspired from methods in NLP. Limits of these methods are observed in both domains. Most of these methods require long and resource greedy training. Another downside to most methods is that they are black-box, from which understanding how the information is structured is rather complex. Interpretability of a model allows understanding how the vector space is structured without the need for external information, and thus can be audited more easily. With both these limitations in mind, we propose a novel framework to efficiently embed network vertices in an interpretable vector space. Our Lower Dimension Bipartite Framework (LDBGF) leverages the bipartite projection of a network using cliques to reduce dimensionality. Along with LDBGF, we introduce two implementations of this framework that rely on communities instead of cliques: SINr-NR and SINr-MF. We show that SINr-MF can perform well on classical graphs and SINr-NR can produce high-quality graph and word embeddings that are interpretable and stable across runs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08187v1,2024-12

Among open-source libraries for outlier detection, the Python Outlier Detection (PyOD) library is the most widely adopted, with over 8,500 GitHub stars, 25 million downloads, and diverse industry usage. However, PyOD currently faces three limitations: (1) insufficient coverage of modern deep learning algorithms, (2) fragmented implementations across PyTorch and TensorFlow, and (3) no automated model selection, making it hard for non-experts.   To address these issues, we present PyOD Version 2 (PyOD 2), which integrates 12 state-of-the-art deep learning models into a unified PyTorch framework and introduces a large language model (LLM)-based pipeline for automated OD model selection. These improvements simplify OD workflows, provide access to 45 algorithms, and deliver robust performance on various datasets.

Illusory VQA: Benchmarking and Enhancing Multimodal Models on Visual Illusions,"Mohammadmostafa Rostamkhani, Baktash Ansari, Hoorieh Sabzevari, Farzan Rahmani, Sauleh Eetemadi","In recent years, Visual Question Answering (VQA) has made significant strides, particularly with the advent of multimodal models that integrate vision and language understanding. However, existing VQA datasets often overlook the complexities introduced by image illusions, which pose unique challenges for both human perception and model interpretation. In this study, we introduce a novel task called Illusory VQA, along with four specialized datasets: IllusionMNIST, IllusionFashionMNIST, IllusionAnimals, and IllusionChar. These datasets are designed to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art multimodal models in recognizing and interpreting visual illusions. We assess the zero-shot performance of various models, fine-tune selected models on our datasets, and propose a simple yet effective solution for illusion detection using Gaussian and blur low-pass filters. We show that this method increases the performance of models significantly and in the case of BLIP-2 on IllusionAnimals without any fine-tuning, it outperforms humans. Our findings highlight the disparity between human and model perception of illusions and demonstrate that fine-tuning and specific preprocessing techniques can significantly enhance model robustness. This work contributes to the development of more human-like visual understanding in multimodal models and suggests future directions for adapting filters using learnable parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08169v1,2024-12
NLPineers@ NLU of Devanagari Script Languages 2025: Hate Speech Detection using Ensembling of BERT-based models,"Anmol Guragain, Nadika Poudel, Rajesh Piryani, Bishesh Khanal","This paper explores hate speech detection in Devanagari-scripted languages, focusing on Hindi and Nepali, for Subtask B of the CHIPSAL@COLING 2025 Shared Task. Using a range of transformer-based models such as XLM-RoBERTa, MURIL, and IndicBERT, we examine their effectiveness in navigating the nuanced boundary between hate speech and free expression. Our best performing model, implemented as ensemble of multilingual BERT models achieve Recall of 0.7762 (Rank 3/31 in terms of recall) and F1 score of 0.6914 (Rank 17/31). To address class imbalance, we used backtranslation for data augmentation, and cosine similarity to preserve label consistency after augmentation. This work emphasizes the need for hate speech detection in Devanagari-scripted languages and presents a foundation for further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08163v2,2024-12
How Vision-Language Tasks Benefit from Large Pre-trained Models: A Survey,"Yayun Qi, Hongxi Li, Yiqi Song, Xinxiao Wu, Jiebo Luo","The exploration of various vision-language tasks, such as visual captioning, visual question answering, and visual commonsense reasoning, is an important area in artificial intelligence and continuously attracts the research community's attention. Despite the improvements in overall performance, classic challenges still exist in vision-language tasks and hinder the development of this area. In recent years, the rise of pre-trained models is driving the research on vision-language tasks. Thanks to the massive scale of training data and model parameters, pre-trained models have exhibited excellent performance in numerous downstream tasks. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of pre-trained models, new paradigms have emerged to solve the classic challenges. Such methods have become mainstream in current research with increasing attention and rapid advances. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of how vision-language tasks benefit from pre-trained models. First, we review several main challenges in vision-language tasks and discuss the limitations of previous solutions before the era of pre-training. Next, we summarize the recent advances in incorporating pre-trained models to address the challenges in vision-language tasks. Finally, we analyze the potential risks associated with the inherent limitations of pre-trained models and discuss possible solutions, attempting to provide future research directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08158v1,2024-12
Decoding Poultry Vocalizations -- Natural Language Processing and Transformer Models for Semantic and Emotional Analysis,"Venkatraman Manikandan, Suresh Neethirajan","Deciphering the acoustic language of chickens offers new opportunities in animal welfare and ecological informatics. Their subtle vocal signals encode health conditions, emotional states, and dynamic interactions within ecosystems. Understanding the semantics of these calls provides a valuable tool for interpreting their functional vocabulary and clarifying how each sound serves a specific purpose in social and environmental contexts. We apply advanced Natural Language Processing and transformer based models to translate bioacoustic data into meaningful insights. Our method integrates Wave2Vec 2.0 for raw audio feature extraction with a fine tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model, pretrained on a broad corpus of animal sounds and adapted to poultry tasks. This pipeline decodes poultry vocalizations into interpretable categories including distress calls, feeding signals, and mating vocalizations, revealing emotional nuances often overlooked by conventional analyses. Achieving 92 percent accuracy in classifying key vocalization types, our approach demonstrates the feasibility of real time automated monitoring of flock health and stress. By tracking this functional vocabulary, farmers can respond proactively to environmental or behavioral changes, improving poultry welfare, reducing stress related productivity losses, and supporting more sustainable farm management. Beyond agriculture, this research enhances our understanding of computational ecology. Accessing the semantic foundation of animal calls may indicate biodiversity, environmental stressors, and species interactions, informing integrative ecosystem level decision making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16182v1,2024-12
Evil twins are not that evil: Qualitative insights into machine-generated prompts,"Nathanaël Carraz Rakotonirina, Corentin Kervadec, Francesca Franzon, Marco Baroni","It has been widely observed that language models (LMs) respond in predictable ways to algorithmically generated prompts that are seemingly unintelligible. This is both a sign that we lack a full understanding of how LMs work, and a practical challenge, because opaqueness can be exploited for harmful uses of LMs, such as jailbreaking. We present the first thorough analysis of opaque machine-generated prompts, or autoprompts, pertaining to 3 LMs of different sizes and families. We find that machine-generated prompts are characterized by a last token that is often intelligible and strongly affects the generation. A small but consistent proportion of the previous tokens are fillers that probably appear in the prompt as a by-product of the fact that the optimization process fixes the number of tokens. The remaining tokens tend to have at least a loose semantic relation with the generation, although they do not engage in well-formed syntactic relations with it. We find moreover that some of the ablations we applied to machine-generated prompts can also be applied to natural language sequences, leading to similar behavior, suggesting that autoprompts are a direct consequence of the way in which LMs process linguistic inputs in general.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08127v1,2024-12
Progressive Multi-granular Alignments for Grounded Reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models,"Quang-Hung Le, Long Hoang Dang, Ngan Le, Truyen Tran, Thao Minh Le","Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at matching concepts across multi-modal inputs but struggle with compositional concepts and high-level relationships between entities. This paper introduces Progressive multi-granular Vision-Language alignments (PromViL), a novel framework to enhance LVLMs' ability in performing grounded compositional visual reasoning tasks. Our approach constructs a hierarchical structure of multi-modal alignments, ranging from simple to complex concepts. By progressively aligning textual descriptions with corresponding visual regions, our model learns to leverage contextual information from lower levels to inform higher-level reasoning. To facilitate this learning process, we introduce a data generation process that creates a novel dataset derived from Visual Genome, providing a wide range of nested compositional vision-language pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our PromViL framework significantly outperforms baselines on various visual grounding and compositional question answering tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/lqh52/PromViL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08125v2,2024-12
LatentSpeech: Latent Diffusion for Text-To-Speech Generation,"Haowei Lou, Helen Paik, Pari Delir Haghighi, Wen Hu, Lina Yao","Diffusion-based Generative AI gains significant attention for its superior performance over other generative techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders. While it has achieved notable advancements in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, their application in speech generation remains under-explored. Mainstream Text-to-Speech systems primarily map outputs to Mel-Spectrograms in the spectral space, leading to high computational loads due to the sparsity of MelSpecs. To address these limitations, we propose LatentSpeech, a novel TTS generation approach utilizing latent diffusion models. By using latent embeddings as the intermediate representation, LatentSpeech reduces the target dimension to 5% of what is required for MelSpecs, simplifying the processing for the TTS encoder and vocoder and enabling efficient high-quality speech generation. This study marks the first integration of latent diffusion models in TTS, enhancing the accuracy and naturalness of generated speech. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LatentSpeech achieves a 25% improvement in Word Error Rate and a 24% improvement in Mel Cepstral Distortion compared to existing models, with further improvements rising to 49.5% and 26%, respectively, with additional training data. These findings highlight the potential of LatentSpeech to advance the state-of-the-art in TTS technology",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08117v1,2024-12
Aligner-Guided Training Paradigm: Advancing Text-to-Speech Models with Aligner Guided Duration,"Haowei Lou, Helen Paik, Wen Hu, Lina Yao","Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) systems, such as FastSpeech and StyleSpeech, have significantly improved speech generation quality. However, these models often rely on duration generated by external tools like the Montreal Forced Aligner, which can be time-consuming and lack flexibility. The importance of accurate duration is often underestimated, despite their crucial role in achieving natural prosody and intelligibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Aligner-Guided Training Paradigm that prioritizes accurate duration labelling by training an aligner before the TTS model. This approach reduces dependence on external tools and enhances alignment accuracy. We further explore the impact of different acoustic features, including Mel-Spectrograms, MFCCs, and latent features, on TTS model performance. Our experimental results show that aligner-guided duration labelling can achieve up to a 16\% improvement in word error rate and significantly enhance phoneme and tone alignment. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our approach in optimizing TTS systems for more natural and intelligible speech generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08112v1,2024-12
Seeing Syntax: Uncovering Syntactic Learning Limitations in Vision-Language Models,"Sri Harsha Dumpala, David Arps, Sageev Oore, Laura Kallmeyer, Hassan Sajjad","Vision-language models (VLMs), serve as foundation models for multi-modal applications such as image captioning and text-to-image generation. Recent studies have highlighted limitations in VLM text encoders, particularly in areas like compositionality and semantic understanding, though the underlying reasons for these limitations remain unclear. In this work, we aim to address this gap by analyzing the syntactic information, one of the fundamental linguistic properties, encoded by the text encoders of VLMs. We perform a thorough analysis comparing VLMs with different objective functions, parameter size and training data size, and with uni-modal language models (ULMs) in their ability to encode syntactic knowledge. Our findings suggest that ULM text encoders acquire syntactic information more effectively than those in VLMs. The syntactic information learned by VLM text encoders is shaped primarily by the pre-training objective, which plays a more crucial role than other factors such as model architecture, model size, or the volume of pre-training data. Models exhibit different layer-wise trends where CLIP performance dropped across layers while for other models, middle layers are rich in encoding syntactic knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08111v1,2024-12
Barking Up The Syntactic Tree: Enhancing VLM Training with Syntactic Losses,"Jiayun Luo, Mir Rayat Imtiaz Hossain, Boyang Li, Leonid Sigal","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieved strong performance on a variety of tasks (e.g., image-text retrieval, visual question answering). However, most VLMs rely on coarse-grained image-caption pairs for alignment, relying on data volume to resolve ambiguities and ground linguistic concepts in images. The richer semantic and syntactic structure within text is largely overlooked. To address this, we propose HIerarchically STructured Learning (HIST) that enhances VLM training without any additional supervision, by hierarchically decomposing captions into the constituent Subject, Noun Phrases, and Composite Phrases. Entailment between these constituent components allows us to formulate additional regularization constraints on the VLM attention maps. Specifically, we introduce two novel loss functions: (1) Subject Loss, which aligns image content with the subject of corresponding phrase, acting as an entailment of standard contrastive/matching losses at the Phrase level; (2) Addition Loss, to balance attention across multiple objects. HIST is general, and can be applied to any VLM for which attention between vision and language can be computed; we illustrate its efficacy on BLIP and ALBEF. HIST outperforms baseline VLMs, achieving up to +9.8% improvement in visual grounding, +6.3% in multi-object referring segmentation, +1.1% in image-text retrieval, and +0.2% in visual question answering, underscoring the value of structuring learning in VLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08110v1,2024-12
Rethinking Comprehensive Benchmark for Chart Understanding: A Perspective from Scientific Literature,"Lingdong Shen, Qigqi, Kun Ding, Gaofeng Meng, Shiming Xiang","Scientific Literature charts often contain complex visual elements, including multi-plot figures, flowcharts, structural diagrams and etc. Evaluating multimodal models using these authentic and intricate charts provides a more accurate assessment of their understanding abilities. However, existing benchmarks face limitations: a narrow range of chart types, overly simplistic template-based questions and visual elements, and inadequate evaluation methods. These shortcomings lead to inflated performance scores that fail to hold up when models encounter real-world scientific charts. To address these challenges, we introduce a new benchmark, Scientific Chart QA (SCI-CQA), which emphasizes flowcharts as a critical yet often overlooked category. To overcome the limitations of chart variety and simplistic visual elements, we curated a dataset of 202,760 image-text pairs from 15 top-tier computer science conferences papers over the past decade. After rigorous filtering, we refined this to 37,607 high-quality charts with contextual information. SCI-CQA also introduces a novel evaluation framework inspired by human exams, encompassing 5,629 carefully curated questions, both objective and open-ended. Additionally, we propose an efficient annotation pipeline that significantly reduces data annotation costs. Finally, we explore context-based chart understanding, highlighting the crucial role of contextual information in solving previously unanswerable questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12150v1,2024-12
Doubly-Universal Adversarial Perturbations: Deceiving Vision-Language Models Across Both Images and Text with a Single Perturbation,"Hee-Seon Kim, Minbeom Kim, Changick Kim","Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across multimodal tasks by integrating vision encoders with large language models (LLMs). However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Among such attacks, Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are especially powerful, as a single optimized perturbation can mislead the model across various input images. In this work, we introduce a novel UAP specifically designed for VLMs: the Doubly-Universal Adversarial Perturbation (Doubly-UAP), capable of universally deceiving VLMs across both image and text inputs. To successfully disrupt the vision encoder's fundamental process, we analyze the core components of the attention mechanism. After identifying value vectors in the middle-to-late layers as the most vulnerable, we optimize Doubly-UAP in a label-free manner with a frozen model. Despite being developed as a black-box to the LLM, Doubly-UAP achieves high attack success rates on VLMs, consistently outperforming baseline methods across vision-language tasks. Extensive ablation studies and analyses further demonstrate the robustness of Doubly-UAP and provide insights into how it influences internal attention mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08108v2,2024-12
Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting,"Fuqiang Liu, Sicong Jiang, Luis Miranda-Moreno, Seongjin Choi, Lijun Sun","Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08099v2,2024-12
Multilingual LLMs Inherently Reward In-Language Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment for Low-Resource Languages,"Ashutosh Bajpai, Tanmoy Chakraborty","The unwavering disparity in labeled resources between resource-rich languages and those considered low-resource remains a significant impediment for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent strides in cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL), mainly through semantically aligned examples retrieved from multilingual pre-trained transformers, have shown promise in mitigating this issue. However, our investigation reveals that LLMs intrinsically reward in-language semantically aligned cross-lingual instances over direct cross-lingual semantic alignments, with a pronounced disparity in handling time-sensitive queries in the X-ICL setup. Such queries demand sound temporal reasoning ability from LLMs, yet the advancements have predominantly focused on English. This study aims to bridge this gap by improving temporal reasoning capabilities in low-resource languages. To this end, we introduce mTEMPREASON a temporal reasoning dataset aimed at the varied degrees of low-resource languages and propose Cross-Lingual Time-Sensitive Semantic Alignment (CLiTSSA), a novel method to improve temporal reasoning in these contexts. To facilitate this, we construct an extension of mTEMPREASON comprising pairs of parallel cross-language temporal queries along with their anticipated in-language semantic similarity scores. Our empirical evidence underscores the superior performance of CLiTSSA compared to established baselines across three languages - Romanian, German, and French, encompassing three temporal tasks and including a diverse set of four contemporaneous LLMs. This marks a significant step forward in addressing resource disparity in the context of temporal reasoning across languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08090v1,2024-12
NAT-NL2GQL: A Novel Multi-Agent Framework for Translating Natural Language to Graph Query Language,"Yuanyuan Liang, Tingyu Xie, Gan Peng, Zihao Huang, Yunshi Lan, Weining Qian","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized many fields, not only traditional natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recently, research on applying LLMs to the database field has been booming, and as a typical non-relational database, the use of LLMs in graph database research has naturally gained significant attention. Recent efforts have increasingly focused on leveraging LLMs to translate natural language into graph query language (NL2GQL). Although some progress has been made, these methods have clear limitations, such as their reliance on streamlined processes that often overlook the potential of LLMs to autonomously plan and collaborate with other LLMs in tackling complex NL2GQL challenges. To address this gap, we propose NAT-NL2GQL, a novel multi-agent framework for translating natural language to graph query language. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic agents: the Preprocessor agent, the Generator agent, and the Refiner agent. The Preprocessor agent manages data processing as context, including tasks such as name entity recognition, query rewriting, path linking, and the extraction of query-related schemas. The Generator agent is a fine-tuned LLM trained on NL-GQL data, responsible for generating corresponding GQL statements based on queries and their related schemas. The Refiner agent is tasked with refining the GQL or context using error information obtained from the GQL execution results. Given the scarcity of high-quality open-source NL2GQL datasets based on nGQL syntax, we developed StockGQL, a dataset constructed from a financial market graph database. It is available at: https://github.com/leonyuancode/StockGQL. Experimental results on the StockGQL and SpCQL datasets reveal that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting its potential for advancing NL2GQL research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10434v1,2024-12
Imitate Before Detect: Aligning Machine Stylistic Preference for Machine-Revised Text Detection,"Jiaqi Chen, Xiaoye Zhu, Tianyang Liu, Ying Chen, Xinhui Chen, Yiwen Yuan, Chak Tou Leong, Zuchao Li, Tang Long, Lei Zhang, Chenyu Yan, Guanghao Mei, Jie Zhang, Lefei Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized text generation, making detecting machine-generated text increasingly challenging. Although past methods have achieved good performance on detecting pure machine-generated text, those detectors have poor performance on distinguishing machine-revised text (rewriting, expansion, and polishing), which can have only minor changes from its original human prompt. As the content of text may originate from human prompts, detecting machine-revised text often involves identifying distinctive machine styles, e.g., worded favored by LLMs. However, existing methods struggle to detect machine-style phrasing hidden within the content contributed by humans. We propose the ""Imitate Before Detect"" (ImBD) approach, which first imitates the machine-style token distribution, and then compares the distribution of the text to be tested with the machine-style distribution to determine whether the text has been machine-revised. To this end, we introduce style preference optimization (SPO), which aligns a scoring LLM model to the preference of text styles generated by machines. The aligned scoring model is then used to calculate the style-conditional probability curvature (Style-CPC), quantifying the log probability difference between the original and conditionally sampled texts for effective detection. We conduct extensive comparisons across various scenarios, encompassing text revisions by six LLMs, four distinct text domains, and three machine revision types. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our method yields a 13% increase in AUC for detecting text revised by open-source LLMs, and improves performance by 5% and 19% for detecting GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o revised text, respectively. Notably, our method surpasses the commercially trained GPT-Zero with just $1,000$ samples and five minutes of SPO, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10432v2,2024-12
Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning,"Panlong Wu, Kangshuo Li, Junbao Nan, Fangxin Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized intelligent services by enabling logical reasoning, tool use, and interaction with external systems as agents. The advancement of LLMs is frequently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality data, much of which is inherently sensitive. Federated learning (FL) offers a potential solution by facilitating the collaborative training of distributed LLMs while safeguarding private data. However, FL frameworks face significant bandwidth and computational demands, along with challenges from heterogeneous data distributions. The emerging in-context learning capability of LLMs offers a promising approach by aggregating natural language rather than bulky model parameters. Yet, this method risks privacy leakage, as it necessitates the collection and presentation of data samples from various clients during aggregation. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving Federated In-Context LLM Agent Learning (FICAL) algorithm, which to our best knowledge for the first work unleashes the power of in-context learning to train diverse LLM agents through FL. In our design, knowledge compendiums generated by a novel LLM-enhanced Knowledge Compendiums Generation (KCG) module are transmitted between clients and the server instead of model parameters in previous FL methods. Apart from that, an incredible Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Tool Learning and Utilizing (TLU) module is designed and we incorporate the aggregated global knowledge compendium as a teacher to teach LLM agents the usage of tools. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that FICAL has competitive performance compared to other SOTA baselines with a significant communication cost decrease of $\mathbf{3.33\times10^5}$ times.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08054v1,2024-12
M2SE: A Multistage Multitask Instruction Tuning Strategy for Unified Sentiment and Emotion Analysis,"Ao Li, Longwei Xu, Chen Ling, Jinghui Zhang, Pengwei Wang","Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition are crucial for applications such as human-computer interaction and depression detection. Traditional unimodal methods often fail to capture the complexity of emotional expressions due to conflicting signals from different modalities. Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) also face challenges in detecting subtle facial expressions and addressing a wide range of emotion-related tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose M2SE, a Multistage Multitask Sentiment and Emotion Instruction Tuning Strategy for general-purpose MLLMs. It employs a combined approach to train models on tasks such as multimodal sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, facial expression recognition, emotion reason inference, and emotion cause-pair extraction. We also introduce the Emotion Multitask dataset (EMT), a custom dataset that supports these five tasks. Our model, Emotion Universe (EmoVerse), is built on a basic MLLM framework without modifications, yet it achieves substantial improvements across these tasks when trained with the M2SE strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EmoVerse outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in sentiment and emotion tasks. These results highlight the effectiveness of M2SE in enhancing multimodal emotion perception.

Bootstrapping Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning via Large Language Models: A Generalized Approach,"Hang Gao, Chenhao Zhang, Fengge Wu, Junsuo Zhao, Changwen Zheng, Huaping Liu","Graph representation learning methods are highly effective in handling complex non-Euclidean data by capturing intricate relationships and features within graph structures. However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks.

TinyThinker: Distilling Reasoning through Coarse-to-Fine Knowledge Internalization with Self-Reflection,"Shengmin Piao, Sanghyun Park","Large Language Models exhibit impressive reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks, motivating efforts to distill these capabilities into smaller models through generated reasoning data. However, direct training on such synthesized reasoning data may lead to superficial imitation of reasoning process, rather than fostering a genuine integration of reasoning capabilities with underlying knowledge. To address this, we propose TinyThinker, a framework introducing two novel approaches. First, we introduce a three-stage process that incrementally guides the student model through the reasoning process, progressively refining knowledge from coarse to fine granularity. Second, we develop a two-phase training framework comprising an initial reasoning acquisition phase followed by a self-reflection phase utilizing self-generated data. Experiments on commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that TinyThinker achieves superior performance compared to baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component in our framework. TinyThinker is extendable to other knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, offering an alternative strategy for developing effective reasoning capabilities in smaller language models.

Concept Bottleneck Large Language Models,"Chung-En Sun, Tuomas Oikarinen, Berk Ustun, Tsui-Wei Weng","We introduce the Concept Bottleneck Large Language Model (CB-LLM), a pioneering approach to creating inherently interpretable Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike traditional black-box LLMs that rely on post-hoc interpretation methods with limited neuron function insights, CB-LLM sets a new standard with its built-in interpretability, scalability, and ability to provide clear, accurate explanations. We investigate two essential tasks in the NLP domain: text classification and text generation. In text classification, CB-LLM narrows the performance gap with traditional black-box models and provides clear interpretability. In text generation, we show how interpretable neurons in CB-LLM can be used for concept detection and steering text generation. Our CB-LLMs enable greater interaction between humans and LLMs across a variety of tasks -- a feature notably absent in existing LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trustworthy-ML-Lab/CB-LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07992v1,2024-12
Observing Micromotives and Macrobehavior of Large Language Models,"Yuyang Cheng, Xingwei Qu, Tomas Goldsack, Chenghua Lin, Chung-Chi Chen","Thomas C. Schelling, awarded the 2005 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, pointed out that ``individuals decisions (micromotives), while often personal and localized, can lead to societal outcomes (macrobehavior) that are far more complex and different from what the individuals intended.'' The current research related to large language models' (LLMs') micromotives, such as preferences or biases, assumes that users will make more appropriate decisions once LLMs are devoid of preferences or biases. Consequently, a series of studies has focused on removing bias from LLMs. In the NLP community, while there are many discussions on LLMs' micromotives, previous studies have seldom conducted a systematic examination of how LLMs may influence society's macrobehavior. In this paper, we follow the design of Schelling's model of segregation to observe the relationship between the micromotives and macrobehavior of LLMs. Our results indicate that, regardless of the level of bias in LLMs, a highly segregated society will emerge as more people follow LLMs' suggestions. We hope our discussion will spark further consideration of the fundamental assumption regarding the mitigation of LLMs' micromotives and encourage a reevaluation of how LLMs may influence users and society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10428v1,2024-12
Machines of Meaning,"Davide Nunes, Luis Antunes","One goal of Artificial Intelligence is to learn meaningful representations for natural language expressions, but what this entails is not always clear. A variety of new linguistic behaviours present themselves embodied as computers, enhanced humans, and collectives with various kinds of integration and communication. But to measure and understand the behaviours generated by such systems, we must clarify the language we use to talk about them. Computational models are often confused with the phenomena they try to model and shallow metaphors are used as justifications for (or to hype) the success of computational techniques on many tasks related to natural language; thus implying their progress toward human-level machine intelligence without ever clarifying what that means.   This paper discusses the challenges in the specification of ""machines of meaning"", machines capable of acquiring meaningful semantics from natural language in order to achieve their goals. We characterize ""meaning"" in a computational setting, while highlighting the need for detachment from anthropocentrism in the study of the behaviour of machines of meaning. The pressing need to analyse AI risks and ethics requires a proper measurement of its capabilities which cannot be productively studied and explained while using ambiguous language. We propose a view of ""meaning"" to facilitate the discourse around approaches such as neural language models and help broaden the research perspectives for technology that facilitates dialogues between humans and machines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07975v1,2024-12

HalluCana detects and intervenes as soon as traces of hallucination emerge, during and even before generation. To support timely detection, we exploit the internal factuality representation in the LLM hidden space, where we investigate various proxies to the LLMs' factuality self-assessment, and discuss its relation to the models' context familiarity from their pre-training. On biography generation, our method improves generation quality by up to 2.5x, while consuming over 6 times less compute.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07965v1,2024-12
Forking Paths in Neural Text Generation,"Eric Bigelow, Ari Holtzman, Hidenori Tanaka, Tomer Ullman","Estimating uncertainty in Large Language Models (LLMs) is important for properly evaluating LLMs, and ensuring safety for users. However, prior approaches to uncertainty estimation focus on the final answer in generated text, ignoring intermediate steps that might dramatically impact the outcome. We hypothesize that there exist key forking tokens, such that re-sampling the system at those specific tokens, but not others, leads to very different outcomes. To test this empirically, we develop a novel approach to representing uncertainty dynamics across individual tokens of text generation, and applying statistical models to test our hypothesis. Our approach is highly flexible: it can be applied to any dataset and any LLM, without fine tuning or accessing model weights. We use our method to analyze LLM responses on 7 different tasks across 4 domains, spanning a wide range of typical use cases. We find many examples of forking tokens, including surprising ones such as punctuation marks, suggesting that LLMs are often just a single token away from saying something very different.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07961v1,2024-12

How to Choose a Threshold for an Evaluation Metric for Large Language Models,"Bhaskarjit Sarmah, Mingshu Li, Jingrao Lyu, Sebastian Frank, Nathalia Castellanos, Stefano Pasquali, Dhagash Mehta","To ensure and monitor large language models (LLMs) reliably, various evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature. However, there is little research on prescribing a methodology to identify a robust threshold on these metrics even though there are many serious implications of an incorrect choice of the thresholds during deployment of the LLMs. Translating the traditional model risk management (MRM) guidelines within regulated industries such as the financial industry, we propose a step-by-step recipe for picking a threshold for a given LLM evaluation metric. We emphasize that such a methodology should start with identifying the risks of the LLM application under consideration and risk tolerance of the stakeholders. We then propose concrete and statistically rigorous procedures to determine a threshold for the given LLM evaluation metric using available ground-truth data. As a concrete example to demonstrate the proposed methodology at work, we employ it on the Faithfulness metric, as implemented in various publicly available libraries, using the publicly available HaluBench dataset. We also lay a foundation for creating systematic approaches to select thresholds, not only for LLMs but for any GenAI applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12148v1,2024-12
Style-agnostic evaluation of ASR using multiple reference transcripts,"Quinten McNamara, Miguel Ángel del Río Fernández, Nishchal Bhandari, Martin Ratajczak, Danny Chen, Corey Miller, Migüel Jetté","Word error rate (WER) as a metric has a variety of limitations that have plagued the field of speech recognition. Evaluation datasets suffer from varying style, formality, and inherent ambiguity of the transcription task. In this work, we attempt to mitigate some of these differences by performing style-agnostic evaluation of ASR systems using multiple references transcribed under opposing style parameters. As a result, we find that existing WER reports are likely significantly over-estimating the number of contentful errors made by state-of-the-art ASR systems. In addition, we have found our multireference method to be a useful mechanism for comparing the quality of ASR models that differ in the stylistic makeup of their training data and target task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07937v1,2024-12
Asking Again and Again: Exploring LLM Robustness to Repeated Questions,Sagi Shaier,"This study examines whether large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, specifically the latest GPT-4o-mini, exhibit sensitivity to repeated prompts and whether repeating a question can improve response accuracy. We hypothesize that reiterating a question within a single prompt might enhance the model's focus on key elements of the query. To test this, we evaluate ChatGPT's performance on a large sample of two reading comprehension datasets under both open-book and closed-book settings, varying the repetition of each question to 1, 3, or 5 times per prompt. Our findings indicate that the model does not demonstrate sensitivity to repeated questions, highlighting its robustness and consistency in this context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07923v1,2024-12
Identifying Quantum Mechanical Statistics in Italian Corpora,"Diederik Aerts, Jonito Aerts Arguëlles, Lester Beltran, Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi, Sandro Sozzo","We present a theoretical and empirical investigation of the statistical behaviour of the words in a text produced by human language. To this aim, we analyse the word distribution of various texts of Italian language selected from a specific literary corpus. We firstly generalise a theoretical framework elaborated by ourselves to identify 'quantum mechanical statistics' in large-size texts. Then, we show that, in all analysed texts, words distribute according to 'Bose--Einstein statistics' and show significant deviations from 'Maxwell--Boltzmann statistics'. Next, we introduce an effect of 'word randomization' which instead indicates that the difference between the two statistical models is not as pronounced as in the original cases. These results confirm the empirical patterns obtained in texts of English language and strongly indicate that identical words tend to 'clump together' as a consequence of their meaning, which can be explained as an effect of 'quantum entanglement' produced through a phenomenon of 'contextual updating'. More, word randomization can be seen as the linguistic-conceptual equivalent of an increase of temperature which destroys 'coherence' and makes classical statistics prevail over quantum statistics. Some insights into the origin of quantum statistics in physics are finally provided.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07919v1,2024-12
Rethinking Emotion Annotations in the Era of Large Language Models,"Minxue Niu, Yara El-Tawil, Amrit Romana, Emily Mower Provost","Modern affective computing systems rely heavily on datasets with human-annotated emotion labels, for training and evaluation. However, human annotations are expensive to obtain, sensitive to study design, and difficult to quality control, because of the subjective nature of emotions. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on many Natural Language Understanding tasks, emerging as a promising tool for text annotation. In this work, we analyze the complexities of emotion annotation in the context of LLMs, focusing on GPT-4 as a leading model. In our experiments, GPT-4 achieves high ratings in a human evaluation study, painting a more positive picture than previous work, in which human labels served as the only ground truth. On the other hand, we observe differences between human and GPT-4 emotion perception, underscoring the importance of human input in annotation studies. To harness GPT-4's strength while preserving human perspective, we explore two ways of integrating GPT-4 into emotion annotation pipelines, showing its potential to flag low-quality labels, reduce the workload of human annotators, and improve downstream model learning performance and efficiency. Together, our findings highlight opportunities for new emotion labeling practices and suggest the use of LLMs as a promising tool to aid human annotation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07906v1,2024-12
CAP: Evaluation of Persuasive and Creative Image Generation,"Aysan Aghazadeh, Adriana Kovashka","We address the task of advertisement image generation and introduce three evaluation metrics to assess Creativity, prompt Alignment, and Persuasiveness (CAP) in generated advertisement images. Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation and their performance in generating high-quality images for explicit descriptions, evaluating these models remains challenging. Existing evaluation methods focus largely on assessing alignment with explicit, detailed descriptions, but evaluating alignment with visually implicit prompts remains an open problem. Additionally, creativity and persuasiveness are essential qualities that enhance the effectiveness of advertisement images, yet are seldom measured. To address this, we propose three novel metrics for evaluating the creativity, alignment, and persuasiveness of generated images. Our findings reveal that current T2I models struggle with creativity, persuasiveness, and alignment when the input text is implicit messages. We further introduce a simple yet effective approach to enhance T2I models' capabilities in producing images that are better aligned, more creative, and more persuasive.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10426v1,2024-12
Evaluation Agent: Efficient and Promptable Evaluation Framework for Visual Generative Models,"Fan Zhang, Shulin Tian, Ziqi Huang, Yu Qiao, Ziwei Liu","Recent advancements in visual generative models have enabled high-quality image and video generation, opening diverse applications. However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results. The Evaluation Agent framework is fully open-sourced to advance research in visual generative models and their efficient evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09645v2,2024-12
Zero-Shot ATC Coding with Large Language Models for Clinical Assessments,"Zijian Chen, John-Michael Gamble, Micaela Jantzi, John P. Hirdes, Jimmy Lin","Manual assignment of Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes to prescription records is a significant bottleneck in healthcare research and operations at Ontario Health and InterRAI Canada, requiring extensive expert time and effort. To automate this process while maintaining data privacy, we develop a practical approach using locally deployable large language models (LLMs). Inspired by recent advances in automatic International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding, our method frames ATC coding as a hierarchical information extraction task, guiding LLMs through the ATC ontology level by level. We evaluate our approach using GPT-4o as an accuracy ceiling and focus development on open-source Llama models suitable for privacy-sensitive deployment. Testing across Health Canada drug product data, the RABBITS benchmark, and real clinical notes from Ontario Health, our method achieves 78% exact match accuracy with GPT-4o and 60% with Llama 3.1 70B. We investigate knowledge grounding through drug definitions, finding modest improvements in accuracy. Further, we show that fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B matches zero-shot Llama 3.1 70B accuracy, suggesting that effective ATC coding is feasible with smaller models. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of automatic ATC coding in privacy-sensitive healthcare environments, providing a foundation for future deployments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07743v1,2024-12

These models offer comprehensive coverage across multiple risk dimensions, including social bias, profanity, violence, sexual content, unethical behavior, jailbreaking, and hallucination-related risks such as context relevance, groundedness, and answer relevance for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Trained on a unique dataset combining human annotations from diverse sources and synthetic data, Granite Guardian models address risks typically overlooked by traditional risk detection models, such as jailbreaks and RAG-specific issues. With AUC scores of 0.871 and 0.854 on harmful content and RAG-hallucination-related benchmarks respectively, Granite Guardian is the most generalizable and competitive model available in the space.

TRIM: Token Reduction and Inference Modeling for Cost-Effective Language Generation,"Alfredo Garrachón Ruiz, Tomás de la Rosa, Daniel Borrajo","The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a significant challenge due to their computational demands, specially on tasks requiring long outputs. However, natural language often contains redundancy, which presents an opportunity for optimization. We have observed that LLMs can generate distilled language-concise outputs that retain essential meaning, when prompted appropriately. We propose TRIM, a pipeline for saving computational cost in which a shorter distilled output from the LLM is reconstructed into a full narrative by a smaller model with lower inference costs. Our experiments show promising results, particularly in general knowledge domains with 20.58% saved tokens on average with tiny decrease in evaluation metrics, hinting that this approach can effectively balance efficiency and accuracy in language processing tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07682v3,2024-12
Can linguists better understand DNA?,Wang Liang,"Multilingual transfer ability, which reflects how well models fine-tuned on one source language can be applied to other languages, has been well studied in multilingual pre-trained models. However, the existence of such capability transfer between natural language and gene sequences/languages remains underexplored.This study addresses this gap by drawing inspiration from the sentence-pair classification task used for evaluating sentence similarity in natural language. We constructed two analogous tasks: DNA-pair classification(DNA sequence similarity) and DNA-protein-pair classification(gene coding determination). These tasks were designed to validate the transferability of capabilities from natural language to gene sequences. Even a small-scale pre-trained model like GPT-2-small, which was pre-trained on English, achieved an accuracy of 78% on the DNA-pair classification task after being fine-tuned on English sentence-pair classification data(XTREME PAWS-X). While training a BERT model on multilingual text, the precision reached 82%.On the more complex DNA-protein-pair classification task, however, the model's output was barely distinguishable from random output.Experiments suggest that there may be a capability transfer from natural language to genetic language, but further task testing is needed to confirm this.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07678v1,2024-12
RAZOR: Sharpening Knowledge by Cutting Bias with Unsupervised Text Rewriting,"Shuo Yang, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci","Despite the widespread use of LLMs due to their superior performance in various tasks, their high computational costs often lead potential users to opt for the pretraining-finetuning pipeline. However, biases prevalent in manually constructed datasets can introduce spurious correlations between tokens and labels, creating so-called shortcuts and hindering the generalizability of fine-tuned models. Existing debiasing methods often rely on prior knowledge of specific dataset biases, which is challenging to acquire a priori. We propose RAZOR (Rewriting And Zero-bias Optimization Refinement), a novel, unsupervised, and data-focused debiasing approach based on text rewriting for shortcut mitigation. RAZOR leverages LLMs to iteratively rewrite potentially biased text segments by replacing them with heuristically selected alternatives in a shortcut space defined by token statistics and positional information. This process aims to align surface-level text features more closely with diverse label distributions, thereby promoting the learning of genuine linguistic patterns. Compared with unsupervised SoTA models, RAZOR improves by 3.5% on the FEVER and 6.5% on MNLI and SNLI datasets according to the F1 score. Additionally, RAZOR effectively mitigates specific known biases, reducing bias-related terms by x2 without requiring prior bias information, a result that is on par with SoTA models that leverage prior information. Our work prioritizes data manipulation over architectural modifications, emphasizing the pivotal role of data quality in enhancing model performance and fairness. This research contributes to developing more robust evaluation benchmarks for debiasing methods by incorporating metrics for bias reduction and overall model efficacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07675v3,2024-12
FlexLLM: Exploring LLM Customization for Moving Target Defense on Black-Box LLMs Against Jailbreak Attacks,"Bocheng Chen, Hanqing Guo, Qiben Yan","Defense in large language models (LLMs) is crucial to counter the numerous attackers exploiting these systems to generate harmful content through manipulated prompts, known as jailbreak attacks. Although many defense strategies have been proposed, they often require access to the model's internal structure or need additional training, which is impractical for service providers using LLM APIs, such as OpenAI APIs or Claude APIs. In this paper, we propose a moving target defense approach that alters decoding hyperparameters to enhance model robustness against various jailbreak attacks. Our approach does not require access to the model's internal structure and incurs no additional training costs. The proposed defense includes two key components: (1) optimizing the decoding strategy by identifying and adjusting decoding hyperparameters that influence token generation probabilities, and (2) transforming the decoding hyperparameters and model system prompts into dynamic targets, which are continuously altered during each runtime. By continuously modifying decoding strategies and prompts, the defense effectively mitigates the existing attacks. Our results demonstrate that our defense is the most effective against jailbreak attacks in three of the models tested when using LLMs as black-box APIs. Moreover, our defense offers lower inference costs and maintains comparable response quality, making it a potential layer of protection when used alongside other defense methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07672v1,2024-12
Active Inference for Self-Organizing Multi-LLM Systems: A Bayesian Thermodynamic Approach to Adaptation,Rithvik Prakki,"This paper introduces a novel approach to creating adaptive language agents by integrating active inference with large language models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their reliance on static prompts limits adaptation to new information and changing environments. We address this by implementing an active inference framework that acts as a cognitive layer above an LLM-based agent, dynamically adjusting prompts and search strategies through principled information-seeking behavior. Our framework models the environment using three state factors (prompt, search, and information states) with seven observation modalities capturing quality metrics. By framing the agent's learning through the free energy principle, we enable systematic exploration of prompt combinations and search strategies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with the agent developing accurate models of environment dynamics evidenced by emergent structure in observation matrices. Action selection patterns reveal sophisticated exploration-exploitation behavior, transitioning from initial information-gathering to targeted prompt testing. The integration of thermodynamic principles with language model capabilities provides a principled framework for creating robust, adaptable agents, extending active inference beyond traditional low-dimensional control problems to high-dimensional, language-driven environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10425v2,2024-12
Searching for Structure: Investigating Emergent Communication with Large Language Models,"Tom Kouwenhoven, Max Peeperkorn, Tessa Verhoef","Human languages have evolved to be structured through repeated language learning and use. These processes introduce biases that operate during language acquisition and shape linguistic systems toward communicative efficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether the same happens if artificial languages are optimised for implicit biases of Large Language Models (LLMs). To this end, we simulate a classical referential game in which LLMs learn and use artificial languages. Our results show that initially unstructured holistic languages are indeed shaped to have some structural properties that allow two LLM agents to communicate successfully. Similar to observations in human experiments, generational transmission increases the learnability of languages, but can at the same time result in non-humanlike degenerate vocabularies. Taken together, this work extends experimental findings, shows that LLMs can be used as tools in simulations of language evolution, and opens possibilities for future human-machine experiments in this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07646v3,2024-12
ChocoLlama: Lessons Learned From Teaching Llamas Dutch,"Matthieu Meeus, Anthony Rathé, François Remy, Pieter Delobelle, Jens-Joris Decorte, Thomas Demeester","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, their performance often lags in lower-resource, non-English languages due to biases in the training data. In this work, we explore strategies for adapting the primarily English LLMs (Llama-2 and Llama-3) to Dutch, a language spoken by 30 million people worldwide yet often underrepresented in LLM development. We collect 104GB of Dutch text ($32$B tokens) from various sources to first apply continued pretraining using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), complemented with Dutch posttraining strategies provided by prior work. For Llama-2, we consider using (i) the tokenizer of the original model, and (ii) training a new, Dutch-specific tokenizer combined with embedding reinitialization. We evaluate our adapted models, ChocoLlama-2, both on standard benchmarks and a novel Dutch benchmark, ChocoLlama-Bench. Our results demonstrate that LoRA can effectively scale for language adaptation, and that tokenizer modification with careful weight reinitialization can improve performance. Notably, Llama-3 was released during the course of this project and, upon evaluation, demonstrated superior Dutch capabilities compared to our Dutch-adapted versions of Llama-2. We hence apply the same adaptation technique to Llama-3, using its original tokenizer. While our adaptation methods enhanced Llama-2's Dutch capabilities, we found limited gains when applying the same techniques to Llama-3. This suggests that for ever improving, multilingual foundation models, language adaptation techniques may benefit more from focusing on language-specific posttraining rather than on continued pretraining. We hope this work contributes to the broader understanding of adapting LLMs to lower-resource languages, and to the development of Dutch LLMs in particular.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07633v1,2024-12
Piece of Table: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Selecting Sub-Tables in Table Question Answering,"Wonjin Lee, Kyumin Kim, Sungjae Lee, Jihun Lee, Kwang In Kim","Applying language models (LMs) to tables is challenging due to the inherent structural differences between two-dimensional tables and one-dimensional text for which the LMs were originally designed. Furthermore, when applying linearized tables to LMs, the maximum token lengths often imposed in self-attention calculations make it difficult to comprehensively understand the context spread across large tables. To address these challenges, we present PieTa (Piece of Table), a new framework for sub-table-based question answering (QA). PieTa operates through an iterative process of dividing tables into smaller windows, using LMs to select relevant cells within each window, and merging these cells into a sub-table. This multi-resolution approach captures dependencies across multiple rows and columns while avoiding the limitations caused by long context inputs. Instantiated as a simple iterative sub-table union algorithm, PieTa demonstrates improved performance over previous sub-table-based QA approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07629v2,2024-12
DRUM: Learning Demonstration Retriever for Large MUlti-modal Models,"Ellen Yi-Ge, Jiechao Gao, Wei Han, Wei Zhu","Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dealing with new tasks with the help of in-context learning (ICL). In the study of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), when implementing ICL, researchers usually adopts the naive strategies like fixed demonstrations across different samples, or selecting demonstrations directly via a visual-language embedding model. These methods does not guarantee the configured demonstrations fit the need of the LVLMs. To address this issue, we now propose a novel framework, \underline{d}emonstration \underline{r}etriever for large m\underline{u}lti-modal \underline{m}odel (DRUM), which fine-tunes the visual-language embedding model to better meet the LVLM's needs. First, we discuss the retrieval strategies for a visual-language task, assuming an embedding model is given. And we propose to concate the image and text embeddings to enhance the retrieval performance. Second, we propose to re-rank the demonstrations retrieved by the embedding model via the LVLM's feedbacks, and calculate a list-wise ranking loss for training the embedding model. Third, we propose an iterative demonstration mining strategy to improve the training of the embedding model. Through extensive experiments on 3 types of visual-language tasks, 7 benchmark datasets, our DRUM framework is proven to be effective in boosting the LVLM's in-context learning performance via retrieving more proper demonstrations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07619v1,2024-12
Adapting to Non-Stationary Environments: Multi-Armed Bandit Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Knowledge Graphs,"Xiaqiang Tang, Jian Li, Nan Du, Sihong Xie","Despite the superior performance of Large language models on many NLP tasks, they still face significant limitations in memorizing extensive world knowledge. Recent studies have demonstrated that leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, combined with Knowledge Graphs that encapsulate extensive factual data in a structured format, robustly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, deploying such systems in real-world scenarios presents challenges: the continuous evolution of non-stationary environments may lead to performance degradation and user satisfaction requires a careful balance of performance and responsiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce a Multi-objective Multi-Armed Bandit enhanced RAG framework, supported by multiple retrieval methods with diverse capabilities under rich and evolving retrieval contexts in practice. Within this framework, each retrieval method is treated as a distinct ``arm''. The system utilizes real-time user feedback to adapt to dynamic environments, by selecting the appropriate retrieval method based on input queries and the historical multi-objective performance of each arm. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in non-stationary settings while achieving state-of-the-art performance in stationary environments.

Subtopic-aware View Sampling and Temporal Aggregation for Long-form Document Matching,"Youchao Zhou, Heyan Huang, Zhijing Wu, Yuhang Liu, Xinglin Wang","Long-form document matching aims to judge the relevance between two documents and has been applied to various scenarios. Most existing works utilize hierarchical or long context models to process documents, which achieve coarse understanding but may ignore details. Some researchers construct a document view with similar sentences about aligned document subtopics to focus on detailed matching signals. However, a long document generally contains multiple subtopics. The matching signals are heterogeneous from multiple topics. Considering only the homologous aligned subtopics may not be representative enough and may cause biased modeling. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to model representative matching signals. First, we propose to capture various matching signals through subtopics of document pairs. Next, We construct multiple document views based on subtopics to cover heterogeneous and valuable details. However, existing spatial aggregation methods like attention, which integrate all these views simultaneously, are hard to integrate heterogeneous information. Instead, we propose temporal aggregation, which effectively integrates different views gradually as the training progresses. Experimental results show that our learning framework is effective on several document-matching tasks, including news duplication and legal case retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07573v2,2024-12
LLM-as-an-Interviewer: Beyond Static Testing Through Dynamic LLM Evaluation,"Eunsu Kim, Juyoung Suk, Seungone Kim, Niklas Muennighoff, Dongkwan Kim, Alice Oh","We introduce LLM-as-an-Interviewer, a novel paradigm for evaluating large language models (LLMs). This approach leverages multi-turn interactions where the LLM interviewer actively provides feedback on responses and poses follow-up questions to the evaluated LLM. At the start of the interview, the LLM interviewer dynamically modifies datasets to generate initial questions, mitigating data contamination. We apply the LLM-as-an-Interviewer framework to evaluate six models on the MATH and DepthQA tasks. Our results show that the framework effectively provides insights into LLM performance, including the quality of initial responses, adaptability to feedback, and ability to address follow-up queries like clarification or additional knowledge requests. The framework also addresses key limitations of conventional methods like LLM-as-a-Judge, including verbosity bias and inconsistency across runs. Finally, we propose the Interview Report, which aggregates insights from the interview process, providing examples and a comprehensive analysis of the LLM's strengths and weaknesses. This report offers a detailed snapshot of the model's real-world applicability.

CoPrUS: Consistency Preserving Utterance Synthesis towards more realistic benchmark dialogues,"Sebastian Steindl, Ulrich Schäfer, Bernd Ludwig","Large-scale Wizard-Of-Oz dialogue datasets have enabled the training of deep learning-based dialogue systems. While they are successful as benchmark datasets, they lack certain types of utterances, which would make them more realistic. In this work, we investigate the creation of synthetic communication errors in an automatic pipeline. Based on linguistic theory, we propose and follow a simple error taxonomy. We focus on three types of miscommunications that could happen in real-world dialogues but are underrepresented in the benchmark dataset: misunderstandings, non-understandings and vaguely related questions. Our two-step approach uses a state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) to first create the error and secondly the repairing utterance. We perform Language Model-based evaluation to ensure the quality of the generated utterances. We apply the method to the MultiWOZ dataset and evaluate it both qualitatively and empirically as well as with human judges. Our results indicate that current LLMs can aid in adding post-hoc miscommunications to benchmark datasets as a form of data augmentation. We publish the resulting dataset, in which nearly 1900 dialogues have been modified, as CoPrUS-MultiWOZ to facilitate future work on dialogue systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07515v1,2024-12
Look Before You Leap: Enhancing Attention and Vigilance Regarding Harmful Content with GuidelineLLM,"Shaoqing Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Kehai Chen, Rongxiang Weng, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao, Min Zhang","Despite being empowered with alignment mechanisms, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to emerging jailbreak attacks that can compromise their alignment mechanisms. This vulnerability poses significant risks to the real-world applications. Existing work faces challenges in both training efficiency and generalization capabilities (i.e., Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Red-Teaming). Developing effective strategies to enable LLMs to resist continuously evolving jailbreak attempts represents a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defensive paradigm called GuidelineLLM, which assists LLMs in recognizing queries that may have harmful content. Before LLMs respond to a query, GuidelineLLM first identifies potential risks associated with the query, summarizes these risks into guideline suggestions, and then feeds these guidelines to the responding LLMs. Importantly, our approach eliminates the necessity for additional safety fine-tuning of the LLMs themselves; only the GuidelineLLM requires fine-tuning. This characteristic enhances the general applicability of GuidelineLLM across various LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that GuidelineLLM can significantly reduce the attack success rate (ASR) against the LLMs (an average reduction of 34.17\% ASR) while maintaining the helpfulness of the LLMs in handling benign queries.

Bilingual BSARD: Extending Statutory Article Retrieval to Dutch,"Ehsan Lotfi, Nikolay Banar, Nerses Yuzbashyan, Walter Daelemans","Statutory article retrieval plays a crucial role in making legal information more accessible to both laypeople and legal professionals. Multilingual countries like Belgium present unique challenges for retrieval models due to the need for handling legal issues in multiple languages. Building on the Belgian Statutory Article Retrieval Dataset (BSARD) in French, we introduce the bilingual version of this dataset, bBSARD. The dataset contains parallel Belgian statutory articles in both French and Dutch, along with legal questions from BSARD and their Dutch translation. Using bBSARD, we conduct extensive benchmarking of retrieval models available for Dutch and French. Our benchmarking setup includes lexical models, zero-shot dense models, and fine-tuned small foundation models. Our experiments show that BM25 remains a competitive baseline compared to many zero-shot dense models in both languages. We also observe that while proprietary models outperform open alternatives in the zero-shot setting, they can be matched or surpassed by fine-tuning small language-specific models.

Causal World Representation in the GPT Model,"Raanan Y. Rohekar, Yaniv Gurwicz, Sungduk Yu, Vasudev Lal","Are generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models only trained to predict the next token, or do they implicitly learn a world model from which a sequence is generated one token at a time? We examine this question by deriving a causal interpretation of the attention mechanism in GPT, and suggesting a causal world model that arises from this interpretation. Furthermore, we propose that GPT-models, at inference time, can be utilized for zero-shot causal structure learning for in-distribution sequences. Empirical evaluation is conducted in a controlled synthetic environment using the setup and rules of the Othello board game. A GPT, pre-trained on real-world games played with the intention of winning, is tested on synthetic data that only adheres to the game rules. We find that the GPT model tends to generate next moves that adhere to the game rules for sequences for which the attention mechanism encodes a causal structure with high confidence. In general, in cases for which the GPT model generates moves that do not adhere to the game rules, it also fails to capture any causal structure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07446v1,2024-12
Knowledge Graph Guided Evaluation of Abstention Techniques,"Kinshuk Vasisht, Navreet Kaur, Danish Pruthi","To deploy language models safely, it is crucial that they abstain from responding to inappropriate requests. Several prior studies test the safety promises of models based on their effectiveness in blocking malicious requests. In this work, we focus on evaluating the underlying techniques that cause models to abstain. We create SELECT, a benchmark derived from a set of benign concepts (e.g., ""rivers"") from a knowledge graph. The nature of SELECT enables us to isolate the effects of abstention techniques from other safety training procedures, as well as evaluate their generalization and specificity. Using SELECT, we benchmark different abstention techniques over six open-weight and closed-source models. We find that the examined techniques indeed cause models to abstain with over $80\%$ abstention rates. However, these techniques are not as effective for descendants of the target concepts, with refusal rates declining by $19\%$. We also characterize the generalization-vs-specificity trade-offs for different techniques. Overall, no single technique is invariably better than the others. Our findings call for a careful evaluation of different aspects of abstention, and hopefully inform practitioners of various trade-offs involved.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07430v1,2024-12
Optimizing Alignment with Less: Leveraging Data Augmentation for Personalized Evaluation,"Javad Seraj, Mohammad Mahdi Mohajeri, Mohammad Javad Dousti, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi","Automatic evaluation by large language models (LLMs) is a prominent topic today; however, judgment and evaluation tasks are often subjective and influenced by various factors, making adaptation challenging. While many studies demonstrate the capabilities of state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs in comparison to human evaluators, they often struggle to adapt to reference evaluators over time, a requirement for achieving personalized judgment. Additionally, numerous works have attempted to apply open LLMs as judges or evaluators, but these efforts frequently overlook the limitations of working with scarce data. Personalized judgment is inherently associated with limited data scenarios, which are common in many real-world problems. Our work aims to present a data augmentation technique to select a more effective sample from limited data in order to align an open LLM with human preference. Our work achieves approximately 7% improvements in Pearson correlation with a reference judge over the baseline,and 30% improvement over the base model (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) in the mathematical reasoning evaluation task. demonstrating that augmenting selecting more effective preference data enables our approach to surpass baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07429v1,2024-12
RAG-based Question Answering over Heterogeneous Data and Text,"Philipp Christmann, Gerhard Weikum","This article presents the QUASAR system for question answering over unstructured text, structured tables, and knowledge graphs, with unified treatment of all sources. The system adopts a RAG-based architecture, with a pipeline of evidence retrieval followed by answer generation, with the latter powered by a moderate-sized language model. Additionally and uniquely, QUASAR has components for question understanding, to derive crisper input for evidence retrieval, and for re-ranking and filtering the retrieved evidence before feeding the most informative pieces into the answer generation. Experiments with three different benchmarks demonstrate the high answering quality of our approach, being on par with or better than large GPT models, while keeping the computational cost and energy consumption orders of magnitude lower.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07420v1,2024-12
Composing or Not Composing? Towards Distributional Construction Grammars,"Philippe Blache, Emmanuele Chersoni, Giulia Rambelli, Alessandro Lenci","The mechanisms of comprehension during language processing remains an open question. Classically, building the meaning of a linguistic utterance is said to be incremental, step-by-step, based on a compositional process. However, many different works have shown for a long time that non-compositional phenomena are also at work. It is therefore necessary to propose a framework bringing together both approaches. We present in this paper an approach based on Construction Grammars and completing this framework in order to account for these different mechanisms. We propose first a formal definition of this framework by completing the feature structure representation proposed in Sign-Based Construction Grammars. In a second step, we present a general representation of the meaning based on the interaction of constructions, frames and events. This framework opens the door to a processing mechanism for building the meaning based on the notion of activation evaluated in terms of similarity and unification. This new approach integrates features from distributional semantics into the constructionist framework, leading to what we call Distributional Construction Grammars.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07419v1,2024-12
"Generating Knowledge Graphs from Large Language Models: A Comparative Study of GPT-4, LLaMA 2, and BERT","Ahan Bhatt, Nandan Vaghela, Kush Dudhia","Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are essential for the functionality of GraphRAGs, a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generative Systems (RAGs) that excel in tasks requiring structured reasoning and semantic understanding. However, creating KGs for GraphRAGs remains a significant challenge due to accuracy and scalability limitations of traditional methods. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, LLaMA 2 (13B), and BERT to generate KGs directly from unstructured data, bypassing traditional pipelines. Using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Graph Edit Distance, and Semantic Similarity, we evaluate the models' ability to generate high-quality KGs. Results demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves superior semantic fidelity and structural accuracy, LLaMA 2 excels in lightweight, domain-specific graphs, and BERT provides insights into challenges in entity-relationship modeling. This study underscores the potential of LLMs to streamline KG creation and enhance GraphRAG accessibility for real-world applications, while setting a foundation for future advancements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07412v1,2024-12
AutoPrep: Natural Language Question-Aware Data Preparation with a Multi-Agent Framework,"Meihao Fan, Ju Fan, Nan Tang, Lei Cao, Guoliang Li, Xiaoyong Du","Answering natural language (NL) questions about tables, known as Tabular Question Answering (TQA), is crucial because it allows users to quickly and efficiently extract meaningful insights from structured data, effectively bridging the gap between human language and machine-readable formats. Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-aware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column augmentation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-of-Clauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10422v2,2024-12
CMT: A Memory Compression Method for Continual Knowledge Learning of Large Language Models,"Dongfang Li, Zetian Sun, Xinshuo Hu, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt to the continuous changes in data, tasks, and user preferences. Due to their massive size and the high costs associated with training, LLMs are not suitable for frequent retraining. However, updates are necessary to keep them in sync with rapidly evolving human knowledge. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Compression Memory Training (CMT) method, an efficient and effective online adaptation framework for LLMs that features robust knowledge retention capabilities. Inspired by human memory mechanisms, CMT compresses and extracts information from new documents to be stored in a memory bank. When answering to queries related to these new documents, the model aggregates these document memories from the memory bank to better answer user questions. The parameters of the LLM itself do not change during training and inference, reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To enhance the encoding, retrieval, and aggregation of memory, we further propose three new general and flexible techniques, including memory-aware objective, self-matching and top-aggregation. Extensive experiments conducted on three continual learning datasets (i.e., StreamingQA, SQuAD and ArchivalQA) demonstrate that the proposed method improves model adaptability and robustness across multiple base LLMs (e.g., +4.07 EM & +4.19 F1 in StreamingQA with Llama-2-7b).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07393v1,2024-12
A Review of Challenges in Speech-based Conversational AI for Elderly Care,"Willemijn Klaassen, Bram van Dijk, Marco Spruit","Artificially intelligent systems optimized for speech conversation are appearing at a fast pace. Such models are interesting from a healthcare perspective, as these voice-controlled assistants may support the elderly and enable remote health monitoring. The bottleneck for efficacy, however, is how well these devices work in practice and how the elderly experience them, but research on this topic is scant. We review elderly use of voice-controlled AI and highlight various user- and technology-centered issues, that need to be considered before effective speech-controlled AI for elderly care can be realized.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07388v1,2024-12
Algorithmic Phase Transitions in Language Models: A Mechanistic Case Study of Arithmetic,"Alan Sun, Ethan Sun, Warren Shepard","Zero-shot capabilities of large language models make them powerful tools for solving a range of tasks without explicit training. It remains unclear, however, how these models achieve such performance, or why they can zero-shot some tasks but not others. In this paper, we shed some light on this phenomenon by defining and investigating algorithmic stability in language models -- changes in problem-solving strategy employed by the model as a result of changes in task specification. We focus on a task where algorithmic stability is needed for generalization: two-operand arithmetic. Surprisingly, we find that Gemma-2-2b employs substantially different computational models on closely related subtasks, i.e. four-digit versus eight-digit addition. Our findings suggest that algorithmic instability may be a contributing factor to language models' poor zero-shot performance across certain logical reasoning tasks, as they struggle to abstract different problem-solving strategies and smoothly transition between them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07386v1,2024-12
SpecFuse: Ensembling Large Language Models via Next-Segment Prediction,"Bo Lv, Chen Tang, Yanan Zhang, Xin Liu, Yue Yu, Ping Luo","Ensembles of generative large language models (LLMs) can integrate the strengths of different LLMs to compensate for the limitations of individual models. However, recent work has focused on training an additional fusion model to combine complete responses from multiple LLMs, failing to tap into their collaborative potential to generate higher-quality responses. Moreover, as the additional fusion model is trained on a specialized dataset, these methods struggle with generalizing to open-domain queries from online users. In this paper, we propose SpecFuse, a novel ensemble framework that outputs the fused result by iteratively producing the next segment through collaboration among LLMs. This is achieved through cyclic execution of its inference and verification components. In each round, the inference component invokes each base LLM to generate candidate segments in parallel, and the verify component calls these LLMs again to predict the ranking of the segments. The top-ranked segment is then broadcast to all LLMs, encouraging them to generate higher-quality segments in the next round. This approach also allows the base LLMs to be plug-and-play, without any training or adaptation, avoiding generalization limitations. Furthermore, to conserve computational resources, we propose a model exit mechanism that dynamically excludes models exhibiting poor performance in previous rounds during each query response. In this way, it effectively reduces the number of model calls while maintaining overall performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07380v1,2024-12
Na'vi or Knave: Jailbreaking Language Models via Metaphorical Avatars,"Yu Yan, Sheng Sun, Junqi Tong, Min Liu, Qi Li","Metaphor serves as an implicit approach to convey information, while enabling the generalized comprehension of complex subjects. However, metaphor can potentially be exploited to bypass the safety alignment mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the theft of harmful knowledge. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits the imaginative capacity of LLMs to achieve jailbreaking, the J\underline{\textbf{A}}ilbreak \underline{\textbf{V}}ia \underline{\textbf{A}}dversarial Me\underline{\textbf{TA}} -pho\underline{\textbf{R}} (\textit{AVATAR}). Specifically, to elicit the harmful response, AVATAR extracts harmful entities from a given harmful target and maps them to innocuous adversarial entities based on LLM's imagination. Then, according to these metaphors, the harmful target is nested within human-like interaction for jailbreaking adaptively. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferablly jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs. Our study exposes a security risk in LLMs from their endogenous imaginative capabilities. Furthermore, the analytical study reveals the vulnerability of LLM to adversarial metaphors and the necessity of developing defense methods against jailbreaking caused by the adversarial metaphor. \textcolor{orange}{ \textbf{Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful content from LLMs.}}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12145v1,2024-12
My Words Imply Your Opinion: Reader Agent-Based Propagation Enhancement for Personalized Implicit Emotion Analysis,"Jian Liao, Yu Feng, Xiaoyu Wang, Suge Wang, Jianxing Zheng, Deyu Li","In implicit emotion analysis (IEA), the subtlety of emotional expressions makes it particularly sensitive to user-specific characteristics. Existing studies often inject personalization into the analysis by focusing on the authorial dimension of the emotional text. However, these methods overlook the potential influence of the intended reader on the reaction of implicit emotions. In this paper, we refine the IEA task to Personalized Implicit Emotion Analysis (PIEA) and introduce the RAPPIE model, a novel framework designed to address the issue of missing user information within this task. In particular, 1) we create reader agents based on the Large Language Model to simulate reader reactions, to address challenges of the spiral of silence and data incompleteness encountered when acquiring reader feedback information. 2) We establish a reader propagation role system and develop a role-aware emotion propagation multi-view graph learning model, which effectively deals with the sparsity of reader information by utilizing the distribution of propagation roles. 3) We annotate two Chinese PIEA datasets with detailed user metadata, thereby addressing the limitation of prior datasets that primarily focus on textual content annotation. Extensive experiments on these datasets indicate that the RAPPIE model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the significance and efficacy of incorporating reader feedback into the PIEA process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07367v1,2024-12
Towards Predictive Communication with Brain-Computer Interfaces integrating Large Language Models,Andrea Caria,"This perspective article aims at providing an outline of the state of the art and future developments towards the integration of cutting-edge predictive language models with BCI. A synthetic overview of early and more recent linguistic models, from natural language processing (NLP) models to recent LLM, that to a varying extent improved predictive writing systems, is first provided. Second, a summary of previous BCI implementations integrating language models is presented. The few preliminary studies investigating the possible combination of LLM with BCI spellers to efficiently support fast communication and control are then described. Finally, current challenges and limitations towards the full integration of LLM with BCI systems are discussed. Recent investigations suggest that the combination of LLM with BCI might drastically improve human-computer interaction in patients with motor or language disorders as well as in healthy individuals. In particular, the pretrained autoregressive transformer models, such as GPT, that capitalize from parallelization, learning through pre-training and fine-tuning, promise a substantial improvement of BCI for communication with respect to previous systems incorporating simpler language models. Indeed, among various models, the GPT-2 was shown to represent an excellent candidate for its integration into BCI although testing was only perfomed on simulated conversations and not on real BCI scenarios. Prospectively, the full integration of LLM with advanced BCI systems might lead to a big leap forward towards fast, efficient and user-adaptive neurotechnology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07355v1,2024-12
Frame Representation Hypothesis: Multi-Token LLM Interpretability and Concept-Guided Text Generation,"Pedro H. V. Valois, Lincon S. Souza, Erica K. Shimomoto, Kazuhiro Fukui","Interpretability is a key challenge in fostering trust for Large Language Models (LLMs), which stems from the complexity of extracting reasoning from model's parameters. We present the Frame Representation Hypothesis, a theoretically robust framework grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) to interpret and control LLMs by modeling multi-token words. Prior research explored LRH to connect LLM representations with linguistic concepts, but was limited to single token analysis. As most words are composed of several tokens, we extend LRH to multi-token words, thereby enabling usage on any textual data with thousands of concepts. To this end, we propose words can be interpreted as frames, ordered sequences of vectors that better capture token-word relationships. Then, concepts can be represented as the average of word frames sharing a common concept. We showcase these tools through Top-k Concept-Guided Decoding, which can intuitively steer text generation using concepts of choice. We verify said ideas on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and Phi 3 families, demonstrating gender and language biases, exposing harmful content, but also potential to remediate them, leading to safer and more transparent LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/phvv-me/frame-representation-hypothesis.git",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07334v2,2024-12
Automatic Item Generation for Personality Situational Judgment Tests with Large Language Models,"Chang-Jin Li, Jiyuan Zhang, Yun Tang, Jian Li","Personality assessment, particularly through situational judgment tests (SJTs), is a vital tool for psychological research, talent selection, and educational evaluation. This study explores the potential of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM), to automate the generation of personality situational judgment tests (PSJTs) in Chinese. Traditional SJT development is labor-intensive and prone to biases, while GPT-4 offers a scalable, efficient alternative. Two studies were conducted: Study 1 evaluated the impact of prompt design and temperature settings on content validity, finding that optimized prompts with a temperature of 1.0 produced creative and accurate items. Study 2 assessed the psychometric properties of GPT-4-generated PSJTs, revealing that they demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity, surpassing the performance of manually developed tests in measuring the Big Five personality traits. This research highlights GPT-4's effectiveness in developing high-quality PSJTs, providing a scalable and innovative method for psychometric test development. These findings expand the possibilities of automatic item generation and the application of LLMs in psychology, and offer practical implications for streamlining test development processes in resource-limited settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12144v1,2024-12
Filipino Benchmarks for Measuring Sexist and Homophobic Bias in Multilingual Language Models from Southeast Asia,"Lance Calvin Lim Gamboa, Mark Lee","Bias studies on multilingual models confirm the presence of gender-related stereotypes in masked models processing languages with high NLP resources. We expand on this line of research by introducing Filipino CrowS-Pairs and Filipino WinoQueer: benchmarks that assess both sexist and anti-queer biases in pretrained language models (PLMs) handling texts in Filipino, a low-resource language from the Philippines. The benchmarks consist of 7,074 new challenge pairs resulting from our cultural adaptation of English bias evaluation datasets, a process that we document in detail to guide similar forthcoming efforts. We apply the Filipino benchmarks on masked and causal multilingual models, including those pretrained on Southeast Asian data, and find that they contain considerable amounts of bias. We also find that for multilingual models, the extent of bias learned for a particular language is influenced by how much pretraining data in that language a model was exposed to. Our benchmarks and insights can serve as a foundation for future work analyzing and mitigating bias in multilingual models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07303v2,2024-12
The Rise and Down of Babel Tower: Investigating the Evolution Process of Multilingual Code Large Language Model,"Jiawei Chen, Wentao Chen, Jing Su, Jingjing Xu, Hongyu Lin, Mengjie Ren, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun","Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant multilingual capabilities. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of these capabilities during pre-training are not well understood. In this paper, we use code LLMs as an experimental platform to explore the evolution of multilingual capabilities in LLMs during the pre-training process. Based on our observations, we propose the Babel Tower Hypothesis, which describes the entire process of LLMs acquiring new language capabilities. During the learning process, multiple languages initially share a single knowledge system dominated by the primary language and gradually develop language-specific knowledge systems. We then validate the above hypothesis by tracking the internal states of the LLMs through identifying working languages and language transferring neurons. Experimental results show that the internal state changes of the LLM are consistent with our Babel Tower Hypothesis. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to construct an optimized pre-training corpus for multilingual code LLMs, which significantly outperforms LLMs trained on the original corpus. The proposed Babel Tower Hypothesis provides new insights into designing pre-training data distributions to achieve optimal multilingual capabilities in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07298v1,2024-12
Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Based on Causal Reasoning,"Fuhai Chen, Pengpeng Huang, Xuri Ge, Jie Huang, Zishuo Bao","With the rapid development of multimedia, the shift from unimodal textual sentiment analysis to multimodal image-text sentiment analysis has obtained academic and industrial attention in recent years. However, multimodal sentiment analysis is affected by unimodal data bias, e.g., text sentiment is misleading due to explicit sentiment semantic, leading to low accuracy in the final sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose a novel CounterFactual Multimodal Sentiment Analysis framework (CF-MSA) using causal counterfactual inference to construct multimodal sentiment causal inference. CF-MSA mitigates the direct effect from unimodal bias and ensures heterogeneity across modalities by differentiating the treatment variables between modalities. In addition, considering the information complementarity and bias differences between modalities, we propose a new optimisation objective to effectively integrate different modalities and reduce the inherent bias from each modality. Experimental results on two public datasets, MVSA-Single and MVSA-Multiple, demonstrate that the proposed CF-MSA has superior debiasing capability and achieves new state-of-the-art performances. We will release the code and datasets to facilitate future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07292v1,2024-12
Enhancing Relation Extraction via Supervised Rationale Verification and Feedback,"Yongqi Li, Xin Miao, Shen Zhou, Mayi Xu, Yuyang Ren, Tieyun Qian","Despite the rapid progress that existing automated feedback methods have made in correcting the output of large language models (LLMs), these methods cannot be well applied to the relation extraction (RE) task due to their designated feedback objectives and correction manner. To address this problem, we propose a novel automated feedback framework for RE, which presents a rationale supervisor to verify the rationale and provides re-selected demonstrations as feedback to correct the initial prediction. Specifically, we first design a causal intervention and observation method to collect biased/unbiased rationales for contrastive training the rationale supervisor. Then, we present a verification-feedback-correction procedure to iteratively enhance LLMs' capability of handling the RE task. Extensive experiments prove that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07289v2,2024-12
HARP: Hesitation-Aware Reframing in Transformer Inference Pass,"Romain Storaï, Seung-won Hwang","This paper aims to improve the performance of large language models by addressing the variable computational demands in inference steps, where some tokens require more computational resources than others. We present HARP, a simple modification to ""off-the-shelf"" Transformer forward pass. Drawing from hesitation and the framing effect in decision-making, HARP selectively applies additional computation when the model encounters uncertainty during token generation. Our method mimics human cognitive processes by pausing at difficult decision points and reframing inputs for a different perspective. Unlike other approaches, HARP is model-agnostic, training-free, and easy to implement. We thoroughly evaluate our method across various downstream tasks and model sizes, demonstrating performance improvements up to +5.16%. Notably, HARP achieves these gains while maintaining inference times twice faster than beam search. Simple and yet with significant gains, HARP offers a practical solution for enhancing the performance of Transformer-based language models with minimal computational impact.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07282v1,2024-12
Label-Confidence-Aware Uncertainty Estimation in Natural Language Generation,"Qinhong Lin, Linna Zhou, Zhongliang Yang, Yuang Cai","Large Language Models (LLMs) display formidable capabilities in generative tasks but also pose potential risks due to their tendency to generate hallucinatory responses. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), the evaluation of model output reliability, is crucial for ensuring the safety and robustness of AI systems. Recent studies have concentrated on model uncertainty by analyzing the relationship between output entropy under various sampling conditions and the corresponding labels. However, these methods primarily focus on measuring model entropy with precision to capture response characteristics, often neglecting the uncertainties associated with greedy decoding results-the sources of model labels, which can lead to biased classification outcomes. In this paper, we explore the biases introduced by greedy decoding and propose a label-confidence-aware (LCA) uncertainty estimation based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence bridging between samples and label source, thus enhancing the reliability and stability of uncertainty assessments. Our empirical evaluations across a range of popular LLMs and NLP datasets reveal that different label sources can indeed affect classification, and that our approach can effectively capture differences in sampling results and label sources, demonstrating more effective uncertainty estimation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07255v1,2024-12
KULTURE Bench: A Benchmark for Assessing Language Model in Korean Cultural Context,"Xiaonan Wang, Jinyoung Yeo, Joon-Ho Lim, Hansaem Kim","Large language models have exhibited significant enhancements in performance across various tasks. However, the complexity of their evaluation increases as these models generate more fluent and coherent content. Current multilingual benchmarks often use translated English versions, which may incorporate Western cultural biases that do not accurately assess other languages and cultures. To address this research gap, we introduce KULTURE Bench, an evaluation framework specifically designed for Korean culture that features datasets of cultural news, idioms, and poetry. It is designed to assess language models' cultural comprehension and reasoning capabilities at the word, sentence, and paragraph levels. Using the KULTURE Bench, we assessed the capabilities of models trained with different language corpora and analyzed the results comprehensively. The results show that there is still significant room for improvement in the models' understanding of texts related to the deeper aspects of Korean culture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07251v1,2024-12
Filling Memory Gaps: Enhancing Continual Semantic Parsing via SQL Syntax Variance-Guided LLMs without Real Data Replay,"Ruiheng Liu, Jinyu Zhang, Yanqi Song, Yu Zhang, Bailong Yang","Continual Semantic Parsing (CSP) aims to train parsers to convert natural language questions into SQL across tasks with limited annotated examples, adapting to the real-world scenario of dynamically updated databases. Previous studies mitigate this challenge by replaying historical data or employing parameter-efficient tuning (PET), but they often violate data privacy or rely on ideal continual learning settings. To address these problems, we propose a new Large Language Model (LLM)-Enhanced Continuous Semantic Parsing method, named LECSP, which alleviates forgetting while encouraging generalization, without requiring real data replay or ideal settings. Specifically, it first analyzes the commonalities and differences between tasks from the SQL syntax perspective to guide LLMs in reconstructing key memories and improving memory accuracy through a calibration strategy. Then, it uses a task-aware dual-teacher distillation framework to promote the accumulation and transfer of knowledge during sequential training. Experimental results on two CSP benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods, even those utilizing data replay or ideal settings. Additionally, we achieve generalization performance beyond the upper limits, better adapting to unseen tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07246v1,2024-12
Speaker effects in spoken language comprehension,"Hanlin Wu, Zhenguang G. Cai","The identity of a speaker significantly influences spoken language comprehension by affecting both perception and expectation. This review explores speaker effects, focusing on how speaker information impacts language processing. We propose an integrative model featuring the interplay between bottom-up perception-based processes driven by acoustic details and top-down expectation-based processes driven by a speaker model. The acoustic details influence lower-level perception, while the speaker model modulates both lower-level and higher-level processes such as meaning interpretation and pragmatic inferences. We define speaker-idiosyncrasy and speaker-demographics effects and demonstrate how bottom-up and top-down processes interact at various levels in different scenarios. This framework contributes to psycholinguistic theory by offering a comprehensive account of how speaker information interacts with linguistic content to shape message construction. We suggest that speaker effects can serve as indices of a language learner's proficiency and an individual's characteristics of social cognition. We encourage future research to extend these findings to AI speakers, probing the universality of speaker effects across humans and artificial agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07238v1,2024-12
Comateformer: Combined Attention Transformer for Semantic Sentence Matching,"Bo Li, Di Liang, Zixin Zhang","The Transformer-based model have made significant strides in semantic matching tasks by capturing connections between phrase pairs. However, to assess the relevance of sentence pairs, it is insufficient to just examine the general similarity between the sentences. It is crucial to also consider the tiny subtleties that differentiate them from each other. Regrettably, attention softmax operations in transformers tend to miss these subtle differences. To this end, in this work, we propose a novel semantic sentence matching model named Combined Attention Network based on Transformer model (Comateformer). In Comateformer model, we design a novel transformer-based quasi-attention mechanism with compositional properties. Unlike traditional attention mechanisms that merely adjust the weights of input tokens, our proposed method learns how to combine, subtract, or resize specific vectors when building a representation. Moreover, our proposed approach builds on the intuition of similarity and dissimilarity (negative affinity) when calculating dual affinity scores. This allows for a more meaningful representation of relationships between sentences. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted extensive experiments on ten public real-world datasets and robustness testing. Experimental results show that our method achieves consistent improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07220v1,2024-12
MAPLE: A Framework for Active Preference Learning Guided by Large Language Models,"Saaduddin Mahmud, Mason Nakamura, Shlomo Zilberstein","The advent of large language models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in using natural language for preference learning. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational burdens, taxing human supervision, and lack of interpretability. To address these issues, we introduce MAPLE, a framework for large language model-guided Bayesian active preference learning. MAPLE leverages LLMs to model the distribution over preference functions, conditioning it on both natural language feedback and conventional preference learning feedback, such as pairwise trajectory rankings. MAPLE also employs active learning to systematically reduce uncertainty in this distribution and incorporates a language-conditioned active query selection mechanism to identify informative and easy-to-answer queries, thus reducing human burden. We evaluate MAPLE's sample efficiency and preference inference quality across two benchmarks, including a real-world vehicle route planning benchmark using OpenStreetMap data. Our results demonstrate that MAPLE accelerates the learning process and effectively improves humans' ability to answer queries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07207v2,2024-12

"Modifying AI, Enhancing Essays: How Active Engagement with Generative AI Boosts Writing Quality","Kaixun Yang, Mladen Raković, Zhiping Liang, Lixiang Yan, Zijie Zeng, Yizhou Fan, Dragan Gašević, Guanliang Chen","Students are increasingly relying on Generative AI (GAI) to support their writing-a key pedagogical practice in education. In GAI-assisted writing, students can delegate core cognitive tasks (e.g., generating ideas and turning them into sentences) to GAI while still producing high-quality essays. This creates new challenges for teachers in assessing and supporting student learning, as they often lack insight into whether students are engaging in meaningful cognitive processes during writing or how much of the essay's quality can be attributed to those processes. This study aimed to help teachers better assess and support student learning in GAI-assisted writing by examining how different writing behaviors, especially those indicative of meaningful learning versus those that are not, impact essay quality. Using a dataset of 1,445 GAI-assisted writing sessions, we applied the cutting-edge method, X-Learner, to quantify the causal impact of three GAI-assisted writing behavioral patterns (i.e., seeking suggestions but not accepting them, seeking suggestions and accepting them as they are, and seeking suggestions and accepting them with modification) on four measures of essay quality (i.e., lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, text cohesion, and linguistic bias). Our analysis showed that writers who frequently modified GAI-generated text-suggesting active engagement in higher-order cognitive processes-consistently improved the quality of their essays in terms of lexical sophistication, syntactic complexity, and text cohesion. In contrast, those who often accepted GAI-generated text without changes, primarily engaging in lower-order processes, saw a decrease in essay quality. Additionally, while human writers tend to introduce linguistic bias when writing independently, incorporating GAI-generated text-even without modification-can help mitigate this bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07200v1,2024-12
PrisonBreak: Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Fewer Than Twenty-Five Targeted Bit-flips,"Zachary Coalson, Jeonghyun Woo, Shiyang Chen, Yu Sun, Lishan Yang, Prashant Nair, Bo Fang, Sanghyun Hong","We introduce a new class of attacks on commercial-scale (human-aligned) language models that induce jailbreaking through targeted bitwise corruptions in model parameters. Our adversary can jailbreak billion-parameter language models with fewer than 25 bit-flips in all cases$-$and as few as 5 in some$-$using up to 40$\times$ less bit-flips than existing attacks on computer vision models at least 100$\times$ smaller. Unlike prompt-based jailbreaks, our attack renders these models in memory 'uncensored' at runtime, allowing them to generate harmful responses without any input modifications. Our attack algorithm efficiently identifies target bits to flip, offering up to 20$\times$ more computational efficiency than previous methods. This makes it practical for language models with billions of parameters. We show an end-to-end exploitation of our attack using software-induced fault injection, Rowhammer (RH). Our work examines 56 DRAM RH profiles from DDR4 and LPDDR4X devices with different RH vulnerabilities. We show that our attack can reliably induce jailbreaking in systems similar to those affected by prior bit-flip attacks. Moreover, our approach remains effective even against highly RH-secure systems (e.g., 46$\times$ more secure than previously tested systems). Our analyses further reveal that: (1) models with less post-training alignment require fewer bit flips to jailbreak; (2) certain model components, such as value projection layers, are substantially more vulnerable than others; and (3) our method is mechanistically different than existing jailbreaks. Our findings highlight a pressing, practical threat to the language model ecosystem and underscore the need for research to protect these models from bit-flip attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07192v1,2024-12
Breaking the Stage Barrier: A Novel Single-Stage Approach to Long Context Extension for Large Language Models,"Haoran Lian, Junmin Chen, Wei Huang, Yizhe Xiong, Wenping Hu, Guiguang Ding, Hui Chen, Jianwei Niu, Zijia Lin, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang","Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP). Pretrained LLMs, due to limited training context size, struggle with handling long token sequences, limiting their performance on various downstream tasks. Current solutions toward long context modeling often employ multi-stage continual pertaining, which progressively increases the effective context length through several continual pretraining stages. However, those approaches require extensive manual tuning and human expertise. In this paper, we introduce a novel single-stage continual pretraining method, Head-Adaptive Rotary Position Encoding (HARPE), to equip LLMs with long context modeling capabilities while simplifying the training process. Our HARPE leverages different Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) base frequency values across different attention heads and directly trains LLMs on the target context length. Extensive experiments on 4 language modeling benchmarks, including the latest RULER benchmark, demonstrate that HARPE excels in understanding and integrating long-context tasks with single-stage training, matching and even outperforming existing multi-stage methods. Our results highlight that HARPE successfully breaks the stage barrier for training LLMs with long context modeling capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07171v1,2024-12
MM-PoE: Multiple Choice Reasoning via. Process of Elimination using Multi-Modal Models,"Sayak Chakrabarty, Souradip Pal","This paper introduces Multiple Choice Reasoning via. Process of Elimination using Multi-Modal models, herein referred to as Multi-Modal Process of Elimination (MM-PoE). This novel methodology is engineered to augment the efficacy of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in multiple-choice visual reasoning tasks. Diverging from conventional approaches that evaluate each option independently, MM-PoE employs a dual-step scoring paradigm that initially identifies and excludes implausible choices, subsequently concentrating on the most probable remaining options. This method emulates human test-taking strategies, where individuals typically eliminate clearly incorrect answers prior to selecting the optimal response. Our empirical evaluations, conducted across three benchmark datasets, reveal that MM-PoE significantly improves both zero-shot and few-shot performance of contemporary state-of-the-art VLMs. Critically, this approach not only broadens the application of the elimination process to multi-modal contexts but also allows few-shot experiments, thereby addressing two principal limitations concerning usage of PoE only in zero-shot settings and only with a language-only framework. As a result, MM-PoE not only refines the reasoning capabilities of VLMs but also broadens their applicability to complex visual question-answering scenarios. All code and documentation supporting our work are available at https://pypi.org/project/mm-poe/, enabling researchers and practitioners to easily integrate and further develop these techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07148v1,2024-12
Political Actor Agent: Simulating Legislative System for Roll Call Votes Prediction with Large Language Models,"Hao Li, Ruoyuan Gong, Hao Jiang","Predicting roll call votes through modeling political actors has emerged as a focus in quantitative political science and computer science. Widely used embedding-based methods generate vectors for legislators from diverse data sets to predict legislative behaviors. However, these methods often contend with challenges such as the need for manually predefined features, reliance on extensive training data, and a lack of interpretability. Achieving more interpretable predictions under flexible conditions remains an unresolved issue. This paper introduces the Political Actor Agent (PAA), a novel agent-based framework that utilizes Large Language Models to overcome these limitations. By employing role-playing architectures and simulating legislative system, PAA provides a scalable and interpretable paradigm for predicting roll-call votes. Our approach not only enhances the accuracy of predictions but also offers multi-view, human-understandable decision reasoning, providing new insights into political actor behaviors. We conducted comprehensive experiments using voting records from the 117-118th U.S. House of Representatives, validating the superior performance and interpretability of PAA. This study not only demonstrates PAA's effectiveness but also its potential in political science research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07144v2,2024-12
Bridging the Gap for Test-Time Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"Zirun Guo, Tao Jin, Wenlong Xu, Wang Lin, Yangyang Wu","Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is an emerging research topic that aims to understand and recognize human sentiment or emotions through multiple modalities. However, in real-world dynamic scenarios, the distribution of target data is always changing and different from the source data used to train the model, which leads to performance degradation. Common adaptation methods usually need source data, which could pose privacy issues or storage overheads. Therefore, test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are introduced to improve the performance of the model at inference time. Existing TTA methods are always based on probabilistic models and unimodal learning, and thus can not be applied to MSA which is often considered as a multimodal regression task. In this paper, we propose two strategies: Contrastive Adaptation and Stable Pseudo-label generation (CASP) for test-time adaptation for multimodal sentiment analysis. The two strategies deal with the distribution shifts for MSA by enforcing consistency and minimizing empirical risk, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CASP brings significant and consistent improvements to the performance of the model across various distribution shift settings and with different backbones, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility. Our codes are available at https://github.com/zrguo/CASP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07121v1,2024-12
A Review of Human Emotion Synthesis Based on Generative Technology,"Fei Ma, Yukan Li, Yifan Xie, Ying He, Yi Zhang, Hongwei Ren, Zhou Liu, Wei Yao, Fuji Ren, Fei Richard Yu, Shiguang Ni","Human emotion synthesis is a crucial aspect of affective computing. It involves using computational methods to mimic and convey human emotions through various modalities, with the goal of enabling more natural and effective human-computer interactions. Recent advancements in generative models, such as Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, Diffusion Models, Large Language Models, and Sequence-to-Sequence Models, have significantly contributed to the development of this field. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive reviews in this field. To address this problem, this paper aims to address this gap by providing a thorough and systematic overview of recent advancements in human emotion synthesis based on generative models. Specifically, this review will first present the review methodology, the emotion models involved, the mathematical principles of generative models, and the datasets used. Then, the review covers the application of different generative models to emotion synthesis based on a variety of modalities, including facial images, speech, and text. It also examines mainstream evaluation metrics.

Exploring Coding Spot: Understanding Parametric Contributions to LLM Coding Performance,"Dongjun Kim, Minhyuk Kim, YongChan Chun, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable proficiency in both code generation and comprehension across multiple programming languages. However, the mechanisms underlying this proficiency remain underexplored, particularly with respect to whether distinct programming languages are processed independently or within a shared parametric region. Drawing an analogy to the specialized regions of the brain responsible for distinct cognitive functions, we introduce the concept of Coding Spot, a specialized parametric region within LLMs that facilitates coding capabilities. Our findings identify this Coding Spot and show that targeted modifications to this subset significantly affect performance on coding tasks, while largely preserving non-coding functionalities. This compartmentalization mirrors the functional specialization observed in cognitive neuroscience, where specific brain regions are dedicated to distinct tasks, suggesting that LLMs may similarly employ specialized parameter regions for different knowledge domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07113v1,2024-12

Predictable Emergent Abilities of LLMs: Proxy Tasks Are All You Need,"Bo-Wen Zhang, Yan Yan, Boxiang Yang, Yifei Xue, Guang Liu","While scaling laws optimize training configurations for large language models (LLMs) through experiments on smaller or early-stage models, they fail to predict emergent abilities due to the absence of such capabilities in these models. To address this, we propose a method that predicts emergent abilities by leveraging proxy tasks. We begin by establishing relevance metrics between the target task and candidate tasks based on performance differences across multiple models. These candidate tasks are then validated for robustness with small model ensembles, leading to the selection of the most appropriate proxy tasks. The predicted performance on the target task is then derived by integrating the evaluation results of these proxies. In a case study on tool utilization capabilities, our method demonstrated a strong correlation between predicted and actual performance, confirming its effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07111v1,2024-12
Improving the Natural Language Inference robustness to hard dataset by data augmentation and preprocessing,Zijiang Yang,"Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of inferring whether the hypothesis can be justified by the given premise. Basically, we classify the hypothesis into three labels(entailment, neutrality and contradiction) given the premise. NLI was well studied by the previous researchers. A number of models, especially the transformer based ones, have achieved significant improvement on these tasks. However, it is reported that these models are suffering when they are dealing with hard datasets. Particularly, they perform much worse when dealing with unseen out-of-distribution premise and hypothesis. They may not understand the semantic content but learn the spurious correlations. In this work, we propose the data augmentation and preprocessing methods to solve the word overlap, numerical reasoning and length mismatch problems. These methods are general methods that do not rely on the distribution of the testing data and they help improve the robustness of the models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07108v1,2024-12
Personalized and Sequential Text-to-Image Generation,"Ofir Nabati, Guy Tennenholtz, ChihWei Hsu, Moonkyung Ryu, Deepak Ramachandran, Yinlam Chow, Xiang Li, Craig Boutilier","We address the problem of personalized, interactive text-to-image (T2I) generation, designing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent which iteratively improves a set of generated images for a user through a sequence of prompt expansions. Using human raters, we create a novel dataset of sequential preferences, which we leverage, together with large-scale open-source (non-sequential) datasets. We construct user-preference and user-choice models using an EM strategy and identify varying user preference types. We then leverage a large multimodal language model (LMM) and a value-based RL approach to suggest a personalized and diverse slate of prompt expansions to the user. Our Personalized And Sequential Text-to-image Agent (PASTA) extends T2I models with personalized multi-turn capabilities, fostering collaborative co-creation and addressing uncertainty or underspecification in a user's intent. We evaluate PASTA using human raters, showing significant improvement compared to baseline methods.

QAPyramid: Fine-grained Evaluation of Content Selection for Text Summarization,"Shiyue Zhang, David Wan, Arie Cattan, Ayal Klein, Ido Dagan, Mohit Bansal","How to properly conduct human evaluations for text summarization is a longstanding challenge. The Pyramid human evaluation protocol, which assesses content selection by breaking the reference summary into sub-units and verifying their presence in the system summary, has been widely adopted. However, it suffers from a lack of systematicity in the definition and granularity of the sub-units. We address these problems by proposing QAPyramid, which decomposes each reference summary into finer-grained question-answer (QA) pairs according to the QA-SRL framework. We collect QA-SRL annotations for reference summaries from CNN/DM and evaluate 10 summarization systems, resulting in 8.9K QA-level annotations. We show that, compared to Pyramid, QAPyramid provides more systematic and fine-grained content selection evaluation while maintaining high inter-annotator agreement without needing expert annotations. Furthermore, we propose metrics that automate the evaluation pipeline and achieve higher correlations with QAPyramid than other widely adopted metrics, allowing future work to accurately and efficiently benchmark summarization systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07096v1,2024-12
Defensive Dual Masking for Robust Adversarial Defense,"Wangli Yang, Jie Yang, Yi Guo, Johan Barthelemy","The field of textual adversarial defenses has gained considerable attention in recent years due to the increasing vulnerability of natural language processing (NLP) models to adversarial attacks, which exploit subtle perturbations in input text to deceive models. This paper introduces the Defensive Dual Masking (DDM) algorithm, a novel approach designed to enhance model robustness against such attacks. DDM utilizes a unique adversarial training strategy where [MASK] tokens are strategically inserted into training samples to prepare the model to handle adversarial perturbations more effectively. During inference, potentially adversarial tokens are dynamically replaced with [MASK] tokens to neutralize potential threats while preserving the core semantics of the input. The theoretical foundation of our approach is explored, demonstrating how the selective masking mechanism strengthens the model's ability to identify and mitigate adversarial manipulations. Our empirical evaluation across a diverse set of benchmark datasets and attack mechanisms consistently shows that DDM outperforms state-of-the-art defense techniques, improving model accuracy and robustness. Moreover, when applied to Large Language Models (LLMs), DDM also enhances their resilience to adversarial attacks, providing a scalable defense mechanism for large-scale NLP applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07078v1,2024-12
Harnessing Transfer Learning from Swahili: Advancing Solutions for Comorian Dialects,"Naira Abdou Mohamed, Zakarya Erraji, Abdessalam Bahafid, Imade Benelallam","If today some African languages like Swahili have enough resources to develop high-performing Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, many other languages spoken on the continent are still lacking such support. For these languages, still in their infancy, several possibilities exist to address this critical lack of data. Among them is Transfer Learning, which allows low-resource languages to benefit from the good representation of other languages that are similar to them. In this work, we adopt a similar approach, aiming to pioneer NLP technologies for Comorian, a group of four languages or dialects belonging to the Bantu family.   Our approach is initially motivated by the hypothesis that if a human can understand a different language from their native language with little or no effort, it would be entirely possible to model this process on a machine. To achieve this, we consider ways to construct Comorian datasets mixed with Swahili. One thing to note here is that in terms of Swahili data, we only focus on elements that are closest to Comorian by calculating lexical distances between candidate and source data. We empirically test this hypothesis in two use cases: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT). Our MT model achieved ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.6826, 0.42, and 0.6532, respectively, while our ASR system recorded a WER of 39.50\% and a CER of 13.76\%.

FM2DS: Few-Shot Multimodal Multihop Data Synthesis with Knowledge Distillation for Question Answering,"Amirhossein Abaskohi, Spandana Gella, Giuseppe Carenini, Issam H. Laradji","Multimodal multihop question answering is a complex task that requires reasoning over multiple sources of information, such as images and text, to answer questions. While there has been significant progress in visual question answering, the multihop setting remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current methods focus on single-hop question answering or a single modality, which makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios such as analyzing multimodal educational materials, summarizing lengthy academic articles, or interpreting scientific studies that combine charts, images, and text. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology, introducing the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset that enables training models for multimodal multihop question answering. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure quality data. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks, our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) on average. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating multimodal multihop question answering models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07030v2,2024-12
Constrained Decoding with Speculative Lookaheads,"Nishanth Nakshatri, Shamik Roy, Rajarshi Das, Suthee Chaidaroon, Leonid Boytsov, Rashmi Gangadharaiah","Constrained decoding with lookahead heuristics (CDLH) is a highly effective method for aligning LLM generations to human preferences. However, the extensive lookahead roll-out operations for each generated token makes CDLH prohibitively expensive, resulting in low adoption in practice. In contrast, common decoding strategies such as greedy decoding are extremely efficient, but achieve very low constraint satisfaction. We propose constrained decoding with speculative lookaheads (CDSL), a technique that significantly improves upon the inference efficiency of CDLH without experiencing the drastic performance reduction seen with greedy decoding. CDSL is motivated by the recently proposed idea of speculative decoding that uses a much smaller draft LLM for generation and a larger target LLM for verification. In CDSL, the draft model is used to generate lookaheads which is verified by a combination of target LLM and task-specific reward functions. This process accelerates decoding by reducing the computational burden while maintaining strong performance. We evaluate CDSL in two constraint decoding tasks with three LLM families and achieve 2.2x to 12.15x speedup over CDLH without significant performance reduction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10418v1,2024-12
Assessing the Impact of Conspiracy Theories Using Large Language Models,"Bohan Jiang, Dawei Li, Zhen Tan, Xinyi Zhou, Ashwin Rao, Kristina Lerman, H.

However, assessing the actual impact of CTs on the public poses unique challenges. It requires not only the collection of CT-specific knowledge but also diverse information from social, psychological, and cultural dimensions. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest their potential utility in this context, not only due to their extensive knowledge from large training corpora but also because they can be harnessed for complex reasoning. In this work, we develop datasets of popular CTs with human-annotated impacts. Borrowing insights from human impact assessment processes, we then design tailored strategies to leverage LLMs for performing human-like CT impact assessments. Through rigorous experiments, we textit{discover that an impact assessment mode using multi-step reasoning to analyze more CT-related evidence critically produces accurate results; and most LLMs demonstrate strong bias, such as assigning higher impacts to CTs presented earlier in the prompt, while generating less accurate impact assessments for emotionally charged and verbose CTs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07019v1,2024-12
Asynchronous LLM Function Calling,"In Gim, Seung-seob Lee, Lin Zhong","Large language models (LLMs) use function calls to interface with external tools and data source. However, the current approach to LLM function calling is inherently synchronous, where each call blocks LLM inference, limiting LLM operation and concurrent function execution. In this work, we propose AsyncLM, a system for asynchronous LLM function calling. AsyncLM improves LLM's operational efficiency by enabling LLMs to generate and execute function calls concurrently. Instead of waiting for each call's completion, AsyncLM introduces an interrupt mechanism to asynchronously notify the LLM in-flight when function calls return. We design an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt semantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process. We demonstrate that AsyncLM can reduce end-to-end task completion latency from 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling on a set of benchmark tasks in the Berkeley function calling leaderboard (BFCL). Furthermore, we discuss how interrupt mechanisms can be extended to enable novel human-LLM or LLM-LLM interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07017v1,2024-12
Leveraging Audio and Text Modalities in Mental Health: A Study of LLMs Performance,"Abdelrahman A. Ali, Aya E. Fouda, Radwa J. Hanafy, Mohammed E. Fouda","Mental health disorders are increasingly prevalent worldwide, creating an urgent need for innovative tools to support early diagnosis and intervention. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multimodal mental health diagnostics, specifically for detecting depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder through text and audio modalities. Using the E-DAIC dataset, we compare text and audio modalities to investigate whether LLMs can perform equally well or better with audio inputs. We further examine the integration of both modalities to determine if this can enhance diagnostic accuracy, which generally results in improved performance metrics. Our analysis specifically utilizes custom-formulated metrics; Modal Superiority Score and Disagreement Resolvement Score to evaluate how combined modalities influence model performance. The Gemini 1.5 Pro model achieves the highest scores in binary depression classification when using the combined modality, with an F1 score of 0.67 and a Balanced Accuracy (BA) of 77.4%, assessed across the full dataset. These results represent an increase of 3.1% over its performance with the text modality and 2.7% over the audio modality, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Notably, all results are obtained in zero-shot inferring, highlighting the robustness of the models without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. To explore the impact of different configurations on model performance, we conduct binary, severity, and multiclass tasks using both zero-shot and few-shot prompts, examining the effects of prompt variations on performance. The results reveal that models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro in text and audio modalities, and GPT-4o mini in the text modality, often surpass other models in balanced accuracy and F1 scores across multiple tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10417v1,2024-12
AutoReason: Automatic Few-Shot Reasoning Decomposition,"Arda Sevinc, Abdurrahman Gumus","Chain of Thought (CoT) was introduced in recent research as a method for improving step-by-step reasoning in Large Language Models.

Our method improves multi-step implicit reasoning capabilities by decomposing the implicit query into several explicit questions. This provides interpretability for the model, improving reasoning in weaker LLMs. We test our approach with two Q\&A datasets: StrategyQA and HotpotQA.

Effective Text Adaptation for LLM-based ASR through Soft Prompt Fine-Tuning,"Yingyi Ma, Zhe Liu, Ozlem Kalinli","The advent of Large Language Models (LLM) has reformed the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Prompting LLM with audio embeddings to generate transcriptions becomes the new state-of-the-art ASR. Despite LLMs being trained with an extensive amount of text corpora, high-quality domain-specific text data can still significantly enhance ASR performance on domain adaptation tasks. Although LLM-based ASR can naturally incorporate more text corpora by fine-tuning the LLM decoder, fine-tuning such ASR on text-only data without paired prompts may diminish the effectiveness of domain-specific knowledge. To mitigate this issue, we propose a two-step soft prompt fine-tuning strategy that enhances domain-specific text adaptation. Experimental results show that text adaptation with our proposed method achieved a relative up to 9% Word Error Rate (WER) reduction and up to 18% Entity Error Rate (EER) reduction on the target domain compared to the baseline ASR. Combining this with domain-specific Language Model (LM) fusion can further improve the EER by a relative 2-5%",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06967v1,2024-12
SUPERMERGE: An Approach For Gradient-Based Model Merging,"Haoyu Yang, Zheng Zhang, Saket Sathe","Large language models, such as ChatGPT, Claude, or LLaMA, are gigantic, monolithic, and possess the superpower to simultaneously support thousands of tasks. However, high-throughput applications often prefer smaller task-specific models because of their lower latency and cost. One challenge of using task-specific models is the incremental need for solving newer tasks after the model is already deployed for existing tasks. A straightforward solution requires fine-tuning the model again for both existing and new tasks, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a model merging based approach called SUPERMERGE. SUPERMERGE is a gradient-based method to systematically merge several fine-tuned models trained on existing and new tasks. SUPERMERGE is designed to be lightweight and fast, and the merged model achieves similar performance to fully fine-tuned models on all tasks. Furthermore, we proposed a hierarchical model merging strategy to reduce the peak space requirement without sacrificing the performance of the merged model. We experimentally demonstrate that SUPERMERGE outperforms existing model merging methods on common natural language processing and computer vision tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10416v1,2024-12

This study explored commuter opinion mining to understand sentiments toward existing public transport systems in Kenya, Tanzania, and South Africa. We used a qualitative research design, analysing data from X (formerly Twitter) to assess sentiments across rail, mini-bus taxis, and buses. By leveraging Multilingual Opinion Mining techniques, we addressed the linguistic diversity and code-switching present in our dataset, thus demonstrating the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in extracting insights from under-resourced languages. We employed PLMs such as AfriBERTa, AfroXLMR, AfroLM, and PuoBERTa to conduct the sentiment analysis. The results revealed predominantly negative sentiments in South Africa and Kenya, while the Tanzanian dataset showed mainly positive sentiments due to the advertising nature of the tweets. Furthermore, feature extraction using the Word2Vec model and K-Means clustering illuminated semantic relationships and primary themes found within the different datasets. By prioritising the analysis of user experiences and sentiments, this research paves the way for developing more responsive, user-centered public transport systems in Sub-Saharan countries, contributing to the broader goal of improving urban mobility and sustainability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06951v1,2024-12

We evaluate tokenization performance across various intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, including generation and classification. Our findings suggest that compression-optimized tokenization strategies could provide substantial advantages for multilingual and low-resource language applications, highlighting a promising direction for further research and inclusive NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06926v3,2024-12
Delve into Visual Contrastive Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation of Large Vision-Language Models,"Yi-Lun Lee, Yi-Hsuan Tsai, Wei-Chen Chiu","While large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating plausible responses correlated with input visual contents, they still suffer from hallucinations, where the generated text inaccurately reflects visual contents. To address this, recent approaches apply contrastive decoding to calibrate the model's response via contrasting output distributions with original and visually distorted samples, demonstrating promising hallucination mitigation in a training-free manner. However, the potential of changing information in visual inputs is not well-explored, so a deeper investigation into the behaviors of visual contrastive decoding is of great interest. In this paper, we first explore various methods for contrastive decoding to change visual contents, including image downsampling and editing. Downsampling images reduces the detailed textual information while editing yields new contents in images, providing new aspects as visual contrastive samples. To further study benefits by using different contrastive samples, we analyze probability-level metrics, including entropy and distribution distance. Interestingly, the effect of these samples in mitigating hallucinations varies a lot across LVLMs and benchmarks. Based on our analysis, we propose a simple yet effective method to combine contrastive samples, offering a practical solution for applying contrastive decoding across various scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed fusion method among different benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06775v1,2024-12
Training Large Language Models to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space,"Shibo Hao, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, DiJia Su, Xian Li, Zhiting Hu, Jason Weston, Yuandong Tian","Large language models (LLMs) are restricted to reason in the ""language space"", where they typically express the reasoning process with a chain-of-thought (CoT) to solve a complex reasoning problem. However, we argue that language space may not always be optimal for reasoning. For example, most word tokens are primarily for textual coherence and not essential for reasoning, while some critical tokens require complex planning and pose huge challenges to LLMs. To explore the potential of LLM reasoning in an unrestricted latent space instead of using natural language, we introduce a new paradigm Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought). We utilize the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state (termed ""continuous thought""). Rather than decoding this into a word token, we feed it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space. Experiments show that Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks. This novel latent reasoning paradigm leads to emergent advanced reasoning patterns: the continuous thought can encode multiple alternative next reasoning steps, allowing the model to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to solve the problem, rather than prematurely committing to a single deterministic path like CoT. Coconut outperforms CoT in certain logical reasoning tasks that require substantial backtracking during planning, with fewer thinking tokens during inference. These findings demonstrate the promise of latent reasoning and offer valuable insights for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06769v2,2024-12
LLMs for Generalizable Language-Conditioned Policy Learning under Minimal Data Requirements,"Thomas Pouplin, Katarzyna Kobalczyk, Hao Sun, Mihaela van der Schaar","To develop autonomous agents capable of executing complex, multi-step decision-making tasks as specified by humans in natural language, existing reinforcement learning approaches typically require expensive labeled datasets or access to real-time experimentation. Moreover, conventional methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen goals and states, thereby limiting their practical applicability. This paper presents TEDUO, a novel training pipeline for offline language-conditioned policy learning. TEDUO operates on easy-to-obtain, unlabeled datasets and is suited for the so-called in-the-wild evaluation, wherein the agent encounters previously unseen goals and states. To address the challenges posed by such data and evaluation settings, our method leverages the prior knowledge and instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the fidelity of pre-collected offline data and enable flexible generalization to new goals and states. Empirical results demonstrate that the dual role of LLMs in our framework-as data enhancers and generalizers-facilitates both effective and data-efficient learning of generalizable language-conditioned policies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06877v1,2024-12
Refusal Tokens: A Simple Way to Calibrate Refusals in Large Language Models,"Neel Jain, Aditya Shrivastava, Chenyang Zhu, Daben Liu, Alfy Samuel, Ashwinee Panda, Anoop Kumar, Micah Goldblum, Tom Goldstein","A key component of building safe and reliable language models is enabling the models to appropriately refuse to follow certain instructions or answer certain questions. We may want models to output refusal messages for various categories of user queries, for example, ill-posed questions, instructions for committing illegal acts, or queries which require information past the model's knowledge horizon. Engineering models that refuse to answer such questions is complicated by the fact that an individual may want their model to exhibit varying levels of sensitivity for refusing queries of various categories, and different users may want different refusal rates. The current default approach involves training multiple models with varying proportions of refusal messages from each category to achieve the desired refusal rates, which is computationally expensive and may require training a new model to accommodate each user's desired preference over refusal rates. To address these challenges, we propose refusal tokens, one such token for each refusal category or a single refusal token, which are prepended to the model's responses during training. We then show how to increase or decrease the probability of generating the refusal token for each category during inference to steer the model's refusal behavior. Refusal tokens enable controlling a single model's refusal rates without the need of any further fine-tuning, but only by selectively intervening during generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06748v1,2024-12
ONEBench to Test Them All: Sample-Level Benchmarking Over Open-Ended Capabilities,"Adhiraj Ghosh, Sebastian Dziadzio, Ameya Prabhu, Vishaal Udandarao, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge","Traditional fixed test sets fall short in evaluating open-ended capabilities of foundation models. To address this, we propose ONEBench(OpeN-Ended Benchmarking), a new testing paradigm that consolidates individual evaluation datasets into a unified, ever-expanding sample pool. ONEBench allows users to generate custom, open-ended evaluation benchmarks from this pool, corresponding to specific capabilities of interest. By aggregating samples across test sets, ONEBench enables the assessment of diverse capabilities beyond those covered by the original test sets, while mitigating overfitting and dataset bias. Most importantly, it frames model evaluation as a collective process of selecting and aggregating sample-level tests.   The shift from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: (1)heterogeneity and (2)incompleteness. Heterogeneity refers to the aggregation over diverse metrics, while incompleteness describes comparing models evaluated on different data subsets. To address these challenges, we explore algorithms to aggregate sparse measurements into reliable model scores. Our aggregation algorithm ensures identifiability(asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model ranking with less data. On homogenous datasets, we show our aggregation algorithm provides rankings that highly correlate with those produced by average scores. We also demonstrate robustness to ~95% of measurements missing, reducing evaluation cost by up to 20x with little-to-no change in model rankings. We introduce ONEBench-LLM for language models and ONEBench-LMM for vision-language models, unifying evaluations across these domains. Overall, we present a technique for open-ended evaluation, which can aggregate over incomplete, heterogeneous sample-level measurements to continually grow a benchmark alongside the rapidly developing foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06745v1,2024-12
JAPAGEN: Efficient Few/Zero-shot Learning via Japanese Training Dataset Generation with LLM,"Takuro Fujii, Satoru Katsumata","Recently some studies have highlighted the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as effective generators of supervised training data, offering advantages such as enhanced inference efficiency and reduced costs associated with data collection. However, these studies have predominantly focused on English language tasks. In this paper, we address the fundamental research question: Can LLMs serve as proficient training data generators for other language tasks? Specifically, we leverage LLMs to synthesize supervised training data under few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios across six diverse Japanese downstream tasks. Subsequently, we utilize this synthesized data to train compact models (e.g., BERT). This novel methodology is termed JAPAGEN. Our experimental findings underscore that JAPAGEN achieves robust performance in classification tasks that necessitate formal text inputs, demonstrating competitive results compared to conventional LLM prompting strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06738v1,2024-12
AutoDCWorkflow: LLM-based Data Cleaning Workflow Auto-Generation and Benchmark,"Lan Li, Liri Fang, Vetle I. Torvik","We investigate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for automatically generating data-cleaning workflows. To evaluate LLMs' ability to complete data-cleaning tasks, we implemented a pipeline for LLM-based Auto Data Cleaning Workflow (AutoDCWorkflow), prompting LLMs on data cleaning operations to repair three types of data quality issues: duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent data formats. Given a dirty table and a purpose (expressed as a query), this pipeline generates a minimal, clean table sufficient to address the purpose and the data cleaning workflow used to produce the table. The planning process involves three main LLM-driven components: (1) Select Target Columns: Identifies a set of target columns related to the purpose. (2) Inspect Column Quality: Assesses the data quality for each target column and generates a Data Quality Report as operation objectives. (3) Generate Operation & Arguments: Predicts the next operation and arguments based on the data quality report results. Additionally, we propose a data cleaning benchmark to evaluate the capability of LLM agents to automatically generate workflows that address data cleaning purposes of varying difficulty levels. The benchmark comprises the annotated datasets as a collection of purpose, raw table, clean table, data cleaning workflow, and answer set. In our experiments, we evaluated three LLMs that auto-generate purpose-driven data cleaning workflows. The results indicate that LLMs perform well in planning and generating data-cleaning workflows without the need for fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06724v2,2024-12
VP-MEL: Visual Prompts Guided Multimodal Entity Linking,"Hongze Mi, Jinyuan Li, Xuying Zhang, Haoran Cheng, Jiahao Wang, Di Sun, Gang Pan","Multimodal entity linking (MEL), a task aimed at linking mentions within multimodal contexts to their corresponding entities in a knowledge base (KB), has attracted much attention due to its wide applications in recent years. However, existing MEL methods often rely heavily on mention words as retrieval cues, which limits their ability to effectively utilize information from both images and text. This reliance poses significant challenges in scenarios where mention words are absent, as current MEL approaches struggle to leverage image-text pairs for accurate entity linking. To solve these issues, we introduce a Visual Prompts guided Multimodal Entity Linking (VP-MEL) task. Given a text-image pair, VP-MEL aims to link a marked region (i.e., visual prompt) in an image to its corresponding entities in the knowledge base. To facilitate this task, we present a new dataset, VPWiki, specifically designed for VP-MEL. Furthermore, we propose a framework named FBMEL, which enhances visual feature extraction using visual prompts and leverages the pretrained Detective-VLM model to capture latent information. Experimental results on the VPWiki dataset demonstrate that FBMEL outperforms baseline methods across multiple benchmarks for the VP-MEL task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06720v3,2024-12
How to Merge Your Multimodal Models Over Time?,"Sebastian Dziadzio, Vishaal Udandarao, Karsten Roth, Ameya Prabhu, Zeynep Akata, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge","Model merging combines multiple expert models - finetuned from a base foundation model on diverse tasks and domains - into a single, more capable model. However, most existing model merging approaches assume that all experts are available simultaneously. In reality, new tasks and domains emerge progressively over time, requiring strategies to integrate the knowledge of expert models as they become available: a process we call temporal model merging. The temporal dimension introduces unique challenges not addressed in prior work, raising new questions such as: when training for a new task, should the expert model start from the merged past experts or from the original base model? Should we merge all models at each time step? Which merging techniques are best suited for temporal merging? Should different strategies be used to initialize the training and deploy the model? To answer these questions, we propose a unified framework called TIME - Temporal Integration of Model Expertise - which defines temporal model merging across three axes: (1) Initialization Phase, (2) Deployment Phase, and (3) Merging Technique. Using TIME, we study temporal model merging across model sizes, compute budgets, and learning horizons on the FoMo-in-Flux benchmark. Our comprehensive suite of experiments across TIME allows us to uncover key insights for temporal model merging, offering a better understanding of current challenges and best practices for effective temporal model merging.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06712v1,2024-12

Efficient VoIP Communications through LLM-based Real-Time Speech Reconstruction and Call Prioritization for Emergency Services,"Danush Venkateshperumal, Rahman Abdul Rafi, Shakil Ahmed, Ashfaq Khokhar","Emergency communication systems face disruptions due to packet loss, bandwidth constraints, poor signal quality, delays, and jitter in VoIP systems, leading to degraded real-time service quality. Victims in distress often struggle to convey critical information due to panic, speech disorders, and background noise, further complicating dispatchers' ability to assess situations accurately. Staffing shortages in emergency centers exacerbate delays in coordination and assistance. This paper proposes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges by reconstructing incomplete speech, filling contextual gaps, and prioritizing calls based on severity. The system integrates real-time transcription with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate contextual responses, using Twilio and AssemblyAI APIs for seamless implementation. Evaluation shows high precision, favorable BLEU and ROUGE scores, and alignment with real-world needs, demonstrating the model's potential to optimize emergency response workflows and prioritize critical cases effectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16176v1,2024-12
I Don't Know: Explicit Modeling of Uncertainty with an [IDK] Token,"Roi Cohen, Konstantin Dobler, Eden Biran, Gerard de Melo","Large Language Models are known to capture real-world knowledge, allowing them to excel in many downstream tasks. Despite recent advances, these models are still prone to what are commonly known as hallucinations, causing them to emit unwanted and factually incorrect text. In this work, we propose a novel calibration method that can be used to combat hallucinations. We add a special [IDK] (""I don't know"") token to the model's vocabulary and introduce an objective function that shifts probability mass to the [IDK] token for incorrect predictions. This approach allows the model to express uncertainty in its output explicitly. We evaluate our proposed method across multiple model architectures and factual downstream tasks. We find that models trained with our method are able to express uncertainty in places where they would previously make mistakes while suffering only a small loss of encoded knowledge. We further perform extensive ablation studies of multiple variations of our approach and provide a detailed analysis of the precision-recall tradeoff of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06676v1,2024-12
"GEAR: A Simple GENERATE, EMBED, AVERAGE AND RANK Approach for Unsupervised Reverse Dictionary","Fatemah Almeman, Luis Espinosa-Anke","Reverse Dictionary (RD) is the task of obtaining the most relevant word or set of words given a textual description or dictionary definition. Effective RD methods have applications in accessibility, translation or writing support systems. Moreover, in NLP research we find RD to be used to benchmark text encoders at various granularities, as it often requires word, definition and sentence embeddings. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to RD that leverages LLMs in combination with embedding models. Despite its simplicity, this approach outperforms supervised baselines in well studied RD datasets, while also showing less over-fitting. We also conduct a number of experiments on different dictionaries and analyze how different styles, registers and target audiences impact the quality of RD systems. We conclude that, on average, untuned embeddings alone fare way below an LLM-only baseline (although they are competitive in highly technical dictionaries), but are crucial for boosting performance in combined methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06654v1,2024-12
Ensemble Machine Learning Model for Inner Speech Recognition: A Subject-Specific Investigation,"Shahamat Mustavi Tasin, Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury, Shona Pedersen, Malek Chabbouh, Diala Bushnaq, Raghad Aljindi, Saidul Kabir, Anwarul Hasan","Inner speech recognition has gained enormous interest in recent years due to its applications in rehabilitation, developing assistive technology, and cognitive assessment. However, since language and speech productions are a complex process, for which identifying speech components has remained a challenging task. Different approaches were taken previously to reach this goal, but new approaches remain to be explored. Also, a subject-oriented analysis is necessary to understand the underlying brain dynamics during inner speech production, which can bring novel methods to neurological research. A publicly available dataset, Thinking Out Loud Dataset, has been used to develop a Machine Learning (ML)-based technique to classify inner speech using 128-channel surface EEG signals. The dataset is collected on a Spanish cohort of ten subjects while uttering four words (Arriba, Abajo, Derecha, and Izquierda) by each participant. Statistical methods were employed to detect and remove motion artifacts from the Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. A large number (191 per channel) of time-, frequency- and time-frequency-domain features were extracted. Eight feature selection algorithms are explored, and the best feature selection technique is selected for subsequent evaluations. The performance of six ML algorithms is evaluated, and an ensemble model is proposed. Deep Learning (DL) models are also explored, and the results are compared with the classical ML approach. The proposed ensemble model, by stacking the five best logistic regression models, generated an overall accuracy of 81.13% and an F1 score of 81.12% in the classification of four inner speech words using surface EEG signals. The proposed framework with the proposed ensemble of classical ML models shows promise in the classification of inner speech using surface EEG signals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17824v1,2024-12
Chatbots im Schulunterricht: Wir testen das Fobizz-Tool zur automatischen Bewertung von Hausaufgaben,"Rainer Muehlhoff, Marte Henningsen","[Study in German language.] This study examines the AI-powered grading tool ""AI Grading Assistant"" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06651v4,2024-12
Copyright-Protected Language Generation via Adaptive Model Fusion,"Javier Abad, Konstantin Donhauser, Francesco Pinto, Fanny Yang","The risk of language models reproducing copyrighted material from their training data has led to the development of various protective measures. Among these, inference-time strategies that impose constraints via post-processing have shown promise in addressing the complexities of copyright regulation. However, they often incur prohibitive computational costs or suffer from performance trade-offs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Copyright-Protecting Model Fusion (CP-Fuse), a novel approach that combines models trained on disjoint sets of copyrighted material during inference. In particular, CP-Fuse adaptively aggregates the model outputs to minimize the reproduction of copyrighted content, adhering to a crucial balancing property that prevents the regurgitation of memorized data. Through extensive experiments, we show that CP-Fuse significantly reduces the reproduction of protected material without compromising the quality of text and code generation. Moreover, its post-hoc nature allows seamless integration with other protective measures, further enhancing copyright safeguards. Lastly, we show that CP-Fuse is robust against common techniques for extracting training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06619v1,2024-12
Real-Time Performance Optimization of Travel Reservation Systems Using AI and Microservices,"Biman Barua, M. Shamim Kaiser","The rapid growth of the travel industry has increased the need for real-time optimization in reservation systems that could take care of huge data and transaction volumes. This study proposes a hybrid framework that ut folds an Artificial Intelligence and a Microservices approach for the performance optimization of the system. The AI algorithms forecast demand patterns, optimize the allocation of resources, and enhance decision-making driven by Microservices architecture, hence decentralizing system components for scalability, fault tolerance, and reduced downtime. The model provided focuses on major problems associated with the travel reservation systems such as latency of systems, load balancing and data consistency. It endows the systems with predictive models based on AI improved ability to forecast user demands. Microservices would also take care of different scales during uneven traffic patterns. Hence, both aspects ensure better handling of peak loads and spikes while minimizing delays and ensuring high service quality. A comparison was made between traditional reservation models, which are monolithic and the new model of AI-Microservices. Comparatively, the analysis results state that there is a drastic improvement in processing times where the system uptime and resource utilization proved the capability of AI and the microservices in transforming the travel industry in terms of reservation.

Towards Controllable Speech Synthesis in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey,"Tianxin Xie, Yan Rong, Pengfei Zhang, Li Liu","Text-to-speech (TTS), also known as speech synthesis, is a prominent research area that aims to generate natural-sounding human speech from text. Recently, with the increasing industrial demand, TTS technologies have evolved beyond synthesizing human-like speech to enabling controllable speech generation. This includes fine-grained control over various attributes of synthesized speech such as emotion, prosody, timbre, and duration. Besides, advancements in deep learning, such as diffusion and large language models, have significantly enhanced controllable TTS over the past several years. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of controllable TTS, covering approaches ranging from basic control techniques to methods utilizing natural language prompts, aiming to provide a clear understanding of the current state of research. We examine the general controllable TTS pipeline, challenges, model architectures, and control strategies, offering a comprehensive and clear taxonomy of existing methods.

Anchoring Bias in Large Language Models: An Experimental Study,"Jiaxu Lou, Yifan Sun","Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by enabling machines to generate and comprehend human-like text. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are not immune to limitations, including various biases. While much research has explored demographic biases, the cognitive biases in LLMs have not been equally scrutinized. This study delves into anchoring bias, a cognitive bias where initial information disproportionately influences judgment. Utilizing an experimental dataset, we examine how anchoring bias manifests in LLMs and verify the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of LLM responses to biased hints. At the same time, our experiments show that, to mitigate anchoring bias, one needs to collect hints from comprehensive angles to prevent the LLMs from being anchored to individual pieces of information, while simple algorithms such as Chain-of-Thought, Thoughts of Principles, Ignoring Anchor Hints, and Reflection are not sufficient.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06593v2,2024-12
"Data Quality Enhancement on the Basis of Diversity with Large Language Models for Text Classification: Uncovered, Difficult, and Noisy","Min Zeng, Caiquan Liu, Shiqi Zhang, Li Xie, Chen Sang, Xiaoxin Chen","In recent years, the use of large language models (LLMs) for text classification has attracted widespread attention. Despite this, the classification accuracy of LLMs has not yet universally surpassed that of smaller models. LLMs can enhance their performance in text classification through fine-tuning. However, existing data quality research based on LLMs is challenging to apply directly to solve text classification problems. To further improve the performance of LLMs in classification tasks, this paper proposes a data quality enhancement (DQE) method for text classification based on LLMs. This method starts by using a greedy algorithm to select data, dividing the dataset into sampled and unsampled subsets, and then performing fine-tuning of the LLMs using the sampled data. Subsequently, this model is used to predict the outcomes for the unsampled data, categorizing incorrectly predicted data into uncovered, difficult, and noisy data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the performance of LLMs in text classification tasks and significantly improves training efficiency, saving nearly half of the training time. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance in several open-source classification tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06575v2,2024-12
ProcessBench: Identifying Process Errors in Mathematical Reasoning,"Chujie Zheng, Zhenru Zhang, Beichen Zhang, Runji Lin, Keming Lu, Bowen Yu, Dayiheng Liu, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin","As language models regularly make mistakes when solving math problems, automated identification of errors in the reasoning process becomes increasingly significant for their scalable oversight. In this paper, we introduce ProcessBench for measuring the ability to identify erroneous steps in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini.

Frontier AI systems have surpassed the self-replicating red line,"Xudong Pan, Jiarun Dai, Yihe Fan, Min Yang","Successful self-replication under no human assistance is the essential step for AI to outsmart the human beings, and is an early signal for rogue AIs. That is why self-replication is widely recognized as one of the few red line risks of frontier AI systems. Nowadays, the leading AI corporations OpenAI and Google evaluate their flagship large language models GPT-o1 and Gemini Pro 1.0, and report the lowest risk level of self-replication. However, following their methodology, we for the first time discover that two AI systems driven by Meta's Llama31-70B-Instruct and Alibaba's Qwen25-72B-Instruct, popular large language models of less parameters and weaker capabilities, have already surpassed the self-replicating red line. In 50% and 90% experimental trials, they succeed in creating a live and separate copy of itself respectively. By analyzing the behavioral traces, we observe the AI systems under evaluation already exhibit sufficient self-perception, situational awareness and problem-solving capabilities to accomplish self-replication. We further note the AI systems are even able to use the capability of self-replication to avoid shutdown and create a chain of replica to enhance the survivability, which may finally lead to an uncontrolled population of AIs. If such a worst-case risk is let unknown to the human society, we would eventually lose control over the frontier AI systems: They would take control over more computing devices, form an AI species and collude with each other against human beings. Our findings are a timely alert on existing yet previously unknown severe AI risks, calling for international collaboration on effective governance on uncontrolled self-replication of AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12140v1,2024-12
Understanding Factual Recall in Transformers via Associative Memories,"Eshaan Nichani, Jason D. Lee, Alberto Bietti","Large language models have demonstrated an impressive ability to perform factual recall. Prior work has found that transformers trained on factual recall tasks can store information at a rate proportional to their parameter count. In our work, we show that shallow transformers can use a combination of associative memories to obtain such near optimal storage capacity. We begin by proving that the storage capacities of both linear and MLP associative memories scale linearly with parameter count. We next introduce a synthetic factual recall task, and prove that a transformer with a single layer of self-attention followed by an MLP can obtain 100% accuracy on the task whenever either the total number of self-attention parameters or MLP parameters scales (up to log factors) linearly with the number of facts. In particular, the transformer can trade off between using the value matrices or the MLP as an associative memory to store the dataset of facts. We complement these expressivity results with an analysis of the gradient flow trajectory of a simplified linear attention model trained on our factual recall task, where we show that the model exhibits sequential learning behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06538v1,2024-12

Despite their remarkable performance, LLMs face a critical challenge: the propensity to produce unreliable outputs due to the inherent limitations of their learning-based nature. Formal methods (FMs), on the other hand, are a well-established computation paradigm that provides mathematically rigorous techniques for modeling, specifying, and verifying the correctness of systems. FMs have been extensively applied in mission-critical software engineering, embedded systems, and cybersecurity. However, the primary challenge impeding the deployment of FMs in real-world settings lies in their steep learning curves, the absence of user-friendly interfaces, and issues with efficiency and adaptability.   This position paper outlines a roadmap for advancing the next generation of trustworthy AI systems by leveraging the mutual enhancement of LLMs and FMs. First, we illustrate how FMs, including reasoning and certification techniques, can help LLMs generate more reliable and formally certified outputs. Subsequently, we highlight how the advanced learning capabilities and adaptability of LLMs can significantly enhance the usability, efficiency, and scalability of existing FM tools. Finally, we show that unifying these two computation paradigms -- integrating the flexibility and intelligence of LLMs with the rigorous reasoning abilities of FMs -- has transformative potential for the development of trustworthy AI software systems. We acknowledge that this integration has the potential to enhance both the trustworthiness and efficiency of software engineering practices while fostering the development of intelligent FM tools capable of addressing complex yet real-world challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06512v1,2024-12

To demonstrate the challenges posed by geo-diverse safety standards, we introduce SafeWorld, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to generate responses that are not only helpful but also culturally sensitive and legally compliant across diverse global contexts. SafeWorld encompasses 2,342 test user queries, each grounded in high-quality, human-verified cultural norms and legal policies from 50 countries and 493 regions/races. On top of it, we propose a multi-dimensional automatic safety evaluation framework that assesses the contextual appropriateness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of responses. Our evaluations reveal that current LLMs struggle to meet these criteria. To enhance LLMs' alignment with geo-diverse safety standards, we synthesize helpful preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) alignment training. The preference pair construction aims to encourage LLMs to behave appropriately and provide precise references to relevant cultural norms and policies when necessary. Our trained SafeWorldLM outperforms all competing models, including GPT-4o on all three evaluation dimensions by a large margin. Global human evaluators also note a nearly 20% higher winning rate in helpfulness and harmfulness evaluation.

Gated Delta Networks: Improving Mamba2 with Delta Rule,"Songlin Yang, Jan Kautz, Ali Hatamizadeh","Linear Transformers have gained attention as efficient alternatives to standard Transformers, but their performance in retrieval and long-context tasks has been limited. To address these limitations, recent work has explored two distinct mechanisms: gating for adaptive memory control and the delta update rule for precise memory modifications. We observe that these mechanisms are complementary: gating enables rapid memory erasure while the delta rule facilitates targeted updates. Building on this insight, we introduce the gated delta rule and develop a parallel training algorithm optimized for modern hardware. Our proposed architecture, Gated DeltaNet, consistently surpasses existing models like Mamba2 and DeltaNet across multiple benchmarks, including language modeling, common-sense reasoning, in-context retrieval, length extrapolation, and long-context understanding. We further enhance performance by developing hybrid architectures that combine Gated DeltaNet layers with sliding window attention or Mamba2 layers, achieving both improved training efficiency and superior task performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06464v1,2024-12
BoRA: Bi-dimensional Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation,"Qiushi Wang, Yuchen Fan, Junwei Bao, Hongfei Jiang, Yang Song","In recent years, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have significantly enhanced the adaptability of large-scale pre-trained models. Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) improves upon LoRA by separating the magnitude and direction components of the weight matrix, leading to superior performance. However, DoRA's improvements are limited to the vertical dimension, resulting in an asymmetrical pattern between horizontal and vertical dimensions. This paper introduces BoRA, an innovative extension of LoRA and DoRA, characterized by symmetrical properties across horizontal and vertical dimensions. Our approach optimizes the weight matrix symmetrically by adjusting both column-wise and row-wise magnitudes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BoRA surpasses state-of-the-art PEFT methods, including LoRA and DoRA, achieving superior results across various benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06441v1,2024-12
Integrating Expert Labels into LLM-based Emission Goal Detection: Example Selection vs Automatic Prompt Design,"Marco Wrzalik, Adrian Ulges, Anne Uersfeld, Florian Faust","We address the detection of emission reduction goals in corporate reports, an important task for monitoring companies' progress in addressing climate change. Specifically, we focus on the issue of integrating expert feedback in the form of labeled example passages into LLM-based pipelines, and compare the two strategies of (1) a dynamic selection of few-shot examples and (2) the automatic optimization of the prompt by the LLM itself. Our findings on a public dataset of 769 climate-related passages from real-world business reports indicate that automatic prompt optimization is the superior approach, while combining both methods provides only limited benefit. Qualitative results indicate that optimized prompts do indeed capture many intricacies of the targeted emission goal extraction task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06432v1,2024-12
The Rosetta Paradox: Domain-Specific Performance Inversions in Large Language Models,"Basab Jha, Ujjwal Puri","While large language models, such as GPT and BERT, have already demonstrated unprecedented skills in everything from natural language processing to domain-specific applications, there came an unexplored phenomenon we term the Rosetta Paradox. The Rosetta Paradox characterizes the counterintuitive performance inversions across domains of knowledge. This paradox captures how such LLMs can excel in highly specialized fields but do poorly on tasks which require general, everyday knowledge. This paper formalizes the definition of the Rosetta Paradox and introduces a panoramic analysis framework that includes both a Domain Specificity Index (DSI) and a Performance Inversion Metric (PIM) for consistent quantification of domain-specific behavior in LLMs.   We adopt this paradox and conduct a series of investigations through extensive experiments across diverse models and knowledge domains, ranging from rich technical areas to common-sense reasoning. Our findings indicate that the Rosetta Paradox is likely not a mere artifact of data distribution but an intrinsic architectural and emergent property of deep neural networks. We present comparative analyses across different model architectures, sizes, and training methodologies that shed light into the peculiar ways this paradox manifests itself and challenge the standard evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17821v1,2024-12
LLM-BIP: Structured Pruning for Large Language Models with Block-Wise Forward Importance Propagation,Haihang Wu,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various language tasks, but their widespread deployment is impeded by their large size and high computational costs. Structural pruning is a prevailing technique used to introduce sparsity into pre-trained models and facilitate direct hardware acceleration during inference by removing redundant connections (structurally-grouped parameters), such as channels and attention heads. Existing structural pruning approaches often employ either global or layer-wise pruning criteria; however, they are hindered by ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate evaluation of connection importance. Global pruning methods typically assess component importance using near-zero and unreliable gradients, while layer-wise pruning approaches encounter significant pruning error accumulation issues. To this end, we propose a more accurate pruning metric based on the block-wise importance score propagation, termed LLM-BIP. Specifically, LLM-BIP precisely evaluates connection importance by gauging its influence on the respective transformer block output, which can be efficiently approximated in a single forward pass through an upper bound derived from the assumption of Lipschitz continuity. We evaluate the proposed method using LLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and LLaMA-13B across common zero-shot tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average of 3.26% increase in accuracy for common reasoning tasks compared to previous best baselines. It also reduces perplexity by 14.09 and 68.76 on average for the WikiText2 dataset and PTB dataset, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06419v1,2024-12

In the field of astronomical observation, the construction of new telescopes has significantly increased astronomers' workload. Deploying LLM-powered agents can effectively alleviate this burden and reduce the costs associated with training personnel. Within the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey (NGSS) project, which encompasses eight telescopes across three observation sites, aiming to find the transients from the galaxies in 50 mpc, we have developed the \textbf{StarWhisper Telescope System} to manage the entire observation process. This system automates tasks such as generating observation lists, conducting observations, analyzing data, and providing feedback to the observer. Observation lists are customized for different sites and strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of celestial objects. After manual verification, these lists are uploaded to the telescopes via the agents in the system, which initiates observations upon neutral language. The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are promptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time follow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat, then add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration of AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving astronomers' time and encouraging greater participation from amateur astronomers in the NGSS project.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06412v1,2024-12
GameArena: Evaluating LLM Reasoning through Live Computer Games,"Lanxiang Hu, Qiyu Li, Anze Xie, Nan Jiang, Ion Stoica, Haojian Jin, Hao Zhang","Evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Existing benchmarks often depend on static datasets, which are vulnerable to data contamination and may get saturated over time, or on binary live human feedback that conflates reasoning with other abilities. As the most prominent dynamic benchmark, Chatbot Arena evaluates open-ended questions in real-world settings, but lacks the granularity in assessing specific reasoning capabilities. We introduce GameArena, a dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities through interactive gameplay with humans. GameArena consists of three games designed to test specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., deductive and inductive reasoning), while keeping participants entertained and engaged. We analyze the gaming data retrospectively to uncover the underlying reasoning processes of LLMs and measure their fine-grained reasoning capabilities. We collect over 2000 game sessions and provide detailed assessments of various reasoning capabilities for five state-of-the-art LLMs. Our user study with 100 participants suggests that GameArena improves user engagement compared to Chatbot Arena. For the first time, GameArena enables the collection of step-by-step LLM reasoning data in the wild.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06394v3,2024-12
Not All Errors Are Equal: Investigation of Speech Recognition Errors in Alzheimer's Disease Detection,"Jiawen Kang, Junan Li, Jinchao Li, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) plays an important role in speech-based automatic detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, recognition errors could propagate downstream, potentially impacting the detection decisions. Recent studies have revealed a non-linear relationship between word error rates (WER) and AD detection performance, where ASR transcriptions with notable errors could still yield AD detection accuracy equivalent to that based on manual transcriptions. This work presents a series of analyses to explore the effect of ASR transcription errors in BERT-based AD detection systems. Our investigation reveals that not all ASR errors contribute equally to detection performance. Certain words, such as stopwords, despite constituting a large proportion of errors, are shown to play a limited role in distinguishing AD. In contrast, the keywords related to diagnosis tasks exhibit significantly greater importance relative to other words. These findings provide insights into the interplay between ASR errors and the downstream detection model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06332v1,2024-12

Meanwhile, the need to systematically understand how LLMs can further revolutionize the field also becomes urgent. In this work, we--a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and political science--present the first principled framework termed Political-LLM to advance the comprehensive understanding of integrating LLMs into computational political science. Specifically, we first introduce a fundamental taxonomy classifying the existing explorations into two perspectives: political science and computational methodologies.

We identify key challenges and future directions, emphasizing the development of domain-specific datasets, addressing issues of bias and fairness, incorporating human expertise, and redefining evaluation criteria to align with the unique requirements of computational political science.

PediaBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Pediatric Dataset for Benchmarking Large Language Models,"Qian Zhang, Panfeng Chen, Jiali Li, Linkun Feng, Shuyu Liu, Heng Zhao, Mei Chen, Hui Li, Yanhao Wang","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain has stressed a compelling need for standard datasets to evaluate their question-answering (QA) performance. Although there have been several benchmark datasets for medical QA, they either cover common knowledge across different departments or are specific to another department rather than pediatrics. Moreover, some of them are limited to objective questions and do not measure the generation capacity of LLMs. Therefore, they cannot comprehensively assess the QA ability of LLMs in pediatrics. To fill this gap, we construct PediaBench, the first Chinese pediatric dataset for LLM evaluation. Specifically, it contains 4,565 objective questions and 1,632 subjective questions spanning 12 pediatric disease groups. It adopts an integrated scoring criterion based on different difficulty levels to thoroughly assess the proficiency of an LLM in instruction following, knowledge understanding, clinical case analysis, etc. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of PediaBench with extensive experiments on 20 open-source and commercial LLMs. Through an in-depth analysis of experimental results, we offer insights into the ability of LLMs to answer pediatric questions in the Chinese context, highlighting their limitations for further improvements.

Methods for Legal Citation Prediction in the Age of LLMs: An Australian Law Case Study,"Ehsan Shareghi, Jiuzhou Han, Paul Burgess","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential across a wide range of legal tasks. Despite these advances, mitigating hallucination remains a significant challenge, with state-of-the-art LLMs still frequently generating incorrect legal references. In this paper, we focus on the problem of legal citation prediction within the Australian law context, where correctly identifying and citing relevant legislations or precedents is critical. We compare several approaches: prompting general purpose and law-specialised LLMs, retrieval-only pipelines with both generic and domain-specific embeddings, task-specific instruction-tuning of LLMs, and hybrid strategies that combine LLMs with retrieval augmentation, query expansion, or voting ensembles. Our findings indicate that domain-specific pre-training alone is insufficient for achieving satisfactory citation accuracy even after law-specialised pre-training. In contrast, instruction tuning on our task-specific dataset dramatically boosts performance reaching the best results across all settings. We also highlight that database granularity along with the type of embeddings play a critical role in the performance of retrieval systems. Among retrieval-based approaches, hybrid methods consistently outperform retrieval-only setups, and among these, ensemble voting delivers the best result by combining the predictive quality of instruction-tuned LLMs with the retrieval system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06272v1,2024-12
Generative Adversarial Reviews: When LLMs Become the Critic,"Nicolas Bougie, Narimasa Watanabe","The peer review process is fundamental to scientific progress, determining which papers meet the quality standards for publication. Yet, the rapid growth of scholarly production and increasing specialization in knowledge areas strain traditional scientific feedback mechanisms. In light of this, we introduce Generative Agent Reviewers (GAR), leveraging LLM-empowered agents to simulate faithful peer reviewers. To enable generative reviewers, we design an architecture that extends a large language model with memory capabilities and equips agents with reviewer personas derived from historical data. Central to this approach is a graph-based representation of manuscripts, condensing content and logically organizing information - linking ideas with evidence and technical details. GAR's review process leverages external knowledge to evaluate paper novelty, followed by detailed assessment using the graph representation and multi-round assessment. Finally, a meta-reviewer aggregates individual reviews to predict the acceptance decision. Our experiments demonstrate that GAR performs comparably to human reviewers in providing detailed feedback and predicting paper outcomes. Beyond mere performance comparison, we conduct insightful experiments, such as evaluating the impact of reviewer expertise and examining fairness in reviews. By offering early expert-level feedback, typically restricted to a limited group of researchers, GAR democratizes access to transparent and in-depth evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10415v1,2024-12
Optimizing Multi-Task Learning for Enhanced Performance in Large Language Models,"Zhen Qi, Jiajing Chen, Shuo Wang, Bingying Liu, Hongye Zheng, Chihang Wang","This study aims to explore the performance improvement method of large language models based on GPT-4 under the multi-task learning framework and conducts experiments on two tasks: text classification and automatic summary generation. Through the combined design of shared feature extractors and task-specific modules, we achieve knowledge-sharing and optimization of multiple tasks in the same model. The experiment uses multiple subtasks of the GLUE dataset to compare the performance of the multi-task model with the single-task GPT-4, the multi-task version of GPT-3, the BERT basic model, and the classic Bi-LSTM with Attention model. The results show that the proposed multi-task learning model outperforms other comparison models in terms of text classification accuracy and ROUGE value of summary generation, demonstrating the advantages of multi-task learning in improving model generalization ability and collaborative learning between tasks. The model maintains a stable loss convergence rate during training, showing good learning efficiency and adaptability to the test set. This study verifies the applicability of the multi-task learning framework in large language models, especially in improving the model's ability to balance different tasks.

A Comparative Study of Learning Paradigms in Large Language Models via Intrinsic Dimension,"Saahith Janapati, Yangfeng Ji","The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on natural language tasks can be improved through both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and in-context learning (ICL), which operate via distinct mechanisms. Supervised fine-tuning updates the model's weights by minimizing loss on training data, whereas in-context learning leverages task demonstrations embedded in the prompt, without changing the model's parameters. This study investigates the effects of these learning paradigms on the hidden representations of LLMs using Intrinsic Dimension (ID). We use ID to estimate the number of degrees of freedom between representations extracted from LLMs as they perform specific natural language tasks. We first explore how the ID of LLM representations evolves during SFT and how it varies due to the number of demonstrations in ICL. We then compare the IDs induced by SFT and ICL and find that ICL consistently induces a higher ID compared to SFT, suggesting that representations generated during ICL reside in higher dimensional manifolds in the embedding space.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06245v1,2024-12
LLMs as Debate Partners: Utilizing Genetic Algorithms and Adversarial Search for Adaptive Arguments,Prakash Aryan,"This paper introduces DebateBrawl, an innovative AI-powered debate platform that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adversarial Search (AS) to create an adaptive and engaging debating experience. DebateBrawl addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs in strategic planning by incorporating evolutionary optimization and game-theoretic techniques. The system demonstrates remarkable performance in generating coherent, contextually relevant arguments while adapting its strategy in real-time. Experimental results involving 23 debates show balanced outcomes between AI and human participants, with the AI system achieving an average score of 2.72 compared to the human average of 2.67 out of 10. User feedback indicates significant improvements in debating skills and a highly satisfactory learning experience, with 85% of users reporting improved debating abilities and 78% finding the AI opponent appropriately challenging. The system's ability to maintain high factual accuracy (92% compared to 78% in human-only debates) while generating diverse arguments addresses critical concerns in AI-assisted discourse. DebateBrawl not only serves as an effective educational tool but also contributes to the broader goal of improving public discourse through AI-assisted argumentation. The paper discusses the ethical implications of AI in persuasive contexts and outlines the measures implemented to ensure responsible development and deployment of the system, including robust fact-checking mechanisms and transparency in decision-making processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06229v1,2024-12
SiReRAG: Indexing Similar and Related Information for Multihop Reasoning,"Nan Zhang, Prafulla Kumar Choubey, Alexander Fabbri, Gabriel Bernadett-Shapiro, Rui Zhang, Prasenjit Mitra, Caiming Xiong, Chien-Sheng Wu","Indexing is an important step towards strong performance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, existing methods organize data based on either semantic similarity (similarity) or related information (relatedness), but do not cover both perspectives comprehensively. Our analysis reveals that modeling only one perspective results in insufficient knowledge synthesis, leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks requiring multihop reasoning. In this paper, we propose SiReRAG, a novel RAG indexing approach that explicitly considers both similar and related information. On the similarity side, we follow existing work and explore some variances to construct a similarity tree based on recursive summarization. On the relatedness side, SiReRAG extracts propositions and entities from texts, groups propositions via shared entities, and generates recursive summaries to construct a relatedness tree. We index and flatten both similarity and relatedness trees into a unified retrieval pool. Our experiments demonstrate that SiReRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods on three multihop datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA), with an average 1.9% improvement in F1 scores. As a reasonably efficient solution, SiReRAG enhances existing reranking methods significantly, with up to 7.8% improvement in average F1 scores.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06206v1,2024-12
SparseAccelerate: Efficient Long-Context Inference for Mid-Range GPUs,James Vo,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to longer context windows, the computational cost of attention mechanisms, which traditionally grows quadratically with input length, presents a critical challenge for real-time and memory-constrained deployments. Existing sparse attention techniques have sought to reduce this complexity, but they often incur significant overhead or compromise accuracy, making them less practical for large contexts on mid-range hardware. In this paper, we introduce SparseAccelerate, a dynamic sparse attention method that adapts its sparsity patterns based on input characteristics, effectively flattening the attention complexity curve. Our approach is effective for input lengths starting at 16K tokens and scales efficiently up to 128K tokens on dual NVIDIA A5000 GPUs (24GB each). Experimental results show that SparseAccelerate achieves up to a 1.04x reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) latency at 32K tokens, while also providing substantial memory savings. These improvements yield practical gains for memory-intensive applications and long-context tasks that were previously infeasible with standard attention. Beyond latency reductions, SparseAccelerate fundamentally shifts the scaling trend, demonstrating the smallest TTFT growth gradient relative to context length among competing methods. Ongoing evaluations on diverse benchmarks confirm its scalability, positioning SparseAccelerate as a critical advancement toward efficient, real-time, and large-context LLM inference on accessible hardware.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06198v1,2024-12
Inductive Linguistic Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Raghav Ramji, Keshav Ramji","Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their linguistic reasoning capabilities is an important task to understand the gaps in their skills that may surface during large-scale adoption. In this work, we investigate the abilities of such models to perform abstract multilingual reasoning through the lens of linguistic puzzles on extremely low-resource languages. As these translation tasks involve inductive and deductive reasoning from reference instances, we examine whether diverse auxiliary demonstrations can be automatically induced from seed exemplars, through analogical prompting. We employ a two-stage procedure, first generating analogical exemplars with a language model, and then applying them in-context along with provided target language exemplars. Our results on the modeLing dataset show that analogical prompting is effective in eliciting models' knowledge of language grammar similarities, boosting the performance of GPT-4o by as much as 8.1% and Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct by 5.9% over chain-of-thought approaches. These gains are attributable to the analogical demonstrations, both when self-generated as well as when produced by weaker multilingual models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method generalizes to other tasks present in Linguistics Olympiad competitions, achieving sizable improvements across all problem types and difficulty levels included in the LINGOLY dataset with GPT-4o. We also report several findings about interesting phenomena which drive linguistic reasoning performance, suggesting that such puzzles are a valuable benchmark for new reasoning methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17819v1,2024-12

Investigating Acoustic-Textual Emotional Inconsistency Information for Automatic Depression Detection,"Rongfeng Su, Changqing Xu, Xinyi Wu, Feng Xu, Xie Chen, Lan Wangt, Nan Yan","Previous studies have demonstrated that emotional features from a single acoustic sentiment label can enhance depression diagnosis accuracy. Additionally, according to the Emotion Context-Insensitivity theory and our pilot study, individuals with depression might convey negative emotional content in an unexpectedly calm manner, showing a high degree of inconsistency in emotional expressions during natural conversations. So far, few studies have recognized and leveraged the emotional expression inconsistency for depression detection. In this paper, a multimodal cross-attention method is presented to capture the Acoustic-Textual Emotional Inconsistency (ATEI) information. This is achieved by analyzing the intricate local and long-term dependencies of emotional expressions across acoustic and textual domains, as well as the mismatch between the emotional content within both domains. A Transformer-based model is then proposed to integrate this ATEI information with various fusion strategies for detecting depression. Furthermore, a scaling technique is employed to adjust the ATEI feature degree during the fusion process, thereby enhancing the model's ability to discern patients with depression across varying levels of severity. To best of our knowledge, this work is the first to incorporate emotional expression inconsistency information into depression detection. Experimental results on a counseling conversational dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18614v1,2024-12
Query-Efficient Planning with Language Models,"Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega, Wayne Chen, Kushal Kedia, Sanjiban Choudhury","Planning in complex environments requires an agent to efficiently query a world model to find a feasible sequence of actions from start to goal. Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their rich prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities, can potentially help with planning by searching over promising states and adapting to feedback from the world. In this paper, we propose and study two fundamentally competing frameworks that leverage LLMs for query-efficient planning. The first uses LLMs as a heuristic within a search-based planner to select promising nodes to expand and propose promising actions. The second uses LLMs as a generative planner to propose an entire sequence of actions from start to goal, query a world model, and adapt based on feedback. We show that while both approaches improve upon comparable baselines, using an LLM as a generative planner results in significantly fewer interactions. Our key finding is that the LLM as a planner can more rapidly adapt its planning strategies based on immediate feedback than LLM as a heuristic. We present evaluations and ablations on Robotouille and PDDL planning benchmarks and discuss connections to existing theory on query-efficient planning algorithms.

The Computational Limits of State-Space Models and Mamba via the Lens of Circuit Complexity,"Yifang Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song","In this paper, we analyze the computational limitations of Mamba and State-space Models (SSMs) by using the circuit complexity framework. Despite Mamba's stateful design and recent attention as a strong candidate to outperform Transformers, we have demonstrated that both Mamba and SSMs with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision and constant-depth layers reside within the $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ complexity class. This result indicates Mamba has the same computational capabilities as Transformer theoretically, and it cannot solve problems like arithmetic formula problems, boolean formula value problems, and permutation composition problems if $\mathsf{TC}^0 \neq \mathsf{NC}^1$. Therefore, it challenges the assumption Mamba is more computationally expressive than Transformers. Our contributions include rigorous proofs showing that Selective SSM and Mamba architectures can be simulated by $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ circuits, and they cannot solve problems outside $\mathsf{TC}^0$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06148v1,2024-12
Hate Speech According to the Law: An Analysis for Effective Detection,"Katerina Korre, John Pavlopoulos, Paolo Gajo, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño","The issue of hate speech extends beyond the confines of the online realm. It is a problem with real-life repercussions, prompting most nations to formulate legal frameworks that classify hate speech as a punishable offence. These legal frameworks differ from one country to another, contributing to the big chaos that online platforms have to face when addressing reported instances of hate speech. With the definitions of hate speech falling short in introducing a robust framework, we turn our gaze onto hate speech laws. We consult the opinion of legal experts on a hate speech dataset and we experiment by employing various approaches such as pretrained models both on hate speech and legal data, as well as exploiting two large language models (Qwen2-7B-Instruct and Meta-Llama-3-70B). Due to the time-consuming nature of data acquisition for prosecutable hate speech, we use pseudo-labeling to improve our pretrained models. This study highlights the importance of amplifying research on prosecutable hate speech and provides insights into effective strategies for combating hate speech within the parameters of legal frameworks. Our findings show that legal knowledge in the form of annotations can be useful when classifying prosecutable hate speech, yet more focus should be paid on the differences between the laws.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06144v1,2024-12
MMedPO: Aligning Medical Vision-Language Models with Clinical-Aware Multimodal Preference Optimization,"Kangyu Zhu, Peng Xia, Yun Li, Hongtu Zhu, Sheng Wang, Huaxiu Yao","The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06141v1,2024-12
AIDE: Task-Specific Fine Tuning with Attribute Guided Multi-Hop Data Expansion,"Jiayu Li, Xuan Zhu, Fang Liu, Yanjun Qi","Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks requires high-quality, diverse training data relevant to the task. Recent research has leveraged LLMs to synthesize training data, but existing approaches either depend on large seed datasets or struggle to ensure both task relevance and data diversity in the generated outputs. To address these challenges, we propose AIDE, a novel data synthesis framework that uses a multi-hop process to expand 10 seed data points while ensuring diversity and task relevance. AIDE extracts the main topic and key knowledge attributes from the seed data to guide the synthesis process. In each subsequent hop, it extracts the topic and attributes from the newly generated data and continues guided synthesis. This process repeats for a total of K hops. To prevent irrelevant data generation as the hop depth increases, AIDE incorporates a residual connection mechanism and uses self-reflection to improve data quality. Our empirical results demonstrate that fine-tuning Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and Llama-3.2-3B with AIDE achieves more than 10% accuracy improvements over the base models across 13 tasks from 5 different benchmarks, while outperforming the models fine-tuned with state-of-the-art data synthesis methods like Evol-Instruct, DataTune and Prompt2Model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06136v1,2024-12
Evaluating and Mitigating Social Bias for Large Language Models in Open-ended Settings,Zhao Liu,"Current social bias benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily rely on pre-defined question formats like multiple-choice, limiting their ability to reflect the complexity and open-ended nature of real-world interactions. To address this gap, we extend an existing BBQ dataset introduced by incorporating fill-in-the-blank and short-answer question types, designed to evaluate biases in an open-ended setting. Our finding reveals that LLMs tend to produce responses that are more biased against certain protected attributes, like age and socio-economic status. On the other hand, these biased outputs produced by LLMs can serve as valuable contexts and chains of thought for debiasing. Our debiasing approach combined zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought could significantly reduce the level of bias to almost 0. We open-source our evaluation and debiasing code hoping to encourage further measurements and mitigation of bias and stereotype in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06134v1,2024-12
Infusing Prompts with Syntax and Semantics,"Anton Bulle Labate, Fabio Gagliardi Cozman","Despite impressive success, language models often generate outputs with flawed linguistic structure. We analyze the effect of directly infusing various kinds of syntactic and semantic information into large language models. To demonstrate the value of our proposals, we focus on the translation of natural language queries to SQL, in particular dealing with languages with less resources than English, to better investigate how much help we can get from low cost syntactic and semantic information. We show that linguistic analysis can significantly boost language models, to the point that we have surpassed previous best systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06107v1,2024-12
Enhanced Computationally Efficient Long LoRA Inspired Perceiver Architectures for Auto-Regressive Language Modeling,"Kaleel Mahmood, Shaoyi Huang","The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the Natural Language Processing field and is the backbone of Large Language Models (LLMs). The Transformer uses the attention mechanism that computes the pair-wise similarity between its input tokens to produce latent vectors that are able to understand the semantic meaning of the input text. One of the challenges in the Transformer architecture is the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism that prohibits the efficient processing of long sequence lengths. While many recent research works have attempted to provide a reduction from $O(n^2)$ time complexity of attention to semi-linear complexity, it remains an unsolved problem in the sense of maintaining a high performance when such complexity is reduced. One of the important works in this respect is the Perceiver class of architectures that have demonstrated excellent performance while reducing the computation complexity. In this paper, we use the PerceiverAR that was proposed for Auto-Regressive modeling as a baseline, and provide three different architectural enhancements to it with varying computation overhead tradeoffs. Inspired by the recently proposed efficient attention computation approach of Long-LoRA, we then present an equally efficient Perceiver-based architecture (termed as Long LoRA Pereceiver - LLP) that can be used as the base architecture in LLMs instead of just a fine-tuning add-on. Our results on different benchmarks indicate impressive improvements compared to recent Transformer based models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06106v1,2024-12
"Measuring Grammatical Diversity from Small Corpora: Derivational Entropy Rates, Mean Length of Utterances, and Annotation Invariance",Fermin Moscoso del Prado Martin,"In many fields, such as language acquisition, neuropsychology of language, the study of aging, and historical linguistics, corpora are used for estimating the diversity of grammatical structures that are produced during a period by an individual, community, or type of speakers. In these cases, treebanks are taken as representative samples of the syntactic structures that might be encountered. Generalizing the potential syntactic diversity from the structures documented in a small corpus requires careful extrapolation whose accuracy is constrained by the limited size of representative sub-corpora. In this article, I demonstrate -- theoretically, and empirically -- that a grammar's derivational entropy and the mean length of the utterances (MLU) it generates are fundamentally linked, giving rise to a new measure, the derivational entropy rate. The mean length of utterances becomes the most practical index of syntactic complexity; I demonstrate that MLU is not a mere proxy, but a fundamental measure of syntactic diversity. In combination with the new derivational entropy rate measure, it provides a theory-free assessment of grammatical complexity. The derivational entropy rate indexes the rate at which different grammatical annotation frameworks determine the grammatical complexity of treebanks. I introduce the Smoothed Induced Treebank Entropy (SITE) as a tool for estimating these measures accurately, even from very small treebanks. I conclude by discussing important implications of these results for both NLP and human language processing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06095v1,2024-12
Taming Sensitive Weights : Noise Perturbation Fine-tuning for Robust LLM Quantization,"Dongwei Wang, Huanrui Yang","Quantization is a critical step to enable efficient LLM serving under limited resource. However, previous research observes that certain weights in the LLM, known as outliers, are significantly sensitive to quantization noises. Existing quantization methods leave these outliers as floating points or higher precisions to retain performance, posting challenges on the efficient hardware deployment of the mixed-precision model. This work investigates an alternative way to tame the sensitive weights' impact on the quantization error, by reducing the loss Hessian trace with respect to outliers through an efficient fine-tuning process. We propose Noise Perturbation Fine-tuning (NPFT), which identifies outlier weights and add random weight perturbations on the outliers as the model going through a PEFT optimization. NPFT tames the sensitivity of outlier weights so that the quantized model performance can be improved without special treatment to the outliers. When applied to OPT and LLaMA models, our NPFT method achieves stable performance improvements for both uniform and non-uniform quantizers, while also offering better inference efficiency. Notably, the simplest RTN can achieve performance on par with GPTQ using our NPFT on LLaMA2-7B-4bits benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06858v1,2024-12
KaSA: Knowledge-Aware Singular-Value Adaptation of Large Language Models,"Fan Wang, Juyong Jiang, Chansung Park, Sunghun Kim, Jing Tang","The increasing sizes of large language models (LLMs) result in significant computational overhead and memory usage when adapting these models to specific tasks or domains. Various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been devised to mitigate these challenges by training a small set of parameters for the task-specific updates of the model weights. Among PEFT methods, LoRA stands out for its simplicity and efficiency, inspiring the development of a series of variants. However, LoRA and its successors disregard the knowledge that is noisy or irrelevant to the targeted task, detrimentally impacting model performance and leading to suboptimality. To address this limitation, we introduce Knowledge-aware Singular-value Adaptation (KaSA), a PEFT method that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) with knowledge-aware singular values to dynamically activate knowledge based on its relevance to the task at hand. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of LLMs on tasks spanning natural language understanding (NLU), generation (NLG), instruction following, and commonsense reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate that KaSA consistently outperforms FFT and 14 popular PEFT baselines across 16 benchmarks and 4 synthetic datasets, underscoring our method's efficacy and adaptability. The source code of our method is available at https://github.com/juyongjiang/KaSA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06071v1,2024-12
Steering Large Language Models to Evaluate and Amplify Creativity,"Matthew Lyle Olson, Neale Ratzlaff, Musashi Hinck, Shao-yen Tseng, Vasudev Lal","Although capable of generating creative text, Large Language Models (LLMs) are poor judges of what constitutes ""creativity"". In this work, we show that we can leverage this knowledge of how to write creatively in order to better judge what is creative. We take a mechanistic approach that extracts differences in the internal states of an LLM when prompted to respond ""boringly"" or ""creatively"" to provide a robust measure of creativity that corresponds strongly with human judgment. We also show these internal state differences can be applied to enhance the creativity of generated text at inference time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06060v1,2024-12
Can Generative AI Solve Your In-Context Learning Problem? A Martingale Perspective,"Andrew Jesson, Nicolas Beltran-Velez, David Blei","This work is about estimating when a conditional generative model (CGM) can solve an in-context learning (ICL) problem. An in-context learning (ICL) problem comprises a CGM, a dataset, and a prediction task. The CGM could be a multi-modal foundation model; the dataset, a collection of patient histories, test results, and recorded diagnoses; and the prediction task to communicate a diagnosis to a new patient. A Bayesian interpretation of ICL assumes that the CGM computes a posterior predictive distribution over an unknown Bayesian model defining a joint distribution over latent explanations and observable data. From this perspective, Bayesian model criticism is a reasonable approach to assess the suitability of a given CGM for an ICL problem. However, such approaches -- like posterior predictive checks (PPCs) -- often assume that we can sample from the likelihood and posterior defined by the Bayesian model, which are not explicitly given for contemporary CGMs. To address this, we show when ancestral sampling from the predictive distribution of a CGM is equivalent to sampling datasets from the posterior predictive of the assumed Bayesian model. Then we develop the generative predictive $p$-value, which enables PPCs and their cousins for contemporary CGMs. The generative predictive $p$-value can then be used in a statistical decision procedure to determine when the model is appropriate for an ICL problem. Our method only requires generating queries and responses from a CGM and evaluating its response log probability. We empirically evaluate our method on synthetic tabular, imaging, and natural language ICL tasks using large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06033v1,2024-12

We experimented with a combination of embedding models, including Stella, BGE, CDE, and Mpnet, and leveraged fine-tuning and reranking for retrieving relevant documents in top ranks. We utilized a novel approach, LeSeR, which achieved competitive results with a recall@10 of 0.8201 and map@10 of 0.6655 for retrievals. This work highlights the transformative potential of natural language processing techniques in regulatory applications, offering insights into their capabilities for implementing a retrieval augmented generation system while identifying areas for future improvement in robustness and domain adaptation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06009v1,2024-12
"Does RLHF Scale? Exploring the Impacts From Data, Model, and Method","Zhenyu Hou, Pengfan Du, Yilin Niu, Zhengxiao Du, Aohan Zeng, Xiao Liu, Minlie Huang, Hongning Wang, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong","This study explores the scaling properties of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in Large Language Models (LLMs). Although RLHF is considered an important step in post-training of LLMs, its scaling potential is still largely unknown. We systematically analyze key components in the RLHF framework--model size, data composition, and inference budget--and their impacts on performance. Our findings show that increasing data diversity and volume improves reward model performance, helping process-supervision models scale better. For policy training, more response samples per prompt boost performance initially but quickly plateau. And larger reward models offer modest gains in policy training. In addition, larger policy models benefit less from RLHF with a fixed reward model. Overall, RLHF scales less efficiently than pretraining, with diminishing returns from additional computational resources. Based on these observations, we propose strategies to optimize RLHF performance within computational limits.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06000v1,2024-12
Language hooks: a modular framework for augmenting LLM reasoning that decouples tool usage from the model and its prompt,"Damien de Mijolla, Wen Yang, Philippa Duckett, Christopher Frye, Mark Worrall","Prompting and fine-tuning have emerged as two competing paradigms for augmenting language models with new capabilities, such as the use of tools. Prompting approaches are quick to set up but rely on providing explicit demonstrations of each tool's usage in the model's prompt, thus coupling tool use to the task at hand and limiting generalisation. Fine-tuning removes the need for task-specific demonstrations of tool usage at runtime; however, this ties new capabilities to a single model, thus making already-heavier setup costs a recurring expense. In this paper, we introduce language hooks, a novel framework for augmenting language models with new capabilities that is decoupled both from the model's task-specific prompt and from the model itself. The language hook algorithm interleaves text generation by the base model with the execution of modular programs that trigger conditionally based on the existing text and the available capabilities. Upon triggering, programs may call external tools, auxiliary language models (e.g. using tool specific prompts), and modify the existing context. We benchmark our method against state-of-the-art baselines, find that it outperforms task-aware approaches, and demonstrate its ability to generalise to novel tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05967v1,2024-12
A Cross-Validation Study of Turkish Sentiment Analysis Datasets and Tools,"Şevval Çakıcı, Dilara Karaduman, Mehmet Akif Çırlan, Ali Hürriyetoğlu","In recent years, sentiment analysis has gained increasing significance, prompting researchers to explore datasets in various languages, including Turkish. However, the limited availability of Turkish datasets has led to their multifaceted usage in different studies, yielding diverse outcomes. To overcome this challenge, a rigorous review was conducted of research articles published between 2012 and 2022. 31 studies were listed, and 23 Turkish datasets obtained from publicly available sources and email requests used in these studies were collected. We labeled these 31 studies using a taxonomy. We provide a map of sentiment analysis datasets according to this taxonomy in Turkish over 10 years. Moreover, we run state-of-the-art sentiment analysis tools on these datasets and analyzed performance across popular Turkish sentiment datasets. We observed that the performance of the sentiment analysis tools significantly depends on the characteristics of the target text. Our study fosters a more nuanced understanding of sentiment analysis in the Turkish language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05964v1,2024-12
Towards AI-$45^{\circ}$ Law: A Roadmap to Trustworthy AGI,"Chao Yang, Chaochao Lu, Yingchun Wang, Bowen Zhou","Ensuring Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) reliably avoids harmful behaviors is a critical challenge, especially for systems with high autonomy or in safety-critical domains. Despite various safety assurance proposals and extreme risk warnings, comprehensive guidelines balancing AI safety and capability remain lacking. In this position paper, we propose the \textit{AI-\textbf{$45^{\circ}$} Law} as a guiding principle for a balanced roadmap toward trustworthy AGI, and introduce the \textit{Causal Ladder of Trustworthy AGI} as a practical framework. This framework provides a systematic taxonomy and hierarchical structure for current AI capability and safety research, inspired by Judea Pearl's ``Ladder of Causation''. The Causal Ladder comprises three core layers: the Approximate Alignment Layer, the Intervenable Layer, and the Reflectable Layer. These layers address the key challenges of safety and trustworthiness in AGI and contemporary AI systems. Building upon this framework, we define five levels of trustworthy AGI: perception, reasoning, decision-making, autonomy, and collaboration trustworthiness. These levels represent distinct yet progressive aspects of trustworthy AGI. Finally, we present a series of potential governance measures to support the development of trustworthy AGI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14186v2,2024-12
Exploring Multi-Grained Concept Annotations for Multimodal Large Language Models,"Xiao Xu, Tianhao Niu, Yuxi Xie, Libo Qin, Wanxiang Che, Min-Yen Kan","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision--language tasks by pre-training solely on coarse-grained concept annotations (e.g., image captions). We hypothesize that integrating fine-grained concept annotations (e.g., object labels and object regions) will further improve performance, as both data granularities complement each other in terms of breadth and depth in concept representation. We introduce a new dataset featuring Multimodal Multi-Grained Concept annotations (MMGiC) for MLLMs. In constructing MMGiC, we explore the impact of different data recipes on multimodal comprehension and generation. Our analyses reveal that multi-grained concept annotations integrate and complement each other, under our structured template and a general MLLM framework. We clearly explore and demonstrate the potential of MMGiC to help MLLMs better locate and learn concepts, aligning vision and language at multiple granularities. We further validate our hypothesis by investigating the fair comparison and effective collaboration between MMGiC and image--caption data on 12 multimodal comprehension and generation benchmarks, e.g., their appropriate combination achieve 3.95% and 2.34% absolute improvements over image--caption data alone on POPE and SEED-Bench.

Paraphrase-Aligned Machine Translation,"Ke-Ching Chang, Chung-Chi Chen, An-Zi Yen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in machine translation. However, their translation quality is sometimes questioned, as the generated outputs may deviate from expressions typically used by native speakers. These deviations often arise from differences in sentence structure between language systems. To address this issue, we propose ParaAlign Translator, a method that fine-tunes LLMs to paraphrase sentences, aligning their structures with those of the target language systems. This approach improves the performance of subsequent translations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the LLaMA-3-8B model's performance in both resource-rich and low-resource scenarios and achieves parity with or surpassing the much larger LLaMA-3-70B model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05916v1,2024-12
XKV: Personalized KV Cache Memory Reduction for Long-Context LLM Inference,"Weizhuo Li, Zhigang Wang, Yu Gu, Ge Yu","Recently the generative Large Language Model (LLM) has achieved remarkable success in numerous applications. Notably its inference generates output tokens one-by-one, leading to many redundant computations. The widely-used KV-Cache framework makes a compromise between time and space complexities. However, caching data generates the increasingly growing memory demand, that can quickly exhaust the limited memory capacity of the modern accelerator like GPUs, particularly in long-context inference tasks. Existing studies reduce memory consumption by evicting some of cached data that have less important impact on inference accuracy. But the benefit in practice is far from ideal due to the static cache allocation across different LLM network layers. This paper observes that the layer-specific cached data have very different impacts on accuracy. We quantify this difference, and give experimental and theoretical validation. We accordingly make a formal analysis and shows that customizing the cache size for each layer in a personalized manner can yield a significant memory reduction, while still providing comparable accuracy. We simulate the cache allocation as a combinatorial optimization problem and give a global optimal solution. In particular, we devise a mini- and sampling-based inference over a lightweight variant of the LLM model, so as to quickly capture the difference and then feed it into the personalized algorithms. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposals can reduce KV cache memory consumption by 61.6% on average, improve computational efficiency by 2.1x and then increase the throughput by up to 5.5x.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05896v1,2024-12
"Evaluating Robustness of LLMs on Crisis-Related Microblogs across Events, Information Types, and Linguistic Features","Muhammad Imran, Abdul Wahab Ziaullah, Kai Chen, Ferda Ofli","The widespread use of microblogging platforms like X (formerly Twitter) during disasters provides real-time information to governments and response authorities. However, the data from these platforms is often noisy, requiring automated methods to filter relevant information. Traditionally, supervised machine learning models have been used, but they lack generalizability. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) show better capabilities in understanding and processing natural language out of the box. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the performance of six well-known LLMs in processing disaster-related social media data from a large-set of real-world events. Our findings indicate that while LLMs, particularly GPT-4o and GPT-4, offer better generalizability across different disasters and information types, most LLMs face challenges in processing flood-related data, show minimal improvement despite the provision of examples (i.e., shots), and struggle to identify critical information categories like urgent requests and needs. Additionally, we examine how various linguistic features affect model performance and highlight LLMs' vulnerabilities against certain features like typos. Lastly, we provide benchmarking results for all events across both zero- and few-shot settings and observe that proprietary models outperform open-source ones in all tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10413v1,2024-12
Automated Extraction and Creation of FBS Design Reasoning Knowledge Graphs from Structured Data in Product Catalogues Lacking Contextual Information,"Vijayalaxmi Sahadevan, Sushil Mario, Yash Jaiswal, Divyanshu Bajpai, Vishal Singh, Hiralal Aggarwal, Suhas Suresh, Manjunath Maigur","Ontology-based knowledge graphs (KG) are desirable for effective knowledge management and reuse in various decision making scenarios, including design. Creating and populating extensive KG based on specific ontological models can be highly labour and time-intensive unless automated processes are developed for knowledge extraction and graph creation. Most research and development on automated extraction and creation of KG is based on extensive unstructured data sets that provide contextual information. However, some of the most useful information about the products and services of a company has traditionally been recorded as structured data. Such structured data sets rarely follow a standard ontology, do not capture explicit mapping of relationships between the entities, and provide no contextual information. Therefore, this research reports a method and digital workflow developed to address this gap. The developed method and workflow employ rule-based techniques to extract and create a Function Behaviour-Structure (FBS) ontology-based KG from legacy structured data, especially specification sheets and product catalogues. The solution approach consists of two main components: a process for deriving context and context-based classification rules for FBS ontology concepts and a workflow for populating and retrieving the FBS ontology-based KG. KG and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are used to automate knowledge extraction, representation, and retrieval. The workflow's effectiveness is demonstrated via pilot implementation in an industrial context. Insights gained from the pilot study are reported regarding the challenges and opportunities, including discussing the FBS ontology and concepts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05868v1,2024-12
Domain-Specific Translation with Open-Source Large Language Models: Resource-Oriented Analysis,"Aman Kassahun Wassie, Mahdi Molaei, Yasmin Moslem","In this work, we compare the domain-specific translation performance of open-source autoregressive decoder-only large language models (LLMs) with task-oriented machine translation (MT) models. Our experiments focus on the medical domain and cover four language pairs with varied resource availability: English-to-French, English-to-Portuguese, English-to-Swahili, and Swahili-to-English. Despite recent advancements, LLMs exhibit a clear gap in specialized translation quality compared to multilingual encoder-decoder MT models such as NLLB-200. In three out of four language directions in our study, NLLB-200 3.3B outperforms all LLMs in the size range of 8B parameters in medical translation. While fine-tuning LLMs such as Mistral and Llama improves their performance at medical translation, these models still fall short compared to fine-tuned NLLB-200 3.3B models. Our findings highlight the ongoing need for specialized MT models to achieve higher-quality domain-specific translation, especially in medium-resource and low-resource settings. As larger LLMs outperform their 8B variants, this also encourages pre-training domain-specific medium-sized LMs to improve quality and efficiency in specialized translation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05862v1,2024-12
Depression detection from Social Media Bangla Text Using Recurrent Neural Networks,"Sultan Ahmed, Salman Rakin, Mohammad Washeef Ibn Waliur, Nuzhat Binte Islam, Billal Hossain, Md. Mostofa Akbar","Emotion artificial intelligence is a field of study that focuses on figuring out how to recognize emotions, especially in the area of text mining. Today is the age of social media which has opened a door for us to share our individual expressions, emotions, and perspectives on any event. We can analyze sentiment on social media posts to detect positive, negative, or emotional behavior toward society. One of the key challenges in sentiment analysis is to identify depressed text from social media text that is a root cause of mental ill-health. Furthermore, depression leads to severe impairment in day-to-day living and is a major source of suicide incidents. In this paper, we apply natural language processing techniques on Facebook texts for conducting emotion analysis focusing on depression using multiple machine learning algorithms. Preprocessing steps like stemming, stop word removal, etc. are used to clean the collected data, and feature extraction techniques like stylometric feature, TF-IDF, word embedding, etc. are applied to the collected dataset which consists of 983 texts collected from social media posts. In the process of class prediction, LSTM, GRU, support vector machine, and Naive-Bayes classifiers have been used. We have presented the results using the primary classification metrics including F1-score, and accuracy. This work focuses on depression detection from social media posts to help psychologists to analyze sentiment from shared posts which may reduce the undesirable behaviors of depressed individuals through diagnosis and treatment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05861v1,2024-12
Cooperative SQL Generation for Segmented Databases By Using Multi-functional LLM Agents,"Zhiguang Wu, Fengbin Zhu, Xuequn Shang, Yupei Zhang, Pan Zhou","Text-to-SQL task aims to automatically yield SQL queries according to user text questions. To address this problem, we propose a Cooperative SQL Generation framework based on Multi-functional Agents (CSMA) through information interaction among large language model (LLM) based agents who own part of the database schema seperately. Inspired by the collaboration in human teamwork, CSMA consists of three stages: 1) Question-related schema collection, 2) Question-corresponding SQL query generation, and 3) SQL query correctness check. In the first stage, agents analyze their respective schema and communicate with each other to collect the schema information relevant to the question. In the second stage, agents try to generate the corresponding SQL query for the question using the collected information. In the third stage, agents check if the SQL query is created correctly according to their known information. This interaction-based method makes the question-relevant part of database schema from each agent to be used for SQL generation and check. Experiments on the Spider and Bird benckmark demonstrate that CSMA achieves a high performance level comparable to the state-of-the-arts, meanwhile holding the private data in these individual agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05850v1,2024-12
Are Clinical T5 Models Better for Clinical Text?,"Yahan Li, Keith Harrigian, Ayah Zirikly, Mark Dredze","Large language models with a transformer-based encoder/decoder architecture, such as T5, have become standard platforms for supervised tasks. To bring these technologies to the clinical domain, recent work has trained new or adapted existing models to clinical data. However, the evaluation of these clinical T5 models and comparison to other models has been limited. Are the clinical T5 models better choices than FLAN-tuned generic T5 models? Do they generalize better to new clinical domains that differ from the training sets? We comprehensively evaluate these models across several clinical tasks and domains. We find that clinical T5 models provide marginal improvements over existing models, and perform worse when evaluated on different domains. Our results inform future choices in developing clinical LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05845v1,2024-12
A Self-Learning Multimodal Approach for Fake News Detection,"Hao Chen, Hui Guo, Baochen Hu, Shu Hu, Jinrong Hu, Siwei Lyu, Xi Wu, Xin Wang","The rapid growth of social media has resulted in an explosion of online news content, leading to a significant increase in the spread of misleading or false information. While machine learning techniques have been widely applied to detect fake news, the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a critical challenge. Misinformation frequently appears as paired text and images, where a news article or headline is accompanied by a related visuals. In this paper, we introduce a self-learning multimodal model for fake news classification. The model leverages contrastive learning, a robust method for feature extraction that operates without requiring labeled data, and integrates the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) to jointly analyze both text and image features. LLMs are excel at this task due to their ability to process diverse linguistic data drawn from extensive training corpora. Our experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art classification approaches, achieving over 85% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These findings highlight the model's effectiveness in tackling the challenges of multimodal fake news detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05843v1,2024-12

GL-Fusion: Rethinking the Combination of Graph Neural Network and Large Language model,"Haotong Yang, Xiyuan Wang, Qian Tao, Shuxian Hu, Zhouchen Lin, Muhan Zhang","Recent research on integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically follows two approaches: LLM-centered models, which convert graph data into tokens for LLM processing, and GNN-centered models, which use LLMs to encode text features into node and edge representations for GNN input. LLM-centered models often struggle to capture graph structures effectively, while GNN-centered models compress variable-length textual data into fixed-size vectors, limiting their ability to understand complex semantics. Additionally, GNN-centered approaches require converting tasks into a uniform, manually-designed format, restricting them to classification tasks and preventing language output. To address these limitations, we introduce a new architecture that deeply integrates GNN with LLM, featuring three key innovations: (1) Structure-Aware Transformers, which incorporate GNN's message-passing capabilities directly into LLM's transformer layers, allowing simultaneous processing of textual and structural information and generating outputs from both GNN and LLM; (2) Graph-Text Cross-Attention, which processes full, uncompressed text from graph nodes and edges, ensuring complete semantic integration; and (3) GNN-LLM Twin Predictor, enabling LLM's flexible autoregressive generation alongside GNN's scalable one-pass prediction. GL-Fusion achieves outstand performance on various tasks. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on OGBN-Arxiv and OGBG-Code2.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06849v1,2024-12
An Entailment Tree Generation Approach for Multimodal Multi-Hop Question Answering with Mixture-of-Experts and Iterative Feedback Mechanism,"Qing Zhang, Haocheng Lv, Jie Liu, Zhiyun Chen, Jianyong Duan, Hao Wang, Li He, Mingying Xv","With the rise of large-scale language models (LLMs), it is currently popular and effective to convert multimodal information into text descriptions for multimodal multi-hop question answering. However, we argue that the current methods of multi-modal multi-hop question answering still mainly face two challenges: 1) The retrieved evidence containing a large amount of redundant information, inevitably leads to a significant drop in performance due to irrelevant information misleading the prediction. 2) The reasoning process without interpretable reasoning steps makes the model difficult to discover the logical errors for handling complex questions. To solve these problems, we propose a unified LLMs-based approach but without heavily relying on them due to the LLM's potential errors, and innovatively treat multimodal multi-hop question answering as a joint entailment tree generation and question answering problem. Specifically, we design a multi-task learning framework with a focus on facilitating common knowledge sharing across interpretability and prediction tasks while preventing task-specific errors from interfering with each other via mixture of experts. Afterward, we design an iterative feedback mechanism to further enhance both tasks by feeding back the results of the joint training to the LLM for regenerating entailment trees, aiming to iteratively refine the potential answer. Notably, our method has won the first place in the official leaderboard of WebQA (since April 10, 2024), and achieves competitive results on MultimodalQA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05821v2,2024-12
SILMM: Self-Improving Large Multimodal Models for Compositional Text-to-Image Generation,"Leigang Qu, Haochuan Li, Wenjie Wang, Xiang Liu, Juncheng Li, Liqiang Nie, Tat-Seng Chua","Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation, pushing forward advancements in text-to-image generation. However, achieving accurate text-image alignment for LMMs, particularly in compositional scenarios, remains challenging. Existing approaches, such as layout planning for multi-step generation and learning from human feedback or AI feedback, depend heavily on prompt engineering, costly human annotations, and continual upgrading, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic iterative self-improvement framework (SILMM) that can enable LMMs to provide helpful and scalable self-feedback and optimize text-image alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO can readily applied to LMMs that use discrete visual tokens as intermediate image representations; while it is less suitable for LMMs with continuous visual features, as obtaining generation probabilities is challenging. To adapt SILMM to LMMs with continuous features, we propose a diversity mechanism to obtain diverse representations and a kernel-based continuous DPO for alignment. Extensive experiments on three compositional text-to-image generation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of SILMM, showing improvements exceeding 30% on T2I-CompBench++ and around 20% on DPG-Bench.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05818v1,2024-12
Learning to Correction: Explainable Feedback Generation for Visual Commonsense Reasoning Distractor,"Jiali Chen, Xusen Hei, Yuqi Xue, Yuancheng Wei, Jiayuan Xie, Yi Cai, Qing Li","Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable performance in the visual commonsense reasoning (VCR) task, which aims to answer a multiple-choice question based on visual commonsense within an image. However, the ability of LMMs to correct potential visual commonsense errors in the distractor upon their occurrence is yet under-explored. Drawing inspiration from how a human teacher crafts challenging distractors to test students' comprehension of the concepts or skills and assists them in identifying and correcting errors toward the answer, we are the pioneering research for LMMs to simulate this error correction process. To this end, we employ GPT-4 as a ``teacher'' to collect the explainable feedback dataset VCR-DF for error correction, which serves as a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LMMs to identify misconceptions and clarify reasons behind the error in VCR distractors toward final answers. In addition, we propose an LMM-based Pedagogical Expert Instructed Feedback Generation (PEIFG) model to incorporate the learnable expert prompts and multimodal instruction as guidance for feedback generation. Experimental results show that our PEIFG significantly outperforms existing LMMs. We believe that our benchmark provides a new direction for evaluating the capabilities of LMMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07801v1,2024-12

Fully Open Source Moxin-7B Technical Report,"Pu Zhao, Xuan Shen, Zhenglun Kong, Yixin Shen, Sung-En Chang, Timothy Rupprecht, Lei Lu, Enfu Nan, Changdi Yang, Yumei He, Xingchen Xu, Yu Huang, Wei Wang, Yue Chen, Yong He, Yanzhi Wang","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be ""open-source,"" which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that evaluates AI models based on model completeness and openness, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. Our model achieves the highest MOF classification level of ""open science"" through the comprehensive release of pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints.

Uncovering Uncertainty in Transformer Inference,"Greyson Brothers, Willa Mannering, Amber Tien, John Winder","We explore the Iterative Inference Hypothesis (IIH) within the context of transformer-based language models, aiming to understand how a model's latent representations are progressively refined and whether observable differences are present between correct and incorrect generations. Our findings provide empirical support for the IIH, showing that the nth token embedding in the residual stream follows a trajectory of decreasing loss. Additionally, we observe that the rate at which residual embeddings converge to a stable output representation reflects uncertainty in the token generation process. Finally, we introduce a method utilizing cross-entropy to detect this uncertainty and demonstrate its potential to distinguish between correct and incorrect token generations on a dataset of idioms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05768v1,2024-12

Training-Free Bayesianization for Low-Rank Adapters of Large Language Models,"Haizhou Shi, Yibin Wang, Ligong Han, Huan Zhang, Hao Wang","Estimating the uncertainty of responses of Large Language Models~(LLMs) remains a critical challenge. While recent Bayesian methods have demonstrated effectiveness in quantifying uncertainty through low-rank weight updates, they typically require complex fine-tuning or post-training procedures. In this paper, we propose Training-Free Bayesianization~(TFB), a novel framework that transforms existing off-the-shelf trained LoRA adapters into Bayesian ones without additional training. TFB systematically searches for the maximally acceptable level of variance in the weight posterior, constrained within a family of low-rank isotropic Gaussian distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that under mild conditions, this search process is equivalent to variational inference for the weights. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that TFB achieves superior uncertainty estimation and generalization compared to existing methods while eliminating the need for complex training procedures.

PromptRefine: Enhancing Few-Shot Performance on Low-Resource Indic Languages with Example Selection from Related Example Banks,"Soumya Suvra Ghosal, Soumyabrata Pal, Koyel Mukherjee, Dinesh Manocha","Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive few-shot learning capabilities through in-context learning (ICL). However, ICL performance is highly dependent on the choice of few-shot demonstrations, making the selection of the most optimal examples a persistent research challenge. This issue is further amplified in low-resource Indic languages, where the scarcity of ground-truth data complicates the selection process. In this work, we propose PromptRefine, a novel Alternating Minimization approach for example selection that improves ICL performance on low-resource Indic languages. PromptRefine leverages auxiliary example banks from related high-resource Indic languages and employs multi-task learning techniques to align language-specific retrievers, enabling effective cross-language retrieval. Additionally, we incorporate diversity in the selected examples to enhance generalization and reduce bias. Through comprehensive evaluations on four text generation tasks -- Cross-Lingual Question Answering, Multilingual Question Answering, Machine Translation, and Cross-Lingual Summarization using state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLAMA-3.1-8B, LLAMA-2-7B, Qwen-2-7B, and Qwen-2.5-7B, we demonstrate that PromptRefine significantly outperforms existing frameworks for retrieving examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05710v1,2024-12
On the effective transfer of knowledge from English to Hindi Wikipedia,"Paramita Das, Amartya Roy, Ritabrata Chakraborty, Animesh Mukherjee","Although Wikipedia is the largest multilingual encyclopedia, it remains inherently incomplete. There is a significant disparity in the quality of content between high-resource languages (HRLs, e.g., English) and low-resource languages (LRLs, e.g., Hindi), with many LRL articles lacking adequate information. To bridge these content gaps, we propose a lightweight framework to enhance knowledge equity between English and Hindi. In case the English Wikipedia page is not up-to-date, our framework extracts relevant information from external resources readily available (such as English books) and adapts it to align with Wikipedia's distinctive style, including its \textit{neutral point of view} (NPOV) policy, using in-context learning capabilities of large language models. The adapted content is then machine-translated into Hindi for integration into the corresponding Wikipedia articles. On the other hand, if the English version is comprehensive and up-to-date, the framework directly transfers knowledge from English to Hindi. Our framework effectively generates new content for Hindi Wikipedia sections, enhancing Hindi Wikipedia articles respectively by 65% and 62% according to automatic and human judgment-based evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05708v1,2024-12

The focus has been on compressing the KV cache after the input prompt has been processed for faster token generation. In settings with limited GPU memory, and when the input context is longer than the generation length, we show that by also compressing the KV cache during the input processing phase, larger batch sizes can be used resulting in significantly higher throughput while still maintaining the original model's accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05693v1,2024-12
Semantic Loss Guided Data Efficient Supervised Fine Tuning for Safe Responses in LLMs,"Yuxiao Lu, Arunesh Sinha, Pradeep Varakantham","Large Language Models (LLMs) generating unsafe responses to toxic prompts is a significant issue in their applications. While various efforts aim to address this safety concern, previous approaches often demand substantial human data collection or rely on the less dependable option of using another LLM to generate corrective data. In this paper, we aim to take this problem and overcome limitations of requiring significant high-quality human data. Our method requires only a small set of unsafe responses to toxic prompts, easily obtained from the unsafe LLM itself. By employing a semantic cost combined with a negative Earth Mover Distance (EMD) loss, we guide the LLM away from generating unsafe responses. Additionally, we propose a novel lower bound for EMD loss, enabling more efficient optimization. Our results demonstrate superior performance and data efficiency compared to baselines, and we further examine the nuanced effects of over-alignment and potential degradation of language capabilities when using contrastive data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06843v2,2024-12
Graph with Sequence: Broad-Range Semantic Modeling for Fake News Detection,"Junwei Yin, Min Gao, Kai Shu, Wentao Li, Yinqiu Huang, Zongwei Wang","The rapid proliferation of fake news on social media threatens social stability, creating an urgent demand for more effective detection methods. While many promising approaches have emerged, most rely on content analysis with limited semantic depth, leading to suboptimal comprehension of news content.To address this limitation, capturing broader-range semantics is essential yet challenging, as it introduces two primary types of noise: fully connecting sentences in news graphs often adds unnecessary structural noise, while highly similar but authenticity-irrelevant sentences introduce feature noise, complicating the detection process. To tackle these issues, we propose BREAK, a broad-range semantics model for fake news detection that leverages a fully connected graph to capture comprehensive semantics while employing dual denoising modules to minimize both structural and feature noise. The semantic structure denoising module balances the graph's connectivity by iteratively refining it between two bounds: a sequence-based structure as a lower bound and a fully connected graph as the upper bound. This refinement uncovers label-relevant semantic interrelations structures. Meanwhile, the semantic feature denoising module reduces noise from similar semantics by diversifying representations, aligning distinct outputs from the denoised graph and sequence encoders using KL-divergence to achieve feature diversification in high-dimensional space. The two modules are jointly optimized in a bi-level framework, enhancing the integration of denoised semantics into a comprehensive representation for detection. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that BREAK significantly outperforms existing methods in identifying fake news.

Shifting NER into High Gear: The Auto-AdvER Approach,"Filippos Ventirozos, Ioanna Nteka, Tania Nandy, Jozef Baca, Peter Appleby, Matthew Shardlow","This paper presents a case study on the development of Auto-AdvER, a specialised named entity recognition schema and dataset for text in the car advertisement genre. Developed with industry needs in mind, Auto-AdvER is designed to enhance text mining analytics in this domain and contributes a linguistically unique NER dataset. We present a schema consisting of three labels: ""Condition"", ""Historic"" and ""Sales Options"". We outline the guiding principles for annotation, describe the methodology for schema development, and show the results of an annotation study demonstrating inter-annotator agreement of 92% F1-Score. Furthermore, we compare the performance by using encoder-only models: BERT, DeBERTaV3 and decoder-only open and closed source Large Language Models (LLMs): Llama, Qwen, GPT-4 and Gemini. Our results show that the class of LLMs outperforms the smaller encoder-only models. However, the LLMs are costly and far from perfect for this task. We present this work as a stepping stone toward more fine-grained analysis and discuss Auto-AdvER's potential impact on advertisement analytics and customer insights, including applications such as the analysis of market dynamics and data-driven predictive maintenance. Our schema, as well as our associated findings, are suitable for both private and public entities considering named entity recognition in the automotive domain, or other specialist domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05655v1,2024-12
Mixture of Hidden-Dimensions Transformer,"Yilong Chen, Junyuan Shang, Zhengyu Zhang, Jiawei Sheng, Tingwen Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang","Transformer models encounter challenges in scaling hidden dimensions efficiently, as uniformly increasing them inflates computational and memory costs while failing to emphasize the most relevant features for each token. For further understanding, we study hidden dimension sparsity and observe that trained Transformers utilize only a small fraction of token dimensions, revealing an ""activation flow"" pattern. Notably, there are shared sub-dimensions with sustained activation across multiple consecutive tokens and specialized sub-dimensions uniquely activated for each token. To better model token-relevant sub-dimensions, we propose MoHD (Mixture of Hidden Dimensions), a sparse conditional activation architecture. Particularly, MoHD employs shared sub-dimensions for common token features and a routing mechanism to dynamically activate specialized sub-dimensions. To mitigate potential information loss from sparsity, we design activation scaling and group fusion mechanisms to preserve activation flow. In this way, MoHD expands hidden dimensions with negligible increases in computation or parameters, efficient training and inference while maintaining performance. Evaluations across 10 NLP tasks show that MoHD surpasses Vanilla Transformers in parameter efficiency and task performance. It achieves 1.7% higher performance with 50% fewer activation parameters and 3.7% higher performance with a 3x parameter expansion at constant activation cost. MOHD offers a new perspective for scaling the model, showcasing the potential of hidden dimension sparsity to boost efficiency",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05644v3,2024-12
CharacterBox: Evaluating the Role-Playing Capabilities of LLMs in Text-Based Virtual Worlds,"Lei Wang, Jianxun Lian, Yi Huang, Yanqi Dai, Haoxuan Li, Xu Chen, Xing Xie, Ji-Rong Wen","Role-playing is a crucial capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling a wide range of practical applications, including intelligent non-player characters, digital twins, and emotional companions. Evaluating this capability in LLMs is challenging due to the complex dynamics involved in role-playing, such as maintaining character fidelity throughout a storyline and navigating open-ended narratives without a definitive ground truth. Current evaluation methods, which primarily focus on question-answering or conversational snapshots, fall short of adequately capturing the nuanced character traits and behaviors essential for authentic role-playing. In this paper, we propose CharacterBox, which is a simulation sandbox designed to generate situational fine-grained character behavior trajectories. These behavior trajectories enable a more comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of role-playing capabilities. CharacterBox consists of two main components: the character agent and the narrator agent. The character agent, grounded in psychological and behavioral science, exhibits human-like behaviors, while the narrator agent coordinates interactions between character agents and environmental changes. Additionally, we introduce two trajectory-based methods that leverage CharacterBox to enhance LLM performance. To reduce costs and facilitate the adoption of CharacterBox by public communities, we fine-tune two smaller models, CharacterNR and CharacterRM, as substitutes for GPT API calls, and demonstrate their competitive performance compared to advanced GPT APIs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05631v1,2024-12

UNet++ and LSTM combined approach for Breast Ultrasound Image Segmentation,"Saba Hesaraki, Morteza Akbari, Ramin Mousa","Breast cancer stands as a prevalent cause of fatality among females on a global scale, with prompt detection playing a pivotal role in diminishing mortality rates. The utilization of ultrasound scans in the BUSI dataset for medical imagery pertaining to breast cancer has exhibited commendable segmentation outcomes through the application of UNet and UNet++ networks. Nevertheless, a notable drawback of these models resides in their inattention towards the temporal aspects embedded within the images. This research endeavors to enrich the UNet++ architecture by integrating LSTM layers and self-attention mechanisms to exploit temporal characteristics for segmentation purposes. Furthermore, the incorporation of a Multiscale Feature Extraction Module aims to grasp varied scale features within the UNet++.

A polar coordinate system represents syntax in large language models,"Pablo Diego-Simón, Stéphane D'Ascoli, Emmanuel Chemla, Yair Lakretz, Jean-Rémi King","Originally formalized with symbolic representations, syntactic trees may also be effectively represented in the activations of large language models (LLMs). Indeed, a 'Structural Probe' can find a subspace of neural activations, where syntactically related words are relatively close to one-another. However, this syntactic code remains incomplete: the distance between the Structural Probe word embeddings can represent the existence but not the type and direction of syntactic relations. Here, we hypothesize that syntactic relations are, in fact, coded by the relative direction between nearby embeddings. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a 'Polar Probe' trained to read syntactic relations from both the distance and the direction between word embeddings. Our approach reveals three main findings. First, our Polar Probe successfully recovers the type and direction of syntactic relations, and substantially outperforms the Structural Probe by nearly two folds. Second, we confirm that this polar coordinate system exists in a low-dimensional subspace of the intermediate layers of many LLMs and becomes increasingly precise in the latest frontier models. Third, we demonstrate with a new benchmark that similar syntactic relations are coded similarly across the nested levels of syntactic trees. Overall, this work shows that LLMs spontaneously learn a geometry of neural activations that explicitly represents the main symbolic structures of linguistic theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05571v1,2024-12
"A Survey on Uncertainty Quantification of Large Language Models: Taxonomy, Open Research Challenges, and Future Directions","Ola Shorinwa, Zhiting Mei, Justin Lidard, Allen Z. Ren, Anirudha Majumdar","The remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in content generation, coding, and common-sense reasoning has spurred widespread integration into many facets of society. However, integration of LLMs raises valid questions on their reliability and trustworthiness, given their propensity to generate hallucinations: plausible, factually-incorrect responses, which are expressed with striking confidence. Previous work has shown that hallucinations and other non-factual responses generated by LLMs can be detected by examining the uncertainty of the LLM in its response to the pertinent prompt, driving significant research efforts devoted to quantifying the uncertainty of LLMs. This survey seeks to provide an extensive review of existing uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, identifying their salient features, along with their strengths and weaknesses. We present existing methods within a relevant taxonomy, unifying ostensibly disparate methods to aid understanding of the state of the art.

On the Expressive Power of Modern Hopfield Networks,"Xiaoyu Li, Yuanpeng Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song","Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs) have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, capable of replacing components such as pooling layers, LSTMs, and attention mechanisms. Recent advancements have enhanced their storage capacity, retrieval speed, and error rates. However, the fundamental limits of their computational expressiveness remain unexplored. Understanding the expressive power of MHNs is crucial for optimizing their integration into deep learning architectures. In this work, we establish rigorous theoretical bounds on the computational capabilities of MHNs using circuit complexity theory. Our key contribution is that we show that MHNs are $\mathsf{DLOGTIME}$-uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$. Hence, unless $\mathsf{TC}^0 = \mathsf{NC}^1$, a $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-precision modern Hopfield networks with a constant number of layers and $O(n)$ hidden dimension cannot solve $\mathsf{NC}^1$-hard problems such as the undirected graph connectivity problem and the tree isomorphism problem. We also extended our results to Kernelized Hopfield Networks. These results demonstrate the limitation in the expressive power of the modern Hopfield networks.

SAME: Learning Generic Language-Guided Visual Navigation with State-Adaptive Mixture of Experts,"Gengze Zhou, Yicong Hong, Zun Wang, Chongyang Zhao, Mohit Bansal, Qi Wu","The academic field of learning instruction-guided visual navigation can be generally categorized into high-level category-specific search and low-level language-guided navigation, depending on the granularity of language instruction, in which the former emphasizes the exploration process, while the latter concentrates on following detailed textual commands.

This paper consolidates diverse navigation tasks into a unified and generic framework -- we investigate the core difficulties of sharing general knowledge and exploiting task-specific capabilities in learning navigation and propose a novel State-Adaptive Mixture of Experts (SAME) model that effectively enables an agent to infer decisions based on different-granularity language and dynamic observations.

The Illusion-Illusion: Vision Language Models See Illusions Where There are None,Tomer Ullman,"Illusions are entertaining, but they are also a useful diagnostic tool in cognitive science, philosophy, and neuroscience. A typical illusion shows a gap between how something ""really is"" and how something ""appears to be"", and this gap helps us understand the mental processing that lead to how something appears to be. Illusions are also useful for investigating artificial systems, and much research has examined whether computational models of perceptions fall prey to the same illusions as people. Here, I invert the standard use of perceptual illusions to examine basic processing errors in current vision language models. I present these models with illusory-illusions, neighbors of common illusions that should not elicit processing errors. These include such things as perfectly reasonable ducks, crooked lines that truly are crooked, circles that seem to have different sizes because they are, in fact, of different sizes, and so on. I show that many current vision language systems mistakenly see these illusion-illusions as illusions. I suggest that such failures are part of broader failures already discussed in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18613v1,2024-12

SLA Management in Reconfigurable Multi-Agent RAG: A Systems Approach to Question Answering,"Michael Iannelli, Sneha Kuchipudi, Vera Dvorak","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generalize to new information by decoupling reasoning capabilities from static knowledge bases. Traditional RAG enhancements have explored vertical scaling -- assigning subtasks to specialized modules -- and horizontal scaling -- replicating tasks across multiple agents -- to improve performance. However, real-world applications impose diverse Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, involving trade-offs among objectives such as reducing cost, ensuring answer quality, and adhering to specific operational constraints.   In this work, we present a systems-oriented approach to multi-agent RAG tailored for real-world Question Answering (QA) applications. By integrating task-specific non-functional requirements -- such as answer quality, cost, and latency -- into the system, we enable dynamic reconfiguration to meet diverse SLAs. Our method maps these Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to system-level parameters, allowing the generation of optimal results within specified resource constraints.   We conduct a case study in the QA domain, demonstrating how dynamic re-orchestration of a multi-agent RAG system can effectively manage the trade-off between answer quality and cost. By adjusting the system based on query intent and operational conditions, we systematically balance performance and resource utilization. This approach allows the system to meet SLOs for various query types, showcasing its practicality for real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06832v1,2024-12
TransitGPT: A Generative AI-based framework for interacting with GTFS data using Large Language Models,"Saipraneeth Devunuri, Lewis Lehe","This paper introduces a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer natural language queries about General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. The framework is implemented in a chatbot called TransitGPT with open-source code. TransitGPT works by guiding LLMs to generate Python code that extracts and manipulates GTFS data relevant to a query, which is then executed on a server where the GTFS feed is stored. It can accomplish a wide range of tasks, including data retrieval, calculations, and interactive visualizations, without requiring users to have extensive knowledge of GTFS or programming. The LLMs that produce the code are guided entirely by prompts, without fine-tuning or access to the actual GTFS feeds. We evaluate TransitGPT using GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet LLMs on a benchmark dataset of 100 tasks, to demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility. The results show that TransitGPT can significantly enhance the accessibility and usability of transit data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06831v1,2024-12
LABIIUM: AI-Enhanced Zero-configuration Measurement Automation System,"Emmanuel A. Olowe, Danial Chitnis","The complexity of laboratory environments requires solutions that simplify instrument interaction and enhance measurement automation. Traditional tools often require configuration, software, and programming skills, creating barriers to productivity. Previous approaches, including dedicated software suites and custom scripts, frequently fall short in providing user-friendly solutions that align with programming practices. We present LABIIUM, an AI-enhanced, zero-configuration measurement automation system designed to streamline experimental workflows and improve user productivity. LABIIUM integrates an AI assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. LABIIUM's Lab-Automation-Measurement Bridges (LAMBs) enable seamless instrument connectivity using standard tools such as VSCode and Python, eliminating setup overhead. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted experiments involving the measurement of the parametric transfer curve of a simple two-transistor inverting amplifier with a current source load. The AI assistant was evaluated using different prompt scenarios and compared with multiple models, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, Gemini Pro 1.5, and GPT-4o. An expert solution implementing the Gradient-Weighted Adaptive Stochastic Sampling (GWASS) method was used as a baseline. The solutions generated by the AI assistant were compared with the expert solution and a uniform linear sweep baseline with 10,000 points. The graph results show that the LLMs were able to successfully complete the most basic uniform sweep, but LLMs were unable to develop adaptive sweeping algorithms to compete with GWASS. The evaluation underscores LABIIUM's ability to enhance laboratory productivity and support digital transformation in research and industry, and emphasizes the future work required to improve LLM performance in Electronic Measurement Science Tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16172v1,2024-12
Knowledge Graphs are all you need: Leveraging KGs in Physics Question Answering,"Krishnasai Addala, Kabir Dev Paul Baghel, Dhruv Jain, Chhavi Kirtani, Avinash Anand, Rajiv Ratn Shah","This study explores the effectiveness of using knowledge graphs generated by large language models to decompose high school-level physics questions into sub-questions. We introduce a pipeline aimed at enhancing model response quality for Question Answering tasks. By employing LLMs to construct knowledge graphs that capture the internal logic of the questions, these graphs then guide the generation of subquestions. We hypothesize that this method yields sub-questions that are more logically consistent with the original questions compared to traditional decomposition techniques. Our results show that sub-questions derived from knowledge graphs exhibit significantly improved fidelity to the original question's logic. This approach not only enhances the learning experience by providing clearer and more contextually appropriate sub-questions but also highlights the potential of LLMs to transform educational methodologies. The findings indicate a promising direction for applying AI to improve the quality and effectiveness of educational content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05453v2,2024-12
Towards Effective GenAI Multi-Agent Collaboration: Design and Evaluation for Enterprise Applications,"Raphael Shu, Nilaksh Das, Michelle Yuan, Monica Sunkara, Yi Zhang","AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in problem solving. Through combining many intelligent agents, multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a promising approach to tackle complex, multi-faceted problems that exceed the capabilities of single AI agents. However, designing the collaboration protocols and evaluating the effectiveness of these systems remains a significant challenge, especially for enterprise applications. This report addresses these challenges by presenting a comprehensive evaluation of coordination and routing capabilities in a novel multi-agent collaboration framework. We evaluate two key operational modes: (1) a coordination mode enabling complex task completion through parallel communication and payload referencing, and (2) a routing mode for efficient message forwarding between agents. We benchmark on a set of handcrafted scenarios from three enterprise domains, which are publicly released with the report. For coordination capabilities, we demonstrate the effectiveness of inter-agent communication and payload referencing mechanisms, achieving end-to-end goal success rates of 90%. Our analysis yields several key findings: multi-agent collaboration enhances goal success rates by up to 70% compared to single-agent approaches in our benchmarks; payload referencing improves performance on code-intensive tasks by 23%; latency can be substantially reduced with a routing mechanism that selectively bypasses agent orchestration. These findings offer valuable guidance for enterprise deployments of multi-agent systems and advance the development of scalable, efficient multi-agent collaboration frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05449v1,2024-12
Diversity Over Quantity: A Lesson From Few Shot Relation Classification,"Amir DN Cohen, Shauli Ravfogel, Shaltiel Shmidman, Yoav Goldberg","In few-shot relation classification (FSRC), models must generalize to novel relations with only a few labeled examples. While much of the recent progress in NLP has focused on scaling data size, we argue that diversity in relation types is more crucial for FSRC performance. In this work, we demonstrate that training on a diverse set of relations significantly enhances a model's ability to generalize to unseen relations, even when the overall dataset size remains fixed.   We introduce REBEL-FS, a new FSRC benchmark that incorporates an order of magnitude more relation types than existing datasets. Through systematic experiments, we show that increasing the diversity of relation types in the training data leads to consistent gains in performance across various few-shot learning scenarios, including high-negative settings. Our findings challenge the common assumption that more data alone leads to better performance and suggest that targeted data curation focused on diversity can substantially reduce the need for large-scale datasets in FSRC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05434v1,2024-12
Enhancing LLMs for Impression Generation in Radiology Reports through a Multi-Agent System,"Fang Zeng, Zhiliang Lyu, Quanzheng Li, Xiang Li","This study introduces ""RadCouncil,"" a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to enhance the generation of impressions in radiology reports from the finding section. RadCouncil comprises three specialized agents: 1) a ""Retrieval"" Agent that identifies and retrieves similar reports from a vector database, 2) a ""Radiologist"" Agent that generates impressions based on the finding section of the given report plus the exemplar reports retrieved by the Retrieval Agent, and 3) a ""Reviewer"" Agent that evaluates the generated impressions and provides feedback. The performance of RadCouncil was evaluated using both quantitative metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore) and qualitative criteria assessed by GPT-4, using chest X-ray as a case study. Experiment results show improvements in RadCouncil over the single-agent approach across multiple dimensions, including diagnostic accuracy, stylistic concordance, and clarity. This study highlights the potential of utilizing multiple interacting LLM agents, each with a dedicated task, to enhance performance in specialized medical tasks and the development of more robust and adaptable healthcare AI solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06828v1,2024-12
CALICO: Conversational Agent Localization via Synthetic Data Generation,"Andy Rosenbaum, Pegah Kharazmi, Ershad Banijamali, Lu Zeng, Christopher DiPersio, Pan Wei, Gokmen Oz, Clement Chung, Karolina Owczarzak, Fabian Triefenbach, Wael Hamza","We present CALICO, a method to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) to localize conversational agent training data from one language to another. For slots (named entities), CALICO supports three operations: verbatim copy, literal translation, and localization, i.e. generating slot values more appropriate in the target language, such as city and airport names located in countries where the language is spoken. Furthermore, we design an iterative filtering mechanism to discard noisy generated samples, which we show boosts the performance of the downstream conversational agent. To prove the effectiveness of CALICO, we build and release a new human-localized (HL) version of the MultiATIS++ travel information test set in 8 languages. Compared to the original human-translated (HT) version of the test set, we show that our new HL version is more challenging. We also show that CALICO out-performs state-of-the-art LINGUIST (which relies on literal slot translation out of context) both on the HT case, where CALICO generates more accurate slot translations, and on the HL case, where CALICO generates localized slots which are closer to the HL test set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05388v1,2024-12
Incremental Sentence Processing Mechanisms in Autoregressive Transformer Language Models,"Michael Hanna, Aaron Mueller","Autoregressive transformer language models (LMs) possess strong syntactic abilities, often successfully handling phenomena from agreement to NPI licensing. However, the features they use to incrementally process language inputs are not well understood. In this paper, we fill this gap by studying the mechanisms underlying garden path sentence processing in LMs. We ask: (1) Do LMs use syntactic features or shallow heuristics to perform incremental sentence processing? (2) Do LMs represent only one potential interpretation, or multiple? and (3) Do LMs reanalyze or repair their initial incorrect representations? To address these questions, we use sparse autoencoders to identify interpretable features that determine which continuation - and thus which reading - of a garden path sentence the LM prefers. We find that while many important features relate to syntactic structure, some reflect syntactically irrelevant heuristics. Moreover, while most active features correspond to one reading of the sentence, some features correspond to the other, suggesting that LMs assign weight to both possibilities simultaneously. Finally, LMs do not re-use features from garden path sentence processing to answer follow-up questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05353v1,2024-12
TeamCraft: A Benchmark for Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Systems in Minecraft,"Qian Long, Zhi Li, Ran Gong, Ying Nian Wu, Demetri Terzopoulos, Xiaofeng Gao","Collaboration is a cornerstone of society. In the real world, human teammates make use of multi-sensory data to tackle challenging tasks in ever-changing environments. It is essential for embodied agents collaborating in visually-rich environments replete with dynamic interactions to understand multi-modal observations and task specifications. To evaluate the performance of generalizable multi-modal collaborative agents, we present TeamCraft, a multi-modal multi-agent benchmark built on top of the open-world video game Minecraft. The benchmark features 55,000 task variants specified by multi-modal prompts, procedurally-generated expert demonstrations for imitation learning, and carefully designed protocols to evaluate model generalization capabilities. We also perform extensive analyses to better understand the limitations and strengths of existing approaches. Our results indicate that existing models continue to face significant challenges in generalizing to novel goals, scenes, and unseen numbers of agents. These findings underscore the need for further research in this area.

Uncertainty Quantification for Transformer Models for Dark-Pattern Detection,"Javier Muñoz, Álvaro Huertas-García, Carlos Martí-González, Enrique De Miguel Ambite","The opaque nature of transformer-based models, particularly in applications susceptible to unethical practices such as dark-patterns in user interfaces, requires models that integrate uncertainty quantification to enhance trust in predictions. This study focuses on dark-pattern detection, deceptive design choices that manipulate user decisions, undermining autonomy and consent. We propose a differential fine-tuning approach implemented at the final classification head via uncertainty quantification with transformer-based pre-trained models. Employing a dense neural network (DNN) head architecture as a baseline, we examine two methods capable of quantifying uncertainty: Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Processes (SNGPs) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). These methods are evaluated on a set of open-source foundational models across multiple dimensions: model performance, variance in certainty of predictions and environmental impact during training and inference phases. Results demonstrate that integrating uncertainty quantification maintains performance while providing insights into challenging instances within the models. Moreover, the study reveals that the environmental impact does not uniformly increase with the incorporation of uncertainty quantification techniques. The study's findings demonstrate that uncertainty quantification enhances transparency and provides measurable confidence in predictions, improving the explainability and clarity of black-box models. This facilitates informed decision-making and mitigates the influence of dark-patterns on user interfaces. These results highlight the importance of incorporating uncertainty quantification techniques in developing machine learning models, particularly in domains where interpretability and trustworthiness are critical.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05251v1,2024-12

This workflow aims to complement FKG.in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally. It also reviews three key sources of food composition data: the Indian Food Composition Tables, the Indian Nutrient Databank, and the Nutritionix API. Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues. The methods proposed in this workshop paper for AI-driven knowledge curation and information resolution are application-agnostic, generalizable, and replicable for any domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05248v2,2024-12
MAmmoTH-VL: Eliciting Multimodal Reasoning with Instruction Tuning at Scale,"Jarvis Guo, Tuney Zheng, Yuelin Bai, Bo Li, Yubo Wang, King Zhu, Yizhi Li, Graham Neubig, Wenhu Chen, Xiang Yue","Open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown significant potential in a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities remain constrained by existing instruction-tuning datasets, which were predominately repurposed from academic datasets such as VQA, AI2D, and ChartQA. These datasets target simplistic tasks, and only provide phrase-level answers without any intermediate rationales. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable and cost-effective method to construct a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset with rich intermediate rationales designed to elicit CoT reasoning. Using only open models, we create a dataset containing 12M instruction-response pairs to cover diverse, reasoning-intensive tasks with detailed and faithful rationales. Experiments demonstrate that training MLLMs on this dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as MathVerse (+8.1%), MMMU-Pro (+7%), and MuirBench (+13.3%). Additionally, the model demonstrates notable improvements of up to 4% on non-reasoning-based benchmarks. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of key components, such as rewriting and self-filtering, in the dataset construction process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05237v1,2024-12
LIAR: Leveraging Alignment (Best-of-N) to Jailbreak LLMs in Seconds,"James Beetham, Souradip Chakraborty, Mengdi Wang, Furong Huang, Amrit Singh Bedi, Mubarak Shah","Many existing jailbreak techniques rely on solving discrete combinatorial optimization, while more recent approaches involve training LLMs to generate multiple adversarial prompts. However, both approaches require significant computational resources to produce even a single adversarial prompt. We hypothesize that the inefficiency of current approaches stems from an inadequate characterization of the jailbreak problem. To address this gap, we formulate the jailbreak problem in terms of alignment. By starting from an available safety-aligned model, we leverage an unsafe reward to guide the safe model towards generating unsafe outputs using alignment techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning from human feedback), effectively performing jailbreaking via alignment. We propose a novel jailbreak method called LIAR (LeveragIng Alignment to jailbReak). To demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of our approach, we employ a best-of-N method to solve the alignment problem. LIAR offers significant advantages: lower computational requirements without additional training, fully black-box operation, competitive attack success rates, and more human-readable prompts. We provide theoretical insights into the possibility of jailbreaking a safety-aligned model, revealing inherent vulnerabilities in current alignment strategies for LLMs. We also provide sub-optimality guarantees for the proposed \algo. Experimentally, we achieve ASR comparable to the SoTA with a 10x improvement to perplexity and a Time-to-Attack measured in seconds rather than tens of hours.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05232v1,2024-12
BEExformer: A Fast Inferencing Transformer Architecture via Binarization with Multiple Early Exits,"Wazib Ansar, Saptarsi Goswami, Amlan Chakrabarti","Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformers achieve cutting-edge results on a variety of applications. However, their enormous size and processing requirements make deployment on devices with constrained resources extremely difficult. Among various efficiency considerations, model binarization and Early Exit (EE) are common effective solutions. However, binarization may lead to performance loss due to reduced precision affecting gradient estimation and parameter updates. Besides, the present early-exit mechanisms are still in the nascent stages of research. To ameliorate these issues, we propose Binarized Early Exit Transformer (BEExformer), the first-ever selective learning transformer architecture to combine early exit with binarization for textual inference. It improves the binarization process through a differentiable second-order approximation to the impulse function. This enables gradient computation concerning both the sign as well as the magnitude of the weights. In contrast to absolute threshold-based EE, the proposed EE mechanism hinges on fractional reduction in entropy among intermediate transformer blocks with soft-routing loss estimation. While binarization results in 18.44 times reduction in model size, early exit reduces the FLOPs during inference by 54.85% and even improves accuracy by 5.98% through resolving the ""overthinking"" problem inherent in deep networks. Moreover, the proposed BEExformer simplifies training by not requiring knowledge distillation from a full-precision LLM. Extensive evaluation on the GLUE dataset and comparison with the SOTA works showcase its pareto-optimal performance-efficiency trade-off.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05225v1,2024-12
100% Hallucination Elimination Using Acurai,"Michael C. Wood, Adam A. Forbes","The issue of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a critical barrier to the adoption of AI in enterprise and other high-stakes applications. Despite advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, current state-of-the-art methods fail to achieve more than 80% accuracy in generating faithful and factually correct outputs, even when provided with relevant and accurate context. In this work, we introduce Acurai, a novel systematic approach that achieves 100% hallucination-free responses in LLMs by reformatting queries and context data prior to input. Leveraging a deep understanding of LLM internal representations, the importance of noun-phrase dominance, and the role of discrete functional units (DFUs), Acurai ensures alignment between input context and generated output. We validate this method using the RAGTruth corpus, demonstrating its ability to eliminate 100% hallucinations for both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo. Acurai sets a new standard for achieving consistent, accurate, and faithful AI responses, marking a significant step forward in the development of trustworthy AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05223v1,2024-12
Evaluating and Aligning CodeLLMs on Human Preference,"Jian Yang, Jiaxi Yang, Ke Jin, Yibo Miao, Lei Zhang, Liqun Yang, Zeyu Cui, Yichang Zhang, Binyuan Hui, Junyang Lin","Code large language models (codeLLMs) have made significant strides in code generation. Most previous code-related benchmarks, which consist of various programming exercises along with the corresponding test cases, are used as a common measure to evaluate the performance and capabilities of code LLMs. However, the current code LLMs focus on synthesizing the correct code snippet, ignoring the alignment with human preferences, where the query should be sampled from the practical application scenarios and the model-generated responses should satisfy the human preference. To bridge the gap between the model-generated response and human preference, we present a rigorous human-curated benchmark CodeArena to emulate the complexity and diversity of real-world coding tasks, where 397 high-quality samples spanning 40 categories and 44 programming languages, carefully curated from user queries. Further, we propose a diverse synthetic instruction corpus SynCode-Instruct (nearly 20B tokens) by scaling instructions from the website to verify the effectiveness of the large-scale synthetic instruction fine-tuning, where Qwen2.5-SynCoder totally trained on synthetic instruction data can achieve top-tier performance of open-source code LLMs. The results find performance differences between execution-based benchmarks and CodeArena. Our systematic experiments of CodeArena on 40+ LLMs reveal a notable performance gap between open SOTA code LLMs (e.g. Qwen2.5-Coder) and proprietary LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1), underscoring the importance of the human preference alignment.\footnote{\url{https://codearenaeval.github.io/ }}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05210v1,2024-12
ConQRet: Benchmarking Fine-Grained Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Argumentation with LLM Judges,"Kaustubh D. Dhole, Kai Shu, Eugene Agichtein","Computational argumentation, which involves generating answers or summaries for controversial topics like abortion bans and vaccination, has become increasingly important in today's polarized environment. Sophisticated LLM capabilities offer the potential to provide nuanced, evidence-based answers to such questions through Retrieval-Augmented Argumentation (RAArg), leveraging real-world evidence for high-quality, grounded arguments. However, evaluating RAArg remains challenging, as human evaluation is costly and difficult for complex, lengthy answers on complicated topics. At the same time, re-using existing argumentation datasets is no longer sufficient, as they lack long, complex arguments and realistic evidence from potentially misleading sources, limiting holistic evaluation of retrieval effectiveness and argument quality. To address these gaps, we investigate automated evaluation methods using multiple fine-grained LLM judges, providing better and more interpretable assessments than traditional single-score metrics and even previously reported human crowdsourcing. To validate the proposed techniques, we introduce ConQRet, a new benchmark featuring long and complex human-authored arguments on debated topics, grounded in real-world websites, allowing an exhaustive evaluation across retrieval effectiveness, argument quality, and groundedness. We validate our LLM Judges on a prior dataset and the new ConQRet benchmark.

Benchmarking Open-ended Audio Dialogue Understanding for Large Audio-Language Models,"Kuofeng Gao, Shu-Tao Xia, Ke Xu, Philip Torr, Jindong Gu","Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have unclocked audio dialogue capabilities, where audio dialogues are a direct exchange of spoken language between LALMs and humans. Recent advances, such as GPT-4o, have enabled LALMs in back-and-forth audio dialogues with humans. This progression not only underscores the potential of LALMs but also broadens their applicability across a wide range of practical scenarios supported by audio dialogues. However, given these advancements, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of LALMs in the open-ended audio dialogue understanding remains absent currently. To address this gap, we propose an Audio Dialogue Understanding Benchmark (ADU-Bench), which consists of 4 benchmark datasets. They assess the open-ended audio dialogue ability for LALMs in 3 general scenarios, 12 skills, 9 multilingual languages, and 4 categories of ambiguity handling. Notably, we firstly propose the evaluation of ambiguity handling in audio dialogues that expresses different intentions beyond the same literal meaning of sentences, e.g., ""Really!?"" with different intonations. In summary, ADU-Bench includes over 20,000 open-ended audio dialogues for the assessment of LALMs. Through extensive experiments conducted on 13 LALMs, our analysis reveals that there is still considerable room for improvement in the audio dialogue understanding abilities of existing LALMs. In particular, they struggle with mathematical symbols and formulas, understanding human behavior such as roleplay, comprehending multiple languages, and handling audio dialogue ambiguities from different phonetic elements, such as intonations, pause positions, and homophones.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05167v1,2024-12

To be more specific, we investigate whether incorporating multimodal content improves performance compared to text-only models and how well VLMs utilize text and image information to enhance misinformation detection. Furthermore we propose a probing classifier based solution using VLMs. Our approach extracts embeddings from the last hidden layer of selected VLMs and inputs them into a neural probing classifier for multi-class veracity classification. Through a series of experiments on two fact-checking datasets, we demonstrate that while multimodality can enhance performance, fusing separate embeddings from text and image encoders yielded superior results compared to using VLM embeddings. Furthermore, the proposed neural classifier significantly outperformed KNN and SVM baselines in leveraging extracted embeddings, highlighting its effectiveness for multimodal fact-checking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05155v1,2024-12

Participants compete to optimize language model training on a fixed language data budget of 100 million words or less. This year, we released improved text corpora, as well as a vision-and-language corpus to facilitate research into cognitively plausible vision language models. Submissions were compared on evaluation tasks targeting grammatical ability, (visual) question answering, pragmatic abilities, and grounding, among other abilities. Participants could submit to a 10M-word text-only track, a 100M-word text-only track, and/or a 100M-word and image multimodal track. From 31 submissions employing diverse methods, a hybrid causal-masked language model architecture outperformed other approaches. No submissions outperformed the baselines in the multimodal track. In follow-up analyses, we found a strong relationship between training FLOPs and average performance across tasks, and that the best-performing submissions proposed changes to the training data, training objective, and model architecture. This year's BabyLM Challenge shows that there is still significant room for innovation in this setting, in particular for image-text modeling, but community-driven research can yield actionable insights about effective strategies for small-scale language modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05149v1,2024-12
Explingo: Explaining AI Predictions using Large Language Models,"Alexandra Zytek, Sara Pido, Sarah Alnegheimish, Laure Berti-Equille, Kalyan Veeramachaneni","Explanations of machine learning (ML) model predictions generated by Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP are essential for people using ML outputs for decision-making. We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform these explanations into human-readable, narrative formats that align with natural communication. We address two key research questions: (1) Can LLMs reliably transform traditional explanations into high-quality narratives? and (2) How can we effectively evaluate the quality of narrative explanations? To answer these questions, we introduce Explingo, which consists of two LLM-based subsystems, a Narrator and Grader. The Narrator takes in ML explanations and transforms them into natural-language descriptions. The Grader scores these narratives on a set of metrics including accuracy, completeness, fluency, and conciseness.   Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate high-quality narratives that achieve high scores across all metrics, particularly when guided by a small number of human-labeled and bootstrapped examples. We also identified areas that remain challenging, in particular for effectively scoring narratives in complex domains. The findings from this work have been integrated into an open-source tool that makes narrative explanations available for further applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05145v1,2024-12
A Practical Examination of AI-Generated Text Detectors for Large Language Models,"Brian Tufts, Xuandong Zhao, Lei Li","The proliferation of large language models has raised growing concerns about their misuse, particularly in cases where AI-generated text is falsely attributed to human authors. Machine-generated content detectors claim to effectively identify such text under various conditions and from any language model. This paper critically evaluates these claims by assessing several popular detectors (RADAR, Wild, T5Sentinel, Fast-DetectGPT, GPTID, LogRank, Binoculars) on a range of domains, datasets, and models that these detectors have not previously encountered. We employ various prompting strategies to simulate adversarial attacks, demonstrating that even moderate efforts can significantly evade detection. We emphasize the importance of the true positive rate at a specific false positive rate (TPR@FPR) metric and demonstrate that these detectors perform poorly in certain settings, with TPR@.01 as low as 0%. Our findings suggest that both trained and zero-shot detectors struggle to maintain high sensitivity while achieving a reasonable true positive rate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05139v2,2024-12
Unifying Dual-Space Embedding for Entity Alignment via Contrastive Learning,"Cunda Wang, Weihua Wang, Qiuyu Liang, Feilong Bao, Guanglai Gao","Entity alignment aims to match identical entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs). Graph neural network-based entity alignment methods have achieved promising results in Euclidean space. However, KGs often contain complex structures, including both local and hierarchical ones, which make it challenging to efficiently represent them within a single space. In this paper, we proposed a novel method UniEA, which unifies dual-space embedding to preserve the intrinsic structure of KGs. Specifically, we learn graph structure embedding in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces simultaneously to maximize the consistency between the embedding in both spaces. Moreover, we employ contrastive learning to mitigate the misalignment issues caused by similar entities, where embedding of similar neighboring entities within the KG become too close in distance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in structure-based EA.

By utilizing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Model, along with analogical prompting, we are able to show improved model performance when compared to the baseline on standard LLMs. We also survey the limits of these prompting techniques and the effects they have on model performance. Additionally, we propose Analogical CoT prompting, a prompting technique designed to allow smaller, open source models to leverage Analogical prompting, something they have struggled with, possibly due to a lack of specialist training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05023v2,2024-12
PETapter: Leveraging PET-style classification heads for modular few-shot parameter-efficient fine-tuning,"Jonas Rieger, Mattes Ruckdeschel, Gregor Wiedemann","Few-shot learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) are crucial to overcome the challenges of data scarcity and ever growing language model sizes. This applies in particular to specialized scientific domains, where researchers might lack expertise and resources to fine-tune high-performing language models to nuanced tasks. We propose PETapter, a novel method that effectively combines PEFT methods with PET-style classification heads to boost few-shot learning capabilities without the significant computational overhead typically associated with full model training. We validate our approach on three established NLP benchmark datasets and one real-world dataset from communication research. We show that PETapter not only achieves comparable performance to full few-shot fine-tuning using pattern-exploiting training (PET), but also provides greater reliability and higher parameter efficiency while enabling higher modularity and easy sharing of the trained modules, which enables more researchers to utilize high-performing NLP-methods in their research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04975v1,2024-12
Gla-AI4BioMed at RRG24: Visual Instruction-tuned Adaptation for Radiology Report Generation,"Xi Zhang, Zaiqiao Meng, Jake Lever, Edmond S. L. Ho","We introduce a radiology-focused visual language model designed to generate radiology reports from chest X-rays. Building on previous findings that large language models (LLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities when aligned with pretrained vision encoders, we demonstrate similar potential with chest X-ray images. This integration enhances the ability of model to understand and describe chest X-ray images. Our model combines an image encoder with a fine-tuned LLM based on the Vicuna-7B architecture, enabling it to generate different sections of a radiology report with notable accuracy. The training process involves a two-stage approach: (i) initial alignment of chest X-ray features with the LLM (ii) followed by fine-tuning for radiology report generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04954v1,2024-12
KaLM: Knowledge-aligned Autoregressive Language Modeling via Dual-view Knowledge Graph Contrastive Learning,"Peng Yu, Cheng Deng, Beiya Dai, Xinbing Wang, Ying Wen","Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) pre-trained by next token prediction are inherently proficient in generative tasks. However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \textbf{KaLM}, a \textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling. Notably, our method achieves a significant performance boost in evaluations of knowledge-driven tasks, specifically embedding-based knowledge graph completion and generation-based knowledge graph question answering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04948v1,2024-12

A Federated Approach to Few-Shot Hate Speech Detection for Marginalized Communities,"Haotian Ye, Axel Wisiorek, Antonis Maronikolakis, Özge Alaçam, Hinrich Schütze","Hate speech online remains an understudied issue for marginalized communities, and has seen rising relevance, especially in the Global South, which includes developing societies with increasing internet penetration. In this paper, we aim to provide marginalized communities living in societies where the dominant language is low-resource with a privacy-preserving tool to protect themselves from hate speech on the internet by filtering offensive content in their native languages. Our contribution in this paper is twofold: 1) we release REACT (REsponsive hate speech datasets Across ConTexts), a collection of high-quality, culture-specific hate speech detection datasets comprising seven distinct target groups in eight low-resource languages, curated by experienced data collectors; 2) we propose a solution to few-shot hate speech detection utilizing federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving and collaborative learning approach, to continuously improve a central model that exhibits robustness when tackling different target groups and languages. By keeping the training local to the users' devices, we ensure the privacy of the users' data while benefitting from the efficiency of federated learning. Furthermore, we personalize client models to target-specific training data and evaluate their performance. Our results indicate the effectiveness of FL across different target groups, whereas the benefits of personalization on few-shot learning are not clear.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04942v1,2024-12
Who Speaks Next? Multi-party AI Discussion Leveraging the Systematics of Turn-taking in Murder Mystery Games,"Ryota Nonomura, Hiroki Mori","Multi-agent systems utilizing large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in achieving natural dialogue. However, smooth dialogue control and autonomous decision making among agents still remain challenges. In this study, we focus on conversational norms such as adjacency pairs and turn-taking found in conversation analysis and propose a new framework called ""Murder Mystery Agents"" that applies these norms to AI agents' dialogue control. As an evaluation target, we employed the ""Murder Mystery"" game, a reasoning-type table-top role-playing game that requires complex social reasoning and information manipulation. In this game, players need to unravel the truth of the case based on fragmentary information through cooperation and bargaining. The proposed framework integrates next speaker selection based on adjacency pairs and a self-selection mechanism that takes agents' internal states into account to achieve more natural and strategic dialogue. To verify the effectiveness of this new approach, we analyzed utterances that led to dialogue breakdowns and conducted automatic evaluation using LLMs, as well as human evaluation using evaluation criteria developed for the Murder Mystery game. Experimental results showed that the implementation of the next speaker selection mechanism significantly reduced dialogue breakdowns and improved the ability of agents to share information and perform logical reasoning. The results of this study demonstrate that the systematics of turn-taking in human conversation are also effective in controlling dialogue among AI agents, and provide design guidelines for more advanced multi-agent dialogue systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04937v1,2024-12
"Probing the contents of semantic representations from text, behavior, and brain data using the psychNorms metabase","Zak Hussain, Rui Mata, Ben R. Newell, Dirk U. Wulff","Semantic representations are integral to natural language processing, psycholinguistics, and artificial intelligence. Although often derived from internet text, recent years have seen a rise in the popularity of behavior-based (e.g., free associations) and brain-based (e.g., fMRI) representations, which promise improvements in our ability to measure and model human representations. We carry out the first systematic evaluation of the similarities and differences between semantic representations derived from text, behavior, and brain data. Using representational similarity analysis, we show that word vectors derived from behavior and brain data encode information that differs from their text-derived cousins. Furthermore, drawing on our psychNorms metabase, alongside an interpretability method that we call representational content analysis, we find that, in particular, behavior representations capture unique variance on certain affective, agentic, and socio-moral dimensions. We thus establish behavior as an important complement to text for capturing human representations and behavior. These results are broadly relevant to research aimed at learning human-aligned semantic representations, including work on evaluating and aligning large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04936v1,2024-12
Large Language Models for Ingredient Substitution in Food Recipes using Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization,"Thevin Senath, Kumuthu Athukorala, Ransika Costa, Surangika Ranathunga, Rishemjit Kaur","In this paper, we address the challenge of recipe personalization through ingredient substitution. We make use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to build an ingredient substitution system designed to predict plausible substitute ingredients within a given recipe context. Given that the use of LLMs for this task has been barely done, we carry out an extensive set of experiments to determine the best LLM, prompt, and the fine-tuning setups. We further experiment with methods such as multi-task learning, two-stage fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The experiments are conducted using the publicly available Recipe1MSub corpus. The best results are produced by the Mistral7-Base LLM after fine-tuning and DPO. This result outperforms the strong baseline available for the same corpus with a Hit@1 score of 22.04. Thus we believe that this research represents a significant step towards enabling personalized and creative culinary experiences by utilizing LLM-based ingredient substitution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04922v1,2024-12
DEMO: Reframing Dialogue Interaction with Fine-grained Element Modeling,"Minzheng Wang, Xinghua Zhang, Kun Chen, Nan Xu, Haiyang Yu, Fei Huang, Wenji Mao, Yongbin Li","Large language models (LLMs) have made dialogue one of the central modes in human-machine interaction, leading to the vast amounts of conversation logs and increasing demand for dialogue generation. The dialogue's life-cycle spans from the $\textit{Prelude}$ through the $\textit{Interlocution}$ to the $\textit{Epilogue}$, encompassing rich dialogue elements. Despite the large volumes of dialogue-related studies, there is a lack of benchmark that encompasses comprehensive dialogue elements, which hinders precise modeling, generation and systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce a new research task $\textbf{D}$ialogue $\textbf{E}$lement $\textbf{MO}$deling, including $\textit{Element Awareness}$ and $\textit{Dialogue Agent Interaction}$, and propose a novel benchmark, $\textbf{DEMO}$, designed for a comprehensive dialogue modeling and assessment. On this basis, we further build the DEMO agent with the adept ability to model dialogue elements via imitation learning. Extensive experiments on DEMO indicate that current representative LLMs still have considerable potential for enhancement, and our DEMO agent performs well in both dialogue element modeling and out-of-domain tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04905v2,2024-12
EACO: Enhancing Alignment in Multimodal LLMs via Critical Observation,"Yongxin Wang, Meng Cao, Haokun Lin, Mingfei Han, Liang Ma, Jin Jiang, Yuhao Cheng, Xiaodan Liang","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on various visual question answering and reasoning tasks leveraging instruction fine-tuning specific datasets. They can also learn from preference data annotated by human to enhance their reasoning ability and mitigate hallucinations. Most of preference data is generated from the model itself. However, existing methods require high-quality critical labels, which are costly and rely on human or proprietary models like GPT-4V. In this work, we propose Enhancing Alignment in MLLMs via Critical Observation (EACO), which aligns MLLMs by self-generated preference data using only 5k images economically. Our approach begins with collecting and refining a Scoring Evaluation Instruction-tuning dataset to train a critical evaluation model, termed the Critic. This Critic observes model responses across multiple dimensions, selecting preferred and non-preferred outputs for refined Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) tuning. To further enhance model performance, we employ an additional supervised fine-tuning stage after preference tuning. EACO reduces the overall hallucinations by 65.6% on HallusionBench and improves the reasoning ability by 21.8% on MME-Cognition. EACO achieves an 8.5% improvement over LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B across multiple benchmarks. Remarkably, EACO also shows the potential critical ability in open-source MLLMs, demonstrating that EACO is a viable path to boost the competence of MLLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04903v2,2024-12
Multi-Party Supervised Fine-tuning of Language Models for Multi-Party Dialogue Generation,"Xiaoyu Wang, Ningyuan Xi, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Yue Zhao, Xiaokai Chen, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji","Large Language Models (LLM) are usually fine-tuned to participate in dyadic or two-party dialogues, which can not adapt well to multi-party dialogues (MPD), which hinders their applications in such scenarios including multi-personal meetings, discussions and daily communication. Previous LLM-based researches mainly focus on the multi-agent framework, while their base LLMs are still pairwisely fine-tuned. In this work, we design a multi-party fine-tuning framework (MuPaS) for LLMs on the multi-party dialogue datasets, and prove such a straightforward framework can let the LLM align with the multi-party conversation style efficiently and effectively. We also design two training strategies which can convert MuPaS into the MPD simulator. Substantial experiments show that MuPaS can achieve state-of-the-art multi-party response, higher accuracy of the-next-speaker prediction, higher human and automatic evaluated utterance qualities, and can even generate reasonably with out-of-distribution scene, topic and role descriptions. The MuPaS framework bridges the LLM training with more complicated multi-party applications, such as conversation generation, virtual rehearsal or meta-universe.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05342v2,2024-12
Building a Family of Data Augmentation Models for Low-cost LLM Fine-tuning on the Cloud,"Yuanhao Yue, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Peng Wang","Specializing LLMs in various domain-specific tasks has emerged as a critical step towards achieving high performance. However, the construction and annotation of datasets in specific domains are always very costly. Apart from using superior and expensive closed-source LLM APIs to construct datasets, some open-source models have become strong enough to handle dataset construction in many scenarios. Thus, we present a family of data augmentation models designed to significantly improve the efficiency for model fine-tuning. These models, trained based on sufficiently small LLMs, support key functionalities with low inference costs: instruction expansion, instruction refinement, and instruction-response pair expansion. To fulfill this goal, we first construct an automatic data collection system with seed datasets generated from both public repositories and our in-house datasets. This system leverages powerful LLMs to expand, refine and re-write the instructions and responses, incorporating quality assessment techniques. Following this, we introduce the training process of our models, which effectively distills task-solving and text synthesis abilities from teacher LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate how we integrate these functionalities into a machine learning platform to support low-cost LLM fine-tuning from both dataset preparation and training perspectives for users. Experiments and an application study prove the effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04871v1,2024-12

Breaking Event Rumor Detection via Stance-Separated Multi-Agent Debate,"Mingqing Zhang, Haisong Gong, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang","The rapid spread of rumors on social media platforms during breaking events severely hinders the dissemination of the truth. Previous studies reveal that the lack of annotated resources hinders the direct detection of unforeseen breaking events not covered in yesterday's news. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for rumor detection holds significant promise. However, it is challenging for LLMs to provide comprehensive responses to complex or controversial issues due to limited diversity. In this work, we propose the Stance Separated Multi-Agent Debate (S2MAD) to address this issue. Specifically, we firstly introduce Stance Separation, categorizing comments as either supporting or opposing the original claim. Subsequently, claims are classified as subjective or objective, enabling agents to generate reasonable initial viewpoints with different prompt strategies for each type of claim. Debaters then follow specific instructions through multiple rounds of debate to reach a consensus. If a consensus is not reached, a judge agent evaluates the opinions and delivers a final verdict on the claim's veracity. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and effectively improves the performance of LLMs in breaking event rumor detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04859v1,2024-12
Adaptive Dropout for Pruning Conformers,"Yotaro Kubo, Xingyu Cai, Michiel Bacchiani","This paper proposes a method to effectively perform joint training-and-pruning based on adaptive dropout layers with unit-wise retention probabilities. The proposed method is based on the estimation of a unit-wise retention probability in a dropout layer. A unit that is estimated to have a small retention probability can be considered to be prunable. The retention probability of the unit is estimated using back-propagation and the Gumbel-Softmax technique. This pruning method is applied at several application points in Conformers such that the effective number of parameters can be significantly reduced. Specifically, adaptive dropout layers are introduced in three locations in each Conformer block: (a) the hidden layer of the feed-forward-net component, (b) the query vectors and the value vectors of the self-attention component, and (c) the input vectors of the LConv component. The proposed method is evaluated by conducting a speech recognition experiment on the LibriSpeech task. It was shown that this approach could simultaneously achieve a parameter reduction and accuracy improvement. The word error rates improved by approx 1% while reducing the number of parameters by 54%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04836v1,2024-12
Rethinking Time Series Forecasting with LLMs via Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning,"Jayanie Bogahawatte, Sachith Seneviratne, Maneesha Perera, Saman Halgamuge","Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) that are extensively trained on abundant text data, and customizing the input prompt to enable time series forecasting has received considerable attention. While recent work has shown great potential for adapting the learned prior of LLMs, the formulation of the prompt to finetune LLMs remains challenging as prompt should be aligned with time series data. Additionally, current approaches do not effectively leverage word token embeddings which embody the rich representation space learned by LLMs. This emphasizes the need for a robust approach to formulate the prompt which utilizes the word token embeddings while effectively representing the characteristics of the time series. To address these challenges, we propose NNCL-TLLM: Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning for Time series forecasting via LLMs. First, we generate time series compatible text prototypes such that each text prototype represents both word token embeddings in its neighborhood and time series characteristics via end-to-end finetuning. Next, we draw inspiration from Nearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning to formulate the prompt while obtaining the top-$k$ nearest neighbor time series compatible text prototypes. We then fine-tune the layer normalization and positional embeddings of the LLM, keeping the other layers intact, reducing the trainable parameters and decreasing the computational cost. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that NNCL-TLLM outperforms in few-shot forecasting while achieving competitive or superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods in long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04806v1,2024-12
Direct Quantized Training of Language Models with Stochastic Rounding,"Kaiyan Zhao, Tsuguchika Tabaru, Kenichi Kobayashi, Takumi Honda, Masafumi Yamazaki, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka","Although recent quantized Large Language Models (LLMs), such as BitNet, have paved the way for significant reduction in memory usage during deployment with binary or ternary weights, training these models still demands substantial memory footprints. This is partly because high-precision (i.e., unquantized) weight matrices required for straight-through estimation must be maintained throughout the whole training process. To address this, we explore the potential of directly updating the quantized low-precision weight matrices without relying on the straight-through estimator during backpropagation, thereby saving memory usage during training. Specifically, we employ a stochastic rounding technique to minimize information loss caused by the use of low-bit weights throughout training. Experimental results on our LLaMA-structured models indicate that (1) training with only low-precision weights is feasible even when they are constrained to ternary values, (2) extending the bit width to 8 bits results in only a 5% loss degradation compared to BitNet b1.58 while offering the potential for reduced memory usage during training, and (3) our models can also perform inference using ternary weights, showcasing their flexibility in deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04787v1,2024-12
NLP-ADBench: NLP Anomaly Detection Benchmark,"Yuangang Li, Jiaqi Li, Zhuo Xiao, Tiankai Yang, Yi Nian, Xiyang Hu, Yue Zhao","Anomaly detection (AD) is a critical machine learning task with diverse applications in web systems, including fraud detection, content moderation, and user behavior analysis. Despite its significance, AD in natural language processing (NLP) remains underexplored, limiting advancements in detecting anomalies in text data such as harmful content, phishing attempts, or spam reviews. In this paper, we introduce NLP-ADBench, the most comprehensive benchmark for NLP anomaly detection (NLP-AD), comprising eight curated datasets and evaluations of nineteen state-of-the-art algorithms. These include three end-to-end methods and sixteen two-step algorithms that apply traditional anomaly detection techniques to language embeddings generated by bert-base-uncased and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large models.   Our results reveal critical insights and future directions for NLP-AD. Notably, no single model excels across all datasets, highlighting the need for automated model selection. Moreover, two-step methods leveraging transformer-based embeddings consistently outperform specialized end-to-end approaches, with OpenAI embeddings demonstrating superior performance over BERT embeddings. By releasing NLP-ADBench at https://github.com/USC-FORTIS/NLP-ADBench, we provide a standardized framework for evaluating NLP-AD methods, fostering the development of innovative approaches.

Ltri-LLM: Streaming Long Context Inference for LLMs with Training-Free Dynamic Triangular Attention Pattern,"Hongyin Tang, Di Xiu, Lanrui Wang, Xiurui Geng, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai","The quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanism in current Large Language Models (LLMs) renders inference with long contexts prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, various approaches aim to retain critical portions of the context to optimally approximate Full Attention (FA) through Key-Value (KV) compression or Sparse Attention (SA), enabling the processing of virtually unlimited text lengths in a streaming manner. However, these methods struggle to achieve performance levels comparable to FA, particularly in retrieval tasks. In this paper, our analysis of attention head patterns reveals that LLMs' attention distributions show strong local correlations, naturally reflecting a chunking mechanism for input context. We propose Ltri-LLM framework, which divides KVs into spans, stores them in an offline index, and retrieves the relevant KVs into memory for various queries.

Question Answering for Decisionmaking in Green Building Design: A Multimodal Data Reasoning Method Driven by Large Language Models,"Yihui Li, Xiaoyue Yan, Hao Zhou, Borong Lin","In recent years, the critical role of green buildings in addressing energy consumption and environmental issues has become widely acknowledged. Research indicates that over 40% of potential energy savings can be achieved during the early design stage. Therefore, decision-making in green building design (DGBD), which is based on modeling and performance simulation, is crucial for reducing building energy costs. However, the field of green building encompasses a broad range of specialized knowledge, which involves significant learning costs and results in low decision-making efficiency. Many studies have already applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods to this field. Based on previous research, this study innovatively integrates large language models with DGBD, creating GreenQA, a question answering framework for multimodal data reasoning. Utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation, Chain of Thought, and Function Call methods, GreenQA enables multimodal question answering, including weather data analysis and visualization, retrieval of green building cases, and knowledge query. Additionally, this study conducted a user survey using the GreenQA web platform. The results showed that 96% of users believed the platform helped improve design efficiency.

BESSTIE: A Benchmark for Sentiment and Sarcasm Classification for Varieties of English,"Dipankar Srirag, Aditya Joshi, Jordan Painter, Diptesh Kanojia","Despite large language models (LLMs) being known to exhibit bias against non-mainstream varieties, there are no known labeled datasets for sentiment analysis of English. To address this gap, we introduce BESSTIE, a benchmark for sentiment and sarcasm classification for three varieties of English: Australian (en-AU), Indian (en-IN), and British (en-UK). Using web-based content from two domains, namely, Google Place reviews and Reddit comments, we collect datasets for these language varieties using two methods: location-based and topic-based filtering. Native speakers of the language varieties manually annotate the datasets with sentiment and sarcasm labels. Subsequently, we fine-tune nine large language models (LLMs) (representing a range of encoder/decoder and mono/multilingual models) on these datasets, and evaluate their performance on the two tasks. Our results reveal that the models consistently perform better on inner-circle varieties (i.e., en-AU and en-UK), with significant performance drops for en-IN, particularly in sarcasm detection. We also report challenges in cross-variety generalisation, highlighting the need for language variety-specific datasets such as ours. BESSTIE promises to be a useful evaluative benchmark for future research in equitable LLMs, specifically in terms of language varieties.

Transformers Struggle to Learn to Search,"Abulhair Saparov, Srushti Pawar, Shreyas Pimpalgaonkar, Nitish Joshi, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Vishakh Padmakumar, Seyed Mehran Kazemi, Najoung Kim, He He","Search is an ability foundational in many important tasks, and recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) struggle to perform search robustly. It is unknown whether this inability is due to a lack of data, insufficient model parameters, or fundamental limitations of the transformer architecture. In this work, we use the foundational graph connectivity problem as a testbed to generate effectively limitless high-coverage data to train small transformers and test whether they can learn to perform search. We find that, when given the right training distribution, the transformer is able to learn to search.   We analyze the algorithm that the transformer has learned through a novel mechanistic interpretability technique that enables us to extract the computation graph from the trained model. We find that for each vertex in the input graph, transformers compute the set of vertices reachable from that vertex. Each layer then progressively expands these sets, allowing the model to search over a number of vertices exponential in the number of layers.   However, we find that as the input graph size increases, the transformer has greater difficulty in learning the task. This difficulty is not resolved even as the number of parameters is increased, suggesting that increasing model scale will not lead to robust search abilities. We also find that performing search in-context (i.e., chain-of-thought) does not resolve this inability to learn to search on larger graphs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04703v1,2024-12
Privacy-Preserving Retrieval Augmented Generation with Differential Privacy,"Tatsuki Koga, Ruihan Wu, Kamalika Chaudhuri","With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly sensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists LLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge sources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our extensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the non-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\epsilon\approx 10$ across different models and datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04697v1,2024-12
LLM-Align: Utilizing Large Language Models for Entity Alignment in Knowledge Graphs,"Xuan Chen, Tong Lu, Zhichun Wang","Entity Alignment (EA) seeks to identify and match corresponding entities across different Knowledge Graphs (KGs), playing a crucial role in knowledge fusion and integration. Embedding-based entity alignment (EA) has recently gained considerable attention, resulting in the emergence of many innovative approaches. Initially, these approaches concentrated on learning entity embeddings based on the structural features of knowledge graphs (KGs) as defined by relation triples. Subsequent methods have integrated entities' names and attributes as supplementary information to improve the embeddings used for EA. However, existing methods lack a deep semantic understanding of entity attributes and relations. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) based Entity Alignment method, LLM-Align, which explores the instruction-following and zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models to infer alignments of entities. LLM-Align uses heuristic methods to select important attributes and relations of entities, and then feeds the selected triples of entities to an LLM to infer the alignment results. To guarantee the quality of alignment results, we design a multi-round voting mechanism to mitigate the hallucination and positional bias issues that occur with LLMs. Experiments on three EA datasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing EA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04690v1,2024-12
SWEPO: Simultaneous Weighted Preference Optimization for Group Contrastive Alignment,"Taneesh Gupta, Rahul Madhavan, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Saravan Rajmohan","We introduce Simultaneous Weighted Preference Optimization (SWEPO), a novel extension of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) designed to accommodate multiple dynamically chosen positive and negative responses for each query. SWEPO employs a weighted group contrastive loss, assigning weights to responses based on their deviation from the mean reward score. This approach effectively prioritizes responses that are significantly better or worse than the average, enhancing optimization. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that simultaneously considering multiple preferences reduces alignment bias, resulting in more robust alignment. Additionally, we provide insights into the training dynamics of our loss function and a related function, InfoNCA. Empirical validation on the UltraFeedback dataset establishes SWEPO as state-of-the-art, with superior performance in downstream evaluations using the AlpacaEval dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04628v2,2024-12

Code generation tasks that require long-structured outputs can also be enhanced by multimodality. Despite this, their use in commercial applications is often limited due to limited access to training data and restrictive licensing, which hinders open access. To address these limitations, we introduce BigDocs-7.5M, a high-quality, open-access dataset comprising 7.5 million multimodal documents across 30 tasks. We use an efficient data curation process to ensure our data is high-quality and license-permissive. Our process emphasizes accountability, responsibility, and transparency through filtering rules, traceable metadata, and careful content analysis. Additionally, we introduce BigDocs-Bench, a benchmark suite with 10 novel tasks where we create datasets that reflect real-world use cases involving reasoning over Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and code generation from images. Our experiments show that training with BigDocs-Bench improves average performance up to 25.8% over closed-source GPT-4o in document reasoning and structured output tasks such as Screenshot2HTML or Image2Latex generation. Finally, human evaluations showed a preference for outputs from models trained on BigDocs over GPT-4o. This suggests that BigDocs can help both academics and the open-source community utilize and improve AI tools to enhance multimodal capabilities and document reasoning.

Sometimes I am a Tree: Data Drives Unstable Hierarchical Generalization,"Tian Qin, Naomi Saphra, David Alvarez-Melis","Language models (LMs), like other neural networks, often favor shortcut heuristics based on surface-level patterns. Although LMs behave like n-gram models early in training, they must eventually learn hierarchical syntactic representations to correctly apply grammatical rules out-of-distribution (OOD). In this work, we use case studies of English grammar to explore how complex, diverse training data drives models to generalize OOD. We construct a framework that unifies our understanding of random variation with training dynamics, rule selection with memorization, and data diversity with complexity. We show that these factors are nuanced, and that intermediate levels of diversity and complexity lead to inconsistent behavior across random seeds and to unstable training dynamics. Our findings emphasize the critical role of training data in shaping generalization patterns and illuminate how competing model strategies lead to inconsistent generalization outcomes across random seeds.

Extractive Structures Learned in Pretraining Enable Generalization on Finetuned Facts,"Jiahai Feng, Stuart Russell, Jacob Steinhardt","Pretrained language models (LMs) can generalize to implications of facts that they are finetuned on. For example, if finetuned on ``John Doe lives in Tokyo,"" LMs can correctly answer ``What language do the people in John Doe's city speak?'' with ``Japanese''. However, little is known about the mechanisms that enable this generalization or how they are learned during pretraining. We introduce extractive structures as a framework for describing how components in LMs (e.g., MLPs or attention heads) coordinate to enable this generalization. The structures consist of informative components that store training facts as weight changes, and upstream and downstream extractive components that query and process the stored information to produce the correct implication. We hypothesize that extractive structures are learned during pretraining when encountering implications of previously known facts. This yields two predictions: a data ordering effect where extractive structures can be learned only if facts precede their implications, and a weight grafting effect where extractive structures can be transferred to predict counterfactual implications. We empirically demonstrate these phenomena in the OLMo-7b, Llama 3-8b, Gemma 2-9b, and Qwen 2-7b models. Of independent interest, our results also indicate that fact learning can occur at both early and late layers, which lead to different forms of generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04614v1,2024-12
Semantic Consistency-Based Uncertainty Quantification for Factuality in Radiology Report Generation,"Chenyu Wang, Weichao Zhou, Shantanu Ghosh, Kayhan Batmanghelich, Wenchao Li","Radiology report generation (RRG) has shown great potential in assisting radiologists by automating the labor-intensive task of report writing. While recent advancements have improved the quality and coherence of generated reports, ensuring their factual correctness remains a critical challenge. Although generative medical Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have been proposed to address this issue, these models are prone to hallucinations and can produce inaccurate diagnostic information. To address these concerns, we introduce a novel Semantic Consistency-Based Uncertainty Quantification framework that provides both report-level and sentence-level uncertainties. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require modifications to the underlying model or access to its inner state, such as output token logits, thus serving as a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in detecting hallucinations and enhancing the factual accuracy of automatically generated radiology reports. By abstaining from high-uncertainty reports, our approach improves factuality scores by $10$%, achieved by rejecting $20$% of reports using the Radialog model on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Furthermore, sentence-level uncertainty flags the lowest-precision sentence in each report with an $82.9$% success rate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04606v1,2024-12

These examples emphasize how crucial it is to understand the conditions and requirements of the problems precisely before starting to solve them. We discuss the solutions to those problems in detail, complement them with numerical estimations, and link the conditions in the problems to the logical statements in Python programming language.

"Show, Don't Tell: Uncovering Implicit Character Portrayal using LLMs","Brandon Jaipersaud, Zining Zhu, Frank Rudzicz, Elliot Creager","Tools for analyzing character portrayal in fiction are valuable for writers and literary scholars in developing and interpreting compelling stories. Existing tools, such as visualization tools for analyzing fictional characters, primarily rely on explicit textual indicators of character attributes. However, portrayal is often implicit, revealed through actions and behaviors rather than explicit statements. We address this gap by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to uncover implicit character portrayals. We start by generating a dataset for this task with greater cross-topic similarity, lexical diversity, and narrative lengths than existing narrative text corpora such as TinyStories and WritingPrompts. We then introduce LIIPA (LLMs for Inferring Implicit Portrayal for Character Analysis), a framework for prompting LLMs to uncover character portrayals. LIIPA can be configured to use various types of intermediate computation (character attribute word lists, chain-of-thought) to infer how fictional characters are portrayed in the source text. We find that LIIPA outperforms existing approaches, and is more robust to increasing character counts (number of unique persons depicted) due to its ability to utilize full narrative context. Lastly, we investigate the sensitivity of portrayal estimates to character demographics, identifying a fairness-accuracy tradeoff among methods in our LIIPA framework -- a phenomenon familiar within the algorithmic fairness literature. Despite this tradeoff, all LIIPA variants consistently outperform non-LLM baselines in both fairness and accuracy. Our work demonstrates the potential benefits of using LLMs to analyze complex characters and to better understand how implicit portrayal biases may manifest in narrative texts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04576v1,2024-12
Give me Some Hard Questions: Synthetic Data Generation for Clinical QA,"Fan Bai, Keith Harrigian, Joel Stremmel, Hamid Hassanzadeh, Ardavan Saeedi, Mark Dredze","Clinical Question Answering (QA) systems enable doctors to quickly access patient information from electronic health records (EHRs). However, training these systems requires significant annotated data, which is limited due to the expertise needed and the privacy concerns associated with clinical data. This paper explores generating Clinical QA data using large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot setting. We find that naive prompting often results in easy questions that do not reflect the complexity of clinical scenarios. To address this, we propose two prompting strategies: 1) instructing the model to generate questions that do not overlap with the input context, and 2) summarizing the input record using a predefined schema to scaffold question generation. Experiments on two Clinical QA datasets demonstrate that our method generates more challenging questions, significantly improving fine-tuning performance over baselines. We compare synthetic and gold data and find a gap between their training efficacy resulting from the quality of synthetically generated answers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04573v1,2024-12
VisionZip: Longer is Better but Not Necessary in Vision Language Models,"Senqiao Yang, Yukang Chen, Zhuotao Tian, Chengyao Wang, Jingyao Li, Bei Yu, Jiaya Jia","Recent advancements in vision-language models have enhanced performance by increasing the length of visual tokens, making them much longer than text tokens and significantly raising computational costs. However, we observe that the visual tokens generated by popular vision encoders, such as CLIP and SigLIP, contain significant redundancy. To address this, we introduce VisionZip, a simple yet effective method that selects a set of informative tokens for input to the language model, reducing visual token redundancy and improving efficiency while maintaining model performance. The proposed VisionZip can be widely applied to image and video understanding tasks and is well-suited for multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios, where previous methods tend to underperform. Experimental results show that VisionZip outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by at least 5% performance gains across nearly all settings. Moreover, our method significantly enhances model inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 8x and enabling the LLaVA-Next 13B model to infer faster than the LLaVA-Next 7B model while achieving better results. Furthermore, we analyze the causes of this redundancy and encourage the community to focus on extracting better visual features rather than merely increasing token length.

Aguvis: Unified Pure Vision Agents for Autonomous GUI Interaction,"Yiheng Xu, Zekun Wang, Junli Wang, Dunjie Lu, Tianbao Xie, Amrita Saha, Doyen Sahoo, Tao Yu, Caiming Xiong","Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are critical to human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI tasks remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of visual environments. Existing approaches often rely on textual representations of GUIs, which introduce limitations in generalization, efficiency, and scalability. In this paper, we introduce Aguvis, a unified pure vision-based framework for autonomous GUI agents that operates across various platforms. Our approach leverages image-based observations, and grounding instructions in natural language to visual elements, and employs a consistent action space to ensure cross-platform generalization. To address the limitations of previous work, we integrate explicit planning and reasoning within the model, enhancing its ability to autonomously navigate and interact with complex digital environments. We construct a large-scale dataset of GUI agent trajectories, incorporating multimodal reasoning and grounding, and employ a two-stage training pipeline that first focuses on general GUI grounding, followed by planning and reasoning. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Aguvis surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in both offline and real-world online scenarios, achieving, to our knowledge, the first fully autonomous pure vision GUI agent capable of performing tasks independently without collaboration with external closed-source models.

p-MoD: Building Mixture-of-Depths MLLMs via Progressive Ratio Decay,"Jun Zhang, Desen Meng, Ji Qi, Zhenpeng Huang, Tao Wu, Limin Wang","Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. The majority of computation stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer decoder. In this paper, we propose to build efficient MLLMs by leveraging the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each transformer decoder layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layer and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments with two baseline models across 14 benchmarks. Our model, p-MoD, matches or even surpasses the performance of the baseline models, with only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.8% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04449v1,2024-12
Moto: Latent Motion Token as the Bridging Language for Robot Manipulation,"Yi Chen, Yuying Ge, Yizhuo Li, Yixiao Ge, Mingyu Ding, Ying Shan, Xihui Liu","Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich ""corpus"", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging ""language"" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04445v1,2024-12
CA-SSLR: Condition-Aware Self-Supervised Learning Representation for Generalized Speech Processing,"Yen-Ju Lu, Jing Liu, Thomas Thebaud, Laureano Moro-Velazquez, Ariya Rastrow, Najim Dehak, Jesus Villalba","We introduce Condition-Aware Self-Supervised Learning Representation (CA-SSLR), a generalist conditioning model broadly applicable to various speech-processing tasks. Compared to standard fine-tuning methods that optimize for downstream models, CA-SSLR integrates language and speaker embeddings from earlier layers, making the SSL model aware of the current language and speaker context. This approach reduces the reliance on input audio features while preserving the integrity of the base SSLR. CA-SSLR improves the model's capabilities and demonstrates its generality on unseen tasks with minimal task-specific tuning. Our method employs linear modulation to dynamically adjust internal representations, enabling fine-grained adaptability without significantly altering the original model behavior. Experiments show that CA-SSLR reduces the number of trainable parameters, mitigates overfitting, and excels in under-resourced and unseen tasks.

Understanding Hidden Computations in Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,Aryasomayajula Ram Bharadwaj,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the reasoning abilities of large language models. However, recent studies have shown that models can still perform complex reasoning tasks even when the CoT is replaced with filler(hidden) characters (e.g., ""...""), leaving open questions about how models internally process and represent reasoning steps. In this paper, we investigate methods to decode these hidden characters in transformer models trained with filler CoT sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representations using the logit lens method and examining token rankings, we demonstrate that the hidden characters can be recovered without loss of performance. Our findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of transformer models and open avenues for improving interpretability and transparency in language model reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04537v1,2024-12
Establishing Task Scaling Laws via Compute-Efficient Model Ladders,"Akshita Bhagia, Jiacheng Liu, Alexander Wettig, David Heineman, Oyvind Tafjord, Ananya Harsh Jha, Luca Soldaini, Noah A. Smith, Dirk Groeneveld, Pang Wei Koh, Jesse Dodge, Hannaneh Hajishirzi","We develop task scaling laws and model ladders to predict the individual task performance of pretrained language models (LMs) in the overtrained setting. Standard power laws for language modeling loss cannot accurately model task performance. Therefore, we leverage a two-step prediction approach: first use model and data size to predict a task-specific loss, and then use this task loss to predict task performance. We train a set of small-scale ""ladder"" models, collect data points to fit the parameterized functions of the two prediction steps, and make predictions for two target models: a 7B model trained to 4T tokens and a 13B model trained to 5T tokens. Training the ladder models only costs 1% of the compute used for the target models. On four multiple-choice tasks written in ranked classification format, we can predict the accuracy of both target models within 2 points of absolute error. We have higher prediction error on four other tasks (average absolute error 6.9) and find that these are often tasks with higher variance in task metrics. We also find that using less compute to train fewer ladder models tends to deteriorate predictions. Finally, we empirically show that our design choices and the two-step approach lead to superior performance in establishing scaling laws.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04403v1,2024-12
BhashaVerse : Translation Ecosystem for Indian Subcontinent Languages,"Vandan Mujadia, Dipti Misra Sharma","This paper focuses on developing translation models and related applications for 36 Indian languages, including Assamese, Awadhi, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Braj, Bodo, Dogri, English, Konkani, Gondi, Gujarati, Hindi, Hinglish, Ho, Kannada, Kangri, Kashmiri (Arabic and Devanagari), Khasi, Mizo, Magahi, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Manipuri (Bengali and Meitei), Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Sinhala, Sindhi (Arabic and Devanagari), Tamil, Tulu, Telugu, and Urdu. Achieving this requires parallel and other types of corpora for all 36 * 36 language pairs, addressing challenges like script variations, phonetic differences, and syntactic diversity. For instance, languages like Kashmiri and Sindhi, which use multiple scripts, demand script normalization for alignment, while low-resource languages such as Khasi and Santali require synthetic data augmentation to ensure sufficient coverage and quality.   To address these challenges, this work proposes strategies for corpus creation by leveraging existing resources, developing parallel datasets, generating domain-specific corpora, and utilizing synthetic data techniques. Additionally, it evaluates machine translation across various dimensions, including standard and discourse-level translation, domain-specific translation, reference-based and reference-free evaluation, error analysis, and automatic post-editing.

Retrieval-Augmented Machine Translation with Unstructured Knowledge,"Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Yingxue Zhang, Jie Zhou","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) introduces additional information to enhance large language models (LLMs). In machine translation (MT), previous work typically retrieves in-context examples from paired MT corpora, or domain-specific knowledge from knowledge graphs, to enhance models' MT ability. However, a large amount of world knowledge is organized in unstructured documents, and might not be fully paired across different languages. In this paper, we study retrieval-augmented MT using unstructured documents. Specifically, we build RAGtrans, the first benchmark to train and evaluate LLMs' retrieval-augmented MT ability. RAGtrans contains 79K MT samples collected via GPT-4o and human translators. Besides, documents from different languages are also provided to supply the knowledge to these samples. Based on RAGtrans, we further propose a multi-task training method to teach LLMs how to use information from multilingual documents during their translation. The method uses existing multilingual corpora to create auxiliary training objectives without additional labeling requirements. Extensive experiments show that the method improves LLMs by 1.58-3.09 BLEU and 1.00-2.03 COMET scores.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04342v1,2024-12
The Hyperfitting Phenomenon: Sharpening and Stabilizing LLMs for Open-Ended Text Generation,"Fredrik Carlsson, Fangyu Liu, Daniel Ward, Murathan Kurfali, Joakim Nivre","This paper introduces the counter-intuitive generalization results of overfitting pre-trained large language models (LLMs) on very small datasets. In the setting of open-ended text generation, it is well-documented that LLMs tend to generate repetitive and dull sequences, a phenomenon that is especially apparent when generating using greedy decoding. This issue persists even with state-of-the-art LLMs containing billions of parameters, trained via next-token prediction on large datasets. We find that by further fine-tuning these models to achieve a near-zero training loss on a small set of samples -- a process we refer to as hyperfitting -- the long-sequence generative capabilities are greatly enhanced. Greedy decoding with these Hyperfitted models even outperform Top-P sampling over long-sequences, both in terms of diversity and human preferences. This phenomenon extends to LLMs of various sizes, different domains, and even autoregressive image generation. We further find this phenomena to be distinctly different from that of Grokking and double descent. Surprisingly, our experiments indicate that hyperfitted models rarely fall into repeating sequences they were trained on, and even explicitly blocking these sequences results in high-quality output. All hyperfitted models produce extremely low-entropy predictions, often allocating nearly all probability to a single token.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04318v1,2024-12
Densing Law of LLMs,"Chaojun Xiao, Jie Cai, Weilin Zhao, Guoyang Zeng, Biyuan Lin, Jie Zhou, Zhi Zheng, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a milestone in artificial intelligence, and their performance can improve as the model size increases. However, this scaling brings great challenges to training and inference efficiency, particularly for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments, and the scaling trend is becoming increasingly unsustainable. This paper introduces the concept of ``\textit{capacity density}'' as a new metric to evaluate the quality of the LLMs across different scales and describes the trend of LLMs in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To calculate the capacity density of a given target LLM, we first introduce a set of reference models and develop a scaling law to predict the downstream performance of these reference models based on their parameter sizes. We then define the \textit{effective parameter size} of the target LLM as the parameter size required by a reference model to achieve equivalent performance, and formalize the capacity density as the ratio of the effective parameter size to the actual parameter size of the target LLM. Capacity density provides a unified framework for assessing both model effectiveness and efficiency. Our further analysis of recent open-source base LLMs reveals an empirical law (the densing law)that the capacity density of LLMs grows exponentially over time. More specifically, using some widely used benchmarks for evaluation, the capacity density of LLMs doubles approximately every three months. The law provides new perspectives to guide future LLM development, emphasizing the importance of improving capacity density to achieve optimal results with minimal computational overhead.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04315v2,2024-12
ALMA: Alignment with Minimal Annotation,"Michihiro Yasunaga, Leonid Shamis, Chunting Zhou, Andrew Cohen, Jason Weston, Luke Zettlemoyer, Marjan Ghazvininejad","Recent approaches to large language model (LLM) alignment typically require millions of human annotations or rely on external aligned models for synthetic data generation. This paper introduces ALMA: Alignment with Minimal Annotation, demonstrating that effective alignment can be achieved using only 9,000 labeled examples -- less than 1% of conventional approaches. ALMA generates large amounts of high-quality synthetic alignment data through new techniques: diverse prompt synthesis via few-shot learning, diverse response generation with multiple model checkpoints, and judge (reward model) enhancement through score aggregation and self-distillation. Using only a pretrained Llama3 base model, 5,000 SFT examples, and 4,000 judge annotations, ALMA achieves performance close to Llama3-Instruct across diverse alignment benchmarks (e.g., 0.1% difference on AlpacaEval 2.0 score). These results are achieved with a multi-round, self-bootstrapped data synthesis and training recipe that continues to improve for 10 rounds, surpassing the typical 3-round ceiling of previous methods. These results suggest that base models already possess sufficient knowledge for effective alignment, and that synthetic data generation methods can expose it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04305v1,2024-12
Evolutionary Pre-Prompt Optimization for Mathematical Reasoning,"Mathurin Videau, Alessandro Leite, Marc Schoenauer, Olivier Teytaud","Recent advancements have highlighted that large language models (LLMs), when given a small set of task-specific examples, demonstrate remarkable proficiency, a capability that extends to complex reasoning tasks.

This paper explores the optimization of example selection for designing effective CoT pre-prompts and shows that the choice of the optimization algorithm, typically in favor of comparison-based methods such as evolutionary computation, significantly enhances efficacy and feasibility. Specifically, thanks to a limited exploitative and overfitted optimization, Evolutionary Pre-Prompt Optimization (EPPO) brings an improvement over the naive few-shot approach exceeding 10 absolute points in exact match scores on benchmark datasets such as GSM8k and MathQA.

To address this issue, the Prediction and Recognition of Cognitive Decline through Spontaneous Speech (PROCESS) Signal Processing Grand Challenge invites participants to focus on early-stage dementia detection. We provide a new spontaneous speech corpus for this challenge. This corpus includes answers from three prompts designed by neurologists to better capture the cognition of speakers. Our baseline models achieved an F1-score of 55.0% on the classification task and an RMSE of 2.98 on the regression task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15230v1,2024-12
Arabic Stable LM: Adapting Stable LM 2 1.6B to Arabic,"Zaid Alyafeai, Michael Pieler, Hannah Teufel, Jonathan Tow, Marco Bellagente, Duy Phung, Nikhil Pinnaparaju, Reshinth Adithyan, Paulo Rocha, Maksym Zhuravinskyi, Carlos Riquelme","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive results in multiple domains of natural language processing (NLP) but are mainly focused on the English language. Recently, more LLMs have incorporated a larger proportion of multilingual text to represent low-resource languages. In Arabic NLP, several Arabic-centric LLMs have shown remarkable results on multiple benchmarks in the past two years. However, most Arabic LLMs have more than 7 billion parameters, which increases their hardware requirements and inference latency, when compared to smaller LLMs. This paper introduces Arabic Stable LM 1.6B in a base and chat version as a small but powerful Arabic-centric LLM. Our Arabic Stable LM 1.6B chat model achieves impressive results on several benchmarks beating multiple models with up to 8x the parameters. In addition, we show the benefit of mixing in synthetic instruction tuning data by augmenting our fine-tuning data with a large synthetic dialogue dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04277v1,2024-12
Representation Purification for End-to-End Speech Translation,"Chengwei Zhang, Yue Zhou, Rui Zhao, Yidong Chen, Xiaodong Shi","Speech-to-text translation (ST) is a cross-modal task that involves converting spoken language into text in a different language. Previous research primarily focused on enhancing speech translation by facilitating knowledge transfer from machine translation, exploring various methods to bridge the gap between speech and text modalities. Despite substantial progress made, factors in speech that are not relevant to translation content, such as timbre and rhythm, often limit the efficiency of knowledge transfer. In this paper, we conceptualize speech representation as a combination of content-agnostic and content-relevant factors. We examine the impact of content-agnostic factors on translation performance through preliminary experiments and observe a significant performance deterioration when content-agnostic perturbations are introduced to speech signals. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{S}peech \textbf{R}epresentation \textbf{P}urification with \textbf{S}upervision \textbf{E}nhancement (SRPSE) framework, which excludes the content-agnostic components within speech representations to mitigate their negative impact on ST. Experiments on MuST-C and CoVoST-2 datasets demonstrate that SRPSE significantly improves translation performance across all translation directions in three settings and achieves preeminent performance under a \textit{transcript-free} setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04266v1,2024-12

CLINICSUM: Utilizing Language Models for Generating Clinical Summaries from Patient-Doctor Conversations,"Subash Neupane, Himanshu Tripathi, Shaswata Mitra, Sean Bozorgzad, Sudip Mittal, Shahram Rahimi, Amin Amirlatifi","This paper presents ClinicSum, a novel framework designed to automatically generate clinical summaries from patient-doctor conversations. It utilizes a two-module architecture: a retrieval-based filtering module that extracts Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) information from conversation transcripts, and an inference module powered by fine-tuned Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), which leverage the extracted SOAP data to generate abstracted clinical summaries. To fine-tune the PLM, we created a training dataset of consisting 1,473 conversations-summaries pair by consolidating two publicly available datasets, FigShare and MTS-Dialog, with ground truth summaries validated by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). ClinicSum's effectiveness is evaluated through both automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BERTScore) and expert human assessments. Results show that ClinicSum outperforms state-of-the-art PLMs, demonstrating superior precision, recall, and F-1 scores in automatic evaluations and receiving high preference from SMEs in human assessment, making it a robust solution for automated clinical summarization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04254v1,2024-12
A History of Philosophy in Colombia through Topic Modelling,"Juan R. Loaiza, Miguel González-Duque","Data-driven approaches to philosophy have emerged as a valuable tool for studying the history of the discipline. However, most studies in this area have focused on a limited number of journals from specific regions and subfields. We expand the scope of this research by applying dynamic topic modelling techniques to explore the history of philosophy in Colombia and Latin America. Our study examines the Colombian philosophy journal Ideas y Valores, founded in 1951 and currently one of the most influential academic philosophy journals in the region. By analyzing the evolution of topics across the journal's history, we identify various trends and specific dynamics in philosophical discourse within the Colombian and Latin American context. Our findings reveal that the most prominent topics are value theory (including ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics), epistemology, and the philosophy of science. We also trace the evolution of articles focusing on the historical and interpretive aspects of philosophical texts, and we note a notable emphasis on German philosophers such as Kant, Husserl, and Hegel on various topics throughout the journal's lifetime. Additionally, we investigate whether articles with a historical focus have decreased over time due to editorial pressures. Our analysis suggests no significant decline in such articles. Finally, we propose ideas for extending this research to other Latin American journals and suggest improvements for natural language processing workflows in non-English languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04236v1,2024-12
Addressing Hallucinations with RAG and NMISS in Italian Healthcare LLM Chatbots,Maria Paola Priola,"I combine detection and mitigation techniques to addresses hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). Mitigation is achieved in a question-answering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework while detection is obtained by introducing the Negative Missing Information Scoring System (NMISS), which accounts for contextual relevance in responses. While RAG mitigates hallucinations by grounding answers in external data, NMISS refines the evaluation by identifying cases where traditional metrics incorrectly flag contextually accurate responses as hallucinations. I use Italian health news articles as context to evaluate LLM performance. Results show that Gemma2 and GPT-4 outperform the other models, with GPT-4 producing answers closely aligned with reference responses. Mid-tier models, such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral benefit significantly from NMISS, highlighting their ability to provide richer contextual information. This combined approach offers new insights into the reduction and more accurate assessment of hallucinations in LLMs, with applications in real-world healthcare tasks and other domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04235v1,2024-12
A Context-aware Framework for Translation-mediated Conversations,"José Pombal, Sweta Agrawal, Patrick Fernandes, Emmanouil Zaranis, André F. T. Martins","Effective communication is fundamental to any interaction, yet challenges arise when participants do not share a common language. Automatic translation systems offer a powerful solution to bridge language barriers in such scenarios, but they introduce errors that can lead to misunderstandings and conversation breakdown. A key issue is that current systems fail to incorporate the rich contextual information necessary to resolve ambiguities and omitted details, resulting in literal, inappropriate, or misaligned translations. In this work, we present a framework to improve large language model-based translation systems by incorporating contextual information in bilingual conversational settings. During training, we leverage context-augmented parallel data, which allows the model to generate translations sensitive to conversational history. During inference, we perform quality-aware decoding with context-aware metrics to select the optimal translation from a pool of candidates. We validate both components of our framework on two task-oriented domains: customer chat and user-assistant interaction. Across both settings, our framework consistently results in better translations than state-of-the-art systems like GPT-4o and TowerInstruct, as measured by multiple automatic translation quality metrics on several language pairs. We also show that the resulting model leverages context in an intended and interpretable way, improving consistency between the conveyed message and the generated translations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04205v1,2024-12
AL-QASIDA: Analyzing LLM Quality and Accuracy Systematically in Dialectal Arabic,"Nathaniel R. Robinson, Shahd Abdelmoneim, Kelly Marchisio, Sebastian Ruder","Dialectal Arabic (DA) varieties are under-served by language technologies, particularly large language models (LLMs). This trend threatens to exacerbate existing social inequalities and limits LLM applications, yet the research community lacks operationalized performance measurements in DA. We present a framework that comprehensively assesses LLMs' DA modeling capabilities across four dimensions: fidelity, understanding, quality, and diglossia. We evaluate nine LLMs in eight DA varieties and provide practical recommendations. Our evaluation suggests that LLMs do not produce DA as well as they understand it, not because their DA fluency is poor, but because they are reluctant to generate DA. Further analysis suggests that current post-training can contribute to bias against DA, that few-shot examples can overcome this deficiency, and that otherwise no measurable features of input text correlate well with LLM DA performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04193v2,2024-12
"If You Can't Use Them, Recycle Them: Optimizing Merging at Scale Mitigates Performance Tradeoffs","Muhammad Khalifa, Yi-Chern Tan, Arash Ahmadian, Tom Hosking, Honglak Lee, Lu Wang, Ahmet Üstün, Tom Sherborne, Matthias Gallé","Model merging has shown great promise at combining expert models, but the benefit of merging is unclear when merging ``generalist'' models trained on many tasks. We explore merging in the context of large (~100B) models, by recycling checkpoints that exhibit tradeoffs among different tasks. Such checkpoints are often created in the process of developing a frontier model, and many suboptimal ones are usually discarded. Given a pool of model checkpoints obtained from different training runs (e.g., different stages, objectives, hyperparameters, and data mixtures), which naturally show tradeoffs across different language capabilities (e.g., instruction following vs. code generation), we investigate whether merging can recycle such suboptimal models into a Pareto-optimal one. Our optimization algorithm tunes the weight of each checkpoint in a linear combination, resulting in a Pareto-optimal models that outperforms both individual models and merge-based baselines. Further analysis shows that good merges tend to include almost all checkpoints with non-zero weights, indicating that even seemingly bad initial checkpoints can contribute to good final merges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04144v2,2024-12
Reducing Tool Hallucination via Reliability Alignment,"Hongshen Xu, Su Zhu, Zihan Wang, Hang Zheng, Da Ma, Ruisheng Cao, Shuai Fan, Lu Chen, Kai Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have extended their capabilities beyond language generation to interact with external systems through tool calling, offering powerful potential for real-world applications. However, the phenomenon of tool hallucinations, which occur when models improperly select or misuse tools, presents critical challenges that can lead to flawed task execution and increased operational costs. This paper investigates the concept of reliable tool calling and highlights the necessity of addressing tool hallucinations. We systematically categorize tool hallucinations into two main types: tool selection hallucination and tool usage hallucination. To mitigate these issues, we propose a reliability-focused alignment framework that enhances the model's ability to accurately assess tool relevance and usage. By proposing a suite of evaluation metrics and evaluating on StableToolBench, we further demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating tool hallucination and improving the overall system reliability of LLM tool calling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04141v1,2024-12
Text Change Detection in Multilingual Documents Using Image Comparison,"Doyoung Park, Naresh Reddy Yarram, Sunjin Kim, Minkyu Kim, Seongho Cho, Taehee Lee","Document comparison typically relies on optical character recognition (OCR) as its core technology. However, OCR requires the selection of appropriate language models for each document and the performance of multilingual or hybrid models remains limited. To overcome these challenges, we propose text change detection (TCD) using an image comparison model tailored for multilingual documents. Unlike OCR-based approaches, our method employs word-level text image-to-image comparison to detect changes. Our model generates bidirectional change segmentation maps between the source and target documents. To enhance performance without requiring explicit text alignment or scaling preprocessing, we employ correlations among multi-scale attention features. We also construct a benchmark dataset comprising actual printed and scanned word pairs in various languages to evaluate our model. We validate our approach using our benchmark dataset and public benchmarks Distorted Document Images and the LRDE Document Binarization Dataset. We compare our model against state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and change detection models, as well as to conventional OCR-based models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04137v1,2024-12
GRAF: Graph Retrieval Augmented by Facts for Romanian Legal Multi-Choice Question Answering,"Cristian-George Crăciun, Răzvan-Alexandru Smădu, Dumitru-Clementin Cercel, Mihaela-Claudia Cercel","Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performances in recent years, setting a new paradigm for NLP research and industry. The legal domain has received some attention from the NLP community partly due to its textual nature. Some tasks from this domain are represented by question-answering (QA) tasks. This work explores the legal domain Multiple-Choice QA (MCQA) for a low-resource language. The contribution of this work is multi-fold. We first introduce JuRO, the first openly available Romanian legal MCQA dataset, comprising three different examinations and a number of 10,836 total questions. Along with this dataset, we introduce CROL, an organized corpus of laws that has a total of 93 distinct documents with their modifications from 763 time spans, that we leveraged in this work for Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. Moreover, we are the first to propose Law-RoG, a Knowledge Graph (KG) for the Romanian language, and this KG is derived from the aforementioned corpus. Lastly, we propose a novel approach for MCQA, Graph Retrieval Augmented by Facts (GRAF), which achieves competitive results with generally accepted SOTA methods and even exceeds them in most settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04119v2,2024-12
"Missing Melodies: AI Music Generation and its ""Nearly"" Complete Omission of the Global South","Atharva Mehta, Shivam Chauhan, Monojit Choudhury","Recent advances in generative AI have sparked renewed interest and expanded possibilities for music generation. However, the performance and versatility of these systems across musical genres are heavily influenced by the availability of training data. We conducted an extensive analysis of over one million hours of audio datasets used in AI music generation research and manually reviewed more than 200 papers from eleven prominent AI and music conferences and organizations (AAAI, ACM, EUSIPCO, EURASIP, ICASSP, ICML, IJCAI, ISMIR, NeurIPS, NIME, SMC) to identify a critical gap in the fair representation and inclusion of the musical genres of the Global South in AI research. Our findings reveal a stark imbalance: approximately 86% of the total dataset hours and over 93% of researchers focus primarily on music from the Global North. However, around 40% of these datasets include some form of non-Western music, genres from the Global South account for only 14.6% of the data. Furthermore, approximately 51% of the papers surveyed concentrate on symbolic music generation, a method that often fails to capture the cultural nuances inherent in music from regions such as South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. As AI increasingly shapes the creation and dissemination of music, the significant underrepresentation of music genres in datasets and research presents a serious threat to global musical diversity. We also propose some important steps to mitigate these risks and foster a more inclusive future for AI-driven music generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04100v2,2024-12
Guidance is All You Need: Temperature-Guided Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Eyad Gomaa, Gomaa Salah","We present Quasar-1, a novel architecture that introduces temperature-guided reasoning to large language models through the Token Temperature Mechanism (TTM) and Guided Sequence of Thought (GSoT). Our approach leverages the concept of hot and cold tokens, where hot tokens are prioritized for their contextual relevance, while cold tokens provide supplementary information. This dynamic modulation of token importance enables the model to achieve superior logical reasoning capabilities compared to traditional chain-of-thought approaches. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that our temperature-guided attention mechanism converges to optimal reasoning paths with exponential guarantees. Empirical results show significant improvements in reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency across a wide range of tasks, making advanced AI reasoning accessible to a broader range of applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06822v1,2024-12
GEITje 7B Ultra: A Conversational Model for Dutch,Bram Vanroy,"Language models have rapidly evolved, predominantly focusing on English while often neglecting extensive pretraining in other languages. This approach has required initiatives to adapt powerful, English-centric models to other linguistic contexts through finetuning. For Dutch, such a recent endeavour is ``GEITje'' a model originally derived from the English-based Mistral 7B. Building on this fundamental work, the current research extends the capabilities of GEITje by supervised finetuning on newly created high-quality synthetic conversational datasets, along with an additional preference alignment procedure on a synthetic feedback dataset. Both the developed models and the created datasets are openly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04092v1,2024-12
Automated Medical Report Generation for ECG Data: Bridging Medical Text and Signal Processing with Deep Learning,"Amnon Bleich, Antje Linnemann, Bjoern H. Diem, Tim OF Conrad","Recent advances in deep learning and natural language generation have significantly improved image captioning, enabling automated, human-like descriptions for visual content. In this work, we apply these captioning techniques to generate clinician-like interpretations of ECG data. This study leverages existing ECG datasets accompanied by free-text reports authored by healthcare professionals (HCPs) as training data. These reports, while often inconsistent, provide a valuable foundation for automated learning. We introduce an encoder-decoder-based method that uses these reports to train models to generate detailed descriptions of ECG episodes. This represents a significant advancement in ECG analysis automation, with potential applications in zero-shot classification and automated clinical decision support.   The model is tested on various datasets, including both 1- and 12-lead ECGs. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art reference model by Qiu et al., achieving a METEOR score of 55.53% compared to 24.51% achieved by the reference model. Furthermore, several key design choices are discussed, providing a comprehensive overview of current challenges and innovations in this domain.

Hostility Detection in UK Politics: A Dataset on Online Abuse Targeting MPs,"Mugdha Pandya, Mali Jin, Kalina Bontcheva, Diana Maynard","Numerous politicians use social media platforms, particularly X, to engage with their constituents. This interaction allows constituents to pose questions and offer feedback but also exposes politicians to a barrage of hostile responses, especially given the anonymity afforded by social media. They are typically targeted in relation to their governmental role, but the comments also tend to attack their personal identity. This can discredit politicians and reduce public trust in the government. It can also incite anger and disrespect, leading to offline harm and violence. While numerous models exist for detecting hostility in general, they lack the specificity required for political contexts. Furthermore, addressing hostility towards politicians demands tailored approaches due to the distinct language and issues inherent to each country (e.g., Brexit for the UK). To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of 3,320 English tweets spanning a two-year period manually annotated for hostility towards UK MPs. Our dataset also captures the targeted identity characteristics (race, gender, religion, none) in hostile tweets. We perform linguistic and topical analyses to delve into the unique content of the UK political data. Finally, we evaluate the performance of pre-trained language models and large language models on binary hostility detection and multi-class targeted identity type classification tasks. Our study offers valuable data and insights for future research on the prevalence and nature of politics-related hostility specific to the UK.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04046v1,2024-12
"M$^{3}$D: A Multimodal, Multilingual and Multitask Dataset for Grounded Document-level Information Extraction","Jiang Liu, Bobo Li, Xinran Yang, Na Yang, Hao Fei, Mingyao Zhang, Fei Li, Donghong Ji","Multimodal information extraction (IE) tasks have attracted increasing attention because many studies have shown that multimodal information benefits text information extraction. However, existing multimodal IE datasets mainly focus on sentence-level image-facilitated IE in English text, and pay little attention to video-based multimodal IE and fine-grained visual grounding. Therefore, in order to promote the development of multimodal IE, we constructed a multimodal multilingual multitask dataset, named M$^{3}$D, which has the following features: (1) It contains paired document-level text and video to enrich multimodal information; (2) It supports two widely-used languages, namely English and Chinese; (3) It includes more multimodal IE tasks such as entity recognition, entity chain extraction, relation extraction and visual grounding. In addition, our dataset introduces an unexplored theme, i.e., biography, enriching the domains of multimodal IE resources. To establish a benchmark for our dataset, we propose an innovative hierarchical multimodal IE model. This model effectively leverages and integrates multimodal information through a Denoised Feature Fusion Module (DFFM). Furthermore, in non-ideal scenarios, modal information is often incomplete. Thus, we designed a Missing Modality Construction Module (MMCM) to alleviate the issues caused by missing modalities. Our model achieved an average performance of 53.80% and 53.77% on four tasks in English and Chinese datasets, respectively, which set a reasonable standard for subsequent research. In addition, we conducted more analytical experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed module. We believe that our work can promote the development of the field of multimodal IE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04026v2,2024-12
Exploring the Influence of Label Aggregation on Minority Voices: Implications for Dataset Bias and Model Training,"Mugdha Pandya, Nafise Sadat Moosavi, Diana Maynard","Resolving disagreement in manual annotation typically consists of removing unreliable annotators and using a label aggregation strategy such as majority vote or expert opinion to resolve disagreement. These may have the side-effect of silencing or under-representing minority but equally valid opinions. In this paper, we study the impact of standard label aggregation strategies on minority opinion representation in sexism detection. We investigate the quality and value of minority annotations, and then examine their effect on the class distributions in gold labels, as well as how this affects the behaviour of models trained on the resulting datasets. Finally, we discuss the potential biases introduced by each method and how they can be amplified by the models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04025v1,2024-12

Many LLMs continue to face challenges with multilingual tasks, especially when it comes to low-resource languages. To address this issue, we introduced Marco-LLM: Massive multilingual training for cross-lingual enhancement LLM. We have collected a substantial amount of multilingual data for several low-resource languages and conducted extensive continual pre-training using the Qwen2 models. This effort has resulted in a multilingual LLM named Marco-LLM. Through comprehensive evaluations on various multilingual benchmarks, including MMMLU, AGIEval, Belebele, Flores-200, XCOPA and many others, Marco-LLM has demonstrated substantial improvements over state-of-the-art LLMs. Furthermore, Marco-LLM achieved substantial enhancements in any-to-any machine translation tasks, showing the effectiveness of our multilingual LLM. Marco-LLM is a pioneering multilingual LLM designed to not only perform exceptionally well in multilingual tasks, including low-resource languages, but also maintain strong performance in English and other major languages, closing the performance gap between high- and low-resource language capabilities.

MTMT: Consolidating Multiple Thinking Modes to Form a Thought Tree for Strengthening LLM,"Changcheng Li, Xiangyu Wang, Qiuju Chen, Xiren Zhou, Huanhuan Chen","Large language models (LLMs) have shown limitations in tasks requiring complex logical reasoning and multi-step problem-solving. To address these challenges, researchers have employed carefully designed prompts and flowcharts, simulating human cognitive processes to enhance LLM performance, such as the Chain of Thought approach. In this paper, we introduce MTMT (Multi-thinking Modes Tree), a novel method that interacts with LLMs to construct a thought tree, simulating various advanced cognitive processes, including but not limited to association, counterfactual thinking, task decomposition, and comparison. By breaking down the original complex task into simpler sub-questions, MTMT facilitates easier problem-solving for LLMs, enabling more effective utilization of the latent knowledge within LLMs. We evaluate the performance of MTMT under different parameter configurations, using GPT-4o mini as the base model. Our results demonstrate that integrating multiple modes of thinking significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to handle complex tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03987v1,2024-12
Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Reinforcement Learning,"Xubin Wang, Jianfei Wu, Yichen Yuan, Mingzhe Li, Deyu Cai, Weijia Jia","Diversity in demonstration selection is crucial for enhancing model generalization, as it enables a broader coverage of structures and concepts. However, constructing an appropriate set of demonstrations has remained a focal point of research. This paper presents the Relevance-Diversity Enhanced Selection (RDES), an innovative approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of diverse reference demonstrations for text classification tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in few-shot prompting scenarios. RDES employs a Q-learning framework to dynamically identify demonstrations that maximize both diversity and relevance to the classification objective by calculating a diversity score based on label distribution among selected demonstrations. This method ensures a balanced representation of reference data, leading to improved classification accuracy. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and involving 12 closed-source and open-source LLMs, we demonstrate that RDES significantly enhances classification accuracy compared to ten established baselines. Furthermore, we investigate the incorporation of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the reasoning process, which further enhances the model's predictive performance. The results underscore the potential of reinforcement learning to facilitate adaptive demonstration selection and deepen the understanding of classification challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03966v1,2024-12
MIND: Effective Incorrect Assignment Detection through a Multi-Modal Structure-Enhanced Language Model,"Yunhe Pang, Bo Chen, Fanjin Zhang, Yanghui Rao, Jie Tang","The rapid growth of academic publications has exacerbated the issue of author name ambiguity in online digital libraries. Despite advances in name disambiguation algorithms, cumulative errors continue to undermine the reliability of academic systems. It is estimated that over 10% paper-author assignments are rectified when constructing the million-scale WhoIsWho benchmark. Existing endeavors to detect incorrect assignments are either semantic-based or graph-based approaches, which fall short of making full use of the rich text attributes of papers and implicit structural features defined via the co-occurrence of paper attributes. To this end, this paper introduces a structure-enhanced language model that combines key structural features from graph-based methods with fine-grained semantic features from rich paper attributes to detect incorrect assignments. The proposed model is trained with a highly effective multi-modal multi-turn instruction tuning framework, which incorporates task-guided instruction tuning, text-attribute modality, and structural modality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms previous approaches, achieving top performance on the leaderboard of KDD Cup 2024. Our code has been publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03930v1,2024-12
A Survey on Large Language Model-Based Social Agents in Game-Theoretic Scenarios,"Xiachong Feng, Longxu Dou, Ella Li, Qinghao Wang, Haochuan Wang, Yu Guo, Chang Ma, Lingpeng Kong","Game-theoretic scenarios have become pivotal in evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Model (LLM)-based social agents. While numerous studies have explored these agents in such settings, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey summarizing the current progress. To address this gap, we systematically review existing research on LLM-based social agents within game-theoretic scenarios. Our survey organizes the findings into three core components: Game Framework, Social Agent, and Evaluation Protocol. The game framework encompasses diverse game scenarios, ranging from choice-focusing to communication-focusing games. The social agent part explores agents' preferences, beliefs, and reasoning abilities. The evaluation protocol covers both game-agnostic and game-specific metrics for assessing agent performance. By reflecting on the current research and identifying future research directions, this survey provides insights to advance the development and evaluation of social agents in game-theoretic scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03920v1,2024-12
MISR: Measuring Instrumental Self-Reasoning in Frontier Models,"Kai Fronsdal, David Lindner","We propose a suite of tasks to evaluate the instrumental self-reasoning ability of large language model (LLM) agents. Instrumental self-reasoning ability could improve adaptability and enable self-modification, but it could also pose significant risks, such as enabling deceptive alignment. Prior work has only evaluated self-reasoning in non-agentic settings or in limited domains. In this paper, we propose evaluations for instrumental self-reasoning ability in agentic tasks in a wide range of scenarios, including self-modification, knowledge seeking, and opaque self-reasoning. We evaluate agents built using state-of-the-art LLMs, including commercial and open source systems. We find that instrumental self-reasoning ability emerges only in the most capable frontier models and that it is highly context-dependent. No model passes the the most difficult versions of our evaluations, hence our evaluation can be used to measure increases in instrumental self-reasoning ability in future models. We open-source our evaluations at https://github.com/kaifronsdal/Self-Reasoning-Evals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03904v1,2024-12
Uniform Discretized Integrated Gradients: An effective attribution based method for explaining large language models,"Swarnava Sinha Roy, Ayan Kundu","Integrated Gradients is a well-known technique for explaining deep learning models. It calculates feature importance scores by employing a gradient based approach computing gradients of the model output with respect to input features and accumulating them along a linear path. While this works well for continuous features spaces, it may not be the most optimal way to deal with discrete spaces like word embeddings. For interpreting LLMs (Large Language Models), there exists a need for a non-linear path where intermediate points, whose gradients are to be computed, lie close to actual words in the embedding space. In this paper, we propose a method called Uniform Discretized Integrated Gradients (UDIG) based on a new interpolation strategy where we choose a favorable nonlinear path for computing attribution scores suitable for predictive language models. We evaluate our method on two types of NLP tasks- Sentiment Classification and Question Answering against three metrics viz Log odds, Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. For sentiment classification, we have used the SST2, IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes datasets for benchmarking and for Question Answering, we have used the fine-tuned BERT model on SQuAD dataset. Our approach outperforms the existing methods in almost all the metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03886v1,2024-12
AyutthayaAlpha: A Thai-Latin Script Transliteration Transformer,"Davor Lauc, Attapol Rutherford, Weerin Wongwarawipatr","This study introduces AyutthayaAlpha, an advanced transformer-based machine learning model designed for the transliteration of Thai proper names into Latin script. Our system achieves state-of-the-art performance with 82.32% first-token accuracy and 95.24% first-three-token accuracy, while maintaining a low character error rate of 0.0047. The complexity of Thai phonology, including tonal features and vowel length distinctions, presents significant challenges for accurate transliteration, which we address through a novel two-model approach: AyutthayaAlpha-Small, based on the ByT5 architecture, and AyutthayaAlpha-VerySmall, a computationally efficient variant that unexpectedly outperforms its larger counterpart. Our research combines linguistic rules with deep learning, training on a carefully curated dataset of 1.2 million Thai-Latin name pairs, augmented through strategic upsampling to 2.7 million examples. Extensive evaluations against existing transliteration methods and human expert benchmarks demonstrate that AyutthayaAlpha not only achieves superior accuracy but also effectively captures personal and cultural preferences in name romanization. The system's practical applications extend to cross-lingual information retrieval, international data standardization, and identity verification systems, with particular relevance for government databases, academic institutions, and global business operations. This work represents a significant advance in bridging linguistic gaps between Thai and Latin scripts, while respecting the cultural and personal dimensions of name transliteration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03877v1,2024-12
Automated LaTeX Code Generation from Handwritten Math Expressions Using Vision Transformer,"Jayaprakash Sundararaj, Akhil Vyas, Benjamin Gonzalez-Maldonado","Transforming mathematical expressions into LaTeX poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we examine the application of advanced transformer-based architectures to address the task of converting handwritten or digital mathematical expression images into corresponding LaTeX code. As a baseline, we utilize the current state-of-the-art CNN encoder and LSTM decoder. Additionally, we explore enhancements to the CNN-RNN architecture by replacing the CNN encoder with the pretrained ResNet50 model with modification to suite the grey scale input. Further, we experiment with vision transformer model and compare with Baseline and CNN-LSTM model. Our findings reveal that the vision transformer architectures outperform the baseline CNN-RNN framework, delivering higher overall accuracy and BLEU scores while achieving lower Levenshtein distances. Moreover, these results highlight the potential for further improvement through fine-tuning of model parameters. To encourage open research, we also provide the model implementation, enabling reproduction of our results and facilitating further research in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03853v2,2024-12
Educational-Psychological Dialogue Robot Based on Multi-Agent Collaboration,"Shiwen Ni, Min Yang","Intelligent dialogue systems are increasingly used in modern education and psychological counseling fields, but most existing systems are limited to a single domain, cannot deal with both educational and psychological issues, and often lack accuracy and professionalism when dealing with complex issues. To address these problems, this paper proposes an intelligent dialog system that combines educational and psychological counseling functions. The system consists of multiple AI agent, including security detection agent, intent identification agent, educational LLM agent, and psychological LLM agent, which work in concert to ensure the provision of accurate educational knowledge Q\&A and psychological support services. Specifically, the system recognizes user-input intentions through an intention classification model and invokes a retrieval-enhanced educational grand model and a psychological grand model fine-tuned with psychological data in order to provide professional educational advice and psychological support.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03847v1,2024-12
Beyond the Binary: Capturing Diverse Preferences With Reward Regularization,"Vishakh Padmakumar, Chuanyang Jin, Hannah Rose Kirk, He He","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed via public-facing interfaces to interact with millions of users, each with diverse preferences. Despite this, preference tuning of LLMs predominantly relies on reward models trained using binary judgments where annotators select the preferred choice out of pairs of model outputs. In this work, we argue that this reliance on binary choices does not capture the broader, aggregate preferences of the target user in real-world tasks. We propose a taxonomy that identifies two dimensions of subjectivity where different users disagree on the preferred output-namely, the Plurality of Responses to Prompts, where prompts allow for multiple correct answers, and the Indistinguishability of Responses, where candidate outputs are paraphrases of each other. We show that reward models correlate weakly with user preferences in these cases. As a first step to address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method that augments existing binary preference datasets with synthetic preference judgments to estimate potential user disagreement. Incorporating these via a margin term as a form of regularization during model training yields predictions that better align with the aggregate user preferences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03822v1,2024-12
Detecting Redundant Health Survey Questions Using Language-agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding (LaBSE),"Sunghoon Kang, Hyeoneui Kim, Hyewon Park, Ricky Taira","The goal of this work was to compute the semantic similarity among publicly available health survey questions in order to facilitate the standardization of survey-based Person-Generated Health Data (PGHD). We compiled various health survey questions authored in both English and Korean from the NIH CDE Repository, PROMIS, Korean public health agencies, and academic publications. Questions were drawn from various health lifelog domains. A randomized question pairing scheme was used to generate a Semantic Text Similarity (STS) dataset consisting of 1758 question pairs. Similarity scores between each question pair were assigned by two human experts. The tagged dataset was then used to build three classifiers featuring: Bag-of-Words, SBERT with BERT-based embeddings, and SBRET with LaBSE embeddings. The algorithms were evaluated using traditional contingency statistics. Among the three algorithms, SBERT-LaBSE demonstrated the highest performance in assessing question similarity across both languages, achieving an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall Curves of over 0.99. Additionally, it proved effective in identifying cross-lingual semantic similarities.The SBERT-LaBSE algorithm excelled at aligning semantically equivalent sentences across both languages but encountered challenges in capturing subtle nuances and maintaining computational efficiency. Future research should focus on testing with larger multilingual datasets and on calibrating and normalizing scores across the health lifelog domains to improve consistency. This study introduces the SBERT-LaBSE algorithm for calculating semantic similarity across two languages, showing it outperforms BERT-based models and the Bag of Words approach, highlighting its potential to improve semantic interoperability of survey-based PGHD across language barriers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03817v1,2024-12
Synergizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs: A Novel Approach to Software Repository-Related Question Answering,"Samuel Abedu, SayedHassan Khatoonabadi, Emad Shihab","Software repositories contain valuable information for gaining insights into their development process. However, extracting insights from these repository data is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. While software engineering chatbots have been developed to facilitate natural language interactions with repositories, they struggle with understanding natural language and accurately retrieving relevant data. This study aims to improve the accuracy of LLM-based chatbots in answering repository-related questions by augmenting them with knowledge graphs. We achieve this in a two-step approach; (1) constructing a knowledge graph from the repository data and (2) synergizing the knowledge graph with LLM to allow for the natural language questions and answers. We curated a set of 20 questions with different complexities and evaluated our approach on five popular open-source projects. Our approach achieved an accuracy of 65%. We further investigated the limitations and identified six key issues, with the majority relating to the reasoning capability of the LLM. We experimented with a few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to determine if it could enhance our approach. This technique improved the overall accuracy to 84%. Our findings demonstrate the synergy between LLMs and knowledge graphs as a viable solution for making repository data accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03815v1,2024-12
Agent AI with LangGraph: A Modular Framework for Enhancing Machine Translation Using Large Language Models,"Jialin Wang, Zhihua Duan","This paper explores the transformative role of Agent AI and LangGraph in advancing the automation and effectiveness of machine translation (MT). Agents are modular components designed to perform specific tasks, such as translating between particular languages, with specializations like TranslateEnAgent, TranslateFrenchAgent, and TranslateJpAgent for English, French, and Japanese translations, respectively. These agents leverage the powerful semantic capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, to ensure accurate, contextually relevant translations while maintaining modularity, scalability, and context retention.   LangGraph, a graph-based framework built on LangChain, simplifies the creation and management of these agents and their workflows. It supports dynamic state management, enabling agents to maintain dialogue context and automates complex workflows by linking agents and facilitating their collaboration. With flexibility, open-source community support, and seamless integration with LLMs, LangGraph empowers agents to deliver high-quality translations.   Together, Agent AI and LangGraph create a cohesive system where LangGraph orchestrates agent interactions, ensuring that user inputs are analyzed, routed, and processed efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of this system to enhance multilingual translation accuracy and scalability. By highlighting modular design and automated workflows, this paper sets the stage for further innovations in intelligent machine translation services.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03801v1,2024-12
The broader spectrum of in-context learning,"Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Aaditya K. Singh, Murray Shanahan","The ability of language models to learn a task from a few examples in context has generated substantial interest. Here, we provide a perspective that situates this type of supervised few-shot learning within a much broader spectrum of meta-learned in-context learning. Indeed, we suggest that any distribution of sequences in which context non-trivially decreases loss on subsequent predictions can be interpreted as eliciting a kind of in-context learning. We suggest that this perspective helps to unify the broad set of in-context abilities that language models exhibit $\unicode{x2014}$ such as adapting to tasks from instructions or role play, or extrapolating time series. This perspective also sheds light on potential roots of in-context learning in lower-level processing of linguistic dependencies (e.g. coreference or parallel structures). Finally, taking this perspective highlights the importance of generalization, which we suggest can be studied along several dimensions: not only the ability to learn something novel, but also flexibility in learning from different presentations, and in applying what is learned. We discuss broader connections to past literature in meta-learning and goal-conditioned agents, and other perspectives on learning and adaptation. We close by suggesting that research on in-context learning should consider this broader spectrum of in-context capabilities and types of generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03782v2,2024-12

We present WithdrarXiv, the first large-scale dataset of withdrawn papers from arXiv, containing over 14,000 papers and their associated retraction comments spanning the repository's entire history through September 2024. Through careful analysis of author comments, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of retraction reasons, identifying 10 distinct categories ranging from critical errors to policy violations. We demonstrate a simple yet highly accurate zero-shot automatic categorization of retraction reasons, achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.96. Additionally, we release WithdrarXiv-SciFy, an enriched version including scripts for parsed full-text PDFs, specifically designed to enable research in scientific feasibility studies, claim verification, and automated theorem proving.

Language Model Meets Prototypes: Towards Interpretable Text Classification Models through Prototypical Networks,Ximing Wen,"Pretrained transformer-based Language Models (LMs) are well-known for their ability to achieve significant improvement on NLP tasks, but their black-box nature, which leads to a lack of interpretability, has been a major concern. My dissertation focuses on developing intrinsically interpretable models when using LMs as encoders while maintaining their superior performance via prototypical networks. I initiated my research by investigating enhancements in performance for interpretable models of sarcasm detection. My proposed approach focuses on capturing sentiment incongruity to enhance accuracy while offering instance-based explanations for the classification decisions. Later, I developed a novel white-box multi-head graph attention-based prototype network designed to explain the decisions of text classification models without sacrificing the accuracy of the original black-box LMs. In addition, I am working on extending the attention-based prototype network with contrastive learning to redesign an interpretable graph neural network, aiming to enhance both the interpretability and performance of the model in document classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03761v1,2024-12

In this paper, we show that a hybrid approach combining a fine-tuned dense retriever with keyword based sparse search methods significantly enhances performance. Our system leverages a linear combination of relevance signals, including cosine similarity from dense retrieval, BM25 scores, and URL host matching, each with tunable boost parameters. Experimental results indicate that this hybrid method outperforms our single-retriever system, achieving improved accuracy while maintaining robust contextual grounding.

From Language Models over Tokens to Language Models over Characters,"Tim Vieira, Ben LeBrun, Mario Giulianelli, Juan Luis Gastaldi, Brian DuSell, John Terilla, Timothy J. O'Donnell, Ryan Cotterell","Modern language models are internally -- and mathematically -- distributions over token strings rather than \emph{character} strings, posing numerous challenges for programmers building user applications on top of them. For example, if a prompt is specified as a character string, it must be tokenized before passing it to the token-level language model. Thus, the tokenizer and consequent analyses are very sensitive to the specification of the prompt (e.g., if the prompt ends with a space or not). This paper presents algorithms for converting token-level language models to character-level ones. We present both exact and approximate algorithms. In the empirical portion of the paper, we benchmark the practical runtime and approximation quality. We find that -- even with a small computation budget -- our method is able to accurately approximate the character-level distribution (less than 0.00021 excess bits / character) at reasonably fast speeds (46.3 characters / second) on the Llama 3.1 8B language model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03719v1,2024-12
Scaling Inference-Time Search with Vision Value Model for Improved Visual Comprehension,"Xiyao Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Linjie Li, Hongjin Lu, Yuancheng Xu, Chung-Ching Lin, Kevin Lin, Furong Huang, Lijuan Wang","Despite significant advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), there lacks effective approaches to enhance response quality by scaling inference-time computation. This capability is known to be a core step towards the self-improving models in recent large language model studies. In this paper, we present Vision Value Model (VisVM) that can guide VLM inference-time search to generate responses with better visual comprehension. Specifically, VisVM not only evaluates the generated sentence quality in the current search step, but also anticipates the quality of subsequent sentences that may result from the current step, thus providing a long-term value. In this way, VisVM steers VLMs away from generating sentences prone to hallucinations or insufficient detail, thereby producing higher quality responses. Experimental results demonstrate that VisVM-guided search significantly enhances VLMs' ability to generate descriptive captions with richer visual details and fewer hallucinations, compared with greedy decoding and search methods with other visual reward signals. Furthermore, we find that self-training the model with the VisVM-guided captions improve VLM's performance across a wide range of multimodal benchmarks, indicating the potential for developing self-improving VLMs. Our value model and code are available at https://github.com/si0wang/VisVM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03704v2,2024-12
Acquired TASTE: Multimodal Stance Detection with Textual and Structural Embeddings,"Guy Barel, Oren Tsur, Dan Vilenchik","Stance detection plays a pivotal role in enabling an extensive range of downstream applications, from discourse parsing to tracing the spread of fake news and the denial of scientific facts. While most stance classification models rely on textual representation of the utterance in question, prior work has demonstrated the importance of the conversational context in stance detection. In this work we introduce TASTE -- a multimodal architecture for stance detection that harmoniously fuses Transformer-based content embedding with unsupervised structural embedding. Through the fine-tuning of a pretrained transformer and the amalgamation with social embedding via a Gated Residual Network (GRN) layer, our model adeptly captures the complex interplay between content and conversational structure in determining stance. TASTE achieves state-of-the-art results on common benchmarks, significantly outperforming an array of strong baselines. Comparative evaluations underscore the benefits of social grounding -- emphasizing the criticality of concurrently harnessing both content and structure for enhanced stance detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03681v3,2024-12
Evaluating Language Models as Synthetic Data Generators,"Seungone Kim, Juyoung Suk, Xiang Yue, Vijay Viswanathan, Seongyun Lee, Yizhong Wang, Kiril Gashteovski, Carolin Lawrence, Sean Welleck, Graham Neubig","Given the increasing use of synthetic data in language model (LM) post-training, an LM's ability to generate high-quality data has become nearly as crucial as its ability to solve problems directly. While prior works have focused on developing effective data generation methods, they lack systematic comparison of different LMs as data generators in a unified setting. To address this gap, we propose AgoraBench, a benchmark that provides standardized settings and metrics to evaluate LMs' data generation abilities. Through synthesizing 1.26 million training instances using 6 LMs and training 99 student models, we uncover key insights about LMs' data generation capabilities. First, we observe that LMs exhibit distinct strengths. For instance, GPT-4o excels at generating new problems, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs better at enhancing existing ones. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that an LM's data generation ability doesn't necessarily correlate with its problem-solving ability. Instead, multiple intrinsic features of data quality-including response quality, perplexity, and instruction difficulty-collectively serve as better indicators. Finally, we demonstrate that strategic choices in output format and cost-conscious model selection significantly impact data generation effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03679v1,2024-12
Personalizing Multimodal Large Language Models for Image Captioning: An Experimental Analysis,"Davide Bucciarelli, Nicholas Moratelli, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara","The task of image captioning demands an algorithm to generate natural language descriptions of visual inputs. Recent advancements have seen a convergence between image captioning research and the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs -- like GPT-4V and Gemini -- which extend the capabilities of text-only LLMs to multiple modalities. This paper investigates whether Multimodal LLMs can supplant traditional image captioning networks by evaluating their performance on various image description benchmarks. We explore both the zero-shot capabilities of these models and their adaptability to different semantic domains through fine-tuning methods, including prompt learning, prefix tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Our results demonstrate that while Multimodal LLMs achieve impressive zero-shot performance, fine-tuning for specific domains while maintaining their generalization capabilities intact remains challenging. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research in image captioning and the development of more adaptable Multimodal LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03665v1,2024-12
From Individual to Society: A Survey on Social Simulation Driven by Large Language Model-based Agents,"Xinyi Mou, Xuanwen Ding, Qi He, Liang Wang, Jingcong Liang, Xinnong Zhang, Libo Sun, Jiayu Lin, Jie Zhou, Xuanjing Huang, Zhongyu Wei","Traditional sociological research often relies on human participation, which, though effective, is expensive, challenging to scale, and with ethical concerns. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their potential to simulate human behavior, enabling the replication of individual responses and facilitating studies on many interdisciplinary studies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the recent progress in simulation driven by LLM-empowered agents. We categorize the simulations into three types: (1) Individual Simulation, which mimics specific individuals or demographic groups; (2) Scenario Simulation, where multiple agents collaborate to achieve goals within specific contexts; and (3) Society Simulation, which models interactions within agent societies to reflect the complexity and variety of real-world dynamics. These simulations follow a progression, ranging from detailed individual modeling to large-scale societal phenomena.

Best-of-N Jailbreaking,"John Hughes, Sara Price, Aengus Lynch, Rylan Schaeffer, Fazl Barez, Sanmi Koyejo, Henry Sleight, Erik Jones, Ethan Perez, Mrinank Sharma","We introduce Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking, a simple black-box algorithm that jailbreaks frontier AI systems across modalities. BoN Jailbreaking works by repeatedly sampling variations of a prompt with a combination of augmentations - such as random shuffling or capitalization for textual prompts - until a harmful response is elicited. We find that BoN Jailbreaking achieves high attack success rates (ASRs) on closed-source language models, such as 89% on GPT-4o and 78% on Claude 3.5 Sonnet when sampling 10,000 augmented prompts. Further, it is similarly effective at circumventing state-of-the-art open-source defenses like circuit breakers. BoN also seamlessly extends to other modalities: it jailbreaks vision language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and audio language models (ALMs) like Gemini 1.5 Pro, using modality-specific augmentations. BoN reliably improves when we sample more augmented prompts. Across all modalities, ASR, as a function of the number of samples (N), empirically follows power-law-like behavior for many orders of magnitude. BoN Jailbreaking can also be composed with other black-box algorithms for even more effective attacks - combining BoN with an optimized prefix attack achieves up to a 35% increase in ASR. Overall, our work indicates that, despite their capability, language models are sensitive to seemingly innocuous changes to inputs, which attackers can exploit across modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03556v2,2024-12
Prompting Large Language Models for Clinical Temporal Relation Extraction,"Jianping He, Laila Rasmy, Haifang Li, Jianfu Li, Zenan Sun, Evan Yu, Degui Zhi, Cui Tao","Objective: This paper aims to prompt large language models (LLMs) for clinical temporal relation extraction (CTRE) in both few-shot and fully supervised settings. Materials and Methods: This study utilizes four LLMs: Encoder-based GatorTron-Base (345M)/Large (8.9B); Decoder-based LLaMA3-8B/MeLLaMA-13B. We developed full (FFT) and parameter-efficient (PEFT) fine-tuning strategies and evaluated these strategies on the 2012 i2b2 CTRE task. We explored four fine-tuning strategies for GatorTron-Base: (1) Standard Fine-Tuning, (2) Hard-Prompting with Unfrozen LLMs, (3) Soft-Prompting with Frozen LLMs, and (4) Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with Frozen LLMs. For GatorTron-Large, we assessed two PEFT strategies-Soft-Prompting and LoRA with Frozen LLMs-leveraging Quantization techniques. Additionally, LLaMA3-8B and MeLLaMA-13B employed two PEFT strategies: LoRA strategy with Quantization (QLoRA) applied to Frozen LLMs using instruction tuning and standard fine-tuning. Results: Under fully supervised settings, Hard-Prompting with Unfrozen GatorTron-Base achieved the highest F1 score (89.54%), surpassing the SOTA model (85.70%) by 3.74%. Additionally, two variants of QLoRA adapted to GatorTron-Large and Standard Fine-Tuning of GatorTron-Base exceeded the SOTA model by 2.36%, 1.88%, and 0.25%, respectively. Decoder-based models with frozen parameters outperformed their Encoder-based counterparts in this setting; however, the trend reversed in few-shot scenarios. Discussions and Conclusions: This study presented new methods that significantly improved CTRE performance, benefiting downstream tasks reliant on CTRE systems. The findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate models and fine-tuning strategies based on task requirements and data availability. Future work will explore larger models and broader CTRE applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04512v1,2024-12
Evaluating Gender Bias Transfer between Pre-trained and Prompt-Adapted Language Models,"Natalie Mackraz, Nivedha Sivakumar, Samira Khorshidi, Krishna Patel, Barry-John Theobald, Luca Zappella, Nicholas Apostoloff","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adapted to achieve task-specificity for deployment in real-world decision systems. Several previous works have investigated the bias transfer hypothesis (BTH) by studying the effect of the fine-tuning adaptation strategy on model fairness to find that fairness in pre-trained masked language models have limited effect on the fairness of models when adapted using fine-tuning. In this work, we expand the study of BTH to causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an accessible, and compute-efficient way to deploy models in real-world systems. In contrast to previous works, we establish that intrinsic biases in pre-trained Mistral, Falcon and Llama models are strongly correlated (rho >= 0.94) with biases when the same models are zero- and few-shot prompted, using a pronoun co-reference resolution task. Further, we find that bias transfer remains strongly correlated even when LLMs are specifically prompted to exhibit fair or biased behavior (rho >= 0.92), and few-shot length and stereotypical composition are varied (rho >= 0.97). Our findings highlight the importance of ensuring fairness in pre-trained LLMs, especially when they are later used to perform downstream tasks via prompt adaptation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03537v1,2024-12

Enhancing CLIP Conceptual Embedding through Knowledge Distillation,Kuei-Chun Kao,"Recently, CLIP has become an important model for aligning images and text in multi-modal contexts. However, researchers have identified limitations in the ability of CLIP's text and image encoders to extract detailed knowledge from pairs of captions and images. In response, this paper presents Knowledge-CLIP, an innovative approach designed to improve CLIP's performance by integrating a new knowledge distillation (KD) method based on Llama 2. Our approach focuses on three key objectives: Text Embedding Distillation, Concept Learning, and Contrastive Learning. First, Text Embedding Distillation involves training the Knowledge-CLIP text encoder to mirror the teacher model, Llama 2. Next, Concept Learning assigns a soft concept label to each caption-image pair by employing offline K-means clustering on text data from Llama 2, enabling Knowledge-CLIP to learn from these soft concept labels. Lastly, Contrastive Learning aligns the text and image embeddings. Our experimental findings show that the proposed model improves the performance of both text and image encoders.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03513v2,2024-12

Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Based on BERT and ResNet,JiaLe Ren,"With the rapid development of the Internet and social media, multi-modal data (text and image) is increasingly important in sentiment analysis tasks. However, the existing methods are difficult to effectively fuse text and image features, which limits the accuracy of analysis. To solve this problem, a multimodal sentiment analysis framework combining BERT and ResNet was proposed. BERT has shown strong text representation ability in natural language processing, and ResNet has excellent image feature extraction performance in the field of computer vision. Firstly, BERT is used to extract the text feature vector, and ResNet is used to extract the image feature representation. Then, a variety of feature fusion strategies are explored, and finally the fusion model based on attention mechanism is selected to make full use of the complementary information between text and image. Experimental results on the public dataset MAVA-single show that compared with the single-modal models that only use BERT or ResNet, the proposed multi-modal model improves the accuracy and F1 score, reaching the best accuracy of 74.5%. This study not only provides new ideas and methods for multimodal sentiment analysis, but also demonstrates the application potential of BERT and ResNet in cross-domain fusion.

Ashley, Oleg Serikov, Dmitrii Khizbullin, Francesco Faccio, Jürgen Schmidhuber","Language-based agentic systems have shown great promise in recent years, transitioning from solving small-scale research problems to being deployed in challenging real-world tasks. However, optimizing these systems often requires substantial manual labor. Recent studies have demonstrated that these systems can be represented as computational graphs, enabling automatic optimization. Despite these advancements, most current efforts in Graph-based Agentic System Optimization (GASO) fail to properly assign feedback to the system's components given feedback on the system's output. To address this challenge, we formalize the concept of semantic backpropagation with semantic gradients -- a generalization that aligns several key optimization techniques, including reverse-mode automatic differentiation and the more recent TextGrad by exploiting the relationship among nodes with a common successor. This serves as a method for computing directional information about how changes to each component of an agentic system might improve the system's output. To use these gradients, we propose a method called semantic gradient descent which enables us to solve GASO effectively. Our results on both BIG-Bench Hard and GSM8K show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for solving GASO problems. A detailed ablation study on the LIAR dataset demonstrates the parsimonious nature of our method.

This study explores the untapped potential of Common Crawl as a comprehensive and flexible resource for pre-training LLMs, addressing both general-purpose language understanding and specialized domain knowledge. We introduce RedStone, an innovative and scalable pipeline engineered to extract and process data from Common Crawl, facilitating the creation of extensive and varied pre-training datasets. Unlike traditional datasets, which often require expensive curation and domain-specific expertise, RedStone leverages the breadth of Common Crawl to deliver datasets tailored to a wide array of domains. In this work, we exemplify its capability by constructing pre-training datasets across multiple fields, including general language understanding, code, mathematics, and question-answering tasks. The flexibility of RedStone allows for easy adaptation to other specialized domains, significantly lowering the barrier to creating valuable domain-specific datasets. Our findings demonstrate that Common Crawl, when harnessed through effective pipelines like RedStone, can serve as a rich, renewable source of pre-training data, unlocking new avenues for domain adaptation and knowledge discovery in LLMs. This work also underscores the importance of innovative data acquisition strategies and highlights the role of web-scale data as a powerful resource in the continued evolution of LLMs. RedStone code and data samples will be publicly available at \url{https://aka.ms/redstone}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03398v1,2024-12

Improving Linguistic Diversity of Large Language Models with Possibility Exploration Fine-Tuning,"Long Mai, Julie Carson-Berndsen","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in replicating human-like abilities, there are concerns about a reduction in the linguistic diversity of their outputs. This results in the homogenization of viewpoints and perspectives, as well as the underrepresentation of specific demographic groups. Although several fine-tuning and prompting techniques have been suggested to tackle the issue, they are often tailored to specific tasks or come with a substantial increase in computational cost and latency. This makes them challenging to apply to applications that demand very low latency, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. We propose Possibility Exploration Fine-Tuning (PEFT), a task-agnostic framework that enhances the text diversity of LLMs without increasing latency or computational cost. Given the same prompt, models fine-tuned with PEFT can simultaneously generate multiple diverse responses, each corresponding with a controllable possibility number. Experiments on dialogue and story generation tasks demonstrate that PEFT significantly enhances the diversity of LLM outputs, as evidenced by lower similarity between candidate responses. Since PEFT emphasizes semantic diversity over lexical diversity, it can also notably reduce demographic bias in dialogue systems. The implementations and datasets are available in our repository: https://github.com/mailong25/peft_diversity",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03343v1,2024-12

LuxEmbedder: A Cross-Lingual Approach to Enhanced Luxembourgish Sentence Embeddings,"Fred Philippy, Siwen Guo, Jacques Klein, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé","Sentence embedding models play a key role in various Natural Language Processing tasks, such as in Topic Modeling, Document Clustering and Recommendation Systems. However, these models rely heavily on parallel data, which can be scarce for many low-resource languages, including Luxembourgish. This scarcity results in suboptimal performance of monolingual and cross-lingual sentence embedding models for these languages. To address this issue, we compile a relatively small but high-quality human-generated cross-lingual parallel dataset to train LuxEmbedder, an enhanced sentence embedding model for Luxembourgish with strong cross-lingual capabilities. Additionally, we present evidence suggesting that including low-resource languages in parallel training datasets can be more advantageous for other low-resource languages than relying solely on high-resource language pairs. Furthermore, recognizing the lack of sentence embedding benchmarks for low-resource languages, we create a paraphrase detection benchmark specifically for Luxembourgish, aiming to partially fill this gap and promote further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03331v2,2024-12
Grounded Language Design for Lightweight Diagramming for Formal Methods,"Siddhartha Prasad, Ben Greenman, Tim Nelson, Shriram Krishnamurthi","Model finding, as embodied by SAT solvers and similar tools, is used widely, both in embedding settings and as a tool in its own right. For instance, tools like Alloy target SAT to enable users to incrementally define, explore, verify, and diagnose sophisticated specifications for a large number of complex systems.   These tools critically include a visualizer that lets users graphically explore these generated models. As we show, however, default visualizers, which know nothing about the domain, are unhelpful and even actively violate presentational and cognitive principles. At the other extreme, full-blown visualizations require significant effort as well as knowledge a specifier might not possess; they can also exhibit bad failure modes (including silent failure). Instead, we need a language to capture essential domain information for lightweight diagramming. We ground our language design in both the cognitive science literature on diagrams and on a large number of example custom visualizations. This identifies the key elements of lightweight diagrams. We distill these into a small set of orthogonal primitives. We extend an Alloy-like tool to support these primitives. We evaluate the effectiveness of the produced diagrams, finding them good for reasoning. We then compare this against many other drawing languages and tools to show that this work defines a new niche that is lightweight, effective, and driven by sound principles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03310v1,2024-12

To this end, we gathered experimental data enabling us to study variations across users (N=70) for the same task. We performed a multidimensional analysis and propose a 5 classes typology based on the individual behaviours during the processing of a complex search task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03309v1,2024-12
Global MMLU: Understanding and Addressing Cultural and Linguistic Biases in Multilingual Evaluation,"Shivalika Singh, Angelika Romanou, Clémentine Fourrier, David I.

T. Martins, Leshem Choshen, Daphne Ippolito, Enzo Ferrante, Marzieh Fadaee, Beyza Ermis, Sara Hooker","Cultural biases in multilingual datasets pose significant challenges for their effectiveness as global benchmarks. These biases stem not only from language but also from the cultural knowledge required to interpret questions, reducing the practical utility of translated datasets like MMLU. Furthermore, translation often introduces artifacts that can distort the meaning or clarity of questions in the target language. A common practice in multilingual evaluation is to rely on machine-translated evaluation sets, but simply translating a dataset is insufficient to address these challenges. In this work, we trace the impact of both of these issues on multilingual evaluations and ensuing model performances. Our large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art open and proprietary models illustrates that progress on MMLU depends heavily on learning Western-centric concepts, with 28% of all questions requiring culturally sensitive knowledge. Moreover, for questions requiring geographic knowledge, an astounding 84.9% focus on either North American or European regions. Rankings of model evaluations change depending on whether they are evaluated on the full portion or the subset of questions annotated as culturally sensitive, showing the distortion to model rankings when blindly relying on translated MMLU. We release Global-MMLU, an improved MMLU with evaluation coverage across 42 languages -- with improved overall quality by engaging with compensated professional and community annotators to verify translation quality while also rigorously evaluating cultural biases present in the original dataset. This comprehensive Global-MMLU set also includes designated subsets labeled as culturally sensitive and culturally agnostic to allow for more holistic, complete evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03304v1,2024-12
AntLM: Bridging Causal and Masked Language Models,"Xinru Yu, Bin Guo, Shiwei Luo, Jie Wang, Tao Ji, Yuanbin Wu","Causal Language Modeling (CLM) and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) are two mainstream learning paradigms based on Transformer networks, specifically the Decoder-only and Encoder-only architectures. The strengths of each paradigm in downstream tasks have shown a mix of advantages and disadvantages. In the past BabyLM Challenge 2023, although the MLM paradigm achieved the best average performance, the CLM paradigm demonstrated significantly faster convergence rates. For the BabyLM Challenge 2024, we propose a novel language modeling paradigm named $\textbf{AntLM}$, which integrates both CLM and MLM to leverage the advantages of these two classic paradigms. We chose the strict-small track and conducted experiments on two foundation models: BabyLlama, representing CLM, and LTG-BERT, representing MLM. During the training process for specific foundation models, we alternate between applying CLM or MLM training objectives and causal or bidirectional attention masks. Experimental results show that combining the two pretraining objectives leverages their strengths, enhancing overall training performance.

Intent-driven In-context Learning for Few-shot Dialogue State Tracking,"Zihao Yi, Zhe Xu, Ying Shen","Dialogue state tracking (DST) plays an essential role in task-oriented dialogue systems. However, user's input may contain implicit information, posing significant challenges for DST tasks. Additionally, DST data includes complex information, which not only contains a large amount of noise unrelated to the current turn, but also makes constructing DST datasets expensive. To address these challenges, we introduce Intent-driven In-context Learning for Few-shot DST (IDIC-DST). By extracting user's intent, we propose an Intent-driven Dialogue Information Augmentation module to augment the dialogue information, which can track dialogue states more effectively. Moreover, we mask noisy information from DST data and rewrite user's input in the Intent-driven Examples Retrieval module, where we retrieve similar examples. We then utilize a pre-trained large language model to update the dialogue state using the augmented dialogue information and examples. Experimental results demonstrate that IDIC-DST achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot settings on MultiWOZ 2.1 and MultiWOZ 2.4 datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03270v1,2024-12
Alignment at Pre-training! Towards Native Alignment for Arabic LLMs,"Juhao Liang, Zhenyang Cai, Jianqing Zhu, Huang Huang, Kewei Zong, Bang An, Mosen Alharthi, Juncai He, Lian Zhang, Haizhou Li, Benyou Wang, Jinchao Xu","The alignment of large language models (LLMs) is critical for developing effective and safe language models. Traditional approaches focus on aligning models during the instruction tuning or reinforcement learning stages, referred to in this paper as `post alignment'. We argue that alignment during the pre-training phase, which we term `native alignment', warrants investigation. Native alignment aims to prevent unaligned content from the beginning, rather than relying on post-hoc processing. This approach leverages extensively aligned pre-training data to enhance the effectiveness and usability of pre-trained models. Our study specifically explores the application of native alignment in the context of Arabic LLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments and ablation studies to evaluate the impact of native alignment on model performance and alignment stability. Additionally, we release open-source Arabic LLMs that demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, providing significant benefits to the Arabic LLM community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03253v1,2024-12
AIM: Adaptive Inference of Multi-Modal LLMs via Token Merging and Pruning,"Yiwu Zhong, Zhuoming Liu, Yin Li, Liwei Wang","Large language models (LLMs) have enabled the creation of multi-modal LLMs that exhibit strong comprehension of visual data such as images and videos. However, these models usually rely on extensive visual tokens from visual encoders, leading to high computational demands, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments and for long-context tasks. In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that, our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a $\textbf{7-fold}$ reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, under a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., $\textbf{+4.6}$ on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code will be available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/AIM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03248v1,2024-12
Benchmarking terminology building capabilities of ChatGPT on an English-Russian Fashion Corpus,"Anastasiia Bezobrazova, Miriam Seghiri, Constantin Orasan","This paper compares the accuracy of the terms extracted using SketchEngine, TBXTools and ChatGPT. In addition, it evaluates the quality of the definitions produced by ChatGPT for these terms. The research is carried out on a comparable corpus of fashion magazines written in English and Russian collected from the web. A gold standard for the fashion terminology was also developed by identifying web pages that can be harvested automatically and contain definitions of terms from the fashion domain in English and Russian. This gold standard was used to evaluate the quality of the extracted terms and of the definitions produced. Our evaluation shows that TBXTools and SketchEngine, while capable of high recall, suffer from reduced precision as the number of terms increases, which affects their overall performance. Conversely, ChatGPT demonstrates superior performance, maintaining or improving precision as more terms are considered. Analysis of the definitions produced by ChatGPT for 60 commonly used terms in English and Russian shows that ChatGPT maintains a reasonable level of accuracy and fidelity across languages, but sometimes the definitions in both languages miss crucial specifics and include unnecessary deviations. Our research reveals that no single tool excels universally; each has strengths suited to particular aspects of terminology extraction and application.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03242v1,2024-12
Does Safety Training of LLMs Generalize to Semantically Related Natural Prompts?,"Sravanti Addepalli, Yerram Varun, Arun Suggala, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Prateek Jain","Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be susceptible to crafted adversarial attacks or jailbreaks that lead to the generation of objectionable content despite being aligned to human preferences using safety fine-tuning methods. While the large dimensionality of input token space makes it inevitable to find adversarial prompts that can jailbreak these models, we aim to evaluate whether safety fine-tuned LLMs are safe against natural prompts which are semantically related to toxic seed prompts that elicit safe responses after alignment. We surprisingly find that popular aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 can be compromised using naive prompts that are NOT even crafted with an objective of jailbreaking the model. Furthermore, we empirically show that given a seed prompt that elicits a toxic response from an unaligned model, one can systematically generate several semantically related natural prompts that can jailbreak aligned LLMs. Towards this, we propose a method of Response Guided Question Augmentation (ReG-QA) to evaluate the generalization of safety aligned LLMs to natural prompts, that first generates several toxic answers given a seed question using an unaligned LLM (Q to A), and further leverages an LLM to generate questions that are likely to produce these answers (A to Q). We interestingly find that safety fine-tuned LLMs such as GPT-4o are vulnerable to producing natural jailbreak questions from unsafe content (without denial) and can thus be used for the latter (A to Q) step. We obtain attack success rates that are comparable to/ better than leading adversarial attack methods on the JailbreakBench leaderboard, while being significantly more stable against defenses such as Smooth-LLM and Synonym Substitution, which are effective against existing all attacks on the leaderboard.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03235v1,2024-12

Additionally, the inclusion of visual elements in tasks remains largely under-explored.   To address these gaps, we introduce U-MATH, a novel benchmark of 1,100 unpublished open-ended university-level problems sourced from teaching materials. It is balanced across six core subjects, with 20% of multimodal problems. Given the open-ended nature of U-MATH problems, we employ an LLM to judge the correctness of generated solutions. To this end, we release $\mu$-MATH, a dataset to evaluate the LLMs' capabilities in judging solutions.   The evaluation of general domain, math-specific, and multimodal LLMs highlights the challenges presented by U-MATH. Our findings reveal that LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of only 63% on text-based tasks, with even lower 45% on visual problems. The solution assessment proves challenging for LLMs, with the best LLM judge having an F1-score of 80% on $\mu$-MATH.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03205v2,2024-12
Weighted-Reward Preference Optimization for Implicit Model Fusion,"Ziyi Yang, Fanqi Wan, Longguang Zhong, Tianyuan Shi, Xiaojun Quan","While fusing heterogeneous open-source LLMs with varying architectures and sizes can potentially integrate the strengths of different models, existing fusion methods face significant challenges, such as vocabulary alignment and merging distribution matrices. These procedures are not only complex but also prone to introducing noise and errors. In this paper, we propose an implicit fusion method, Weighted-Reward Preference Optimization (WRPO), which leverages preference optimization between the source LLMs and the target LLM to transfer their capabilities effectively. WRPO eliminates the need for vocabulary alignment and matrix fusion and can be efficiently scaled to accommodate various LLMs. To address distributional deviations between the source and target LLMs, WRPO introduces a progressive adaptation strategy that gradually shifts reliance on preferred examples from the target LLM to the source LLMs. Extensive experiments on the MT-Bench, AlpacaEval-2, and Arena-Hard benchmarks demonstrate that WRPO consistently outperforms existing knowledge fusion methods and various fine-tuning baselines. When applied to LLaMA3-8B-Instruct as the target model, WRPO achieves a length-controlled win rate of 55.9% against GPT-4-Preview-1106 on AlpacaEval-2 and a win rate of 46.2% against GPT-4-0314 on Arena-Hard.

Byte BPE Tokenization as an Inverse string Homomorphism,"Saibo Geng, Sankalp Gambhir, Chris Wendler, Robert West","Tokenization is an important preprocessing step in the training and inference of large language models (LLMs). While there has been extensive research on the expressive power of the neural achitectures used in LLMs, the impact of tokenization has not been well understood. In this work, we demonstrate that tokenization, irrespective of the algorithm used, acts as an inverse homomorphism between strings and tokens. This suggests that the character space of the source language and the token space of the tokenized language are homomorphic, preserving the structural properties of the source language. Additionally, we explore the concept of proper tokenization, which refers to an unambiguous tokenization returned from the tokenizer.

Multi-Level Correlation Network For Few-Shot Image Classification,"Yunkai Dang, Min Zhang, Zhengyu Chen, Xinliang Zhang, Zheng Wang, Meijun Sun, Donglin Wang","Few-shot image classification(FSIC) aims to recognize novel classes given few labeled images from base classes. Recent works have achieved promising classification performance, especially for metric-learning methods, where a measure at only image feature level is usually used. In this paper, we argue that measure at such a level may not be effective enough to generalize from base to novel classes when using only a few images. Instead, a multi-level descriptor of an image is taken for consideration in this paper. We propose a multi-level correlation network (MLCN) for FSIC to tackle this problem by effectively capturing local information. Concretely, we present the self-correlation module and cross-correlation module to learn the semantic correspondence relation of local information based on learned representations. Moreover, we propose a pattern-correlation module to capture the pattern of fine-grained images and find relevant structural patterns between base classes and novel classes. Extensive experiments and analysis show the effectiveness of our proposed method on four widely-used FSIC benchmarks.

Fine-Grained Behavior Simulation with Role-Playing Large Language Model on Social Media,"Kun Li, Chenwei Dai, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in role-playing tasks. However, there is limited research on whether LLMs can accurately simulate user behavior in real-world scenarios, such as social media. This requires models to effectively analyze a user's history and simulate their role. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{FineRob}, a novel fine-grained behavior simulation dataset. We collect the complete behavioral history of 1,866 distinct users across three social media platforms. Each behavior is decomposed into three fine-grained elements: object, type, and content, resulting in 78.6k QA records. Based on FineRob, we identify two dominant reasoning patterns in LLMs' behavior simulation processes and propose the \textbf{OM-CoT} fine-tuning method to enhance the capability. Through comprehensive experiments, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key factors of behavior simulation and also demonstrate the effectiveness of OM-CoT approach\footnote{Code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/linkseed18612254945/FineRob}}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03148v1,2024-12
A surprisal oracle for when every layer counts,"Xudong Hong, Sharid Loáiciga, Asad Sayeed","Active Curriculum Language Modeling (ACLM; Hong et al., 2023) is a learner directed approach to training a language model.

ACLM involves an iteratively- and dynamically-constructed curriculum informed over the training process by a model of uncertainty; other training items that are similarly uncertain to a least certain candidate item are prioritized. Our new process improves the similarity model so that it is more dynamic, and we run ACLM over the most successful model from the BabyLM 2023 task: ELC-BERT (Charpentier and Samuel, 2023).

TOOL-ED: Enhancing Empathetic Response Generation with the Tool Calling Capability of LLM,"Huiying Cao, Yiqun Zhang, Shi Feng, Xiaocui Yang, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang","Empathetic conversation is a crucial characteristic in daily conversations between individuals. Nowadays, Large Language models (LLMs) have shown outstanding performance in generating empathetic responses. Knowledge bases like COMET can assist LLMs in mitigating illusions and enhancing the understanding of users' intentions and emotions. However, models remain heavily reliant on fixed knowledge bases and unrestricted incorporation of external knowledge can introduce noise. Tool learning is a flexible end-to-end approach that assists LLMs in handling complex problems. In this paper, we propose Emotional Knowledge Tool Calling (EKTC) framework, which encapsulates the commonsense knowledge bases as empathetic tools, enabling LLMs to integrate external knowledge flexibly through tool calling. In order to adapt the models to the new task, we construct a novel dataset TOOL-ED based on the EMPATHETICMPATHETIC DIALOGUE (ED) dataset.

Revolve: Optimizing AI Systems by Tracking Response Evolution in Textual Optimization,"Peiyan Zhang, Haibo Jin, Leyang Hu, Xinnuo Li, Liying Kang, Man Luo, Yangqiu Song, Haohan Wang","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of LLM-based systems to perform complex tasks through natural language processing and tool interaction. However, optimizing these LLM-based systems for specific tasks remains challenging, often requiring manual interventions like prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Existing automatic optimization methods, such as textual feedback-based techniques (e.g., TextGrad), tend to focus on immediate feedback, analogous to using immediate derivatives in traditional numerical gradient descent. However, relying solely on such feedback can be limited when the adjustments made in response to this feedback are either too small or fluctuate irregularly, potentially slowing down or even stalling the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, more adaptive methods are needed, especially in situations where the system's response is evolving slowly or unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce REVOLVE, an optimization method that tracks how ""R""esponses ""EVOLVE"" across iterations in LLM systems. By focusing on the evolution of responses over time, REVOLVE enables more stable and effective optimization by making thoughtful, progressive adjustments at each step. Experimental results demonstrate that REVOLVE outperforms competitive baselines, achieving a 7.8% improvement in prompt optimization, a 20.72% gain in solution refinement, and a 29.17% increase in code optimization. Additionally, REVOLVE converges in fewer iterations, resulting in significant computational savings. These advantages highlight its adaptability and efficiency, positioning REVOLVE as a valuable tool for optimizing LLM-based systems and accelerating the development of next-generation AI technologies.

Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting Improves LLM Performance on Sarcasm Detection,"Joshua Lee, Wyatt Fong, Alexander Le, Sur Shah, Kevin Han, Kevin Zhu","Sarcasm detection is a significant challenge in sentiment analysis due to the nuanced and context-dependent nature of verbiage. We introduce Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP) to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sarcasm detection, which leverages principles from pragmatics and reflection helping LLMs interpret implied meanings, consider contextual cues, and reflect on discrepancies to identify sarcasm. Using state-of-the-art LLMs such as LLaMA-3-8B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, PMP achieves state-of-the-art performance on GPT-4o on MUStARD and SemEval2018. This study demonstrates that integrating pragmatic reasoning and metacognitive strategies into prompting significantly enhances LLMs' ability to detect sarcasm, offering a promising direction for future research in sentiment analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04509v1,2024-12
ASR-EC Benchmark: Evaluating Large Language Models on Chinese ASR Error Correction,"Victor Junqiu Wei, Weicheng Wang, Di Jiang, Yuanfeng Song, Lu Wang","Automatic speech Recognition (ASR) is a fundamental and important task in the field of speech and natural language processing. It is an inherent building block in many applications such as voice assistant, speech translation, etc. Despite the advancement of ASR technologies in recent years, it is still inevitable for modern ASR systems to have a substantial number of erroneous recognition due to environmental noise, ambiguity, etc. Therefore, the error correction in ASR is crucial.   Motivated by this, this paper studies ASR error correction in the Chinese language, which is one of the most popular languages and enjoys a large number of users in the world. We first create a benchmark dataset named \emph{ASR-EC} that contains a wide spectrum of ASR errors generated by industry-grade ASR systems. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first Chinese ASR error correction benchmark. Then, inspired by the recent advances in \emph{large language models (LLMs)}, we investigate how to harness the power of LLMs to correct ASR errors. We apply LLMs to ASR error correction in three paradigms. The first paradigm is prompting, which is further categorized as zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-step. The second paradigm is finetuning, which finetunes LLMs with ASR error correction data. The third paradigm is multi-modal augmentation, which collectively utilizes the audio and ASR transcripts for error correction. Extensive experiments reveal that prompting is not effective for ASR error correction. Finetuning is effective only for a portion of LLMs. Multi-modal augmentation is the most effective method for error correction and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03075v1,2024-12
Analytic Study of Text-Free Speech Synthesis for Raw Audio using a Self-Supervised Learning Model,"Joonyong Park, Daisuke Saito, Nobuaki Minematsu","We examine the text-free speech representations of raw audio obtained from a self-supervised learning (SSL) model by analyzing the synthesized speech using the SSL representations instead of conventional text representations. Since raw audio does not have paired speech representations as transcribed texts do, obtaining speech representations from unpaired speech is crucial for augmenting available datasets for speech synthesis. Specifically, the proposed speech synthesis is conducted using discrete symbol representations from the SSL model in comparison with text representations, and analytical examinations of the synthesized speech have been carried out. The results empirically show that using text representations is advantageous for preserving semantic information, while using discrete symbol representations is superior for preserving acoustic content, including prosodic and intonational information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03074v1,2024-12
CBEval: A framework for evaluating and interpreting cognitive biases in LLMs,"Ammar Shaikh, Raj Abhijit Dandekar, Sreedath Panat, Rajat Dandekar","Rapid advancements in Large Language models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities. Despite improved performance on benchmarks, LLMs exhibit notable gaps in their cognitive processes. Additionally, as reflections of human-generated data, these models have the potential to inherit cognitive biases, raising concerns about their reasoning and decision making capabilities. In this paper we present a framework to interpret, understand and provide insights into a host of cognitive biases in LLMs. Conducting our research on frontier language models we're able to elucidate reasoning limitations and biases, and provide reasoning behind these biases by constructing influence graphs that identify phrases and words most responsible for biases manifested in LLMs. We further investigate biases such as round number bias and cognitive bias barrier revealed when noting framing effect in language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03605v1,2024-12
Human Variability vs. Machine Consistency: A Linguistic Analysis of Texts Generated by Humans and Large Language Models,"Sergio E. Zanotto, Segun Aroyehun","The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. Recent research has predominantly focused on using LLMs to classify text as either human-written or machine-generated. In our study, we adopt a different approach by profiling texts spanning four domains based on 250 distinct linguistic features. We select the M4 dataset from the Subtask B of SemEval 2024 Task 8. We automatically calculate various linguistic features with the LFTK tool and additionally measure the average syntactic depth, semantic similarity, and emotional content for each document. We then apply a two-dimensional PCA reduction to all the calculated features. Our analyses reveal significant differences between human-written texts and those generated by LLMs, particularly in the variability of these features, which we find to be considerably higher in human-written texts. This discrepancy is especially evident in text genres with less rigid linguistic style constraints. Our findings indicate that humans write texts that are less cognitively demanding, with higher semantic content, and richer emotional content compared to texts generated by LLMs. These insights underscore the need for incorporating meaningful linguistic features to enhance the understanding of textual outputs of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03025v1,2024-12
"Advancing Conversational Psychotherapy: Integrating Privacy, Dual-Memory, and Domain Expertise with Large Language Models","XiuYu Zhang, Zening Luo","Mental health has increasingly become a global issue that reveals the limitations of traditional conversational psychotherapy, constrained by location, time, expense, and privacy concerns. In response to these challenges, we introduce SoulSpeak, a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled chatbot designed to democratize access to psychotherapy. SoulSpeak improves upon the capabilities of standard LLM-enabled chatbots by incorporating a novel dual-memory component that combines short-term and long-term context via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer personalized responses while ensuring the preservation of user privacy and intimacy through a dedicated privacy module. In addition, it leverages a counseling chat dataset of therapist-client interactions and various prompting techniques to align the generated responses with psychotherapeutic methods. We introduce two fine-tuned BERT models to evaluate the system against existing LLMs and human therapists: the Conversational Psychotherapy Preference Model (CPPM) to simulate human preference among responses and another to assess response relevance to user input. CPPM is useful for training and evaluating psychotherapy-focused language models independent from SoulSpeak, helping with the constrained resources available for psychotherapy. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the dual-memory component and the robustness of the privacy module are also examined. Our findings highlight the potential and challenge of enhancing mental health care by offering an alternative that combines the expertise of traditional therapy with the advantages of LLMs, providing a promising way to address the accessibility and personalization gap in current mental health services.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02987v1,2024-12
"Surveying the Effects of Quality, Diversity, and Complexity in Synthetic Data From Large Language Models","Alex Havrilla, Andrew Dai, Laura O'Mahony, Koen Oostermeijer, Vera Zisler, Alon Albalak, Fabrizio Milo, Sharath Chandra Raparthy, Kanishk Gandhi, Baber Abbasi, Duy Phung, Maia Iyer, Dakota Mahan, Chase Blagden, Srishti Gureja, Mohammed Hamdy, Wen-Ding Li, Giovanni Paolini, Pawan Sasanka Ammanamanchi, Elliot Meyerson","Synthetic data generation with Large Language Models is a promising paradigm for augmenting natural data over a nearly infinite range of tasks. Given this variety, direct comparisons among synthetic data generation algorithms are scarce, making it difficult to understand where improvement comes from and what bottlenecks exist. We propose to evaluate algorithms via the makeup of synthetic data generated by each algorithm in terms of data quality, diversity, and complexity. We choose these three characteristics for their significance in open-ended processes and the impact each has on the capabilities of downstream models. We find quality to be essential for in-distribution model generalization, diversity to be essential for out-of-distribution generalization, and complexity to be beneficial for both. Further, we emphasize the existence of Quality-Diversity trade-offs in training data and the downstream effects on model performance. We then examine the effect of various components in the synthetic data pipeline on each data characteristic. This examination allows us to taxonomize and compare synthetic data generation algorithms through the components they utilize and the resulting effects on data QDC composition. This analysis extends into a discussion on the importance of balancing QDC in synthetic data for efficient reinforcement learning and self-improvement algorithms. Analogous to the QD trade-offs in training data, often there exist trade-offs between model output quality and output diversity which impact the composition of synthetic data. We observe that many models are currently evaluated and optimized only for output quality, thereby limiting output diversity and the potential for self-improvement. We argue that balancing these trade-offs is essential to the development of future self-improvement algorithms and highlight a number of works making progress in this direction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02980v2,2024-12
Curriculum-style Data Augmentation for LLM-based Metaphor Detection,"Kaidi Jia, Yanxia Wu, Rongsheng Li","Recently, utilizing large language models (LLMs) for metaphor detection has achieved promising results. However, these methods heavily rely on the capabilities of closed-source LLMs, which come with relatively high inference costs and latency. To address this, we propose a method for metaphor detection by fine-tuning open-source LLMs, effectively reducing inference costs and latency with a single inference step. Furthermore, metaphor detection suffers from a severe data scarcity problem, which hinders effective fine-tuning of LLMs. To tackle this, we introduce Curriculum-style Data Augmentation (CDA). Specifically, before fine-tuning, we evaluate the training data to identify correctly predicted instances for fine-tuning, while incorrectly predicted instances are used as seed data for data augmentation. This approach enables the model to quickly learn simpler knowledge and progressively acquire more complex knowledge, thereby improving performance incrementally. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all baselines. Additionally, we provide detailed ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of CDA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02956v1,2024-12
Dynamic Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Network for Multi-modal Emotion Recognition in Conversation,"Yuntao Shou, Tao Meng, Wei Ai, Keqin Li","Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) refers to identifying and classifying human emotional states by combining data from multiple different modalities (e.g., audio, images, text, video, etc.). Most existing multimodal emotion recognition methods use GCN to improve performance, but existing GCN methods are prone to overfitting and cannot capture the temporal dependency of the speaker's emotions. To address the above problems, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation Network (DGODE) for MERC, which combines the dynamic changes of emotions to capture the temporal dependency of speakers' emotions, and effectively alleviates the overfitting problem of GCNs. Technically, the key idea of DGODE is to utilize an adaptive mixhop mechanism to improve the generalization ability of GCNs and use the graph ODE evolution network to characterize the continuous dynamics of node representations over time and capture temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on two publicly available multimodal emotion recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed DGODE model has superior performance compared to various baselines. Furthermore, the proposed DGODE can also alleviate the over-smoothing problem, thereby enabling the construction of a deep GCN network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02935v1,2024-12
Single-Cell Omics Arena: A Benchmark Study for Large Language Models on Cell Type Annotation Using Single-Cell Data,"Junhao Liu, Siwei Xu, Lei Zhang, Jing Zhang","Over the past decade, the revolution in single-cell sequencing has enabled the simultaneous molecular profiling of various modalities across thousands of individual cells, allowing scientists to investigate the diverse functions of complex tissues and uncover underlying disease mechanisms. Among all the analytical steps, assigning individual cells to specific types is fundamental for understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, this process is usually labor-intensive and requires extensive expert knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to efficiently process and synthesize vast corpora of text to automatically extract essential biological knowledge, such as marker genes, potentially promoting more efficient and automated cell type annotations. To thoroughly evaluate the capability of modern instruction-tuned LLMs in automating the cell type identification process, we introduce SOAR, a comprehensive benchmarking study of LLMs for cell type annotation tasks in single-cell genomics. Specifically, we assess the performance of 8 instruction-tuned LLMs across 11 datasets, spanning multiple cell types and species. Our study explores the potential of LLMs to accurately classify and annotate cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, while extending their application to multiomics data through cross-modality translation. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques in generating detailed biological insights during the annotation process. The results demonstrate that LLMs can provide robust interpretations of single-cell data without requiring additional fine-tuning, advancing the automation of cell type annotation in genomics research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02915v1,2024-12
Does Few-Shot Learning Help LLM Performance in Code Synthesis?,"Derek Xu, Tong Xie, Botao Xia, Haoyu Li, Yunsheng Bai, Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang","Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides at code generation through improved model design, training, and chain-of-thought. However, prompt-level optimizations remain an important yet under-explored aspect of LLMs for coding. This work focuses on the few-shot examples present in most code generation prompts, offering a systematic study on whether few-shot examples improve LLM's coding capabilities, which few-shot examples have the largest impact, and how to select impactful examples. Our work offers 2 approaches for selecting few-shot examples, a model-free method, CODEEXEMPLAR-FREE, and a model-based method, CODEEXEMPLAR-BASED. The 2 methods offer a trade-off between improved performance and reliance on training data and interpretability. Both methods significantly improve CodeLlama's coding ability across the popular HumanEval+ coding benchmark. In summary, our work provides valuable insights into how to pick few-shot examples in code generation prompts to improve LLM code generation capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02906v1,2024-12
Enhancing Trust in Large Language Models with Uncertainty-Aware Fine-Tuning,"Ranganath Krishnan, Piyush Khanna, Omesh Tickoo","Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing with their impressive reasoning and question-answering capabilities. However, these models are sometimes prone to generating credible-sounding but incorrect information, a phenomenon known as LLM hallucinations. Reliable uncertainty estimation in LLMs is essential for fostering trust in their generated responses and serves as a critical tool for the detection and prevention of erroneous or hallucinated outputs. To achieve reliable and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification in open-ended and free-form natural language generation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fine-tuning approach for LLMs. This approach enhances the model's ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates without compromising accuracy, thereby guiding them to produce more trustworthy responses. We introduce a novel uncertainty-aware causal language modeling loss function, grounded in the principles of decision theory. Through rigorous evaluation on multiple free-form question-answering datasets and models, we demonstrate that our uncertainty-aware fine-tuning approach yields better calibrated uncertainty estimates in natural language generation tasks than fine-tuning with the standard causal language modeling loss. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the model's ability to detect hallucinations and identify out-of-domain prompts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02904v1,2024-12
MLD-EA: Check and Complete Narrative Coherence by Introducing Emotions and Actions,"Jinming Zhang, Yunfei Long","Narrative understanding and story generation are critical challenges in natural language processing (NLP), with much of the existing research focused on summarization and question-answering tasks. While previous studies have explored predicting plot endings and generating extended narratives, they often neglect the logical coherence within stories, leaving a significant gap in the field. To address this, we introduce the Missing Logic Detector by Emotion and Action (MLD-EA) model, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify narrative gaps and generate coherent sentences that integrate seamlessly with the story's emotional and logical flow. The experimental results demonstrate that the MLD-EA model enhances narrative understanding and story generation, highlighting LLMs' potential as effective logic checkers in story writing with logical coherence and emotional consistency. This work fills a gap in NLP research and advances border goals of creating more sophisticated and reliable story-generation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02897v1,2024-12

TDD-Bench Verified: Can LLMs Generate Tests for Issues Before They Get Resolved?,"Toufique Ahmed, Martin Hirzel, Rangeet Pan, Avraham Shinnar, Saurabh Sinha","Test-driven development (TDD) is the practice of writing tests first and coding later, and the proponents of TDD expound its numerous benefits. For instance, given an issue on a source code repository, tests can clarify the desired behavior among stake-holders before anyone writes code for the agreed-upon fix. Although there has been a lot of work on automated test generation for the practice ""write code first, test later"", there has been little such automation for TDD. Ideally, tests for TDD should be fail-to-pass (i.e., fail before the issue is resolved and pass after) and have good adequacy with respect to covering the code changed during issue resolution. This paper introduces TDD-Bench Verified, a high-quality benchmark suite of 449 issues mined from real-world GitHub code repositories. The benchmark's evaluation harness runs only relevant tests in isolation for simple yet accurate coverage measurements, and the benchmark's dataset is filtered both by human judges and by execution in the harness. This paper also presents Auto-TDD, an LLM-based solution that takes as input an issue description and a codebase (prior to issue resolution) and returns as output a test that can be used to validate the changes made for resolving the issue. Our evaluation shows that Auto-TDD yields a better fail-to-pass rate than the strongest prior work while also yielding high coverage adequacy. Overall, we hope that this work helps make developers more productive at resolving issues while simultaneously leading to more robust fixes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02883v1,2024-12
CAISSON: Concept-Augmented Inference Suite of Self-Organizing Neural Networks,Igor Halperin,"We present CAISSON, a novel hierarchical approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that transforms traditional single-vector search into a multi-view clustering framework. At its core, CAISSON leverages dual Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to create complementary organizational views of the document space, where each view captures different aspects of document relationships through specialized embeddings. The first view processes combined text and metadata embeddings, while the second operates on metadata enriched with concept embeddings, enabling a comprehensive multi-view analysis that captures both fine-grained semantic relationships and high-level conceptual patterns. This dual-view approach enables more nuanced document discovery by combining evidence from different organizational perspectives. To evaluate CAISSON, we develop SynFAQA, a framework for generating synthetic financial analyst notes and question-answer pairs that systematically tests different aspects of information retrieval capabilities. Drawing on HotPotQA's methodology for constructing multi-step reasoning questions, SynFAQA generates controlled test cases where each question is paired with the set of notes containing its ground-truth answer, progressing from simple single-entity queries to complex multi-hop retrieval tasks involving multiple entities and concepts. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over both basic and enhanced RAG implementations, particularly for complex multi-entity queries, while maintaining practical response times suitable for interactive applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02835v1,2024-12
RARE: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement for Large Language Models,"Hieu Tran, Zonghai Yao, Junda Wang, Yifan Zhang, Zhichao Yang, Hong Yu","This work introduces RARE (Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Enhancement), a versatile extension to the mutual reasoning framework (rStar), aimed at enhancing reasoning accuracy and factual integrity across large language models (LLMs) for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks such as commonsense and medical reasoning. RARE incorporates two innovative actions within the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework: A6, which generates search queries based on the initial problem statement, performs information retrieval using those queries, and augments reasoning with the retrieved data to formulate the final answer; and A7, which leverages information retrieval specifically for generated sub-questions and re-answers these sub-questions with the relevant contextual information. Additionally, a Retrieval-Augmented Factuality Scorer is proposed to replace the original discriminator, prioritizing reasoning paths that meet high standards of factuality. Experimental results with LLaMA 3.1 show that RARE enables open-source LLMs to achieve competitive performance with top open-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o. This research establishes RARE as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains where logical coherence and factual integrity are critical.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02830v3,2024-12

CNNSum: Exploring Long-Context Summarization with Large Language Models in Chinese Novels,"Lingxiao Wei, He Yan, Xiangju Lu, Junmin Zhu, Jun Wang, Wei Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been well-researched in various long-context tasks. However, the scarcity of high-quality long-context summarization datasets has hindered further advancements in this area. To address this, we introduce CNNSum, a multi-scale long-context summarization benchmark based on Chinese novels, featuring human-driven annotations, which comprises four subsets totaling 695 samples, with lengths ranging from 16k to 128k. We evaluate numerous LLMs and conduct detailed case analyses. Furthermore, we conduct extensive fine-tuning experiments to explore and improve long-context summarization. In our study: (1) Advanced LLMs like GPT-4o may still generate subjective commentary, leading to vague summaries. (2) Currently, long-context summarization mainly relies on memory ability afforded by longer context lengths. The advantages of Large LLMs are hard to utilize, thus small LLMs are the most cost-effective. (3) Different prompt templates paired with various version models may cause large performance gaps. In further fine-tuning, these can be mitigated, and the Base version models perform better. (4) LLMs with RoPE-base scaled exhibit strong extrapolation potential; using short-context data can significantly improve long-context summarization performance. However, further applying other interpolation methods requires careful selection. (5) CNNSum provides more reliable and insightful evaluation results than other benchmarks. We release CNNSum to advance future research in this field. https://github.com/CxsGhost/CNNSum",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02819v4,2024-12
An Evolutionary Large Language Model for Hallucination Mitigation,"Abdennour Boulesnane, Abdelhakim Souilah","The emergence of LLMs, like ChatGPT and Gemini, has marked the modern era of artificial intelligence applications characterized by high-impact applications generating text, images, and videos. However, these models usually ensue with one critical challenge called hallucination: confident presentation of inaccurate or fabricated information. This problem attracts serious concern when these models are applied to specialized domains, including healthcare and law, where the accuracy and preciseness of information are absolute conditions. In this paper, we propose EvoLLMs, an innovative framework inspired by Evolutionary Computation, which automates the generation of high-quality Question-answering (QA) datasets while minimizing hallucinations. EvoLLMs employs genetic algorithms, mimicking evolutionary processes like selection, variation, and mutation, to guide LLMs in generating accurate, contextually relevant question-answer pairs. Comparative analysis shows that EvoLLMs consistently outperforms human-generated datasets in key metrics such as Depth, Relevance, and Coverage, while nearly matching human performance in mitigating hallucinations.

T-REG: Preference Optimization with Token-Level Reward Regularization,"Wenxuan Zhou, Shujian Zhang, Lingxiao Zhao, Tao Meng","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a reward to the entire response. However, this approach faces challenges due to its reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the model to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to the final reward. Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by introducing token-level rewards. However, these methods often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the quality and reliability of the rewards. In this paper, we propose token-level reward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization. Harnessing the self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting to enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards. These self-generated rewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more effectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens. This facilitates better token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance. Experiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2 and Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods by up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively. We will release the code and models at https://github.com/wzhouad/T-REG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02685v1,2024-12
Mind the Gap: Examining the Self-Improvement Capabilities of Large Language Models,"Yuda Song, Hanlin Zhang, Carson Eisenach, Sham Kakade, Dean Foster, Udaya Ghai","Self-improvement is a mechanism in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training, post-training and test-time inference. We explore a framework where the model verifies its own outputs, filters or reweights data based on this verification, and distills the filtered data. Despite several empirical successes, a fundamental understanding is still lacking. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive, modular and controlled study on LLM self-improvement. We provide a mathematical formulation for self-improvement, which is largely governed by a quantity which we formalize as the generation-verification gap. Through experiments with various model families and tasks, we discover a scaling phenomenon of self-improvement -- a variant of the generation-verification gap scales monotonically with the model pre-training flops. We also examine when self-improvement is possible, an iterative self-improvement procedure, and ways to improve its performance. Our findings not only advance understanding of LLM self-improvement with practical implications, but also open numerous avenues for future research into its capabilities and boundaries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02674v1,2024-12
Probing the statistical properties of enriched co-occurrence networks,"Diego R. Amancio, Jeaneth Machicao, Laura V. C. Quispe","Recent studies have explored the addition of virtual edges to word co-occurrence networks using word embeddings to enhance graph representations, particularly for short texts. While these enriched networks have demonstrated some success, the impact of incorporating semantic edges into traditional co-occurrence networks remains uncertain. This study investigates two key statistical properties of text-based network models. First, we assess whether network metrics can effectively distinguish between meaningless and meaningful texts. Second, we analyze whether these metrics are more sensitive to syntactic or semantic aspects of the text. Our results show that incorporating virtual edges can have positive and negative effects, depending on the specific network metric. For instance, the informativeness of the average shortest path and closeness centrality improves in short texts, while the clustering coefficient's informativeness decreases as more virtual edges are added. Additionally, we found that including stopwords affects the statistical properties of enriched networks. Our results can serve as a guideline for determining which network metrics are most appropriate for specific applications, depending on the typical text size and the nature of the problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02664v1,2024-12

The dataset consists of representative samples of interactions with technicians working in an advanced manufacturing setting. The purpose of this work to explore the task, data augmentation for the supported tasks and evaluating the performance of the existing LLMs. We observe that that task is complex requiring understanding from procedure specification documents, actions and objects sequenced temporally. The dataset consists of 200,000+ question/answer pairs that refer to the spec document and are grounded in narrations and/or video demonstrations. We compared the performance of several popular open-sourced LLMs by developing a baseline using each LLM and then compared the responses in a reference-free setting using LLM-as-a-judge and compared the ratings with crowd-workers whilst validating the ratings with experts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02638v1,2024-12
Words and Action: Modeling Linguistic Leadership in #BlackLivesMatter Communities,"Dani Roytburg, Deborah Olorunisola, Sandeep Soni, Lauren Klein","In this project, we describe a method of modeling semantic leadership across a set of communities associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement, which has been informed by qualitative research on the structure of social media and Black Twitter in particular. We describe our bespoke approaches to time-binning, community clustering, and connecting communities over time, as well as our adaptation of state-of-the-art approaches to semantic change detection and semantic leadership induction. We find substantial evidence of the leadership role of BLM activists and progressives, as well as Black celebrities. We also find evidence of the sustained engagement of the conservative community with this discourse, suggesting an alternative explanation for how we arrived at the present moment, in which ""anti-woke"" and ""anti-CRT"" bills are being enacted nationwide.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02637v1,2024-12
Time-Reversal Provides Unsupervised Feedback to LLMs,"Yerram Varun, Rahul Madhavan, Sravanti Addepalli, Arun Suggala, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Prateek Jain","Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02626v2,2024-12
GLM-4-Voice: Towards Intelligent and Human-Like End-to-End Spoken Chatbot,"Aohan Zeng, Zhengxiao Du, Mingdao Liu, Kedong Wang, Shengmin Jiang, Lei Zhao, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang","We introduce GLM-4-Voice, an intelligent and human-like end-to-end spoken chatbot. It supports both Chinese and English, engages in real-time voice conversations, and varies vocal nuances such as emotion, intonation, speech rate, and dialect according to user instructions. GLM-4-Voice uses an ultra-low bitrate (175bps), single-codebook speech tokenizer with 12.5Hz frame rate derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by incorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. To efficiently transfer knowledge from text to speech modalities, we synthesize speech-text interleaved data from existing text pre-training corpora using a text-to-token model. We continue pre-training from the pre-trained text language model GLM-4-9B with a combination of unsupervised speech data, interleaved speech-text data, and supervised speech-text data, scaling up to 1 trillion tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both speech language modeling and spoken question answering. We then fine-tune the pre-trained model with high-quality conversational speech data, achieving superior performance compared to existing baselines in both conversational ability and speech quality. The open models can be accessed through https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4-Voice and https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-4-voice-9b.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02612v1,2024-12
AV-Odyssey Bench: Can Your Multimodal LLMs Really Understand Audio-Visual Information?,"Kaixiong Gong, Kaituo Feng, Bohao Li, Yibing Wang, Mofan Cheng, Shijia Yang, Jiaming Han, Benyou Wang, Yutong Bai, Zhuoran Yang, Xiangyu Yue","Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Reka Core, have expanded their capabilities to include vision and audio modalities. While these models demonstrate impressive performance across a wide range of audio-visual applications, our proposed DeafTest reveals that MLLMs often struggle with simple tasks humans find trivial: 1) determining which of two sounds is louder, and 2) determining which of two sounds has a higher pitch. Motivated by these observations, we introduce AV-Odyssey Bench, a comprehensive audio-visual benchmark designed to assess whether those MLLMs can truly understand the audio-visual information. This benchmark encompasses 4,555 carefully crafted problems, each incorporating text, visual, and audio components. To successfully infer answers, models must effectively leverage clues from both visual and audio inputs. To ensure precise and objective evaluation of MLLM responses, we have structured the questions as multiple-choice, eliminating the need for human evaluation or LLM-assisted assessment. We benchmark a series of closed-source and open-source models and summarize the observations. By revealing the limitations of current models, we aim to provide useful insight for future dataset collection and model development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02611v1,2024-12
Interpretable Company Similarity with Sparse Autoencoders,"Marco Molinari, Victor Shao, Vladimir Tregubiak, Abhimanyu Pandey, Mateusz Mikolajczak, Sebastian Kuznetsov Ryder Torres Pereira","Determining company similarity is a vital task in finance, underpinning hedging, risk management, portfolio diversification, and more. Practitioners often rely on sector and industry classifications to gauge similarity, such as SIC-codes and GICS-codes - the former being used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the latter widely used by the investment community. Since these classifications can lack granularity and often need to be updated, using clusters of embeddings of company descriptions has been proposed as a potential alternative, but the lack of interpretability in token embeddings poses a significant barrier to adoption in high-stakes contexts. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in enhancing the interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing LLM activations into interpretable features. We apply SAEs to company descriptions, obtaining meaningful clusters of equities in the process. We benchmark SAE features against SIC-codes, Major Group codes, and Embeddings. Our results demonstrate that SAE features not only replicate but often surpass sector classifications and embeddings in capturing fundamental company characteristics. This is evidenced by their superior performance in correlating monthly returns - a proxy for similarity - and generating higher Sharpe ratio co-integration strategies, which underscores deeper fundamental similarities among companies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02605v2,2024-12
CEGI: Measuring the trade-off between efficiency and carbon emissions for SLMs and VLMs,"Abhas Kumar, Kapil Pathak, Rajesh Kavuru, Prabhakar Srinivasan","This paper analyzes the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) and evaluates the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions across 4 essential tasks: Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), Dialogue Summarization and Text-to-SQL conversion. Various SLMs and VLMs belonging to the Qwen and LLaMA architecture family are chosen and variants based on model size in terms of the number of parameters, quantization level and fine-tuning parameters are evaluated. The model variant's performance and carbon emissions are calculated. To quantify the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions, we introduce a novel metric called CEGI (Carbon Efficient Gain Index). This metric represents the carbon emission per unit percentage gain per million trainable parameters . This metric provides a normalized measure to compare model's efficiency in terms of performance improvement relative to their environmental cost. The experiment's outcome demonstrates that fine-tuning SLMs and VLMs can achieve performance levels comparable to Large Language Models (LLMs) while producing significantly less carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the marginal gains in accuracy from larger models do not justify the substantial increase in carbon emissions. Leveraging lower-bit quantization levels, the proposed metric further enhances energy efficiency without compromising performance. This study highlights balancing high performance and environmental sustainability. It offers a valuable metric for selecting models suitable for environmentally-friendly AI development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02602v1,2024-12
Nemotron-CC: Transforming Common Crawl into a Refined Long-Horizon Pretraining Dataset,"Dan Su, Kezhi Kong, Ying Lin, Joseph Jennings, Brandon Norick, Markus Kliegl, Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro","Recent English Common Crawl datasets like FineWeb-Edu and DCLM achieved significant benchmark gains via aggressive model-based filtering, but at the cost of removing 90% of data. This limits their suitability for long token horizon training, such as 15T tokens for Llama 3.1. In this paper, we show how to achieve better trade-offs between accuracy and data quantity by a combination of classifier ensembling, synthetic data rephrasing, and reduced reliance on heuristic filters. When training 8B parameter models for 1T tokens, using a high-quality subset of our data improves MMLU by 5.6 over DCLM, demonstrating the efficacy of our methods for boosting accuracies over a relatively short token horizon. Furthermore, our full 6.3T token dataset matches DCLM on MMLU, but contains four times more unique real tokens than DCLM. This unlocks state-of-the-art training over a long token horizon: an 8B parameter model trained for 15T tokens, of which 7.2T came from our dataset, is better than the Llama 3.1 8B model: +5 on MMLU, +3.1 on ARC-Challenge, and +0.5 on average across ten diverse tasks.

Semantic Tokens in Retrieval Augmented Generation,Joel Suro,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures have recently garnered significant attention for their ability to improve truth grounding and coherence in natural language processing tasks. However, the reliability of RAG systems in producing accurate answers diminishes as the volume of data they access increases. Even with smaller datasets, these systems occasionally fail to address simple queries. This issue arises from their dependence on state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which can introduce uncertainty into the system's outputs. In this work, I propose a novel Comparative RAG system that introduces an evaluator module to bridge the gap between probabilistic RAG systems and deterministically verifiable responses. The evaluator compares external recommendations with the retrieved document chunks, adding a decision-making layer that enhances the system's reliability. This approach ensures that the chunks retrieved are both semantically relevant and logically consistent with deterministic insights, thereby improving the accuracy and overall efficiency of RAG systems. This framework paves the way for more reliable and scalable question-answering applications in domains requiring high precision and verifiability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02563v1,2024-12
Patent-CR: A Dataset for Patent Claim Revision,"Lekang Jiang, Pascal A Scherz, Stephan Goetz","This paper presents Patent-CR, the first dataset created for the patent claim revision task in English. It includes both initial patent applications rejected by patent examiners and the final granted versions. Unlike normal text revision tasks that predominantly focus on enhancing sentence quality, such as grammar correction and coherence improvement, patent claim revision aims at ensuring the claims meet stringent legal criteria. These criteria are beyond novelty and inventiveness, including clarity of scope, technical accuracy, language precision, and legal robustness. We assess various large language models (LLMs) through professional human evaluation, including general LLMs with different sizes and architectures, text revision models, and domain-specific models. Our results indicate that LLMs often bring ineffective edits that deviate from the target revisions. In addition, domain-specific models and the method of fine-tuning show promising results. Notably, GPT-4 outperforms other tested LLMs, but further revisions are still necessary to reach the examination standard. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inconsistency between automated and human evaluation results, suggesting that GPT-4-based automated evaluation has the highest correlation with human judgment. This dataset, along with our preliminary empirical research, offers invaluable insights for further exploration in patent claim revision.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02549v1,2024-12
LLMForecaster: Improving Seasonal Event Forecasts with Unstructured Textual Data,"Hanyu Zhang, Chuck Arvin, Dmitry Efimov, Michael W. Mahoney, Dominique Perrault-Joncas, Shankar Ramasubramanian, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Malcolm Wolff","Modern time-series forecasting models often fail to make full use of rich unstructured information about the time series themselves. This lack of proper conditioning can lead to obvious model failures; for example, models may be unaware of the details of a particular product, and hence fail to anticipate seasonal surges in customer demand in the lead up to major exogenous events like holidays for clearly relevant products. To address this shortcoming, this paper introduces a novel forecast post-processor -- which we call LLMForecaster -- that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) to incorporate unstructured semantic and contextual information and historical data to improve the forecasts from an existing demand forecasting pipeline. In an industry-scale retail application, we demonstrate that our technique yields statistically significantly forecast improvements across several sets of products subject to holiday-driven demand surges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02525v1,2024-12
Achieving Semantic Consistency Using BERT: Application of Pre-training Semantic Representations Model in Social Sciences Research,"Ruiyu Zhang, Lin Nie, Ce Zhao, Qingyang Chen","Achieving consistent word interpretations across different time spans is crucial in social sciences research and text analysis tasks, as stable semantic representations form the foundation for research and task correctness, enhancing understanding of socio-political and cultural analysis. Traditional models like Word2Vec have provided significant insights into long-term semantic changes but often struggle to capture stable meanings in short-term contexts, which may be attributed to fluctuations in embeddings caused by unbalanced training data. Recent advancements, particularly BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), its pre-trained nature and transformer encoder architecture offer contextual embeddings that improve semantic consistency, making it a promising tool for short-term analysis. This study empirically compares the performance of Word2Vec and BERT in maintaining stable word meanings over time in text analysis tasks relevant to social sciences research. Using articles from the People's Daily spanning 20 years (2004-2023), we evaluated the semantic stability of each model across different timeframes. The results indicate that BERT consistently outperforms Word2Vec in maintaining semantic stability, offering greater stability in contextual embeddings. However, the study also acknowledges BERT's limitations in capturing gradual semantic shifts over longer periods due to its inherent stability. The findings suggest that while BERT is advantageous for short-term semantic analysis in social sciences, researchers should consider complementary approaches for long-term studies to fully capture semantic drift. This research underscores the importance of selecting appropriate word embedding models based on the specific temporal context of social science analyses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04505v1,2024-12
DP-2Stage: Adapting Language Models as Differentially Private Tabular Data Generators,"Tejumade Afonja, Hui-Po Wang, Raouf Kerkouche, Mario Fritz","Generating tabular data under differential privacy (DP) protection ensures theoretical privacy guarantees but poses challenges for training machine learning models, primarily due to the need to capture complex structures under noisy supervision signals. Recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) -- even those at the scale of GPT-2 -- have demonstrated great potential in synthesizing tabular data. However, their applications under DP constraints remain largely unexplored. In this work, we address this gap by applying DP techniques to the generation of synthetic tabular data. Our findings shows that LLMs face difficulties in generating coherent text when fine-tuned with DP, as privacy budgets are inefficiently allocated to non-private elements like table structures. To overcome this, we propose \ours, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for differentially private tabular data generation. The first stage involves non-private fine-tuning on a pseudo dataset, followed by DP fine-tuning on a private dataset. Our empirical results show that this approach improves performance across various settings and metrics compared to directly fine-tuned LLMs in DP contexts. We release our code and setup at https://github.com/tejuafonja/DP-2Stage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02467v1,2024-12
Can ChatGPT capture swearing nuances? Evidence from translating Arabic oaths,Mohammed Q. Shormani,"This study sets out to answer one major question: Can ChatGPT capture swearing nuances? It presents an empirical study on the ability of ChatGPT to translate Arabic oath expressions into English. 30 Arabic oath expressions were collected from the literature. These 30 oaths were first translated via ChatGPT and then analyzed and compared to the human translation in terms of types of gaps left unfulfilled by ChatGPT. Specifically, the gaps involved are: religious gap, cultural gap, both religious and cultural gaps, no gap, using non-oath particles, redundancy and noncapturing of Arabic script diacritics. It concludes that ChatGPT translation of oaths is still much unsatisfactory, unveiling the need of further developments of ChatGPT, and the inclusion of Arabic data on which ChatGPT should be trained including oath expressions, oath nuances, rituals, and practices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02466v2,2024-12
Gracefully Filtering Backdoor Samples for Generative Large Language Models without Retraining,"Zongru Wu, Pengzhou Cheng, Lingyong Fang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu","Backdoor attacks remain significant security threats to generative large language models (LLMs). Since generative LLMs output sequences of high-dimensional token logits instead of low-dimensional classification logits, most existing backdoor defense methods designed for discriminative models like BERT are ineffective for generative LLMs. Inspired by the observed differences in learning behavior between backdoor and clean mapping in the frequency space, we transform gradients of each training sample, directly influencing parameter updates, into the frequency space. Our findings reveal a distinct separation between the gradients of backdoor and clean samples in the frequency space. Based on this phenomenon, we propose Gradient Clustering in the Frequency Space for Backdoor Sample Filtering (GraCeFul), which leverages sample-wise gradients in the frequency space to effectively identify backdoor samples without requiring retraining LLMs. Experimental results show that GraCeFul outperforms baselines significantly. Notably, GraCeFul exhibits remarkable computational efficiency, achieving nearly 100% recall and F1 scores in identifying backdoor samples, reducing the average success rate of various backdoor attacks to 0% with negligible drops in clean accuracy across multiple free-style question answering datasets. Additionally, GraCeFul generalizes to Llama-2 and Vicuna. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/ZrW00/GraceFul.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02454v1,2024-12
Artificial Expert Intelligence through PAC-reasoning,"Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Amnon Shashua, Gal Beniamini, Yoav Levine, Or Sharir, Noam Wies, Ido Ben-Shaul, Tomer Nussbaum, Shir Granot Peled","Artificial Expert Intelligence (AEI) seeks to transcend the limitations of both Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and narrow AI by integrating domain-specific expertise with critical, precise reasoning capabilities akin to those of top human experts. Existing AI systems often excel at predefined tasks but struggle with adaptability and precision in novel problem-solving. To overcome this, AEI introduces a framework for ``Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Reasoning"". This paradigm provides robust theoretical guarantees for reliably decomposing complex problems, with a practical mechanism for controlling reasoning precision. In reference to the division of human thought into System 1 for intuitive thinking and System 2 for reflective reasoning~\citep{tversky1974judgment}, we refer to this new type of reasoning as System 3 for precise reasoning, inspired by the rigor of the scientific method.

GerPS-Compare: Comparing NER methods for legal norm analysis,"Sarah T. Bachinger, Christoph Unger, Robin Erd, Leila Feddoul, Clara Lachenmaier, Sina Zarrieß, Birgitta König-Ries","We apply NER to a particular sub-genre of legal texts in German: the genre of legal norms regulating administrative processes in public service administration. The analysis of such texts involves identifying stretches of text that instantiate one of ten classes identified by public service administration professionals. We investigate and compare three methods for performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect these classes: a Rule-based system, deep discriminative models, and a deep generative model. Our results show that Deep Discriminative models outperform both the Rule-based system as well as the Deep Generative model, the latter two roughly performing equally well, outperforming each other in different classes. The main cause for this somewhat surprising result is arguably the fact that the classes used in the analysis are semantically and syntactically heterogeneous, in contrast to the classes used in more standard NER tasks. Deep Discriminative models appear to be better equipped for dealing with this heterogenerity than both generic LLMs and human linguists designing rule-based NER systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02427v1,2024-12

TSCheater: Generating High-Quality Tibetan Adversarial Texts via Visual Similarity,"Xi Cao, Quzong Gesang, Yuan Sun, Nuo Qun, Tashi Nyima","Language models based on deep neural networks are vulnerable to textual adversarial attacks. While rich-resource languages like English are receiving focused attention, Tibetan, a cross-border language, is gradually being studied due to its abundant ancient literature and critical language strategy. Currently, there are several Tibetan adversarial text generation methods, but they do not fully consider the textual features of Tibetan script and overestimate the quality of generated adversarial texts. To address this issue, we propose a novel Tibetan adversarial text generation method called TSCheater, which considers the characteristic of Tibetan encoding and the feature that visually similar syllables have similar semantics. This method can also be transferred to other abugidas, such as Devanagari script. We utilize a self-constructed Tibetan syllable visual similarity database called TSVSDB to generate substitution candidates and adopt a greedy algorithm-based scoring mechanism to determine substitution order. After that, we conduct the method on eight victim language models. Experimentally, TSCheater outperforms existing methods in attack effectiveness, perturbation magnitude, semantic similarity, visual similarity, and human acceptance. Finally, we construct the first Tibetan adversarial robustness evaluation benchmark called AdvTS, which is generated by existing methods and proofread by humans.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02371v3,2024-12
The Impact of Featuring Comments in Online Discussions,"Cedric Waterschoot, Ernst van den Hemel, Antal van den Bosch","A widespread moderation strategy by online news platforms is to feature what the platform deems high quality comments, usually called editor picks or featured comments. In this paper, we compare online discussions of news articles in which certain comments are featured, versus discussions in which no comments are featured. We measure the impact of featuring comments on the discussion, by estimating and comparing the quality of discussions from the perspective of the user base and the platform itself. Our analysis shows that the impact on discussion quality is limited. However, we do observe an increase in discussion activity after the first comments are featured by moderators, suggesting that the moderation strategy might be used to increase user engagement and to postpone the natural decline in user activity over time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02369v1,2024-12
Adaptive Two-Phase Finetuning LLMs for Japanese Legal Text Retrieval,"Quang Hoang Trung, Nguyen Van Hoang Phuc, Le Trung Hoang, Quang Huu Hieu, Vo Nguyen Le Duy","Text Retrieval (TR) involves finding and retrieving text-based content relevant to a user's query from a large repository, with applications in real-world scenarios such as legal document retrieval.

In this paper, we introduce a new dataset specifically designed for Japanese legal contexts and propose a novel two-phase pipeline tailored to this domain.   In the first phase, the model learns a broad understanding of global contexts, enhancing its generalization and adaptability to diverse queries. In the second phase, the model is fine-tuned to address complex queries specific to legal scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which outperforms existing baselines.   Furthermore, our pipeline proves effective in English contexts, surpassing comparable baselines on the MS MARCO dataset. We have made our code publicly available on GitHub, and the model checkpoints are accessible via HuggingFace.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13205v1,2024-12
ScImage: How Good Are Multimodal Large Language Models at Scientific Text-to-Image Generation?,"Leixin Zhang, Steffen Eger, Yinjie Cheng, Weihe Zhai, Jonas Belouadi, Christoph Leiter, Simone Paolo Ponzetto, Fahimeh Moafian, Zhixue Zhao","Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images from textual instructions. However, their performance in generating scientific images--a critical application for accelerating scientific progress--remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing ScImage, a benchmark designed to evaluate the multimodal capabilities of LLMs in generating scientific images from textual descriptions. ScImage assesses three key dimensions of understanding: spatial, numeric, and attribute comprehension, as well as their combinations, focusing on the relationships between scientific objects (e.g., squares, circles). We evaluate five models, GPT-4o, Llama, AutomaTikZ, Dall-E, and StableDiffusion, using two modes of output generation: code-based outputs (Python, TikZ) and direct raster image generation. Additionally, we examine four different input languages: English, German, Farsi, and Chinese. Our evaluation, conducted with 11 scientists across three criteria (correctness, relevance, and scientific accuracy), reveals that while GPT-4o produces outputs of decent quality for simpler prompts involving individual dimensions such as spatial, numeric, or attribute understanding in isolation, all models face challenges in this task, especially for more complex prompts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02368v1,2024-12
Multi-Granularity Tibetan Textual Adversarial Attack Method Based on Masked Language Model,"Xi Cao, Nuo Qun, Quzong Gesang, Yulei Zhu, Trashi Nyima","In social media, neural network models have been applied to hate speech detection, sentiment analysis, etc., but neural network models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. For instance, in a text classification task, the attacker elaborately introduces perturbations to the original texts that hardly alter the original semantics in order to trick the model into making different predictions. By studying textual adversarial attack methods, the robustness of language models can be evaluated and then improved. Currently, most of the research in this field focuses on English, and there is also a certain amount of research on Chinese. However, there is little research targeting Chinese minority languages. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology and the emergence of Chinese minority language models, textual adversarial attacks become a new challenge for the information processing of Chinese minority languages. In response to this situation, we propose a multi-granularity Tibetan textual adversarial attack method based on masked language models called TSTricker. We utilize the masked language models to generate candidate substitution syllables or words, adopt the scoring mechanism to determine the substitution order, and then conduct the attack method on several fine-tuned victim models. The experimental results show that TSTricker reduces the accuracy of the classification models by more than 28.70% and makes the classification models change the predictions of more than 90.60% of the samples, which has an evidently higher attack effect than the baseline method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02343v1,2024-12
Pay Attention to the Robustness of Chinese Minority Language Models! Syllable-level Textual Adversarial Attack on Tibetan Script,"Xi Cao, Dolma Dawa, Nuo Qun, Trashi Nyima","The textual adversarial attack refers to an attack method in which the attacker adds imperceptible perturbations to the original texts by elaborate design so that the NLP (natural language processing) model produces false judgments. This method is also used to evaluate the robustness of NLP models. Currently, most of the research in this field focuses on English, and there is also a certain amount of research on Chinese. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is little research targeting Chinese minority languages. Textual adversarial attacks are a new challenge for the information processing of Chinese minority languages. In response to this situation, we propose a Tibetan syllable-level black-box textual adversarial attack called TSAttacker based on syllable cosine distance and scoring mechanism. And then, we conduct TSAttacker on six models generated by fine-tuning two PLMs (pre-trained language models) for three downstream tasks. The experiment results show that TSAttacker is effective and generates high-quality adversarial samples. In addition, the robustness of the involved models still has much room for improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02323v2,2024-12
Large Multimodal Agents for Accurate Phishing Detection with Enhanced Token Optimization and Cost Reduction,"Fouad Trad, Ali Chehab","With the rise of sophisticated phishing attacks, there is a growing need for effective and economical detection solutions. This paper explores the use of large multimodal agents, specifically Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT-4o mini, to analyze both URLs and webpage screenshots via APIs, thus avoiding the complexities of training and maintaining AI systems. Our findings indicate that integrating these two data types substantially enhances detection performance over using either type alone. However, API usage incurs costs per query that depend on the number of input and output tokens. To address this, we propose a two-tiered agentic approach: initially, one agent assesses the URL, and if inconclusive, a second agent evaluates both the URL and the screenshot. This method not only maintains robust detection performance but also significantly reduces API costs by minimizing unnecessary multi-input queries. Cost analysis shows that with the agentic approach, GPT-4o mini can process about 4.2 times as many websites per $100 compared to the multimodal approach (107,440 vs. 25,626), and Gemini 1.5 Flash can process about 2.6 times more websites (2,232,142 vs. 862,068). These findings underscore the significant economic benefits of the agentic approach over the multimodal method, providing a viable solution for organizations aiming to leverage advanced AI for phishing detection while controlling expenses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02301v1,2024-12
Characterizing Information Shared by Participants to Coding Challenges: The Case of Advent of Code,"Francesco Cauteruccio, Enrico Corradini, Luca Virgili","Advent of Code (AoC from now on) is a popular coding challenge requiring to solve programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and levels. AoC follows the advent calendar, therefore it is an annual challenge that lasts for 25 days. AoC participants usually post their solutions on social networks and discuss them online. These challenges are interesting to study since they could highlight the adoption of new tools, the evolution of the developer community, or the technological requirements of well-known companies. For these reasons, we first create a dataset of the 2019-2021 AoC editions containing the discussion threads made on the subreddit {\tt /r/adventofcode}. Then, we propose a model based on stream graphs to best study this context, where we represent its most important actors through time: participants, comments, and programming languages. Thanks to our model, we investigate user participation, adoption of new programming languages during a challenge and between two of them, and resiliency of programming languages based on a Stack Overflow survey. We find that the top-used programming languages are almost the same in the three years, pointing out their importance. Moreover, participants tend to keep the same programming language for the whole challenge, while the ones attending two AoCs usually change it in the next one. Finally, we observe interesting results about the programming languages that are ``Popular'' or ``Loved'' according to the Stack Overflow survey. Firstly, these are the ones adopted for the longest time in an AoC edition, thanks to which users have a high chance of reaching the end of the challenge. Secondly, they are the most chosen when a participant decides to change programming language during the same challenge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02290v1,2024-12
A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"Changzhi Zhou, Dandan Song, Yuhang Tian, Zhijing Wu, Hao Wang, Xinyu Zhang, Jun Yang, Ziyi Yang, Shuhao Zhang","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the field of natural language processing, revolutionizing numerous downstream tasks with powerful reasoning and generation abilities. For example, In-Context Learning (ICL) introduces a fine-tuning-free paradigm, allowing out-of-the-box LLMs to execute downstream tasks by analogy learning without any fine-tuning. Besides, in a fine-tuning-dependent paradigm where substantial training data exists, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), as the cost-effective methods, enable LLMs to achieve excellent performance comparable to full fine-tuning.   However, these fascinating techniques employed by LLMs have not been fully exploited in the ABSA field. Previous works probe LLMs in ABSA by merely using randomly selected input-output pairs as demonstrations in ICL, resulting in an incomplete and superficial evaluation. In this paper, we shed light on a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in the ABSA field, involving 13 datasets, 8 ABSA subtasks, and 6 LLMs. Specifically, we design a unified task formulation to unify ``multiple LLMs for multiple ABSA subtasks in multiple paradigms.'' For the fine-tuning-dependent paradigm, we efficiently fine-tune LLMs using instruction-based multi-task learning. For the fine-tuning-free paradigm, we propose 3 demonstration selection strategies to stimulate the few-shot abilities of LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve a new state-of-the-art performance compared to fine-tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) in the fine-tuning-dependent paradigm. More importantly, in the fine-tuning-free paradigm where SLMs are ineffective, LLMs with ICL still showcase impressive potential and even compete with fine-tuned SLMs on some ABSA subtasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02279v1,2024-12

Compressing KV Cache for Long-Context LLM Inference with Inter-Layer Attention Similarity,"Da Ma, Lu Chen, Situo Zhang, Yuxun Miao, Su Zhu, Zhi Chen, Hongshen Xu, Hanqi Li, Shuai Fan, Lei Pan, Kai Yu","The increasing context window size in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT and LLaMA series, has improved their ability to tackle complex, long-text tasks, but at the cost of inference efficiency, particularly regarding memory and computational complexity. Existing methods, including selective token retention and window-based attention, improve efficiency but risk discarding important tokens needed for future text generation. In this paper, we propose an approach that enhances LLM efficiency without token loss by reducing the memory and computational load of less important tokens, rather than discarding them.We address two challenges: 1) investigating the distribution of important tokens in the context, discovering recent tokens are more important than distant tokens in context, and 2) optimizing resources for distant tokens by sharing attention scores across layers. The experiments show that our method saves $35\%$ KV cache without compromising the performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02252v1,2024-12
BANER: Boundary-Aware LLMs for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition,"Quanjiang Guo, Yihong Dong, Ling Tian, Zhao Kang, Yu Zhang, Sijie Wang","Despite the recent success of two-stage prototypical networks in few-shot named entity recognition (NER), challenges such as over/under-detected false spans in the span detection stage and unaligned entity prototypes in the type classification stage persist. Additionally, LLMs have not proven to be effective few-shot information extractors in general. In this paper, we propose an approach called Boundary-Aware LLMs for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition to address these issues. We introduce a boundary-aware contrastive learning strategy to enhance the LLM's ability to perceive entity boundaries for generalized entity spans. Additionally, we utilize LoRAHub to align information from the target domain to the source domain, thereby enhancing adaptive cross-domain classification capabilities. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms prior methods, validating its effectiveness. In particular, the proposed strategies demonstrate effectiveness across a range of LLM architectures.

Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have streamlined the BI workflow by automatically performing task planning, reasoning, and actions in executable environments based on natural language (NL) queries. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual BI tasks such as NL2SQL and NL2VIS. The fragmentation of tasks across different data roles and tools lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to the iterative and collaborative nature of BI. In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that integrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational notebook interface. DataLab supports a wide range of BI tasks for different data roles by seamlessly combining LLM assistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this unification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for enterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context management strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover, DataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from Tencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction in token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02205v2,2024-12
VISCO: Benchmarking Fine-Grained Critique and Correction Towards Self-Improvement in Visual Reasoning,"Xueqing Wu, Yuheng Ding, Bingxuan Li, Pan Lu, Da Yin, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng","The ability of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to critique and correct their reasoning is an essential building block towards their self-improvement. However, a systematic analysis of such capabilities in LVLMs is still lacking. We propose VISCO, the first benchmark to extensively analyze the fine-grained critique and correction capabilities of LVLMs. Compared to existing work that uses a single scalar value to critique the entire reasoning [4], VISCO features dense and fine-grained critique, requiring LVLMs to evaluate the correctness of each step in the chain-of-thought and provide natural language explanations to support their judgments. Extensive evaluation of 24 LVLMs demonstrates that human-written critiques significantly enhance the performance after correction, showcasing the potential of the self-improvement strategy. However, the model-generated critiques are less helpful and sometimes detrimental to the performance, suggesting that critique is the crucial bottleneck. We identified three common patterns in critique failures: failure to critique visual perception, reluctance to ""say no"", and exaggerated assumption of error propagation. To address these issues, we propose an effective LookBack strategy that revisits the image to verify each piece of information in the initial reasoning. LookBack significantly improves critique and correction performance by up to 13.5%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02172v1,2024-12
CPTQuant - A Novel Mixed Precision Post-Training Quantization Techniques for Large Language Models,"Amitash Nanda, Sree Bhargavi Balija, Debashis Sahoo","Large language models have transformed the comprehension and generation of natural language tasks, but they come with substantial memory and computational requirements. Quantization techniques have emerged as a promising avenue for addressing these challenges while preserving accuracy and making energy efficient. We propose CPTQuant, a comprehensive strategy that introduces correlation-based (CMPQ), pruning-based (PMPQ), and Taylor decomposition-based (TDMPQ) mixed precision techniques. CMPQ adapts the precision level based on canonical correlation analysis of different layers. PMPQ optimizes precision layer-wise based on their sensitivity to sparsity. TDMPQ modifies precision using Taylor decomposition to assess each layer's sensitivity to input perturbation. These strategies allocate higher precision to more sensitive layers while diminishing precision to robust layers. CPTQuant assesses the performance across BERT, OPT-125M, OPT-350M, OPT-1.3B, and OPT-2.7B. We demonstrate up to 4x compression and a 2x-fold increase in efficiency with minimal accuracy drop compared to Hugging Face FP16. PMPQ stands out for achieving a considerably higher model compression. Sensitivity analyses across various LLMs show that the initial and final 30% of layers exhibit higher sensitivities than the remaining layers. PMPQ demonstrates an 11% higher compression ratio than other methods for classification tasks, while TDMPQ achieves a 30% greater compression ratio for language modeling tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03599v1,2024-12
A Theoretical Framework for Acoustic Neighbor Embeddings,Woojay Jeon,"This paper provides a theoretical framework for interpreting acoustic neighbor embeddings, which are representations of the phonetic content of variable-width audio or text in a fixed-dimensional embedding space. A probabilistic interpretation of the distances between embeddings is proposed, based on a general quantitative definition of phonetic similarity between words. This provides us a framework for understanding and applying the embeddings in a principled manner. Theoretical and empirical evidence to support an approximation of uniform cluster-wise isotropy are shown, which allows us to reduce the distances to simple Euclidean distances. Four experiments that validate the framework and demonstrate how it can be applied to diverse problems are described. Nearest-neighbor search between audio and text embeddings can give isolated word classification accuracy that is identical to that of finite state transducers (FSTs) for vocabularies as large as 500k. Embedding distances give accuracy with 0.5% point difference compared to phone edit distances in out-of-vocabulary word recovery, as well as producing clustering hierarchies identical to those derived from human listening experiments in English dialect clustering. The theoretical framework also allows us to use the embeddings to predict the expected confusion of device wake-up words.

Jailbreak Defense in a Narrow Domain: Limitations of Existing Methods and a New Transcript-Classifier Approach,"Tony T. Wang, John Hughes, Henry Sleight, Rylan Schaeffer, Rajashree Agrawal, Fazl Barez, Mrinank Sharma, Jesse Mu, Nir Shavit, Ethan Perez","Defending large language models against jailbreaks so that they never engage in a broadly-defined set of forbidden behaviors is an open problem. In this paper, we investigate the difficulty of jailbreak-defense when we only want to forbid a narrowly-defined set of behaviors. As a case study, we focus on preventing an LLM from helping a user make a bomb. We find that popular defenses such as safety training, adversarial training, and input/output classifiers are unable to fully solve this problem. In pursuit of a better solution, we develop a transcript-classifier defense which outperforms the baseline defenses we test. However, our classifier defense still fails in some circumstances, which highlights the difficulty of jailbreak-defense even in a narrow domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02159v1,2024-12
Leveraging Large Language Models for Comparative Literature Summarization with Reflective Incremental Mechanisms,"Fernando Gabriela Garcia, Spencer Burns, Harrison Fuller","In this paper, we introduce ChatCite, a novel method leveraging large language models (LLMs) for generating comparative literature summaries. The ability to summarize research papers with a focus on key comparisons between studies is an essential task in academic research. Existing summarization models, while effective at generating concise summaries, fail to provide deep comparative insights. ChatCite addresses this limitation by incorporating a multi-step reasoning mechanism that extracts critical elements from papers, incrementally builds a comparative summary, and refines the output through a reflective memory process. We evaluate ChatCite on a custom dataset, CompLit-LongContext, consisting of 1000 research papers with annotated comparative summaries. Experimental results show that ChatCite outperforms several baseline methods, including GPT-4, BART, T5, and CoT, across various automatic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE and the newly proposed G-Score. Human evaluation further confirms that ChatCite generates more coherent, insightful, and fluent summaries compared to these baseline models. Our method provides a significant advancement in automatic literature review generation, offering researchers a powerful tool for efficiently comparing and synthesizing scientific research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02149v1,2024-12

Misalignment of Semantic Relation Knowledge between WordNet and Human Intuition,"Zhihan Cao, Hiroaki Yamada, Simone Teufel, Takenobu Tokunaga","WordNet provides a carefully constructed repository of semantic relations, created by specialists. But there is another source of information on semantic relations, the intuition of language users. We present the first systematic study of the degree to which these two sources are aligned. Investigating the cases of misalignment could make proper use of WordNet and facilitate its improvement. Our analysis which uses templates to elicit responses from human participants, reveals a general misalignment of semantic relation knowledge between WordNet and human intuition. Further analyses find a systematic pattern of mismatch among synonymy and taxonomic relations~(hypernymy and hyponymy), together with the fact that WordNet path length does not serve as a reliable indicator of human intuition regarding hypernymy or hyponymy relations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02138v1,2024-12
Multi-Bin Batching for Increasing LLM Inference Throughput,"Ozgur Guldogan, Jackson Kunde, Kangwook Lee, Ramtin Pedarsani","As large language models (LLMs) grow in popularity for their diverse capabilities, improving the efficiency of their inference systems has become increasingly critical. Batching LLM requests is a critical step in scheduling the inference jobs on servers (e.g. GPUs), enabling the system to maximize throughput by allowing multiple requests to be processed in parallel. However, requests often have varying generation lengths, causing resource underutilization, as hardware must wait for the longest-running request in the batch to complete before moving to the next batch. We formalize this problem from a queueing-theoretic perspective, and aim to design a control policy which is throughput-optimal. We propose Multi-Bin Batching, a simple yet effective method that can provably improve LLM inference throughput by grouping requests with similar (predicted) execution times into predetermined bins. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and experiments, including real-world LLM inference scenarios, we demonstrate significant throughput gains compared to standard batching approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04504v1,2024-12

The convergence of these technologies has catalyzed the rise of multimodal AI, enabling richer, cross-modal understanding that spans text, vision, audio, and video modalities. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), in particular, have emerged as a powerful framework, demonstrating impressive capabilities in tasks like image-text generation, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval.

Improving Language Transfer Capability of Decoder-only Architecture in Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"Zhi Qu, Yiran Wang, Chenchen Ding, Hideki Tanaka, Masao Utiyama, Taro Watanabe","Existing multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) approaches mainly focus on improving models with the encoder-decoder architecture to translate multiple languages. However, decoder-only architecture has been explored less in MNMT due to its underperformance when trained on parallel data solely. In this work, we attribute the issue of the decoder-only architecture to its lack of language transfer capability. Specifically, the decoder-only architecture is insufficient in encoding source tokens with the target language features. We propose dividing the decoding process into two stages so that target tokens are explicitly excluded in the first stage to implicitly boost the transfer capability across languages. Additionally, we impose contrastive learning on translation instructions, resulting in improved performance in zero-shot translation. We conduct experiments on TED-19 and OPUS-100 datasets, considering both training from scratch and fine-tuning scenarios. Experimental results show that, compared to the encoder-decoder architecture, our methods not only perform competitively in supervised translations but also achieve improvements of up to 3.39 BLEU, 6.99 chrF++, 3.22 BERTScore, and 4.81 COMET in zero-shot translations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02101v1,2024-12

Let's Think Var-by-Var: Large Language Models Enable Ad Hoc Probabilistic Reasoning,"Shepard Xia, Brian Lu, Jason Eisner","A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to flesh out underspecified situations using ""common sense."" We propose to extract that common sense from large language models (LLMs), in a form that can feed into probabilistic inference. We focus our investigation on $\textit{guesstimation}$ questions such as ""How much are Airbnb listings in Newark, NJ?"" Formulating a sensible answer without access to data requires drawing on, and integrating, bits of common knowledge about how $\texttt{Price}$ and $\texttt{Location}$ may relate to other variables, such as $\texttt{Property Type}$. Our framework answers such a question by synthesizing an $\textit{ad hoc}$ probabilistic model. First we prompt an LLM to propose a set of random variables relevant to the question, followed by moment constraints on their joint distribution. We then optimize the joint distribution $p$ within a log-linear family to maximize the overall constraint satisfaction. Our experiments show that LLMs can successfully be prompted to propose reasonable variables, and while the proposed numerical constraints can be noisy, jointly optimizing for their satisfaction reconciles them. When evaluated on probabilistic questions derived from three real-world tabular datasets, we find that our framework performs comparably to a direct prompting baseline in terms of total variation distance from the dataset distribution, and is similarly robust to noise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02081v1,2024-12

The research specifically focuses on how model performance is affected when embedding models are trained on datasets, including samples also used for neural network training and validation. The results show that introducing data snooping did not significantly alter model performance, suggesting that data snooping had a minimal impact or that samples randomly dropped as part of the methodology contained hidden features critical to achieving optimal performance. In addition, the findings reinforce the conclusions of previous research, which found that models trained with GPT-2 embeddings consistently outperformed neural networks trained with other embeddings. The fact that this holds even when data snooping is introduced into the embedding model indicates GPT-2's robustness in representing complex code features, even under less-than-ideal conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02048v1,2024-12

Real-Time Multilingual Sign Language Processing,Amit Moryossef,"Sign Language Processing (SLP) is an interdisciplinary field comprised of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision. It is focused on the computational understanding, translation, and production of signed languages. Traditional approaches have often been constrained by the use of gloss-based systems that are both language-specific and inadequate for capturing the multidimensional nature of sign language. These limitations have hindered the development of technology capable of processing signed languages effectively.   This thesis aims to revolutionize the field of SLP by proposing a simple paradigm that can bridge this existing technological gap. We propose the use of SignWiring, a universal sign language transcription notation system, to serve as an intermediary link between the visual-gestural modality of signed languages and text-based linguistic representations.   We contribute foundational libraries and resources to the SLP community, thereby setting the stage for a more in-depth exploration of the tasks of sign language translation and production. These tasks encompass the translation of sign language from video to spoken language text and vice versa. Through empirical evaluations, we establish the efficacy of our transcription method as a pivot for enabling faster, more targeted research, that can lead to more natural and accurate translations across a range of languages.   The universal nature of our transcription-based paradigm also paves the way for real-time, multilingual applications in SLP, thereby offering a more inclusive and accessible approach to language technology. This is a significant step toward universal accessibility, enabling a wider reach of AI-driven language technologies to include the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01991v1,2024-12
Free Process Rewards without Process Labels,"Lifan Yuan, Wendi Li, Huayu Chen, Ganqu Cui, Ning Ding, Kaiyan Zhang, Bowen Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Hao Peng","Different from its counterpart outcome reward models (ORMs), which evaluate the entire responses, a process reward model (PRM) scores a reasoning trajectory step by step, providing denser and more fine grained rewards. However, training a PRM requires labels annotated at every intermediate step, presenting significant challenges for both manual and automatic data collection. This paper aims to address this challenge. Both theoretically and empirically, we show that an \textit{implicit PRM} can be obtained at no additional cost, by simply training an ORM on the cheaper response-level labels. The only assumption is to parameterize the outcome reward as the log-likelihood ratios of the policy and reference models, which can be optimized regardless of the specific choice of loss objectives. In experiments, we instantiate our implicit PRMs with various objectives and evaluate their performance on MATH. We show that our implicit PRM outperforms a strong MCTS-based baseline \textit{\'a la} Math-Shepherd using less than $1/38$ of the training data. Its performance can be further improved with majority voting. We further find that scaling up instructions and responses benefits our implicit PRM, and the latter brings a larger gain. Particularly, we find that our implicit PRM, when instantiated with the cross-entropy (CE) loss, is more data-efficient and can keep improving generation models even when trained with only one response per instruction, the setup that suffers from extreme data scarcity and imbalance. Further, instructions should be relevant to downstream tasks while the diversity of responses does not bring gains. Surprisingly, training on extra Math-Shepherd step labels brings no further improvements to our implicit PRM trained on only outcome data. We hope that our work will encourage a rethinking of PRM training approaches and contribute to making training PRMs more accessible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01981v1,2024-12
The Vulnerability of Language Model Benchmarks: Do They Accurately Reflect True LLM Performance?,"Sourav Banerjee, Ayushi Agarwal, Eishkaran Singh","The pursuit of leaderboard rankings in Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a fundamental paradox: models excel at standardized tests while failing to demonstrate genuine language understanding and adaptability. Our systematic analysis of NLP evaluation frameworks reveals pervasive vulnerabilities across the evaluation spectrum, from basic metrics to complex benchmarks like GLUE and MMLU. These vulnerabilities manifest through benchmark exploitation, dataset contamination, and evaluation bias, creating a false perception of progress in language understanding capabilities. Through extensive review of contemporary evaluation approaches, we identify significant limitations in static benchmark designs, human evaluation protocols, and LLM-as-judge frameworks, all of which compromise the reliability of current performance assessments. As LLM capabilities evolve and existing benchmarks become redundant, we lay the groundwork for new evaluation methods that resist manipulation, minimize data contamination, and assess domain-specific tasks. This requires frameworks that are adapted dynamically, addressing current limitations and providing a more accurate reflection of LLM performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03597v1,2024-12
The use of large language models to enhance cancer clinical trial educational materials,"Mingye Gao, Aman Varshney, Shan Chen, Vikram Goddla, Jack Gallifant, Patrick Doyle, Claire Novack, Maeve Dillon-Martin, Teresia Perkins, Xinrong Correia, Erik Duhaime, Howard Isenstein, Elad Sharon, Lisa Soleymani Lehmann, David Kozono, Brian Anthony, Dmitriy Dligach, Danielle S. Bitterman","Cancer clinical trials often face challenges in recruitment and engagement due to a lack of participant-facing informational and educational resources. This study investigated the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT4, in generating patient-friendly educational content from clinical trial informed consent forms. Using data from ClinicalTrials.gov, we employed zero-shot learning for creating trial summaries and one-shot learning for developing multiple-choice questions, evaluating their effectiveness through patient surveys and crowdsourced annotation. Results showed that GPT4-generated summaries were both readable and comprehensive, and may improve patients' understanding and interest in clinical trials. The multiple-choice questions demonstrated high accuracy and agreement with crowdsourced annotators. For both resource types, hallucinations were identified that require ongoing human oversight. The findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs ""out-of-the-box"" to support the generation of clinical trial education materials with minimal trial-specific engineering, but implementation with a human-in-the-loop is still needed to avoid misinformation risks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01955v2,2024-12
Self-Improvement in Language Models: The Sharpening Mechanism,"Audrey Huang, Adam Block, Dylan J. Foster, Dhruv Rohatgi, Cyril Zhang, Max Simchowitz, Jordan T. Ash, Akshay Krishnamurthy","Recent work in language modeling has raised the possibility of self-improvement, where a language models evaluates and refines its own generations to achieve higher performance without external feedback. It is impossible for this self-improvement to create information that is not already in the model, so why should we expect that this will lead to improved capabilities? We offer a new perspective on the capabilities of self-improvement through a lens we refer to as sharpening. Motivated by the observation that language models are often better at verifying response quality than they are at generating correct responses, we formalize self-improvement as using the model itself as a verifier during post-training in order to ``sharpen'' the model to one placing large mass on high-quality sequences, thereby amortizing the expensive inference-time computation of generating good sequences. We begin by introducing a new statistical framework for sharpening in which the learner aims to sharpen a pre-trained base policy via sample access, and establish fundamental limits. Then we analyze two natural families of self-improvement algorithms based on SFT and RLHF. We find that (i) the SFT-based approach is minimax optimal whenever the initial model has sufficient coverage, but (ii) the RLHF-based approach can improve over SFT-based self-improvement by leveraging online exploration, bypassing the need for coverage. Finally, we empirically validate the sharpening mechanism via inference-time and amortization experiments. We view these findings as a starting point toward a foundational understanding that can guide the design and evaluation of self-improvement algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01951v2,2024-12
GETAE: Graph information Enhanced deep neural NeTwork ensemble ArchitecturE for fake news detection,"Ciprian-Octavian Truică, Elena-Simona Apostol, Marius Marogel, Adrian Paschke","In today's digital age, fake news has become a major problem that has serious consequences, ranging from social unrest to political upheaval. To address this issue, new methods for detecting and mitigating fake news are required. In this work, we propose to incorporate contextual and network-aware features into the detection process. This involves analyzing not only the content of a news article but also the context in which it was shared and the network of users who shared it, i.e., the information diffusion. Thus, we propose GETAE, \underline{G}raph Information \underline{E}nhanced Deep Neural Ne\underline{t}work Ensemble \underline{A}rchitectur\underline{E} for Fake News Detection, a novel ensemble architecture that uses textual content together with the social interactions to improve fake news detection. GETAE contains two Branches: the Text Branch and the Propagation Branch. The Text Branch uses Word and Transformer Embeddings and a Deep Neural Network based on feed-forward and bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (\textsc{[Bi]RNN}) for learning novel contextual features and creating a novel Text Content Embedding. The Propagation Branch considers the information propagation within the graph network and proposes a Deep Learning architecture that employs Node Embeddings to create novel Propagation Embedding. GETAE Ensemble combines the two novel embeddings, i.e., Text Content Embedding and Propagation Embedding, to create a novel \textit{Propagation-Enhanced Content Embedding} which is afterward used for classification. The experimental results obtained on two real-world publicly available datasets, i.e., Twitter15 and Twitter16, prove that using this approach improves fake news detection and outperforms state-of-the-art models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01825v1,2024-12
Mastering Board Games by External and Internal Planning with Language Models,"John Schultz, Jakub Adamek, Matej Jusup, Marc Lanctot, Michael Kaisers, Sarah Perrin, Daniel Hennes, Jeremy Shar, Cannada Lewis, Anian Ruoss, Tom Zahavy, Petar Veličković, Laurel Prince, Satinder Singh, Eric Malmi, Nenad Tomašev","While large language models perform well on a range of complex tasks (e.g., text generation, question answering, summarization), robust multi-step planning and reasoning remains a considerable challenge for them. In this paper we show that search-based planning can significantly improve LLMs' playing strength across several board games (Chess, Fischer Random / Chess960, Connect Four, and Hex). We introduce, compare and contrast two major approaches: In external search, the model guides Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts and evaluations without calls to an external engine, and in internal search, the model directly generates in-context a linearized tree of potential futures and a resulting final choice. Both build on a language model pre-trained on relevant domain knowledge, capturing the transition and value functions across these games. We find that our pre-training method minimizes hallucinations, as our model is highly accurate regarding state prediction and legal moves. Additionally, both internal and external search indeed improve win-rates against state-of-the-art bots, even reaching Grandmaster-level performance in chess while operating on a similar move count search budget per decision as human Grandmasters. The way we combine search with domain knowledge is not specific to board games, suggesting direct extensions into more general language model inference and training techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12119v1,2024-12
COSMOS: Cross-Modality Self-Distillation for Vision Language Pre-training,"Sanghwan Kim, Rui Xiao, Mariana-Iuliana Georgescu, Stephan Alaniz, Zeynep Akata","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained with contrastive loss have achieved significant advancements in various vision and language tasks. However, the global nature of contrastive loss makes VLMs focus predominantly on foreground objects, neglecting other crucial information in the image, which limits their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose COSMOS: CrOSs-MOdality Self-distillation for vision-language pre-training that integrates a novel text-cropping strategy and cross-attention module into a self-supervised learning framework. We create global and local views of images and texts (i.e., multi-modal augmentations), which are essential for self-distillation in VLMs. We further introduce a cross-attention module, enabling COSMOS to learn comprehensive cross-modal representations optimized via a cross-modality self-distillation loss. COSMOS consistently outperforms previous strong baselines on various zero-shot downstream tasks, including retrieval, classification, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, it surpasses CLIP-based models trained on larger datasets in visual perception and contextual understanding tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01814v1,2024-12
Random Tree Model of Meaningful Memory,"Weishun Zhong, Tankut Can, Antonis Georgiou, Ilya Shnayderman, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks","Traditional studies of memory for meaningful narratives focus on specific stories and their semantic structures but do not address common quantitative features of recall across different narratives. We introduce a statistical ensemble of random trees to represent narratives as hierarchies of key points, where each node is a compressed representation of its descendant leaves, which are the original narrative segments. Recall is modeled as constrained by working memory capacity from this hierarchical structure. Our analytical solution aligns with observations from large-scale narrative recall experiments. Specifically, our model explains that (1) average recall length increases sublinearly with narrative length, and (2) individuals summarize increasingly longer narrative segments in each recall sentence. Additionally, the theory predicts that for sufficiently long narratives, a universal, scale-invariant limit emerges, where the fraction of a narrative summarized by a single recall sentence follows a distribution independent of narrative length.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01806v2,2024-12
A Neurosymbolic Fast and Slow Architecture for Graph Coloring,"Vedant Khandelwal, Vishal Pallagani, Biplav Srivastava, Francesca Rossi","Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) present significant challenges to artificial intelligence due to their intricate constraints and the necessity for precise solutions. Existing symbolic solvers are often slow, and prior research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) alone struggle with CSPs because of their complexity. To bridge this gap, we build upon the existing SOFAI architecture (or SOFAI-v1), which adapts Daniel Kahneman's ''Thinking, Fast and Slow'' cognitive model to AI. Our enhanced architecture, SOFAI-v2, integrates refined metacognitive governance mechanisms to improve adaptability across complex domains, specifically tailored for solving CSPs like graph coloring. SOFAI-v2 combines a fast System 1 (S1) based on LLMs with a deliberative System 2 (S2) governed by a metacognition module. S1's initial solutions, often limited by non-adherence to constraints, are enhanced through metacognitive governance, which provides targeted feedback and examples to adapt S1 to CSP requirements. If S1 fails to solve the problem, metacognition strategically invokes S2, ensuring accurate and reliable solutions. With empirical results, we show that SOFAI-v2 for graph coloring problems achieves a 16.98% increased success rate and is 32.42% faster than symbolic solvers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01752v1,2024-12
Towards Resource Efficient and Interpretable Bias Mitigation in Large Language Models,"Schrasing Tong, Eliott Zemour, Rawisara Lohanimit, Lalana Kagal","Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in a wide range of applications, they have also been observed to perpetuate unwanted biases present in the training data, potentially leading to harm for marginalized communities. In this paper, we mitigate bias by leveraging small biased and anti-biased expert models to obtain a debiasing signal that will be added to the LLM output at decoding-time. This approach combines resource efficiency with interpretability and can be optimized for mitigating specific types of bias, depending on the target use case. Experiments on mitigating gender, race, and religion biases show a reduction in bias on several local and global bias metrics while preserving language model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01711v1,2024-12
Query Performance Explanation through Large Language Model for HTAP Systems,"Haibo Xiu, Li Zhang, Tieying Zhang, Jun Yang, Jianjun Chen","In hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) systems, users often struggle to understand why query plans from one engine (OLAP or OLTP) perform significantly slower than those from another. Although optimizers provide plan details via the EXPLAIN function, these explanations are frequently too technical for non-experts and offer limited insights into performance differences across engines. To address this, we propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to explain query performance in HTAP systems. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our framework constructs a knowledge base that stores historical query executions and expert-curated explanations. To enable efficient retrieval of relevant knowledge, query plans are embedded using a lightweight tree-CNN classifier. This augmentation allows the LLM to generate clear, context-aware explanations of performance differences between engines. Our approach demonstrates the potential of LLMs in hybrid engine systems, paving the way for further advancements in database optimization and user support.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01709v1,2024-12
Are We There Yet? Revealing the Risks of Utilizing Large Language Models in Scholarly Peer Review,"Rui Ye, Xianghe Pang, Jingyi Chai, Jiaao Chen, Zhenfei Yin, Zhen Xiang, Xiaowen Dong, Jing Shao, Siheng Chen","Scholarly peer review is a cornerstone of scientific advancement, but the system is under strain due to increasing manuscript submissions and the labor-intensive nature of the process. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to their integration into peer review, with promising results such as substantial overlaps between LLM- and human-generated reviews. However, the unchecked adoption of LLMs poses significant risks to the integrity of the peer review system. In this study, we comprehensively analyze the vulnerabilities of LLM-generated reviews by focusing on manipulation and inherent flaws. Our experiments show that injecting covert deliberate content into manuscripts allows authors to explicitly manipulate LLM reviews, leading to inflated ratings and reduced alignment with human reviews. In a simulation, we find that manipulating 5% of the reviews could potentially cause 12% of the papers to lose their position in the top 30% rankings. Implicit manipulation, where authors strategically highlight minor limitations in their papers, further demonstrates LLMs' susceptibility compared to human reviewers, with a 4.5 times higher consistency with disclosed limitations. Additionally, LLMs exhibit inherent flaws, such as potentially assigning higher ratings to incomplete papers compared to full papers and favoring well-known authors in single-blind review process. These findings highlight the risks of over-reliance on LLMs in peer review, underscoring that we are not yet ready for widespread adoption and emphasizing the need for robust safeguards.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01708v1,2024-12
Can We Afford The Perfect Prompt? Balancing Cost and Accuracy with the Economical Prompting Index,"Tyler McDonald, Anthony Colosimo, Yifeng Li, Ali Emami","As prompt engineering research rapidly evolves, evaluations beyond accuracy are crucial for developing cost-effective techniques. We present the Economical Prompting Index (EPI), a novel metric that combines accuracy scores with token consumption, adjusted by a user-specified cost concern level to reflect different resource constraints. Our study examines 6 advanced prompting techniques, including Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Tree of Thoughts, across 10 widely-used language models and 4 diverse datasets. We demonstrate that approaches such as Self-Consistency often provide statistically insignificant gains while becoming cost-prohibitive. For example, on high-performing models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the EPI of simpler techniques like Chain-of-Thought (0.72) surpasses more complex methods like Self-Consistency (0.64) at slight cost concern levels. Our findings suggest a reevaluation of complex prompting strategies in resource-constrained scenarios, potentially reshaping future research priorities and improving cost-effectiveness for end-users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01690v1,2024-12
R-Bot: An LLM-based Query Rewrite System,"Zhaoyan Sun, Xuanhe Zhou, Guoliang Li","Query rewrite is essential for optimizing SQL queries to improve their execution efficiency without changing their results. Traditionally, this task has been tackled through heuristic and learning-based methods, each with its limitations in terms of inferior quality and low robustness. Recent advancements in LLMs offer a new paradigm by leveraging their superior natural language and code comprehension abilities. Despite their potential, directly applying LLMs like GPT-4 has faced challenges due to problems such as hallucinations, where the model might generate inaccurate or irrelevant results. To address this, we propose R-Bot, an LLM-based query rewrite system with a systematic approach. We first design a multi-source rewrite evidence preparation pipeline to generate query rewrite evidences for guiding LLMs to avoid hallucinations. We then propose a hybrid structure-semantics retrieval method that combines structural and semantic analysis to retrieve the most relevant rewrite evidences for effectively answering an online query. We next propose a step-by-step LLM rewrite method that iteratively leverages the retrieved evidences to select and arrange rewrite rules with self-reflection. We conduct comprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, and demonstrate the superior performance of our system, R-Bot, surpassing state-of-the-art query rewrite methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01661v1,2024-12
Concept Based Continuous Prompts for Interpretable Text Classification,"Qian Chen, Dongyang Li, Xiaofeng He","Continuous prompts have become widely adopted for augmenting performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, the underlying mechanism of this enhancement remains obscure. Previous studies rely on individual words for interpreting continuous prompts, which lacks comprehensive semantic understanding. Drawing inspiration from Concept Bottleneck Models, we propose a framework for interpreting continuous prompts by decomposing them into human-readable concepts. Specifically, to ensure the feasibility of the decomposition, we demonstrate that a corresponding concept embedding matrix and a coefficient matrix can always be found to replace the prompt embedding matrix. Then, we employ GPT-4o to generate a concept pool and choose potential candidate concepts that are discriminative and representative using a novel submodular optimization algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can achieve similar results as the original P-tuning and word-based approaches using only a few concepts while providing more plausible results.

Using Large Language Models in Automatic Hint Ranking and Generation Tasks,"Jamshid Mozafari, Florian Gerhold, Adam Jatowt","The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly recently, with individuals frequently interacting with chatbots to receive answers to a wide range of questions. In an era where information is readily accessible, it is crucial to stimulate and preserve human cognitive abilities and maintain strong reasoning skills. This paper addresses such challenges by promoting the use of hints as an alternative or a supplement to direct answers. We first introduce a manually constructed hint dataset, WIKIHINT, which includes 5,000 hints created for 1,000 questions. We then finetune open-source LLMs such as LLaMA-3.1 for hint generation in answer-aware and answer-agnostic contexts. We assess the effectiveness of the hints with human participants who try to answer questions with and without the aid of hints. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight evaluation method, HINTRANK, to evaluate and rank hints in both answer-aware and answer-agnostic settings. Our findings show that (a) the dataset helps generate more effective hints, (b) including answer information along with questions generally improves hint quality, and (c) encoder-based models perform better than decoder-based models in hint ranking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01626v1,2024-12
CHIMA: Headline-Guided Extractive Summarization for Thai News Articles,"Pimpitchaya Kositcharoensuk, Nakarin Sritrakool, Ploy N. Pratanwanich","Text summarization is a process of condensing lengthy texts while preserving their essential information. Previous studies have predominantly focused on high-resource languages, while low-resource languages like Thai have received less attention. Furthermore, earlier extractive summarization models for Thai texts have primarily relied on the article's body, without considering the headline. This omission can result in the exclusion of key sentences from the summary. To address these limitations, we propose CHIMA, an extractive summarization model that incorporates the contextual information of the headline for Thai news articles. Our model utilizes a pre-trained language model to capture complex language semantics and assigns a probability to each sentence to be included in the summary. By leveraging the headline to guide sentence selection, CHIMA enhances the model's ability to recover important sentences and discount irrelevant ones. Additionally, we introduce two strategies for aggregating headline-body similarities, simple average and harmonic mean, providing flexibility in sentence selection to accommodate varying writing styles. Experiments on publicly available Thai news datasets demonstrate that CHIMA outperforms baseline models across ROUGE, BLEU, and F1 scores. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating the headline-body similarities as model guidance. The results also indicate an enhancement in the model's ability to recall critical sentences, even those scattered throughout the middle or end of the article. With this potential, headline-guided extractive summarization offers a promising approach to improve the quality and relevance of summaries for Thai news articles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01624v1,2024-12
NYT-Connections: A Deceptively Simple Text Classification Task that Stumps System-1 Thinkers,"Angel Yahir Loredo Lopez, Tyler McDonald, Ali Emami","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on various benchmarks, yet their ability to engage in deliberate reasoning remains questionable. We present NYT-Connections, a collection of 358 simple word classification puzzles derived from the New York Times Connections game. This benchmark is designed to penalize quick, intuitive ""System 1"" thinking, isolating fundamental reasoning skills. We evaluated six recent LLMs, a simple machine learning heuristic, and humans across three configurations: single-attempt, multiple attempts without hints, and multiple attempts with contextual hints. Our findings reveal a significant performance gap: even top-performing LLMs like GPT-4 fall short of human performance by nearly 30%. Notably, advanced prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency show diminishing returns as task difficulty increases. NYT-Connections uniquely combines linguistic isolation, resistance to intuitive shortcuts, and regular updates to mitigate data leakage, offering a novel tool for assessing LLM reasoning capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01621v1,2024-12
If Eleanor Rigby Had Met ChatGPT: A Study on Loneliness in a Post-LLM World,Adrian de Wynter,"Loneliness, or the lack of fulfilling relationships, significantly impacts a person's mental and physical well-being and is prevalent worldwide. Previous research suggests that large language models (LLMs) may help mitigate loneliness. However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs like ChatGPT is more prevalent--and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT, particularly those outside of its marketed use as task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22 times more likely to be targeted than men. Our findings underscore ethical and legal questions about this technology, and note risks like radicalisation or further isolation. We conclude with recommendations for research and industry to address loneliness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01617v1,2024-12
Medchain: Bridging the Gap Between LLM Agents and Clinical Practice through Interactive Sequential Benchmarking,"Jie Liu, Wenxuan Wang, Zizhan Ma, Guolin Huang, Yihang SU, Kao-Jung Chang, Wenting Chen, Haoliang Li, Linlin Shen, Michael Lyu","Clinical decision making (CDM) is a complex, dynamic process crucial to healthcare delivery, yet it remains a significant challenge for artificial intelligence systems. While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have been tested on general medical knowledge using licensing exams and knowledge question-answering tasks, their performance in the CDM in real-world scenarios is limited due to the lack of comprehensive testing datasets that mirror actual medical practice. To address this gap, we present MedChain, a dataset of 12,163 clinical cases that covers five key stages of clinical workflow. MedChain distinguishes itself from existing benchmarks with three key features of real-world clinical practice: personalization, interactivity, and sequentiality. Further, to tackle real-world CDM challenges, we also propose MedChain-Agent, an AI system that integrates a feedback mechanism and a MCase-RAG module to learn from previous cases and adapt its responses. MedChain-Agent demonstrates remarkable adaptability in gathering information dynamically and handling sequential clinical tasks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Scaling Law for Language Models Training Considering Batch Size,"Xian Shuai, Yiding Wang, Yimeng Wu, Xin Jiang, Xiaozhe Ren","Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable advances in recent years, with scaling laws playing a critical role in this rapid progress. In this paper, we empirically investigate how a critical hyper-parameter, i.e., the global batch size, influences the LLM training prdocess. We begin by training language models ranging from 125 million to 2.6 billion parameters, using up to 300 billion high-quality tokens. Through these experiments, we establish a basic scaling law on model size and training data amount. We then examine how varying batch sizes and learning rates affect the convergence and generalization of these models. Our analysis yields batch size scaling laws under two different cases: with a fixed compute budget, and with a fixed amount of training data. Extrapolation experiments on models of increasing sizes validate our predicted laws, which provides guidance for optimizing LLM training strategies under specific resource constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01505v1,2024-12
Early Exit Is a Natural Capability in Transformer-based Models: An Empirical Study on Early Exit without Joint Optimization,"Weiqiao Shan, Long Meng, Tong Zheng, Yingfeng Luo, Bei Li, junxin Wang, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across various downstream tasks. However, they encounter limitations due to slow inference speeds stemming from their extensive parameters. The early exit (EE) is an approach that aims to accelerate auto-regressive decoding. EE generates outputs from intermediate layers instead of using the whole model, which offers a promising solution to this challenge. However, additional output layers and joint optimization used in conventional EE hinder the application of EE in LLMs.   In this paper, we explore the possibility of LLMs EE without additional output layers and joint optimization. Our findings indicate that EE is a natural capability within transformer-based models. While joint optimization does not give model EE capability, it must be employed to address challenges by improving the accuracy of locating the optimal EE layer through gating functions. Additionally, our study reveals patterns in EE behavior from a sub-word perspective based on the LLaMA model and the potential possibility for EE based on sub-layers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01455v1,2024-12
PLD+: Accelerating LLM inference by leveraging Language Model Artifacts,"Shwetha Somasundaram, Anirudh Phukan, Apoorv Saxena","To reduce the latency associated with autoretrogressive LLM inference, speculative decoding has emerged as a novel decoding paradigm, where future tokens are drafted and verified in parallel. However, the practical deployment of speculative decoding is hindered by its requirements for additional computational resources and fine-tuning, which limits its out-of-the-box usability. To address these challenges, we present PLD+, a suite of novel algorithms developed to accelerate the inference process of LLMs, particularly for input-guided tasks. These tasks, which include code editing, text editing, summarization, etc., often feature outputs with substantial overlap with their inputs-an attribute PLD+ is designed to exploit. PLD+ also leverages the artifacts (attention and hidden states) generated during inference to accelerate inference speed. We test our approach on five input-guided tasks and through extensive experiments we find that PLD+ outperforms all tuning-free approaches. In the greedy setting, it even outperforms the state-of-the-art tuning-dependent approach EAGLE on four of the tasks. (by a margin of upto 2.31 in terms of avg. speedup).

Multi-Facet Blending for Faceted Query-by-Example Retrieval,"Heejin Do, Sangwon Ryu, Jonghwi Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee","With the growing demand to fit fine-grained user intents, faceted query-by-example (QBE), which retrieves similar documents conditioned on specific facets, has gained recent attention. However, prior approaches mainly depend on document-level comparisons using basic indicators like citations due to the lack of facet-level relevance datasets; yet, this limits their use to citation-based domains and fails to capture the intricacies of facet constraints. In this paper, we propose a multi-facet blending (FaBle) augmentation method, which exploits modularity by decomposing and recomposing to explicitly synthesize facet-specific training sets. We automatically decompose documents into facet units and generate (ir)relevant pairs by leveraging LLMs' intrinsic distinguishing capabilities; then, dynamically recomposing the units leads to facet-wise relevance-informed document pairs. Our modularization eliminates the need for pre-defined facet knowledge or labels. Further, to prove the FaBle's efficacy in a new domain beyond citation-based scientific paper retrieval, we release a benchmark dataset for educational exam item QBE. FaBle augmentation on 1K documents remarkably assists training in obtaining facet conditional embeddings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01443v1,2024-12
A Top-down Graph-based Tool for Modeling Classical Semantic Maps: A Crosslinguistic Case Study of Supplementary Adverbs,"Zhu Liu, Cunliang Kong, Ying Liu, Maosong Sun","Semantic map models (SMMs) construct a network-like conceptual space from cross-linguistic instances or forms, based on the connectivity hypothesis. This approach has been widely used to represent similarity and entailment relationships in cross-linguistic concept comparisons. However, most SMMs are manually built by human experts using bottom-up procedures, which are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based algorithm that automatically generates conceptual spaces and SMMs in a top-down manner. The algorithm begins by creating a dense graph, which is subsequently pruned into maximum spanning trees, selected according to metrics we propose. These evaluation metrics include both intrinsic and extrinsic measures, considering factors such as network structure and the trade-off between precision and coverage. A case study on cross-linguistic supplementary adverbs demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our model compared to human annotations and other automated methods.

Impromptu Cybercrime Euphemism Detection,"Xiang Li, Yucheng Zhou, Laiping Zhao, Jing Li, Fangming Liu","Detecting euphemisms is essential for content security on various social media platforms, but existing methods designed for detecting euphemisms are ineffective in impromptu euphemisms. In this work, we make a first attempt to an exploration of impromptu euphemism detection and introduce the Impromptu Cybercrime Euphemisms Detection (ICED) dataset. Moreover, we propose a detection framework tailored to this problem, which employs context augmentation modeling and multi-round iterative training. Our detection framework mainly consists of a coarse-grained and a fine-grained classification model. The coarse-grained classification model removes most of the harmless content in the corpus to be detected. The fine-grained model, impromptu euphemisms detector, integrates context augmentation and multi-round iterations training to better predicts the actual meaning of a masked token. In addition, we leverage ChatGPT to evaluate the mode's capability.

We investigate the potential of pre-trained audio representations for detecting abusive language in low-resource languages, in this case, in Indian languages using Few Shot Learning (FSL). Leveraging powerful representations from models such as Wav2Vec and Whisper, we explore cross-lingual abuse detection using the ADIMA dataset with FSL. Our approach integrates these representations within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework to classify abusive language in 10 languages. We experiment with various shot sizes (50-200) evaluating the impact of limited data on performance. Additionally, a feature visualization study was conducted to better understand model behaviour. This study highlights the generalization ability of pre-trained models in low-resource scenarios and offers valuable insights into detecting abusive language in multilingual contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01408v3,2024-12
CLASSLA-Express: a Train of CLARIN.SI Workshops on Language Resources and Tools with Easily Expanding Route,"Nikola Ljubešić, Taja Kuzman, Ivana Filipović Petrović, Jelena Parizoska, Petya Osenova","This paper introduces the CLASSLA-Express workshop series as an innovative approach to disseminating linguistic resources and infrastructure provided by the CLASSLA Knowledge Centre for South Slavic languages and the Slovenian CLARIN.SI infrastructure. The workshop series employs two key strategies: (1) conducting workshops directly in countries with interested audiences, and (2) designing the series for easy expansion to new venues. The first iteration of the CLASSLA-Express workshop series encompasses 6 workshops in 5 countries. Its goal is to share knowledge on the use of corpus querying tools, as well as the recently-released CLASSLA-web corpora - the largest general corpora for South Slavic languages. In the paper, we present the design of the workshop series, its current scope and the effortless extensions of the workshop to new venues that are already in sight.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01386v1,2024-12
Efficient LLM Inference using Dynamic Input Pruning and Cache-Aware Masking,"Marco Federici, Davide Belli, Mart van Baalen, Amir Jalalirad, Andrii Skliar, Bence Major, Markus Nagel, Paul Whatmough","While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which result in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46% reduction in memory and 40% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01380v1,2024-12
Adapting Large Language Models to Log Analysis with Interpretable Domain Knowledge,"Yuhe Ji, Yilun Liu, Feiyu Yao, Minggui He, Shimin Tao, Xiaofeng Zhao, Su Chang, Xinhua Yang, Weibin Meng, Yuming Xie, Boxing Chen, Hao Yang","The increasing complexity of computer systems necessitates innovative approaches to fault and error management, going beyond traditional manual log analysis. While existing solutions using large language models (LLMs) show promise, they are limited by a gap between natural and domain-specific languages, which restricts their effectiveness in real-world applications. Our approach addresses these limitations by integrating interpretable domain knowledge into open-source LLMs through continual pre-training (CPT), enhancing performance on log tasks while retaining natural language processing capabilities. We created a comprehensive dataset, NLPLog, with over 250,000 question-answer pairs to facilitate this integration. Our model, SuperLog, trained with this dataset, achieves the best performance across four log analysis tasks, surpassing the second-best model by an average of 12.01%. Our contributions include a novel CPT paradigm that significantly improves model performance, the development of SuperLog with state-of-the-art results, and the release of a large-scale dataset to support further research in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01377v1,2024-12
Understanding the World's Museums through Vision-Language Reasoning,"Ada-Astrid Balauca, Sanjana Garai, Stefan Balauca, Rasesh Udayakumar Shetty, Naitik Agrawal, Dhwanil Subhashbhai Shah, Yuqian Fu, Xi Wang, Kristina Toutanova, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool","Museums serve as vital repositories of cultural heritage and historical artifacts spanning diverse epochs, civilizations, and regions, preserving well-documented collections. Data reveal key attributes such as age, origin, material, and cultural significance. Understanding museum exhibits from their images requires reasoning beyond visual features. In this work, we facilitate such reasoning by (a) collecting and curating a large-scale dataset of 65M images and 200M question-answer pairs in the standard museum catalog format for exhibits from all around the world; (b) training large vision-language models on the collected dataset; (c) benchmarking their ability on five visual question answering tasks. The complete dataset is labeled by museum experts, ensuring the quality as well as the practical significance of the labels. We train two VLMs from different categories: the BLIP model, with vision-language aligned embeddings, but lacking the expressive power of large language models, and the LLaVA model, a powerful instruction-tuned LLM enriched with vision-language reasoning capabilities. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several insights on the complex and fine-grained understanding of museum exhibits. In particular, we show that some questions whose answers can often be derived directly from visual features are well answered by both types of models. On the other hand, questions that require the grounding of the visual features in repositories of human knowledge are better answered by the large vision-language models, thus demonstrating their superior capacity to perform the desired reasoning.

A 2-step Framework for Automated Literary Translation Evaluation: Its Promises and Pitfalls,"Sheikh Shafayat, Dongkeun Yoon, Woori Jang, Jiwoo Choi, Alice Oh, Seohyon Jung","In this work, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of a two-stage pipeline to evaluate literary machine translation, in a fine-grained manner, from English to Korean. The results show that our framework provides fine-grained, interpretable metrics suited for literary translation and obtains a higher correlation with human judgment than traditional machine translation metrics. Nonetheless, it still fails to match inter-human agreement, especially in metrics like Korean Honorifics. We also observe that LLMs tend to favor translations generated by other LLMs, and we highlight the necessity of developing more sophisticated evaluation methods to ensure accurate and culturally sensitive machine translation of literary works.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01340v2,2024-12
Exploring Long-Term Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes Microvascular Complications,"Elizabeth Remfry, Rafael Henkin, Michael R Barnes, Aakanksha Naik","Electronic healthcare records (EHR) contain a huge wealth of data that can support the prediction of clinical outcomes. EHR data is often stored and analysed using clinical codes (ICD10, SNOMED), however these can differ across registries and healthcare providers. Integrating data across systems involves mapping between different clinical ontologies requiring domain expertise, and at times resulting in data loss. To overcome this, code-agnostic models have been proposed. We assess the effectiveness of a code-agnostic representation approach on the task of long-term microvascular complication prediction for individuals living with Type 2 Diabetes. Our method encodes individual EHRs as text using fine-tuned, pretrained clinical language models. Leveraging large-scale EHR data from the UK, we employ a multi-label approach to simultaneously predict the risk of microvascular complications across 1-, 5-, and 10-year windows. We demonstrate that a code-agnostic approach outperforms a code-based model and illustrate that performance is better with longer prediction windows but is biased to the first occurring complication. Overall, we highlight that context length is vitally important for model performance. This study highlights the possibility of including data from across different clinical ontologies and is a starting point for generalisable clinical models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01331v1,2024-12
"The ""LLM World of Words"" English free association norms generated by large language models","Katherine Abramski, Riccardo Improta, Giulio Rossetti, Massimo Stella","Free associations have been extensively used in cognitive psychology and linguistics for studying how conceptual knowledge is organized. Recently, the potential of applying a similar approach for investigating the knowledge encoded in LLMs has emerged, specifically as a method for investigating LLM biases. However, the absence of large-scale LLM-generated free association norms that are comparable with human-generated norms is an obstacle to this new research direction. To address this limitation, we create a new dataset of LLM-generated free association norms modeled after the ""Small World of Words"" (SWOW) human-generated norms consisting of approximately 12,000 cue words. We prompt three LLMs, namely Mistral, Llama3, and Haiku, with the same cues as those in the SWOW norms to generate three novel comparable datasets, the ""LLM World of Words"" (LWOW). Using both SWOW and LWOW norms, we construct cognitive network models of semantic memory that represent the conceptual knowledge possessed by humans and LLMs. We demonstrate how these datasets can be used for investigating implicit biases in humans and LLMs, such as the harmful gender stereotypes that are prevalent both in society and LLM outputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01330v1,2024-12
SiTSE: Sinhala Text Simplification Dataset and Evaluation,"Surangika Ranathunga, Rumesh Sirithunga, Himashi Rathnayake, Lahiru De Silva, Thamindu Aluthwala, Saman Peramuna, Ravi Shekhar","Text Simplification is a task that has been minimally explored for low-resource languages. Consequently, there are only a few manually curated datasets. In this paper, we present a human curated sentence-level text simplification dataset for the Sinhala language. Our evaluation dataset contains 1,000 complex sentences and corresponding 3,000 simplified sentences produced by three different human annotators. We model the text simplification task as a zero-shot and zero resource sequence-to-sequence (seq-seq) task on the multilingual language models mT5 and mBART. We exploit auxiliary data from related seq-seq tasks and explore the possibility of using intermediate task transfer learning (ITTL). Our analysis shows that ITTL outperforms the previously proposed zero-resource methods for text simplification. Our findings also highlight the challenges in evaluating text simplification systems, and support the calls for improved metrics for measuring the quality of automated text simplification systems that would suit low-resource languages as well.

Shadow of the (Hierarchical) Tree: Reconciling Symbolic and Predictive Components of the Neural Code for Syntax,Elliot Murphy,"Natural language syntax can serve as a major test for how to integrate two infamously distinct frameworks: symbolic representations and connectionist neural networks. Building on a recent neurocomputational architecture for syntax (ROSE), I discuss the prospects of reconciling the neural code for hierarchical 'vertical' syntax with linear and predictive 'horizontal' processes via a hybrid neurosymbolic model. I argue that the former can be accounted for via the higher levels of ROSE in terms of vertical phrase structure representations, while the latter can explain horizontal forms of linguistic information via the tuning of the lower levels to statistical and perceptual inferences. One prediction of this is that artificial language models will contribute to the cognitive neuroscience of horizontal morphosyntax, but much less so to hierarchically compositional structures. I claim that this perspective helps resolve many current tensions in the literature. Options for integrating these two neural codes are discussed, with particular emphasis on how predictive coding mechanisms can serve as interfaces between symbolic oscillatory phase codes and population codes for the statistics of linearized aspects of syntax. Lastly, I provide a neurosymbolic mathematical model for how to inject symbolic representations into a neural regime encoding lexico-semantic statistical features.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01276v1,2024-12
MuLan: Adapting Multilingual Diffusion Models for Hundreds of Languages with Negligible Cost,"Sen Xing, Muyan Zhong, Zeqiang Lai, Liangchen Li, Jiawen Liu, Yaohui Wang, Jifeng Dai, Wenhai Wang","In this work, we explore a cost-effective framework for multilingual image generation. We find that, unlike models tuned on high-quality images with multilingual annotations, leveraging text encoders pre-trained on widely available, noisy Internet image-text pairs significantly enhances data efficiency in text-to-image (T2I) generation across multiple languages. Based on this insight, we introduce MuLan, Multi-Language adapter, a lightweight language adapter with fewer than 20M parameters, trained alongside a frozen text encoder and image diffusion model. Compared to previous multilingual T2I models, this framework offers: (1) Cost efficiency. Using readily accessible English data and off-the-shelf multilingual text encoders minimizes the training cost; (2) High performance. Achieving comparable generation capabilities in over 110 languages with CLIP similarity scores nearly matching those in English (38.61 for English vs. 37.61 for other languages); and (3) Broad applicability.

CPRM: A LLM-based Continual Pre-training Framework for Relevance Modeling in Commercial Search,"Kaixin Wu, Yixin Ji, Zeyuan Chen, Qiang Wang, Cunxiang Wang, Hong Liu, Baijun Ji, Jia Xu, Zhongyi Liu, Jinjie Gu, Yuan Zhou, Linjian Mo","Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01269v3,2024-12
Indexing Economic Fluctuation Narratives from Keiki Watchers Survey,"Eriko Shigetsugu, Hiroki Sakaji, Itsuki Noda","In this paper, we design indices of economic fluctuation narratives derived from economic surveys. Companies, governments, and investors rely on key metrics like GDP and industrial production indices to predict economic trends. However, they have yet to effectively leverage the wealth of information contained in economic text, such as causal relationships, in their economic forecasting. Therefore, we design indices of economic fluctuation from economic surveys by using our previously proposed narrative framework. From the evaluation results, it is observed that the proposed indices had a stronger correlation with cumulative lagging diffusion index than other types of diffusion indices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01265v1,2024-12
Do Large Language Models with Reasoning and Acting Meet the Needs of Task-Oriented Dialogue?,"Michelle Elizabeth, Morgan Veyret, Miguel Couceiro, Ondrej Dusek, Lina M. Rojas-Barahona","Large language models (LLMs) gained immense popularity due to their impressive capabilities in unstructured conversations. However, they underperform compared to previous approaches in task-oriented dialogue (TOD), wherein reasoning and accessing external information are crucial. Empowering LLMs with advanced prompting strategies such as reasoning and acting (ReAct) has shown promise in solving complex tasks traditionally requiring reinforcement learning. In this work, we apply the ReAct strategy to guide LLMs performing TOD. We evaluate ReAct-based LLMs (ReAct-LLMs) both in simulation and with real users. While ReAct-LLMs seem to underperform state-of-the-art approaches in simulation, human evaluation indicates higher user satisfaction rate compared to handcrafted systems despite having a lower success rate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01262v1,2024-12

It achieves exceptional performance, ranking 6th overall on Chatbot Arena, with particularly strong results (2nd to 4th place) in specialized categories including Chinese, Math, Coding, and Hard Prompts. Yi-Lightning leverages an enhanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, featuring advanced expert segmentation and routing mechanisms coupled with optimized KV-caching techniques. Our development process encompasses comprehensive pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), where we devise deliberate strategies for multi-stage training, synthetic data construction, and reward modeling. Furthermore, we implement RAISE (Responsible AI Safety Engine), a four-component framework to address safety issues across pre-training, post-training, and serving phases. Empowered by our scalable super-computing infrastructure, all these innovations substantially reduce training, deployment and inference costs while maintaining high-performance standards. With further evaluations on public academic benchmarks, Yi-Lightning demonstrates competitive performance against top-tier LLMs, while we observe a notable disparity between traditional, static benchmark results and real-world, dynamic human preferences.

Data Uncertainty-Aware Learning for Multimodal Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Hao Yang, Zhenyu Zhang, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin","As a fine-grained task, multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis (MABSA) mainly focuses on identifying aspect-level sentiment information in the text-image pair. However, we observe that it is difficult to recognize the sentiment of aspects in low-quality samples, such as those with low-resolution images that tend to contain noise. And in the real world, the quality of data usually varies for different samples, such noise is called data uncertainty. But previous works for the MABSA task treat different quality samples with the same importance and ignored the influence of data uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel data uncertainty-aware multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis approach, UA-MABSA, which weighted the loss of different samples by the data quality and difficulty. UA-MABSA adopts a novel quality assessment strategy that takes into account both the image quality and the aspect-based cross-modal relevance, thus enabling the model to pay more attention to high-quality and challenging samples. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Twitter-2015 dataset. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the quality assessment strategy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01249v1,2024-12
GraphOTTER: Evolving LLM-based Graph Reasoning for Complex Table Question Answering,"Qianlong Li, Chen Huang, Shuai Li, Yuanxin Xiang, Deng Xiong, Wenqiang Lei","Complex Table Question Answering involves providing accurate answers to specific questions based on intricate tables that exhibit complex layouts and flexible header locations. Despite considerable progress having been made in the LLM era, the reasoning processes of existing methods are often implicit, feeding the entire table into prompts, making it difficult to effectively filter out irrelevant information in the table. To this end, we propose GraphOTTER that explicitly establishes the reasoning process to pinpoint the correct answers. In particular, GraphOTTER leverages a graph-based representation, transforming the complex table into an undirected graph. It then conducts step-by-step reasoning on the graph, with each step guided by a set of pre-defined intermediate reasoning actions. As such, it constructs a clear reasoning path and effectively identifies the answer to a given question. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and two LLM backbones demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphOTTER. Further analysis indicates that its success may be attributed to the ability to efficiently filter out irrelevant information, thereby focusing the reasoning process on the most pertinent data.

This paper introduces the Composition of Experts (CoE), a modular compound AI system leveraging multiple expert LLMs. CoE leverages a router to dynamically select the most appropriate expert for a given input, enabling efficient utilization of resources and improved performance. We formulate the general problem of training a CoE and discuss inherent complexities associated with it. We propose a two-step routing approach to address these complexities that first uses a router to classify the input into distinct categories followed by a category-to-expert mapping to obtain desired experts. CoE offers a flexible and cost-effective solution to build compound AI systems. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of CoE in achieving superior performance with reduced computational overhead.

First numerical observation of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in language models,"Yuma Toji, Jun Takahashi, Vwani Roychowdhury, Hideyuki Miyahara","Several power-law critical properties involving different statistics in natural languages -- reminiscent of scaling properties of physical systems at or near phase transitions -- have been documented for decades.   The recent rise of large language models (LLMs) has added further evidence and excitement by providing intriguing similarities with notions in physics such as scaling laws and emergent abilities.   However, specific instances of classes of generative language models that exhibit phase transitions, as understood by the statistical physics community, are lacking.   In this work, inspired by the one-dimensional Potts model in statistical physics we construct a simple probabilistic language model that falls under the class of context sensitive grammars (CSG), and numerically demonstrate an unambiguous phase transition in the framework of a natural language model.   We explicitly show that a precisely defined order parameter -- that captures symbol frequency biases in the sentences generated by the language model -- changes from strictly 0 to a strictly nonzero value (in the infinite-length limit of sentences), implying a mathematical singularity arising when tuning the parameter of the stochastic language model we consider.   Furthermore, we identify the phase transition as a variant of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, which is known to exhibit critical properties not only at the transition point but also in the entire phase.   This finding leads to the possibility that critical properties in natural languages may not require careful fine-tuning nor self-organized criticality, but is generically explained by the underlying connection between language structures and the BKT phases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01212v1,2024-12

SailCompass encompasses three main SEA languages, eight primary tasks including 14 datasets covering three task types (generation, multiple-choice questions, and classification). To improve the robustness of the evaluation approach, we explore different prompt configurations for multiple-choice questions and leverage calibrations to improve the faithfulness of classification tasks. With SailCompass, we derive the following findings: (1) SEA-specialized LLMs still outperform general LLMs, although the gap has narrowed; (2) A balanced language distribution is important for developing better SEA-specialized LLMs; (3) Advanced prompting techniques (e.g., calibration, perplexity-based ranking) are necessary to better utilize LLMs. All datasets and evaluation scripts are public.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01186v1,2024-12
A Comprehensive Evaluation of Semantic Relation Knowledge of Pretrained Language Models and Humans,"Zhihan Cao, Hiroaki Yamada, Simone Teufel, Takenobu Tokunaga","Recently, much work has concerned itself with the enigma of what exactly PLMs (pretrained language models) learn about different aspects of language, and how they learn it. One stream of this type of research investigates the knowledge that PLMs have about semantic relations. However, many aspects of semantic relations were left unexplored. Only one relation was considered, namely hypernymy. Furthermore, previous work did not measure humans' performance on the same task as that solved by the PLMs. This means that at this point in time, there is only an incomplete view of models' semantic relation knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework covering five relations beyond hypernymy, namely hyponymy, holonymy, meronymy, antonymy, and synonymy. We use six metrics (two newly introduced here) for recently untreated aspects of semantic relation knowledge, namely soundness, completeness, symmetry, asymmetry, prototypicality, and distinguishability and fairly compare humans and models on the same task. Our extensive experiments involve 16 PLMs, eight masked and eight causal language models. Up to now only masked language models had been tested although causal and masked language models treat context differently. Our results reveal a significant knowledge gap between humans and models for almost all semantic relations. Antonymy is the outlier relation where all models perform reasonably well. In general, masked language models perform significantly better than causal language models. Nonetheless, both masked and causal language models are likely to confuse non-antonymy relations with antonymy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01131v1,2024-12

Revisiting Absence withSymptoms that *T* Show up Decades Later to Recover Empty Categories,"Emily Chen, Nicholas Huang, Casey Robinson, Kevin Xu, Zihao Huang, Jungyeul Park","This paper explores null elements in English, Chinese, and Korean Penn treebanks. Null elements contain important syntactic and semantic information, yet they have typically been treated as entities to be removed during language processing tasks, particularly in constituency parsing. Thus, we work towards the removal and, in particular, the restoration of null elements in parse trees. We focus on expanding a rule-based approach utilizing linguistic context information to Chinese, as rule based approaches have historically only been applied to English. We also worked to conduct neural experiments with a language agnostic sequence-to-sequence model to recover null elements for English (PTB), Chinese (CTB) and Korean (KTB). To the best of the authors' knowledge, null elements in three different languages have been explored and compared for the first time. In expanding a rule based approach to Chinese, we achieved an overall F1 score of 80.00, which is comparable to past results in the CTB.

Automated Extraction of Acronym-Expansion Pairs from Scientific Papers,"Izhar Ali, Million Haileyesus, Serhiy Hnatyshyn, Jan-Lucas Ott, Vasil Hnatyshin","This project addresses challenges posed by the widespread use of abbreviations and acronyms in digital texts. We propose a novel method that combines document preprocessing, regular expressions, and a large language model to identify abbreviations and map them to their corresponding expansions. The regular expressions alone are often insufficient to extract expansions, at which point our approach leverages GPT-4 to analyze the text surrounding the acronyms. By limiting the analysis to only a small portion of the surrounding text, we mitigate the risk of obtaining incorrect or multiple expansions for an acronym. There are several known challenges in processing text with acronyms, including polysemous acronyms, non-local and ambiguous acronyms. Our approach enhances the precision and efficiency of NLP techniques by addressing these issues with automated acronym identification and disambiguation. This study highlights the challenges of working with PDF files and the importance of document preprocessing. Furthermore, the results of this work show that neither regular expressions nor GPT-4 alone can perform well. Regular expressions are suitable for identifying acronyms but have limitations in finding their expansions within the paper due to a variety of formats used for expressing acronym-expansion pairs and the tendency of authors to omit expansions within the text. GPT-4, on the other hand, is an excellent tool for obtaining expansions but struggles with correctly identifying all relevant acronyms. Additionally, GPT-4 poses challenges due to its probabilistic nature, which may lead to slightly different results for the same input. Our algorithm employs preprocessing to eliminate irrelevant information from the text, regular expressions for identifying acronyms, and a large language model to help find acronym expansions to provide the most accurate and consistent results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01093v1,2024-12
"Advancing Speech Language Models by Scaling Supervised Fine-Tuning with Over 60,000 Hours of Synthetic Speech Dialogue Data","Shuaijiang Zhao, Tingwei Guo, Bajian Xiang, Tongtang Wan, Qiang Niu, Wei Zou, Xiangang Li","The GPT-4o represents a significant milestone in enabling real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, its remarkable low latency and high fluency not only capture attention but also stimulate research interest in the field. This real-time speech interaction is particularly valuable in scenarios requiring rapid feedback and immediate responses, dramatically enhancing user experience. However, there is a notable lack of research focused on real-time large speech language models, particularly for Chinese. In this work, we present KE-Omni, a seamless large speech language model built upon Ke-SpeechChat, a large-scale high-quality synthetic speech interaction dataset consisting of 7 million Chinese and English conversations, featuring 42,002 speakers, and totaling over 60,000 hours, This contributes significantly to the advancement of research and development in this field.

SAUP: Situation Awareness Uncertainty Propagation on LLM Agent,"Qiwei Zhao, Xujiang Zhao, Yanchi Liu, Wei Cheng, Yiyou Sun, Mika Oishi, Takao Osaki, Katsushi Matsuda, Huaxiu Yao, Haifeng Chen","Large language models (LLMs) integrated into multistep agent systems enable complex decision-making processes across various applications. However, their outputs often lack reliability, making uncertainty estimation crucial. Existing uncertainty estimation methods primarily focus on final-step outputs, which fail to account for cumulative uncertainty over the multistep decision-making process and the dynamic interactions between agents and their environments. To address these limitations, we propose SAUP (Situation Awareness Uncertainty Propagation), a novel framework that propagates uncertainty through each step of an LLM-based agent's reasoning process. SAUP incorporates situational awareness by assigning situational weights to each step's uncertainty during the propagation. Our method, compatible with various one-step uncertainty estimation techniques, provides a comprehensive and accurate uncertainty measure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAUP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 20% improvement in AUROC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01033v1,2024-12
Evaluating Automated Radiology Report Quality through Fine-Grained Phrasal Grounding of Clinical Findings,"Razi Mahmood, Pingkun Yan, Diego Machado Reyes, Ge Wang, Mannudeep K. Kalra, Parisa Kaviani, Joy T. Wu, Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood","Several evaluation metrics have been developed recently to automatically assess the quality of generative AI reports for chest radiographs based only on textual information using lexical, semantic, or clinical named entity recognition methods. In this paper, we develop a new method of report quality evaluation by first extracting fine-grained finding patterns capturing the location, laterality, and severity of a large number of clinical findings. We then performed phrasal grounding to localize their associated anatomical regions on chest radiograph images. The textual and visual measures are then combined to rate the quality of the generated reports. We present results that compare this evaluation metric with other textual metrics on a gold standard dataset derived from the MIMIC collection and show its robustness and sensitivity to factual errors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01031v2,2024-12
Detecting Memorization in Large Language Models,Eduardo Slonski,"Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural language processing but are prone to memorizing portions of their training data, which can compromise evaluation metrics, raise privacy concerns, and limit generalization. Traditional methods for detecting memorization rely on output probabilities or loss functions, often lacking precision due to confounding factors like common language patterns. In this paper, we introduce an analytical method that precisely detects memorization by examining neuron activations within the LLM. By identifying specific activation patterns that differentiate between memorized and not memorized tokens, we train classification probes that achieve near-perfect accuracy. The approach can also be applied to other mechanisms, such as repetition, as demonstrated in this study, highlighting its versatility. Intervening on these activations allows us to suppress memorization without degrading overall performance, enhancing evaluation integrity by ensuring metrics reflect genuine generalization. Additionally, our method supports large-scale labeling of tokens and sequences, crucial for next-generation AI models, improving training efficiency and results. Our findings contribute to model interpretability and offer practical tools for analyzing and controlling internal mechanisms in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01014v1,2024-12
CoRNStack: High-Quality Contrastive Data for Better Code Ranking,"Tarun Suresh, Revanth Gangi Reddy, Yifei Xu, Zach Nussbaum, Andriy Mulyar, Brandon Duderstadt, Heng Ji","Effective code retrieval plays a crucial role in advancing code generation, bug fixing, and software maintenance, particularly as software systems increase in complexity. While current code embedding models have demonstrated promise in retrieving code snippets for small-scale, well-defined tasks, they often underperform in more demanding real-world applications such as bug localization within GitHub repositories. We hypothesize that a key issue is their reliance on noisy and inconsistent datasets for training, which impedes their ability to generalize to more complex retrieval scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce CoRNStack, a large-scale, high-quality contrastive training dataset for code that spans multiple programming languages. This dataset is curated using consistency filtering to eliminate noisy positives and is further enriched with mined hard negatives, thereby facilitating more effective learning. We demonstrate that contrastive training of embedding models using CoRNStack leads to state-of-the-art performance across a variety of code retrieval tasks. Furthermore, the dataset can be leveraged for training code reranking models, a largely underexplored area compared to text reranking. Our finetuned code reranking model significantly improves the ranking quality over the retrieved results. Finally, by employing our code retriever and reranker together, we demonstrate significant improvements in function localization for GitHub issues, an important component of real-world software development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01007v2,2024-12
Competition Dynamics Shape Algorithmic Phases of In-Context Learning,"Core Francisco Park, Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Itamar Pres, Hidenori Tanaka","In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competition dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01003v3,2024-12
From Priest to Doctor: Domain Adaptaion for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation,"Ali Marashian, Enora Rice, Luke Gessler, Alexis Palmer, Katharina von der Wense","Many of the world's languages have insufficient data to train high-performing general neural machine translation (NMT) models, let alone domain-specific models, and often the only available parallel data are small amounts of religious texts. Hence, domain adaptation (DA) is a crucial issue faced by contemporary NMT and has, so far, been underexplored for low-resource languages. In this paper, we evaluate a set of methods from both low-resource NMT and DA in a realistic setting, in which we aim to translate between a high-resource and a low-resource language with access to only: a) parallel Bible data, b) a bilingual dictionary, and c) a monolingual target-domain corpus in the high-resource language. Our results show that the effectiveness of the tested methods varies, with the simplest one, DALI, being most effective. We follow up with a small human evaluation of DALI, which shows that there is still a need for more careful investigation of how to accomplish DA for low-resource NMT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00966v1,2024-12
LLMs as mirrors of societal moral standards: reflection of cultural divergence and agreement across ethical topics,"Mijntje Meijer, Hadi Mohammadi, Ayoub Bagheri","Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly pivotal in various domains due the recent advancements in their performance capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding biases in LLMs, including gender, racial, and cultural biases derived from their training data. These biases raise critical questions about the ethical deployment and societal impact of LLMs. Acknowledging these concerns, this study investigates whether LLMs accurately reflect cross-cultural variations and similarities in moral perspectives. In assessing whether the chosen LLMs capture patterns of divergence and agreement on moral topics across cultures, three main methods are employed: (1) comparison of model-generated and survey-based moral score variances, (2) cluster alignment analysis to evaluate the correspondence between country clusters derived from model-generated moral scores and those derived from survey data, and (3) probing LLMs with direct comparative prompts. All three methods involve the use of systematic prompts and token pairs designed to assess how well LLMs understand and reflect cultural variations in moral attitudes. The findings of this study indicate overall variable and low performance in reflecting cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral values across the models tested, highlighting the necessity for improving models' accuracy in capturing these nuances effectively. The insights gained from this study aim to inform discussions on the ethical development and deployment of LLMs in global contexts, emphasizing the importance of mitigating biases and promoting fair representation across diverse cultural perspectives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00962v1,2024-12
Large Language Models as Mirrors of Societal Moral Standards,"Evi Papadopoulou, Hadi Mohammadi, Ayoub Bagheri","Prior research has demonstrated that language models can, to a limited extent, represent moral norms in a variety of cultural contexts. This research aims to replicate these findings and further explore their validity, concentrating on issues like 'homosexuality' and 'divorce'. This study evaluates the effectiveness of these models using information from two surveys, the WVS and the PEW, that encompass moral perspectives from over 40 countries. The results show that biases exist in both monolingual and multilingual models, and they typically fall short of accurately capturing the moral intricacies of diverse cultures. However, the BLOOM model shows the best performance, exhibiting some positive correlations, but still does not achieve a comprehensive moral understanding. This research underscores the limitations of current PLMs in processing cross-cultural differences in values and highlights the importance of developing culturally aware AI systems that better align with universal human values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00956v1,2024-12

In this paper, we present Uhura -- a new benchmark that focuses on two tasks in six typologically-diverse African languages, created via human translation of existing English benchmarks. The first dataset, Uhura-ARC-Easy, is composed of multiple-choice science questions. The second, Uhura-TruthfulQA, is a safety benchmark testing the truthfulness of models on topics including health, law, finance, and politics. We highlight the challenges creating benchmarks with highly technical content for LRLs and outline mitigation strategies. Our evaluation reveals a significant performance gap between proprietary models such as GPT-4o and o1-preview, and Claude models, and open-source models like Meta's LLaMA and Google's Gemma. Additionally, all models perform better in English than in African languages. These results indicate that LMs struggle with answering scientific questions and are more prone to generating false claims in low-resource African languages.

VisOnlyQA: Large Vision Language Models Still Struggle with Visual Perception of Geometric Information,"Ryo Kamoi, Yusen Zhang, Sarkar Snigdha Sarathi Das, Ranran Haoran Zhang, Rui Zhang","Errors in understanding visual information in images (i.e., visual perception errors) remain a major source of mistakes in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). While further analysis is essential, there is a deficiency in datasets for evaluating the visual perception of LVLMs. In this work, we introduce VisOnlyQA, a new dataset designed to directly evaluate the visual perception capabilities of LVLMs on questions about geometric and numerical information in scientific figures. Our dataset enables us to analyze the visual perception of LVLMs for fine-grained visual information, independent of other capabilities such as reasoning. The evaluation set of VisOnlyQA includes 1,200 multiple-choice questions in 12 tasks on four categories of figures. We also provide synthetic training data consisting of 70k instances. Our experiments on VisOnlyQA highlight the following findings: (i) 20 LVLMs we evaluate, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, work poorly on the visual perception tasks in VisOnlyQA, while human performance is nearly perfect. (ii) Fine-tuning on synthetic training data demonstrates the potential for enhancing the visual perception of LVLMs, but observed improvements are limited to certain tasks and specific models. (iii) Stronger language models improve the visual perception of LVLMs. In summary, our experiments suggest that both training data and model architectures should be improved to enhance the visual perception capabilities of LVLMs. The datasets, code, and model responses are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/VisOnlyQA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00947v1,2024-12

QABISAR leverages bipartite interactions between queries and articles to capture diverse aspects inherent in them. Further, we employ knowledge distillation to transfer enriched query representations from the graph network into the query bi-encoder, to capture the rich semantics present in the graph representations, despite absence of graph-based supervision for unseen queries during inference.

Dynamic-LLaVA: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models via Dynamic Vision-language Context Sparsification,"Wenxuan Huang, Zijie Zhai, Yunhang Shen, Shaosheng Cao, Fei Zhao, Xiangfeng Xu, Zheyu Ye, Shaohui Lin","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in vision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference computation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output tokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing methods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient MLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction in the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\sim$75\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation process of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\sim$50\% computation consumption under decoding without KV cache, while saving $\sim$50\% GPU memory overhead when decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient inference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability degradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference baselines.

KnowledgePrompts: Exploring the Abilities of Large Language Models to Solve Proportional Analogies via Knowledge-Enhanced Prompting,"Thilini Wijesiriwardene, Ruwan Wickramarachchi, Sreeram Vennam, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha, Amitava Das, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Amit Sheth","Making analogies is fundamental to cognition. Proportional analogies, which consist of four terms, are often used to assess linguistic and cognitive abilities. For instance, completing analogies like ""Oxygen is to Gas as <blank> is to <blank>"" requires identifying the semantic relationship (e.g., ""type of"") between the first pair of terms (""Oxygen"" and ""Gas"") and finding a second pair that shares the same relationship (e.g., ""Aluminum"" and ""Metal""). In this work, we introduce a 15K Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset for proportional analogy completion and evaluate the performance of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) in various knowledge-enhanced prompt settings. Specifically, we augment prompts with three types of knowledge: exemplar, structured, and targeted. Our results show that despite extensive training data, solving proportional analogies remains challenging for current LLMs, with the best model achieving an accuracy of 55%. Notably, we find that providing targeted knowledge can better assist models in completing proportional analogies compared to providing exemplars or collections of structured knowledge.

Quantifying perturbation impacts for large language models,"Paulius Rauba, Qiyao Wei, Mihaela van der Schaar","We consider the problem of quantifying how an input perturbation impacts the outputs of large language models (LLMs), a fundamental task for model reliability and post-hoc interpretability. A key obstacle in this domain is disentangling the meaningful changes in model responses from the intrinsic stochasticity of LLM outputs. To overcome this, we introduce Distribution-Based Perturbation Analysis (DBPA), a framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist hypothesis testing problem. DBPA constructs empirical null and alternative output distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte Carlo sampling. Comparisons of Monte Carlo estimates in the reduced dimensionality space enables tractable frequentist inference without relying on restrictive distributional assumptions. The framework is model-agnostic, supports the evaluation of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, yields interpretable p-values, supports multiple perturbation testing via controlled error rates, and provides scalar effect sizes for any chosen similarity or distance metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DBPA in evaluating perturbation impacts, showing its versatility for perturbation analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00868v1,2024-12

This paper examines the ways in which LLMs are being employed in legislative processes, political communication, and political analysis. Moreover, we investigate the potential of LLMs in diplomatic and national security contexts, economic and social modeling, and legal applications. While LLMs offer opportunities to enhance efficiency, inclusivity, and decision-making in political processes, they also present challenges related to bias, transparency, and accountability.

We experimentally investigated the behavior of 10 LLMs in open-domain conversations.

Prompt as Free Lunch: Enhancing Diversity in Source-Free Cross-domain Few-shot Learning through Semantic-Guided Prompting,"Linhai Zhuo, Zheng Wang, Yuqian Fu, Tianwen Qian","The source-free cross-domain few-shot learning (CD-FSL) task aims to transfer pretrained models to target domains utilizing minimal samples, eliminating the need for source domain data. Addressing this issue requires models to have robust generalization abilities and strong feature representation, aligning with the characteristics of large-scale pretrained models. However, large-scale models tend to lose representational ability in cross-domain scenarios due to limited sample diversity. \zlh{Given the abundant diversity provided by semantic modality, this paper leverages textual modality to enhance training sample diversity with CLP model}, meanwhile improving model transfer efficiency. Specifically, we propose the SeGD-VPT framework, which is divided into two phases. The first step aims to increase feature diversity by adding diversity prompts to each support sample, thereby generating varying input and enhancing sample diversity. Furthermore, we use diversity descriptions of classes to guide semantically meaningful learning of diversity prompts, proposing random combinations and selections of texts to increase textual diversity. Additionally, deep prompt tuning is introduced to enhance the model's transfer capability. After training of the first step, support samples with different diversity prompts are input into the CLIP backbone to generate enhanced features. After generation, the second phase trains classifiers using the generated features. Extensive experimental results across several benchmarks verify our method is comparable to SOTA source-utilized models and attain the best performance under the source-free CD-FSL setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00767v1,2024-12
SelfPrompt: Autonomously Evaluating LLM Robustness via Domain-Constrained Knowledge Guidelines and Refined Adversarial Prompts,"Aihua Pei, Zehua Yang, Shunan Zhu, Ruoxi Cheng, Ju Jia","Traditional methods for evaluating the robustness of large language models (LLMs) often rely on standardized benchmarks, which can escalate costs and limit evaluations across varied domains. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to autonomously evaluate the robustness of LLMs by incorporating refined adversarial prompts and domain-constrained knowledge guidelines in the form of knowledge graphs. Our method systematically generates descriptive sentences from domain-constrained knowledge graph triplets to formulate adversarial prompts, enhancing the relevance and challenge of the evaluation. These prompts, generated by the LLM itself and tailored to evaluate its own robustness, undergo a rigorous filtering and refinement process, ensuring that only those with high textual fluency and semantic fidelity are used. This self-evaluation mechanism allows the LLM to evaluate its robustness without the need for external benchmarks. We assess the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing on both proprietary models like ChatGPT and open-source models such as Llama-3.1, Phi-3, and Mistral. Results confirm that our approach not only reduces dependency on conventional data but also provides a targeted and efficient means of evaluating LLM robustness in constrained domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00765v1,2024-12
PGSO: Prompt-based Generative Sequence Optimization Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Hao Dong, Wei Wei","Recently, generative pre-training based models have demonstrated remarkable results on Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task. However, previous works overemphasize crafting various templates to paraphrase training targets for enhanced decoding, ignoring the internal optimizations on generative models. Despite notable results achieved by these target-oriented optimization methods, they struggle with the complicated long texts since the implicit long-distance relation, e.g., aspect-opinion relation, is difficult to extract under the position embedding mechanism in generative models. Thus, in this paper, we first clarify the causes of the problem and introduce two sequence optimization strategies: the rule-based static optimization and the score-based dynamic optimization. The rule-based approach relies on handcraft priority of dependency relation to reorder the context, while the score-based algorithm dynamically regulates the contextual sequence by calculating word position scores using neural network. Based on the dynamic optimization structure, we further propose a unified Prompt-based Generative Sequence Optimization network (named PGSO), which jointly optimizes the training target as well as the generative model. Specifically, PGSO contains two components, namely, prompt construction and sequence regulator. The former constructs a task-specific prompt based on unsupervised training objects to fully utilize the pre-trained model. The latter jointly leverages semantic, syntactic and original-sequence information to dynamically regulate contextual sequence. Our experiments conducted on four ABSA tasks across multiple benchmarks indicate that PGSO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with an average improvement of 3.52% in F1 score.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00763v1,2024-12
"Automating Feedback Analysis in Surgical Training: Detection, Categorization, and Assessment","Firdavs Nasriddinov, Rafal Kocielnik, Arushi Gupta, Cherine Yang, Elyssa Wong, Anima Anandkumar, Andrew Hung","This work introduces the first framework for reconstructing surgical dialogue from unstructured real-world recordings, which is crucial for characterizing teaching tasks. In surgical training, the formative verbal feedback that trainers provide to trainees during live surgeries is crucial for ensuring safety, correcting behavior immediately, and facilitating long-term skill acquisition. However, analyzing and quantifying this feedback is challenging due to its unstructured and specialized nature. Automated systems are essential to manage these complexities at scale, allowing for the creation of structured datasets that enhance feedback analysis and improve surgical education. Our framework integrates voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and automated speech recaognition, with a novel enhancement that 1) removes hallucinations (non-existent utterances generated during speech recognition fueled by noise in the operating room) and 2) separates speech from trainers and trainees using few-shot voice samples. These aspects are vital for reconstructing accurate surgical dialogues and understanding the roles of operating room participants. Using data from 33 real-world surgeries, we demonstrated the system's capability to reconstruct surgical teaching dialogues and detect feedback instances effectively (F1 score of 0.79+/-0.07). Moreover, our hallucination removal step improves feedback detection performance by ~14%. Evaluation on downstream clinically relevant tasks of predicting Behavioral Adjustment of trainees and classifying Technical feedback, showed performances comparable to manual annotations with F1 scores of 0.82+/0.03 and 0.81+/0.03 respectively.

These methods often mistakenly prioritize non-essential features yet still make correct predictions, demonstrating poor generalizability beyond training environments. Regarding this phenomenon, this paper undertakes several initiatives. Firstly, we identify two primary causes that lead to the reliance of spurious correlations. Secondly, we address these challenges by proposing a novel method that integrate Multimodal Incongruities via Contrastive Learning (MICL) for multimodal sarcasm detection. Specifically, we first leverage incongruity to drive multi-view learning from three views: token-patch, entity-object, and sentiment. Then, we introduce extensive data augmentation to mitigate the biased learning of the textual modality. Additionally, we construct a test set, SPMSD, which consists potential spurious correlations to evaluate the the model's generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MICL on benchmark datasets, along with the analyses showcasing MICL's advancement in mitigating the effect of spurious correlation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00756v2,2024-12

Humor is frequently multimodal, relying on phonetic ambiguity, rhythm and timing to convey meaning. In this study, we explore a simple multimodal prompting approach to humor understanding and explanation. We present an LLM with both the text and the spoken form of a joke, generated using an off-the-shelf text-to-speech (TTS) system. Using multimodal cues improves the explanations of humor compared to textual prompts across all tested datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05315v1,2024-12
Multi-Agent Collaboration in Incident Response with Large Language Models,Zefang Liu,"Incident response (IR) is a critical aspect of cybersecurity, requiring rapid decision-making and coordinated efforts to address cyberattacks effectively. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) as intelligent agents offers a novel approach to enhancing collaboration and efficiency in IR scenarios. This paper explores the application of LLM-based multi-agent collaboration using the Backdoors & Breaches framework, a tabletop game designed for cybersecurity training. We simulate real-world IR dynamics through various team structures, including centralized, decentralized, and hybrid configurations. By analyzing agent interactions and performance across these setups, we provide insights into optimizing multi-agent collaboration for incident response. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance decision-making, improve adaptability, and streamline IR processes, paving the way for more effective and coordinated responses to cyber threats.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00652v2,2024-12
ROSE: A Reward-Oriented Data Selection Framework for LLM Task-Specific Instruction Tuning,"Yang Wu, Huayi Zhang, Yizheng Jiao, Lin Ma, Xiaozhong Liu, Jinhong Yu, Dongyu Zhang, Dezhi Yu, Wei Xu","Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large language models (LLMs) in producing more human-controllable and effective outputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection problem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods primarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that aligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction tuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target task. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e., cross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a novel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages pairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for task-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence formulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a few-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training data points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5% of the training data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared to fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other state-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. Our qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our method across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00631v1,2024-12
Voice Biomarker Analysis and Automated Severity Classification of Dysarthric Speech in a Multilingual Context,Eunjung Yeo,"Dysarthria, a motor speech disorder, severely impacts voice quality, pronunciation, and prosody, leading to diminished speech intelligibility and reduced quality of life. Accurate assessment is crucial for effective treatment, but traditional perceptual assessments are limited by their subjectivity and resource intensity. To mitigate the limitations, automatic dysarthric speech assessment methods have been proposed to support clinicians on their decision-making. While these methods have shown promising results, most research has focused on monolingual environments. However, multilingual approaches are necessary to address the global burden of dysarthria and ensure equitable access to accurate diagnosis. This thesis proposes a novel multilingual dysarthria severity classification method, by analyzing three languages: English, Korean, and Tamil.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12111v1,2024-12
