How Much Annotation is Needed to Compare Summarization Models?,"Chantal Shaib, Joe Barrow, Alexa F. Siu, Byron C. Wallace, Ani Nenkova","Modern instruction-tuned models have become highly capable in text generation tasks such as summarization, and are expected to be released at a steady pace. In practice one may now wish to choose confidently, but with minimal effort, the best performing summarization model when applied to a new domain or purpose. In this work, we empirically investigate the test sample size necessary to select a preferred model in the context of news summarization. Empirical results reveal that comparative evaluation converges quickly for both automatic and human evaluation, with clear preferences for a system emerging from under 100 examples. The human preference data allows us to quantify how well automatic scores can reproduce preference rankings across a variety of downstream summarization tasks. We find that, while automatic metrics are stable at smaller sample sizes, only some automatic metrics are able to moderately predict model win rates according to human preference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18756v1,2024-02
Fine-Tuned Machine Translation Metrics Struggle in Unseen Domains,"Vilém Zouhar, Shuoyang Ding, Anna Currey, Tatyana Badeka, Jenyuan Wang, Brian Thompson","We introduce a new, extensive multidimensional quality metrics (MQM) annotated dataset covering 11 language pairs in the biomedical domain. We use this dataset to investigate whether machine translation (MT) metrics which are fine-tuned on human-generated MT quality judgements are robust to domain shifts between training and inference. We find that fine-tuned metrics exhibit a substantial performance drop in the unseen domain scenario relative to metrics that rely on the surface form, as well as pre-trained metrics which are not fine-tuned on MT quality judgments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18747v2,2024-02
Priority Sampling of Large Language Models for Compilers,"Dejan Grubisic, Chris Cummins, Volker Seeker, Hugh Leather","Large language models show great potential in generating and optimizing code. Widely used sampling methods such as Nucleus Sampling increase the diversity of generation but often produce repeated samples for low temperatures and incoherent samples for high temperatures. Furthermore, the temperature coefficient has to be tuned for each task, limiting its usability. We present Priority Sampling, a simple and deterministic sampling technique that produces unique samples ordered by the model's confidence. Each new sample expands the unexpanded token with the highest probability in the augmented search tree. Additionally, Priority Sampling supports generation based on regular expression that provides a controllable and structured exploration process. Priority Sampling outperforms Nucleus Sampling for any number of samples, boosting the performance of the original model from 2.87% to 5% improvement over -Oz. Moreover, it outperforms the autotuner used for the generation of labels for the training of the original model in just 30 samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18734v1,2024-02
NeuroPrune: A Neuro-inspired Topological Sparse Training Algorithm for Large Language Models,"Amit Dhurandhar, Tejaswini Pedapati, Ronny Luss, Soham Dan, Aurelie Lozano, Payel Das, Georgios Kollias","Transformer-based Language Models have become ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to their impressive performance on various tasks. However, expensive training as well as inference remains a significant impediment to their widespread applicability. While enforcing sparsity at various levels of the model architecture has found promise in addressing scaling and efficiency issues, there remains a disconnect between how sparsity affects network topology. Inspired by brain neuronal networks, we explore sparsity approaches through the lens of network topology. Specifically, we exploit mechanisms seen in biological networks, such as preferential attachment and redundant synapse pruning, and show that principled, model-agnostic sparsity approaches are performant and efficient across diverse NLP tasks, spanning both classification (such as natural language inference) and generation (summarization, machine translation), despite our sole objective not being optimizing performance. NeuroPrune is competitive with (or sometimes superior to) baselines on performance and can be up to $10$x faster in terms of training time for a given level of sparsity, simultaneously exhibiting measurable improvements in inference time in many cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01306v3,2024-02
Learning to Compress Prompt in Natural Language Formats,"Yu-Neng Chuang, Tianwei Xing, Chia-Yuan Chang, Zirui Liu, Xun Chen, Xia Hu","Large language models (LLMs) are great at processing multiple natural language processing tasks, but their abilities are constrained by inferior performance with long context, slow inference speed, and the high cost of computing the results. Deploying LLMs with precise and informative context helps users process large-scale datasets more effectively and cost-efficiently. Existing works rely on compressing long prompt contexts into soft prompts. However, soft prompt compression encounters limitations in transferability across different LLMs, especially API-based LLMs. To this end, this work aims to compress lengthy prompts in the form of natural language with LLM transferability. This poses two challenges: (i) Natural Language (NL) prompts are incompatible with back-propagation, and (ii) NL prompts lack flexibility in imposing length constraints. In this work, we propose a Natural Language Prompt Encapsulation (Nano-Capsulator) framework compressing original prompts into NL formatted Capsule Prompt while maintaining the prompt utility and transferability. Specifically, to tackle the first challenge, the Nano-Capsulator is optimized by a reward function that interacts with the proposed semantics preserving loss. To address the second question, the Nano-Capsulator is optimized by a reward function featuring length constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the Capsule Prompt can reduce 81.4% of the original length, decrease inference latency up to 4.5x, and save 80.1% of budget overheads while providing transferability across diverse LLMs and different datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18700v2,2024-02
Grounding Language Models for Visual Entity Recognition,"Zilin Xiao, Ming Gong, Paola Cascante-Bonilla, Xingyao Zhang, Jie Wu, Vicente Ordonez","We introduce AutoVER, an Autoregressive model for Visual Entity Recognition. Our model extends an autoregressive Multi-modal Large Language Model by employing retrieval augmented constrained generation. It mitigates low performance on out-of-domain entities while excelling in queries that require visually-situated reasoning. Our method learns to distinguish similar entities within a vast label space by contrastively training on hard negative pairs in parallel with a sequence-to-sequence objective without an external retriever. During inference, a list of retrieved candidate answers explicitly guides language generation by removing invalid decoding paths. The proposed method achieves significant improvements across different dataset splits in the recently proposed Oven-Wiki benchmark. Accuracy on the Entity seen split rises from 32.7% to 61.5%. It also demonstrates superior performance on the unseen and query splits by a substantial double-digit margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18695v2,2024-02
CLLMs: Consistency Large Language Models,"Siqi Kou, Lanxiang Hu, Zhezhi He, Zhijie Deng, Hao Zhang","Parallel decoding methods such as Jacobi decoding show promise for more efficient LLM inference as it breaks the sequential nature of the LLM decoding process and transforms it into parallelizable computation. However, in practice, it achieves little speedup compared to traditional autoregressive (AR) decoding, primarily because Jacobi decoding seldom accurately predicts more than one token in a single fixed-point iteration step. To address this, we develop a new approach aimed at realizing fast convergence from any state to the fixed point on a Jacobi trajectory. This is accomplished by refining the target LLM to consistently predict the fixed point given any state as input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing 2.4$\times$ to 3.4$\times$ improvements in generation speed while preserving generation quality across both domain-specific and open-domain benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00835v4,2024-02
RORA: Robust Free-Text Rationale Evaluation,"Zhengping Jiang, Yining Lu, Hanjie Chen, Daniel Khashabi, Benjamin Van Durme, Anqi Liu","Free-text rationales play a pivotal role in explainable NLP, bridging the knowledge and reasoning gaps behind a model's decision-making. However, due to the diversity of potential reasoning paths and a corresponding lack of definitive ground truth, their evaluation remains a challenge. Existing evaluation metrics rely on the degree to which a rationale supports a target label, but we find these fall short in evaluating rationales that inadvertently leak the labels. To address this problem, we propose RORA, a Robust free-text Rationale evaluation against label leakage. RORA quantifies the new information supplied by a rationale to justify the label. This is achieved by assessing the conditional V-information \citep{hewitt-etal-2021-conditional} with a predictive family robust against leaky features that can be exploited by a small model. RORA consistently outperforms existing approaches in evaluating human-written, synthetic, or model-generated rationales, particularly demonstrating robustness against label leakage. We also show that RORA aligns well with human judgment, providing a more reliable and accurate measurement across diverse free-text rationales.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18678v3,2024-02
Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff,"Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher Ré","Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

FOFO: A Benchmark to Evaluate LLMs' Format-Following Capability,"Congying Xia, Chen Xing, Jiangshu Du, Xinyi Yang, Yihao Feng, Ran Xu, Wenpeng Yin, Caiming Xiong","This paper presents FoFo, a pioneering benchmark for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) ability to follow complex, domain-specific formats, a crucial yet underexamined capability for their application as AI agents. Despite LLMs' advancements, existing benchmarks fail to assess their format-following proficiency adequately. FoFo fills this gap with a diverse range of real-world formats and instructions, developed through an AI-Human collaborative method. Our evaluation across both open-source (e.g., Llama 2, WizardLM) and closed-source (e.g., GPT-4, PALM2, Gemini) LLMs highlights three key findings: open-source models significantly lag behind closed-source ones in format adherence; LLMs' format-following performance is independent of their content generation quality; and LLMs' format proficiency varies across different domains. These insights suggest the need for specialized tuning for format-following skills and highlight FoFo's role in guiding the selection of domain-specific AI agents. FoFo is released here at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/FoFo.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18667v1,2024-02
Large Language Models and Games: A Survey and Roadmap,"Roberto Gallotta, Graham Todd, Marvin Zammit, Sam Earle, Antonios Liapis, Julian Togelius, Georgios N. Yannakakis","Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large language models (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic. While starting as a niche area within natural language processing, LLMs have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications and domains, including games. This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game. Importantly, we discuss underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games and we reconcile the potential and limitations of LLMs within the games domain. As the first comprehensive survey and roadmap at the intersection of LLMs and games, we are hopeful that this paper will serve as the basis for groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18659v5,2024-02
Arithmetic Control of LLMs for Diverse User Preferences: Directional Preference Alignment with Multi-Objective Rewards,"Haoxiang Wang, Yong Lin, Wei Xiong, Rui Yang, Shizhe Diao, Shuang Qiu, Han Zhao, Tong Zhang","Fine-grained control over large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, hindering their adaptability to diverse user needs. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) shows promise in aligning LLMs, its reliance on scalar rewards often limits its ability to capture diverse user preferences in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we introduce the Directional Preference Alignment (DPA) framework. Unlike the scalar-reward RLHF, DPA incorporates multi-objective reward modeling to represent diverse preference profiles. Additionally, DPA models user preferences as directions (i.e., unit vectors) in the reward space to achieve user-dependent preference control. Our method involves training a multi-objective reward model and then fine-tuning the LLM with a preference-conditioned variant of Rejection Sampling Finetuning (RSF), an RLHF method adopted by Llama 2. This method enjoys a better performance trade-off across various reward objectives. In comparison with the scalar-reward RLHF, DPA offers users intuitive control over LLM generation: they can arithmetically specify their desired trade-offs (e.g., more helpfulness with less verbosity). We also validate the effectiveness of DPA with real-world alignment experiments on Mistral-7B. Our method provides straightforward arithmetic control over the trade-off between helpfulness and verbosity while maintaining competitive performance with strong baselines such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18571v3,2024-02
Approaching Human-Level Forecasting with Language Models,"Danny Halawi, Fred Zhang, Chen Yueh-Han, Jacob Steinhardt","Forecasting future events is important for policy and decision making. In this work, we study whether language models (LMs) can forecast at the level of competitive human forecasters. Towards this goal, we develop a retrieval-augmented LM system designed to automatically search for relevant information, generate forecasts, and aggregate predictions. To facilitate our study, we collect a large dataset of questions from competitive forecasting platforms. Under a test set published after the knowledge cut-offs of our LMs, we evaluate the end-to-end performance of our system against the aggregates of human forecasts. On average, the system nears the crowd aggregate of competitive forecasters, and in some settings surpasses it. Our work suggests that using LMs to forecast the future could provide accurate predictions at scale and help to inform institutional decision making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18563v1,2024-02
Implicit Optimization Bias of Next-Token Prediction in Linear Models,Christos Thrampoulidis,"We initiate an investigation into the optimization properties of next-token prediction (NTP), the dominant training paradigm for modern language models. Specifically, we study the structural properties of the solutions selected by gradient-based optimizers among the many possible minimizers of the NTP objective. By framing NTP as cross-entropy minimization across distinct contexts, each tied with a sparse conditional probability distribution across a finite vocabulary of tokens, we introduce ""NTP-separability conditions"" that enable reaching the data-entropy lower bound. With this setup, and focusing on linear models with fixed context embeddings, we characterize the optimization bias of gradient descent (GD): Within the data subspace defined by the sparsity patterns of distinct contexts, GD selects parameters that equate the logits' differences of in-support tokens to their log-odds. In the orthogonal subspace, the GD parameters diverge in norm and select the direction that maximizes a margin specific to NTP. These findings extend previous research on implicit bias in one-hot classification to the NTP setting, highlighting key differences and prompting further research into the optimization and generalization properties of NTP, irrespective of the specific architecture used to generate the context embeddings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18551v2,2024-02
Keeping LLMs Aligned After Fine-tuning: The Crucial Role of Prompt Templates,"Kaifeng Lyu, Haoyu Zhao, Xinran Gu, Dingli Yu, Anirudh Goyal, Sanjeev Arora","Public LLMs such as the Llama 2-Chat have driven huge activity in LLM research. These models underwent alignment training and were considered safe. Recently Qi et al. (2023) reported that even benign fine-tuning (e.g., on seemingly safe datasets) can give rise to unsafe behaviors in the models. The current paper is about methods and best practices to mitigate such loss of alignment. Through extensive experiments on several chat models (Meta's Llama 2-Chat, Mistral AI's Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo), this paper uncovers that the prompt templates used during fine-tuning and inference play a crucial role in preserving safety alignment, and proposes the ""Pure Tuning, Safe Testing"" (PTST) principle -- fine-tune models without a safety prompt, but include it at test time. Fine-tuning experiments on GSM8K, ChatDoctor, and OpenOrca show that PTST significantly reduces the rise of unsafe behaviors, and even almost eliminates them in some cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18540v1,2024-02
RNNs are not Transformers (Yet): The Key Bottleneck on In-context Retrieval,"Kaiyue Wen, Xingyu Dang, Kaifeng Lyu","This paper investigates the gap in representation powers of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers in the context of solving algorithmic problems. We focus on understanding whether RNNs, known for their memory efficiency in handling long sequences, can match the performance of Transformers, particularly when enhanced with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Our theoretical analysis reveals that CoT improves RNNs but is insufficient to close the gap with Transformers. A key bottleneck lies in the inability of RNNs to perfectly retrieve information from the context, even with CoT: for several tasks that explicitly or implicitly require this capability, such as associative recall and determining if a graph is a tree, we prove that RNNs are not expressive enough to solve the tasks while Transformers can solve them with ease. Conversely, we prove that adopting techniques to enhance the in-context retrieval capability of RNNs, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and adding a single Transformer layer, can elevate RNNs to be capable of solving all polynomial-time solvable problems with CoT, hence closing the representation gap with Transformers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18510v4,2024-02
Few-Shot Fairness: Unveiling LLM's Potential for Fairness-Aware Classification,"Garima Chhikara, Anurag Sharma, Kripabandhu Ghosh, Abhijnan Chakraborty","Employing Large Language Models (LLM) in various downstream applications such as classification is crucial, especially for smaller companies lacking the expertise and resources required for fine-tuning a model. Fairness in LLMs helps ensure inclusivity, equal representation based on factors such as race, gender and promotes responsible AI deployment. As the use of LLMs has become increasingly prevalent, it is essential to assess whether LLMs can generate fair outcomes when subjected to considerations of fairness. In this study, we introduce a framework outlining fairness regulations aligned with various fairness definitions, with each definition being modulated by varying degrees of abstraction. We explore the configuration for in-context learning and the procedure for selecting in-context demonstrations using RAG, while incorporating fairness rules into the process. Experiments conducted with different LLMs indicate that GPT-4 delivers superior results in terms of both accuracy and fairness compared to other models. This work is one of the early attempts to achieve fairness in prediction tasks by utilizing LLMs through in-context learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18502v1,2024-02
Language Models Represent Beliefs of Self and Others,"Wentao Zhu, Zhining Zhang, Yizhou Wang","Understanding and attributing mental states, known as Theory of Mind (ToM), emerges as a fundamental capability for human social reasoning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to possess certain ToM abilities, the mechanisms underlying these capabilities remain elusive. In this study, we discover that it is possible to linearly decode the belief status from the perspectives of various agents through neural activations of language models, indicating the existence of internal representations of self and others' beliefs. By manipulating these representations, we observe dramatic changes in the models' ToM performance, underscoring their pivotal role in the social reasoning process. Additionally, our findings extend to diverse social reasoning tasks that involve different causal inference patterns, suggesting the potential generalizability of these representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18496v3,2024-02
NewsQs: Multi-Source Question Generation for the Inquiring Mind,"Alyssa Hwang, Kalpit Dixit, Miguel Ballesteros, Yassine Benajiba, Vittorio Castelli, Markus Dreyer, Mohit Bansal, Kathleen McKeown","We present NewsQs (news-cues), a dataset that provides question-answer pairs for multiple news documents. To create NewsQs, we augment a traditional multi-document summarization dataset with questions automatically generated by a T5-Large model fine-tuned on FAQ-style news articles from the News On the Web corpus. We show that fine-tuning a model with control codes produces questions that are judged acceptable more often than the same model without them as measured through human evaluation. We use a QNLI model with high correlation with human annotations to filter our data. We release our final dataset of high-quality questions, answers, and document clusters as a resource for future work in query-based multi-document summarization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18479v2,2024-02
Meta-Task Prompting Elicits Embeddings from Large Language Models,"Yibin Lei, Di Wu, Tianyi Zhou, Tao Shen, Yu Cao, Chongyang Tao, Andrew Yates","We introduce a new unsupervised text embedding method, Meta-Task Prompting with Explicit One-Word Limitation (MetaEOL), for generating high-quality sentence embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for model fine-tuning. Leveraging meta-task prompting, MetaEOL guides LLMs to produce embeddings through a series of carefully designed prompts that address multiple representational aspects. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that embeddings averaged from various meta-tasks are versatile embeddings that yield competitive performance on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks and excel in downstream tasks, surpassing contrastive-trained models. Our findings suggest a new scaling law, offering a versatile and resource-efficient approach for embedding generation across diverse scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18458v2,2024-02
HOP to the Next Tasks and Domains for Continual Learning in NLP,"Umberto Michieli, Mete Ozay","Continual Learning (CL) aims to learn a sequence of problems (i.e., tasks and domains) by transferring knowledge acquired on previous problems, whilst avoiding forgetting of past ones. Different from previous approaches which focused on CL for one NLP task or domain in a specific use-case, in this paper, we address a more general CL setting to learn from a sequence of problems in a unique framework. Our method, HOP, permits to hop across tasks and domains by addressing the CL problem along three directions: (i) we employ a set of adapters to generalize a large pre-trained model to unseen problems, (ii) we compute high-order moments over the distribution of embedded representations to distinguish independent and correlated statistics across different tasks and domains, (iii) we process this enriched information with auxiliary heads specialized for each end problem. Extensive experimental campaign on 4 NLP applications, 5 benchmarks and 2 CL setups demonstrates the effectiveness of our HOP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18449v1,2024-02
Beyond Natural Language: LLMs Leveraging Alternative Formats for Enhanced Reasoning and Communication,"Weize Chen, Chenfei Yuan, Jiarui Yuan, Yusheng Su, Chen Qian, Cheng Yang, Ruobing Xie, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Natural language (NL) has long been the predominant format for human cognition and communication, and by extension, has been similarly pivotal in the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, besides NL, LLMs have seen various non-NL formats during pre-training, such as code and logical expression. NL's status as the optimal format for LLMs, particularly in single-LLM reasoning and multi-agent communication, has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we challenge the default use of NL by exploring the utility of non-NL formats in these contexts. We show that allowing LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable format before reasoning or communicating leads to a 3.3 to 5.7\% improvement in reasoning efficiency for different LLMs, and up to a 72.7\% reduction in token usage in multi-agent communication, all while maintaining communicative effectiveness. Our comprehensive analysis further reveals that LLMs can devise a format from limited task instructions and that the devised format is effectively transferable across different LLMs. Intriguingly, the structured communication format decided by LLMs exhibits notable parallels with established agent communication languages, suggesting a natural evolution towards efficient, structured communication in agent communication.

Leveraging Diverse Modeling Contexts with Collaborating Learning for Neural Machine Translation,"Yusheng Liao, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang","Autoregressive (AR) and Non-autoregressive (NAR) models are two types of generative models for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). AR models predict tokens in a word-by-word manner and can effectively capture the distribution of real translations. NAR models predict tokens by extracting bidirectional contextual information which can improve the inference speed but they suffer from performance degradation. Previous works utilized AR models to enhance NAR models by reducing the training data's complexity or incorporating the global information into AR models by virtue of NAR models. However, those investigated methods only take advantage of the contextual information of a single type of model while neglecting the diversity in the contextual information that can be provided by different types of models. In this paper, we propose a novel generic collaborative learning method, DCMCL, where AR and NAR models are treated as collaborators instead of teachers and students. To hierarchically leverage the bilateral contextual information, token-level mutual learning and sequence-level contrastive learning are adopted between AR and NAR models. Extensive experiments on four widely used benchmarks show that the proposed DCMCL method can simultaneously improve both AR and NAR models with up to 1.38 and 2.98 BLEU scores respectively, and can also outperform the current best-unified model with up to 0.97 BLEU scores for both AR and NAR decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18428v1,2024-02
Emotion Classification in Low and Moderate Resource Languages,"Shabnam Tafreshi, Shubham Vatsal, Mona Diab","It is important to be able to analyze the emotional state of people around the globe. There are 7100+ active languages spoken around the world and building emotion classification for each language is labor intensive. Particularly for low-resource and endangered languages, building emotion classification can be quite challenging. We present a cross-lingual emotion classifier, where we train an emotion classifier with resource-rich languages (i.e. \textit{English} in our work) and transfer the learning to low and moderate resource languages. We compare and contrast two approaches of transfer learning from a high-resource language to a low or moderate-resource language. One approach projects the annotation from a high-resource language to low and moderate-resource language in parallel corpora and the other one uses direct transfer from high-resource language to the other languages. We show the efficacy of our approaches on 6 languages: Farsi, Arabic, Spanish, Ilocano, Odia, and Azerbaijani. Our results indicate that our approaches outperform random baselines and transfer emotions across languages successfully. For all languages, the direct cross-lingual transfer of emotion yields better results. We also create annotated emotion-labeled resources for four languages: Farsi, Azerbaijani, Ilocano and Odia.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18424v2,2024-02
Can GPT Improve the State of Prior Authorization via Guideline Based Automated Question Answering?,"Shubham Vatsal, Ayush Singh, Shabnam Tafreshi","Health insurance companies have a defined process called prior authorization (PA) which is a health plan cost-control process that requires doctors and other healthcare professionals to get clearance in advance from a health plan before performing a particular procedure on a patient in order to be eligible for payment coverage. For health insurance companies, approving PA requests for patients in the medical domain is a time-consuming and challenging task. One of those key challenges is validating if a request matches up to certain criteria such as age, gender, etc. In this work, we evaluate whether GPT can validate numerous key factors, in turn helping health plans reach a decision drastically faster. We frame it as a question answering task, prompting GPT to answer a question from patient electronic health record. We experiment with different conventional prompting techniques as well as introduce our own novel prompting technique. Moreover, we report qualitative assessment by humans on the natural language generation outputs from our approach. Results show that our method achieves superior performance with the mean weighted F1 score of 0.61 as compared to its standard counterparts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18419v2,2024-02
A Cognitive Evaluation Benchmark of Image Reasoning and Description for Large Vision-Language Models,"Xiujie Song, Mengyue Wu, Kenny Q.

Inspired by the prevalent use of the ""Cookie Theft"" task in human cognition test, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark to evaluate high-level cognitive ability of LVLMs using images with rich semantics. It defines eight reasoning capabilities and consists of an image description task and a visual question answering task.

Decomposed Prompting: Unveiling Multilingual Linguistic Structure Knowledge in English-Centric Large Language Models,"Ercong Nie, Shuzhou Yuan, Bolei Ma, Helmut Schmid, Michael Färber, Frauke Kreuter, Hinrich Schütze","Despite the predominance of English in their training data, English-centric Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and LLaMA display a remarkable ability to perform multilingual tasks, raising questions about the depth and nature of their cross-lingual capabilities. This paper introduces the decomposed prompting approach to probe the linguistic structure understanding of these LLMs in sequence labeling tasks. Diverging from the single text-to-text prompt, our method generates for each token of the input sentence an individual prompt which asks for its linguistic label. We assess our method on the Universal Dependencies part-of-speech tagging dataset for 38 languages, utilizing both English-centric and multilingual LLMs. Our findings show that decomposed prompting surpasses the iterative prompting baseline in efficacy and efficiency under zero- and few-shot settings. Further analysis reveals the influence of evaluation methods and the use of instructions in prompts. Our multilingual investigation shows that English-centric language models perform better on average than multilingual models. Our study offers insights into the multilingual transferability of English-centric LLMs, contributing to the understanding of their multilingual linguistic knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18397v1,2024-02
The First Place Solution of WSDM Cup 2024: Leveraging Large Language Models for Conversational Multi-Doc QA,"Yiming Li, Zhao Zhang","Conversational multi-doc question answering aims to answer specific questions based on the retrieved documents as well as the contextual conversations.

Tokenization Is More Than Compression,"Craig W. Schmidt, Varshini Reddy, Haoran Zhang, Alec Alameddine, Omri Uzan, Yuval Pinter, Chris Tanner","Tokenization is a foundational step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, bridging raw text and language models. Existing tokenization approaches like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) originate from the field of data compression, and it has been suggested that the effectiveness of BPE stems from its ability to condense text into a relatively small number of tokens. We test the hypothesis that fewer tokens lead to better downstream performance by introducing PathPiece, a new tokenizer that segments a document's text into the minimum number of tokens for a given vocabulary. Through extensive experimentation we find this hypothesis not to be the case, casting doubt on the understanding of the reasons for effective tokenization. To examine which other factors play a role, we evaluate design decisions across all three phases of tokenization: pre-tokenization, vocabulary construction, and segmentation, offering new insights into the design of effective tokenizers. Specifically, we illustrate the importance of pre-tokenization and the benefits of using BPE to initialize vocabulary construction. We train 64 language models with varying tokenization, ranging in size from 350M to 2.4B parameters, all of which are made publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18376v2,2024-02
VerifiNER: Verification-augmented NER via Knowledge-grounded Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Seoyeon Kim, Kwangwook Seo, Hyungjoo Chae, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee","Recent approaches in domain-specific named entity recognition (NER), such as biomedical NER, have shown remarkable advances. However, they still lack of faithfulness, producing erroneous predictions. We assume that knowledge of entities can be useful in verifying the correctness of the predictions. Despite the usefulness of knowledge, resolving such errors with knowledge is nontrivial, since the knowledge itself does not directly indicate the ground-truth label. To this end, we propose VerifiNER, a post-hoc verification framework that identifies errors from existing NER methods using knowledge and revises them into more faithful predictions. Our framework leverages the reasoning abilities of large language models to adequately ground on knowledge and the contextual information in the verification process. We validate effectiveness of VerifiNER through extensive experiments on biomedical datasets. The results suggest that VerifiNER can successfully verify errors from existing models as a model-agnostic approach. Further analyses on out-of-domain and low-resource settings show the usefulness of VerifiNER on real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18374v2,2024-02
Focus on Your Question! Interpreting and Mitigating Toxic CoT Problems in Commonsense Reasoning,"Jiachun Li, Pengfei Cao, Chenhao Wang, Zhuoran Jin, Yubo Chen, Daojian Zeng, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","Large language models exhibit high-level commonsense reasoning abilities, especially with enhancement methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, we find these CoT-like methods lead to a considerable number of originally correct answers turning wrong, which we define as the Toxic CoT problem. To interpret and mitigate this problem, we first utilize attribution tracing and causal tracing methods to probe the internal working mechanism of the LLM during CoT reasoning. Through comparisons, we prove that the model exhibits information loss from the question over the shallow attention layers when generating rationales or answers. Based on the probing findings, we design a novel method called RIDERS (Residual decodIng and sERial-position Swap), which compensates for the information deficit in the model from both decoding and serial-position perspectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks, we validate that this method not only significantly eliminates Toxic CoT problems (decreased by 23.6%), but also effectively improves the model's overall commonsense reasoning performance (increased by 5.5%).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18344v2,2024-02
Learning to Generate Instruction Tuning Datasets for Zero-Shot Task Adaptation,"Nihal V. Nayak, Yiyang Nan, Avi Trost, Stephen H. Bach","We introduce Bonito, an open-source model for conditional task generation that converts unannotated text into task-specific training datasets for instruction tuning. We aim to enable zero-shot task adaptation of large language models on users' specialized, private data. We train Bonito by fine-tuning a pretrained large language model on a new large-scale dataset with 1.65M examples created by remixing existing instruction tuning datasets into meta-templates. The meta-templates for a dataset produce training examples where the input is the unannotated text and the task attribute and the output consists of the instruction and the response. We use Bonito to generate synthetic tasks for seven datasets from specialized domains with unannotated text across three task types -- yes-no question answering, extractive question answering, and natural language inference -- and adapt language models. We show that Bonito significantly improves the average performance of pretrained and instruction tuned models over the de facto self supervised baseline. For example, adapting Mistral-Instruct-v2 and instruction tuned variants of Mistral and Llama2 with Bonito improves the strong zero-shot performance by 22.1 F1 points whereas the next word prediction objective undoes some of the benefits of instruction tuning and reduces the average performance by 0.8 F1 points. We conduct additional experiments with Bonito to understand the effects of the domain, the size of the training set, and the choice of alternative synthetic task generators. Overall, we show that learning with synthetic instruction tuning datasets is an effective way to adapt language models to new domains. The model, dataset, and code are available at https://github.com/BatsResearch/bonito.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18334v3,2024-02
How to think step-by-step: A mechanistic understanding of chain-of-thought reasoning,"Subhabrata Dutta, Joykirat Singh, Soumen Chakrabarti, Tanmoy Chakraborty","Despite superior reasoning prowess demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a lack of understanding prevails around the internal mechanisms of the models that facilitate CoT generation. This work investigates the neural sub-structures within LLMs that manifest CoT reasoning from a mechanistic point of view. From an analysis of Llama-2 7B applied to multistep reasoning over fictional ontologies, we demonstrate that LLMs deploy multiple parallel pathways of answer generation for step-by-step reasoning. These parallel pathways provide sequential answers from the input question context as well as the generated CoT. We observe a functional rift in the middle layers of the LLM. Token representations in the initial half remain strongly biased towards the pretraining prior, with the in-context prior taking over in the later half. This internal phase shift manifests in different functional components: attention heads that write the answer token appear in the later half, attention heads that move information along ontological relationships appear in the initial half, and so on. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards mechanistic investigation of CoT reasoning in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18312v2,2024-02
Is Crowdsourcing Breaking Your Bank? Cost-Effective Fine-Tuning of Pre-trained Language Models with Proximal Policy Optimization,"Shuo Yang, Gjergji Kasneci","Wide usage of ChatGPT has highlighted the potential of reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, its training pipeline relies on manual ranking, a resource-intensive process. To reduce labor costs, we propose a self-supervised text ranking approach for applying Proximal-Policy-Optimization to fine-tune language models while eliminating the need for human annotators. Our method begins with probabilistic sampling to encourage a language model to generate diverse responses for each input. We then employ TextRank and ISODATA algorithms to rank and cluster these responses based on their semantics. Subsequently, we construct a reward model to learn the rank and optimize our generative policy. Our experimental results, conducted using two language models on three tasks, demonstrate that the models trained by our method considerably outperform baselines regarding BLEU, GLEU, and METEOR scores. Furthermore, our manual evaluation shows that our ranking results exhibit a remarkably high consistency with that of humans. This research significantly reduces training costs of proximal policy-guided models and demonstrates the potential for self-correction of language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18284v2,2024-02
Towards Better Understanding of Contrastive Sentence Representation Learning: A Unified Paradigm for Gradient,"Mingxin Li, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie","Sentence Representation Learning (SRL) is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), where contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is currently a mainstream approach. However, the reasons behind its remarkable effectiveness remain unclear. Specifically, many studies have investigated the similarities between contrastive and non-contrastive SSL from a theoretical perspective. Such similarities can be verified in classification tasks, where the two approaches achieve comparable performance. But in ranking tasks (i.e., Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) in SRL), contrastive SSL significantly outperforms non-contrastive SSL. Therefore, two questions arise: First, *what commonalities enable various contrastive losses to achieve superior performance in STS?* Second, *how can we make non-contrastive SSL also effective in STS?* To address these questions, we start from the perspective of gradients and discover that four effective contrastive losses can be integrated into a unified paradigm, which depends on three components: the **Gradient Dissipation**, the **Weight**, and the **Ratio**. Then, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the roles these components play in optimization and experimentally demonstrate their significance for model performance. Finally, by adjusting these components, we enable non-contrastive SSL to achieve outstanding performance in STS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18281v2,2024-02
Exploration of Adapter for Noise Robust Automatic Speech Recognition,"Hao Shi, Tatsuya Kawahara","Adapting an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to unseen noise environments is crucial. Integrating adapters into neural networks has emerged as a potent technique for transfer learning. This study thoroughly investigates adapter-based ASR adaptation in noisy environments. We conducted experiments using the CHiME--4 dataset. The results show that inserting the adapter in the shallow layer yields superior effectiveness, and there is no significant difference between adapting solely within the shallow layer and adapting across all layers. The simulated data helps the system to improve its performance under real noise conditions. Nonetheless, when the amount of data is the same, the real data is more effective than the simulated data. Multi-condition training is still useful for adapter training. Furthermore, integrating adapters into speech enhancement-based ASR systems yields substantial improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18275v3,2024-02
Rethinking the Bounds of LLM Reasoning: Are Multi-Agent Discussions the Key?,"Qineng Wang, Zihao Wang, Ying Su, Hanghang Tong, Yangqiu Song","Recent progress in LLMs discussion suggests that multi-agent discussion improves the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In this work, we reevaluate this claim through systematic experiments, where we propose a novel group discussion framework to enrich the set of discussion mechanisms. Interestingly, our results show that a single-agent LLM with strong prompts can achieve almost the same performance as the best existing discussion approach on a wide range of reasoning tasks and backbone LLMs. We observe that the multi-agent discussion performs better than a single agent only when there is no demonstration in the prompt. Further study reveals the common interaction mechanisms of LLMs during the discussion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18272v1,2024-02
"A Survey on Neural Question Generation: Methods, Applications, and Prospects","Shasha Guo, Lizi Liao, Cuiping Li, Tat-Seng Chua","In this survey, we present a detailed examination of the advancements in Neural Question Generation (NQG), a field leveraging neural network techniques to generate relevant questions from diverse inputs like knowledge bases, texts, and images. The survey begins with an overview of NQG's background, encompassing the task's problem formulation, prevalent benchmark datasets, established evaluation metrics, and notable applications. It then methodically classifies NQG approaches into three predominant categories: structured NQG, which utilizes organized data sources, unstructured NQG, focusing on more loosely structured inputs like texts or visual content, and hybrid NQG, drawing on diverse input modalities. This classification is followed by an in-depth analysis of the distinct neural network models tailored for each category, discussing their inherent strengths and potential limitations. The survey culminates with a forward-looking perspective on the trajectory of NQG, identifying emergent research trends and prospective developmental paths. Accompanying this survey is a curated collection of related research papers, datasets and codes, systematically organized on Github, providing an extensive reference for those delving into NQG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18267v2,2024-02

Yu, Qinyu Chen, Chenhao Xiong, Dawei Zhu, Han Qian, Mingbo Song, Weimin Xiong, Xiaoguang Li, Qun Liu, Sujian Li","It presents significant challenges to generate comprehensive and accurate Wikipedia articles for newly emerging events under a real-world scenario. Existing attempts fall short either by focusing only on short snippets or by using metrics that are insufficient to evaluate real-world scenarios. In this paper, we construct WIKIGENBENCH, a new benchmark consisting of 1,320 entries, designed to align with real-world scenarios in both generation and evaluation. For generation, we explore a real-world scenario where structured, full-length Wikipedia articles with citations are generated for new events using input documents from web sources. For evaluation, we integrate systematic metrics and LLM-based metrics to assess the verifiability, organization, and other aspects aligned with real-world scenarios. Based on this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments using various models within three commonly used frameworks: direct RAG, hierarchical structure-based RAG, and RAG with a fine-tuned generation model. Experimental results show that hierarchical-based methods can generate more comprehensive content, while fine-tuned methods achieve better verifiability. However, even the best methods still show a significant gap compared to existing Wikipedia content, indicating that further research is necessary.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18264v2,2024-02
Hierarchical Multimodal Pre-training for Visually Rich Webpage Understanding,"Hongshen Xu, Lu Chen, Zihan Zhao, Da Ma, Ruisheng Cao, Zichen Zhu, Kai Yu","The growing prevalence of visually rich documents, such as webpages and scanned/digital-born documents (images, PDFs, etc.), has led to increased interest in automatic document understanding and information extraction across academia and industry. Although various document modalities, including image, text, layout, and structure, facilitate human information retrieval, the interconnected nature of these modalities presents challenges for neural networks. In this paper, we introduce WebLM, a multimodal pre-training network designed to address the limitations of solely modeling text and structure modalities of HTML in webpages. Instead of processing document images as unified natural images, WebLM integrates the hierarchical structure of document images to enhance the understanding of markup-language-based documents. Additionally, we propose several pre-training tasks to model the interaction among text, structure, and image modalities effectively. Empirical results demonstrate that the pre-trained WebLM significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art pre-trained models across several webpage understanding tasks. The pre-trained models and code are available at https://github.com/X-LANCE/weblm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18262v1,2024-02
A BiRGAT Model for Multi-intent Spoken Language Understanding with Hierarchical Semantic Frames,"Hongshen Xu, Ruisheng Cao, Su Zhu, Sheng Jiang, Hanchong Zhang, Lu Chen, Kai Yu","Previous work on spoken language understanding (SLU) mainly focuses on single-intent settings, where each input utterance merely contains one user intent. This configuration significantly limits the surface form of user utterances and the capacity of output semantics. In this work, we first propose a Multi-Intent dataset which is collected from a realistic in-Vehicle dialogue System, called MIVS. The target semantic frame is organized in a 3-layer hierarchical structure to tackle the alignment and assignment problems in multi-intent cases. Accordingly, we devise a BiRGAT model to encode the hierarchy of ontology items, the backbone of which is a dual relational graph attention network. Coupled with the 3-way pointer-generator decoder, our method outperforms traditional sequence labeling and classification-based schemes by a large margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18258v1,2024-02
Towards Generalist Prompting for Large Language Models by Mental Models,"Haoxiang Guan, Jiyan He, Shuxin Zheng, En-Hong Chen, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on many tasks. However, to achieve optimal performance, specially designed prompting methods are still needed. These methods either rely on task-specific few-shot examples that require a certain level of domain knowledge, or are designed to be simple but only perform well on a few types of tasks. In this work, we attempt to introduce the concept of generalist prompting, which operates on the design principle of achieving optimal or near-optimal performance on a wide range of tasks while eliminating the need for manual selection and customization of prompts tailored to specific problems. Furthermore, we propose MeMo (Mental Models), an innovative prompting method that is simple-designed yet effectively fulfills the criteria of generalist prompting. MeMo distills the cores of various prompting methods into individual mental models and allows LLMs to autonomously select the most suitable mental models for the problem, achieving or being near to the state-of-the-art results on diverse tasks such as STEM, logical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning in zero-shot settings. We hope that the insights presented herein will stimulate further exploration of generalist prompting methods for LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18252v1,2024-02
Learning or Self-aligning?

Previous works mainly focus on the IFT's role in the transfer of behavioral norms and the learning of additional world knowledge. However, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of IFT remains significantly limited. In this paper, we design a knowledge intervention framework to decouple the potential underlying factors of IFT, thereby enabling individual analysis of different factors. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that attempting to learn additional world knowledge through IFT often struggles to yield positive impacts and can even lead to markedly negative effects. Further, we discover that maintaining internal knowledge consistency before and after IFT is a critical factor for achieving successful IFT. Our findings reveal the underlying mechanisms of IFT and provide robust support for some very recent and potential future works.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18243v3,2024-02
Prospect Personalized Recommendation on Large Language Model-based Agent Platform,"Jizhi Zhang, Keqin Bao, Wenjie Wang, Yang Zhang, Wentao Shi, Wanhong Xu, Fuli Feng, Tat-Seng Chua","The new kind of Agent-oriented information system, exemplified by GPTs, urges us to inspect the information system infrastructure to support Agent-level information processing and to adapt to the characteristics of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Agents, such as interactivity. In this work, we envisage the prospect of the recommender system on LLM-based Agent platforms and introduce a novel recommendation paradigm called Rec4Agentverse, comprised of Agent Items and Agent Recommender. Rec4Agentverse emphasizes the collaboration between Agent Items and Agent Recommender, thereby promoting personalized information services and enhancing the exchange of information beyond the traditional user-recommender feedback loop. Additionally, we prospect the evolution of Rec4Agentverse and conceptualize it into three stages based on the enhancement of the interaction and information exchange among Agent Items, Agent Recommender, and the user. A preliminary study involving several cases of Rec4Agentverse validates its significant potential for application. Lastly, we discuss potential issues and promising directions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18240v2,2024-02
CogBench: a large language model walks into a psychology lab,"Julian Coda-Forno, Marcel Binz, Jane X. Wang, Eric Schulz","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of artificial intelligence. Yet, evaluating them comprehensively remains challenging. We argue that this is partly due to the predominant focus on performance metrics in most benchmarks. This paper introduces CogBench, a benchmark that includes ten behavioral metrics derived from seven cognitive psychology experiments. This novel approach offers a toolkit for phenotyping LLMs' behavior. We apply CogBench to 35 LLMs, yielding a rich and diverse dataset. We analyze this data using statistical multilevel modeling techniques, accounting for the nested dependencies among fine-tuned versions of specific LLMs. Our study highlights the crucial role of model size and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in improving performance and aligning with human behavior. Interestingly, we find that open-source models are less risk-prone than proprietary models and that fine-tuning on code does not necessarily enhance LLMs' behavior. Finally, we explore the effects of prompt-engineering techniques. We discover that chain-of-thought prompting improves probabilistic reasoning, while take-a-step-back prompting fosters model-based behaviors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18225v1,2024-02
Improving Open-Ended Text Generation via Adaptive Decoding,"Wenhong Zhu, Hongkun Hao, Zhiwei He, Yiming Ai, Rui Wang","Current language models decode text token by token according to probabilistic distribution, and determining the appropriate candidates for the next token is crucial to ensure generation quality. This study introduces adaptive decoding, a mechanism that dynamically empowers language models to ascertain a sensible candidate set during generation. Specifically, we introduce an entropy-based metric called confidence and conceptualize determining the optimal candidate set as a confidence-increasing process. The rationality of including a token in the candidate set is assessed by leveraging the increment of confidence. Experimental results reveal that our method balances diversity and coherence well. The human evaluation shows that our method can generate human-preferred text. Additionally, our method can potentially improve the reasoning ability of language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18223v2,2024-02
LLM Task Interference: An Initial Study on the Impact of Task-Switch in Conversational History,"Akash Gupta, Ivaxi Sheth, Vyas Raina, Mark Gales, Mario Fritz","With the recent emergence of powerful instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), various helpful conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have been deployed across many applications. When prompted by users, these AI systems successfully perform a wide range of tasks as part of a conversation. To provide some sort of memory and context, such approaches typically condition their output on the entire conversational history. Although this sensitivity to the conversational history can often lead to improved performance on subsequent tasks, we find that performance can in fact also be negatively impacted, if there is a task-switch. To the best of our knowledge, our work makes the first attempt to formalize the study of such vulnerabilities and interference of tasks in conversational LLMs caused by task-switches in the conversational history. Our experiments across 5 datasets with 15 task switches using popular LLMs reveal that many of the task-switches can lead to significant performance degradation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18216v2,2024-02
DANSK and DaCy 2.6.0: Domain Generalization of Danish Named Entity Recognition,"Kenneth Enevoldsen, Emil Trenckner Jessen, Rebekah Baglini","Named entity recognition is one of the cornerstones of Danish NLP, essential for language technology applications within both industry and research. However, Danish NER is inhibited by a lack of available datasets. As a consequence, no current models are capable of fine-grained named entity recognition, nor have they been evaluated for potential generalizability issues across datasets and domains. To alleviate these limitations, this paper introduces: 1) DANSK: a named entity dataset providing for high-granularity tagging as well as within-domain evaluation of models across a diverse set of domains; 2) DaCy 2.6.0 that includes three generalizable models with fine-grained annotation; and 3) an evaluation of current state-of-the-art models' ability to generalize across domains. The evaluation of existing and new models revealed notable performance discrepancies across domains, which should be addressed within the field. Shortcomings of the annotation quality of the dataset and its impact on model training and evaluation are also discussed. Despite these limitations, we advocate for the use of the new dataset DANSK alongside further work on the generalizability within Danish NER.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18209v1,2024-02
Clustering and Ranking: Diversity-preserved Instruction Selection through Expert-aligned Quality Estimation,"Yuan Ge, Yilun Liu, Chi Hu, Weibin Meng, Shimin Tao, Xiaofeng Zhao, Hongxia Ma, Li Zhang, Boxing Chen, Hao Yang, Bei Li, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu","With contributions from the open-source community, a vast amount of instruction tuning (IT) data has emerged. Given the significant resource allocation required for training and evaluating models, it is advantageous to have an efficient method for selecting high-quality IT data. However, existing methods for instruction data selection have limitations such as relying on fragile external APIs, being affected by biases in GPT models, or reducing the diversity of the selected instruction dataset. In this paper, we propose an industrial-friendly, expert-aligned and diversity-preserved instruction data selection method: Clustering and Ranking (CaR). CaR employs a two-step process: first, it ranks instruction pairs using a high-accuracy (84.25%) scoring model aligned with expert preferences; second, it preserves dataset diversity through clustering. In our experiment, CaR efficiently selected a mere 1.96% of Alpaca's IT data, yet the resulting AlpaCaR model surpassed Alpaca's performance by an average of 32.1% in GPT-4 evaluations. Moreover, we find that data selecting is a consistent paradigm whether the pre-trained model is more capable or the model parameters scaling up. Our approach employs compact models with 550M parameters and incurs just 11.2% of the financial outlay of current methods, enhancing its industrial deployability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18191v3,2024-02
Challenges in Pre-Training Graph Neural Networks for Context-Based Fake News Detection: An Evaluation of Current Strategies and Resource Limitations,"Gregor Donabauer, Udo Kruschwitz","Pre-training of neural networks has recently revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has before demonstrated its effectiveness in computer vision. At the same time, advances around the detection of fake news were mainly driven by the context-based paradigm, where different types of signals (e.g. from social media) form graph-like structures that hold contextual information apart from the news article to classify. We propose to merge these two developments by applying pre-training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the domain of context-based fake news detection. Our experiments provide an evaluation of different pre-training strategies for graph-based misinformation detection and demonstrate that transfer learning does currently not lead to significant improvements over training a model from scratch in the domain.

However, understanding the intention behind social media posts remains challenging due to the implicitness of intentions in social media posts, the need for cross-modality understanding of both text and images, and the presence of noisy information such as hashtags, misspelled words, and complicated abbreviations. To address these challenges, we present MIKO, a Multimodal Intention Kowledge DistillatiOn framework that collaboratively leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) and a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to uncover users' intentions. Specifically, we use an MLLM to interpret the image and an LLM to extract key information from the text and finally instruct the LLM again to generate intentions. By applying MIKO to publicly available social media datasets, we construct an intention knowledge base featuring 1,372K intentions rooted in 137,287 posts. We conduct a two-stage annotation to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the performance of widely used LLMs for intention generation. We further apply MIKO to a sarcasm detection dataset and distill a student model to demonstrate the downstream benefits of applying intention knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18169v2,2024-02
Evaluating Quantized Large Language Models,"Shiyao Li, Xuefei Ning, Luning Wang, Tengxuan Liu, Xiangsheng Shi, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang","Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising technique to reduce the cost of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, PTQ can effectively mitigate memory consumption and reduce computational overhead in LLMs. To meet the requirements of both high efficiency and performance across diverse scenarios, a comprehensive evaluation of quantized LLMs is essential to guide the selection of quantization methods. This paper presents a thorough evaluation of these factors by evaluating the effect of PTQ on Weight, Activation, and KV Cache on 11 model families, including OPT, LLaMA2, Falcon, Bloomz, Mistral, ChatGLM, Vicuna, LongChat, StableLM, Gemma, and Mamba, with parameters ranging from 125M to 180B. The evaluation encompasses five types of tasks: basic NLP, emergent ability, trustworthiness, dialogue, and long-context tasks. Moreover, we also evaluate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantization methods to demonstrate their applicability.

From Summary to Action: Enhancing Large Language Models for Complex Tasks with Open World APIs,"Yulong Liu, Yunlong Yuan, Chunwei Wang, Jianhua Han, Yongqiang Ma, Li Zhang, Nanning Zheng, Hang Xu","The distinction between humans and animals lies in the unique ability of humans to use and create tools. Tools empower humans to overcome physiological limitations, fostering the creation of magnificent civilizations. Similarly, enabling foundational models like Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capacity to learn external tool usage may serve as a pivotal step toward realizing artificial general intelligence. Previous studies in this field have predominantly pursued two distinct approaches to augment the tool invocation capabilities of LLMs. The first approach emphasizes the construction of relevant datasets for model fine-tuning. The second approach, in contrast, aims to fully exploit the inherent reasoning abilities of LLMs through in-context learning strategies. In this work, we introduce a novel tool invocation pipeline designed to control massive real-world APIs. This pipeline mirrors the human task-solving process, addressing complicated real-life user queries. At each step, we guide LLMs to summarize the achieved results and determine the next course of action. We term this pipeline `from Summary to action', Sum2Act for short. Empirical evaluations of our Sum2Act pipeline on the ToolBench benchmark show significant performance improvements, outperforming established methods like ReAct and DFSDT. This highlights Sum2Act's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs for complex real-world tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18157v1,2024-02
Cutting Off the Head Ends the Conflict: A Mechanism for Interpreting and Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Language Models,"Zhuoran Jin, Pengfei Cao, Hongbang Yuan, Yubo Chen, Jiexin Xu, Huaijun Li, Xiaojian Jiang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","Recently, retrieval augmentation and tool augmentation have demonstrated a remarkable capability to expand the internal memory boundaries of language models (LMs) by providing external context. However, internal memory and external context inevitably clash, leading to knowledge conflicts within LMs. In this paper, we aim to interpret the mechanism of knowledge conflicts through the lens of information flow, and then mitigate conflicts by precise interventions at the pivotal point. We find there are some attention heads with opposite effects in the later layers, where memory heads can recall knowledge from internal memory, and context heads can retrieve knowledge from external context. Moreover, we reveal that the pivotal point at which knowledge conflicts emerge in LMs is the integration of inconsistent information flows by memory heads and context heads. Inspired by the insights, we propose a novel method called Pruning Head via PatH PatcHing (PH3), which can efficiently mitigate knowledge conflicts by pruning conflicting attention heads without updating model parameters. PH3 can flexibly control eight LMs to use internal memory ($\uparrow$ 44.0%) or external context ($\uparrow$ 38.5%). Moreover, PH3 can also improve the performance of LMs on open-domain QA tasks. We also conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the cross-model, cross-relation, and cross-format generalization of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18154v1,2024-02

MMSR: Symbolic Regression is a Multi-Modal Information Fusion Task,"Yanjie Li, Jingyi Liu, Weijun Li, Lina Yu, Min Wu, Wenqiang Li, Meilan Hao, Su Wei, Yusong Deng","Mathematical formulas are the crystallization of human wisdom in exploring the laws of nature for thousands of years. Describing the complex laws of nature with a concise mathematical formula is a constant pursuit of scientists and a great challenge for artificial intelligence. This field is called symbolic regression (SR). Symbolic regression was originally formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem, and Genetic Programming (GP) and Reinforcement Learning algorithms were used to solve it. However, GP is sensitive to hyperparameters, and these two types of algorithms are inefficient. To solve this problem, researchers treat the mapping from data to expressions as a translation problem. And the corresponding large-scale pre-trained model is introduced. However, the data and expression skeletons do not have very clear word correspondences as the two languages do. Instead, they are more like two modalities (e.g., image and text). Therefore, in this paper, we proposed MMSR. The SR problem is solved as a pure multi-modal problem, and contrastive learning is also introduced in the training process for modal alignment to facilitate later modal feature fusion. It is worth noting that to better promote the modal feature fusion, we adopt the strategy of training contrastive learning loss and other losses at the same time, which only needs one-step training, instead of training contrastive learning loss first and then training other losses. Because our experiments prove training together can make the feature extraction module and feature fusion module wearing-in better. Experimental results show that compared with multiple large-scale pre-training baselines, MMSR achieves the most advanced results on multiple mainstream datasets including SRBench.

Unsupervised Information Refinement Training of Large Language Models for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Shicheng Xu, Liang Pang, Mo Yu, Fandong Meng, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng, Jie Zhou","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating additional information from retrieval. However, studies have shown that LLMs still face challenges in effectively using the retrieved information, even ignoring it or being misled by it. The key reason is that the training of LLMs does not clearly make LLMs learn how to utilize input retrieved texts with varied quality. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that considers the role of LLMs in RAG as ``Information Refiner'', which means that regardless of correctness, completeness, or usefulness of retrieved texts, LLMs can consistently integrate knowledge within the retrieved texts and model parameters to generate the texts that are more concise, accurate, and complete than the retrieved texts. To this end, we propose an information refinement training method named InFO-RAG that optimizes LLMs for RAG in an unsupervised manner. InFO-RAG is low-cost and general across various tasks. Extensive experiments on zero-shot prediction of 11 datasets in diverse tasks including Question Answering, Slot-Filling, Language Modeling, Dialogue, and Code Generation show that InFO-RAG improves the performance of LLaMA2 by an average of 9.39\% relative points. InFO-RAG also shows advantages in in-context learning and robustness of RAG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18150v2,2024-02
Learning Intrinsic Dimension via Information Bottleneck for Explainable Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Zhenxiao Cheng, Jie Zhou, Wen Wu, Qin Chen, Liang He","Gradient-based explanation methods are increasingly used to interpret neural models in natural language processing (NLP) due to their high fidelity. Such methods determine word-level importance using dimension-level gradient values through a norm function, often presuming equal significance for all gradient dimensions. However, in the context of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), our preliminary research suggests that only specific dimensions are pertinent. To address this, we propose the Information Bottleneck-based Gradient (\texttt{IBG}) explanation framework for ABSA. This framework leverages an information bottleneck to refine word embeddings into a concise intrinsic dimension, maintaining essential features and omitting unrelated information. Comprehensive tests show that our \texttt{IBG} approach considerably improves both the models' performance and interpretability by identifying sentiment-aware features.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18145v1,2024-02
Cause and Effect: Can Large Language Models Truly Understand Causality?,"Swagata Ashwani, Kshiteesh Hegde, Nishith Reddy Mannuru, Mayank Jindal, Dushyant Singh Sengar, Krishna Chaitanya Rao Kathala, Dishant Banga, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha","With the rise of Large Language Models(LLMs), it has become crucial to understand their capabilities and limitations in deciphering and explaining the complex web of causal relationships that language entails. Current methods use either explicit or implicit causal reasoning, yet there is a strong need for a unified approach combining both to tackle a wide array of causal relationships more effectively. This research proposes a novel architecture called Context Aware Reasoning Enhancement with Counterfactual Analysis(CARE CA) framework to enhance causal reasoning and explainability. The proposed framework incorporates an explicit causal detection module with ConceptNet and counterfactual statements, as well as implicit causal detection through LLMs. Our framework goes one step further with a layer of counterfactual explanations to accentuate LLMs understanding of causality. The knowledge from ConceptNet enhances the performance of multiple causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery, causal identification and counterfactual reasoning. The counterfactual sentences add explicit knowledge of the not caused by scenarios. By combining these powerful modules, our model aims to provide a deeper understanding of causal relationships, enabling enhanced interpretability. Evaluation of benchmark datasets shows improved performance across all metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. We also introduce CausalNet, a new dataset accompanied by our code, to facilitate further research in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18139v3,2024-02
DecisionNCE: Embodied Multimodal Representations via Implicit Preference Learning,"Jianxiong Li, Jinliang Zheng, Yinan Zheng, Liyuan Mao, Xiao Hu, Sijie Cheng, Haoyi Niu, Jihao Liu, Yu Liu, Jingjing Liu, Ya-Qin Zhang, Xianyuan Zhan","Multimodal pretraining is an effective strategy for the trinity of goals of representation learning in autonomous robots: 1) extracting both local and global task progressions; 2) enforcing temporal consistency of visual representation; 3) capturing trajectory-level language grounding. Most existing methods approach these via separate objectives, which often reach sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a universal unified objective that can simultaneously extract meaningful task progression information from image sequences and seamlessly align them with language instructions. We discover that via implicit preferences, where a visual trajectory inherently aligns better with its corresponding language instruction than mismatched pairs, the popular Bradley-Terry model can transform into representation learning through proper reward reparameterizations. The resulted framework, DecisionNCE, mirrors an InfoNCE-style objective but is distinctively tailored for decision-making tasks, providing an embodied representation learning framework that elegantly extracts both local and global task progression features, with temporal consistency enforced through implicit time contrastive learning, while ensuring trajectory-level instruction grounding via multimodal joint encoding. Evaluation on both simulated and real robots demonstrates that DecisionNCE effectively facilitates diverse downstream policy learning tasks, offering a versatile solution for unified representation and reward learning.

"Exploring Multilingual Concepts of Human Value in Large Language Models: Is Value Alignment Consistent, Transferable and Controllable across Languages?","Shaoyang Xu, Weilong Dong, Zishan Guo, Xinwei Wu, Deyi Xiong","Prior research has revealed that certain abstract concepts are linearly represented as directions in the representation space of LLMs, predominantly centered around English. In this paper, we extend this investigation to a multilingual context, with a specific focus on human values-related concepts (i.e., value concepts) due to their significance for AI safety. Through our comprehensive exploration covering 7 types of human values, 16 languages and 3 LLM series with distinct multilinguality (e.g., monolingual, bilingual and multilingual), we first empirically confirm the presence of value concepts within LLMs in a multilingual format. Further analysis on the cross-lingual characteristics of these concepts reveals 3 traits arising from language resource disparities: cross-lingual inconsistency, distorted linguistic relationships, and unidirectional cross-lingual transfer between high- and low-resource languages, all in terms of value concepts. Moreover, we validate the feasibility of cross-lingual control over value alignment capabilities of LLMs, leveraging the dominant language as a source language. Ultimately, recognizing the significant impact of LLMs' multilinguality on our results, we consolidate our findings and provide prudent suggestions on the composition of multilingual data for LLMs pre-training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18120v3,2024-02
UniVS: Unified and Universal Video Segmentation with Prompts as Queries,"Minghan Li, Shuai Li, Xindong Zhang, Lei Zhang","Despite the recent advances in unified image segmentation (IS), developing a unified video segmentation (VS) model remains a challenge. This is mainly because generic category-specified VS tasks need to detect all objects and track them across consecutive frames, while prompt-guided VS tasks require re-identifying the target with visual/text prompts throughout the entire video, making it hard to handle the different tasks with the same architecture. We make an attempt to address these issues and present a novel unified VS architecture, namely UniVS, by using prompts as queries. UniVS averages the prompt features of the target from previous frames as its initial query to explicitly decode masks, and introduces a target-wise prompt cross-attention layer in the mask decoder to integrate prompt features in the memory pool. By taking the predicted masks of entities from previous frames as their visual prompts, UniVS converts different VS tasks into prompt-guided target segmentation, eliminating the heuristic inter-frame matching process. Our framework not only unifies the different VS tasks but also naturally achieves universal training and testing, ensuring robust performance across different scenarios. UniVS shows a commendable balance between performance and universality on 10 challenging VS benchmarks, covering video instance, semantic, panoptic, object, and referring segmentation tasks.

Small But Funny: A Feedback-Driven Approach to Humor Distillation,"Sahithya Ravi, Patrick Huber, Akshat Shrivastava, Aditya Sagar, Ahmed Aly, Vered Shwartz, Arash Einolghozati","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought to light promising language generation capabilities, particularly in performing tasks like complex reasoning and creative writing. Consequently, distillation through imitation of teacher responses has emerged as a popular technique to transfer knowledge from LLMs to more accessible, Small Language Models (SLMs). While this works well for simpler tasks, there is a substantial performance gap on tasks requiring intricate language comprehension and creativity, such as humor generation. We hypothesize that this gap may stem from the fact that creative tasks might be hard to learn by imitation alone and explore whether an approach, involving supplementary guidance from the teacher, could yield higher performance. To address this, we study the effect of assigning a dual role to the LLM - as a ""teacher"" generating data, as well as a ""critic"" evaluating the student's performance. Our experiments on humor generation reveal that the incorporation of feedback significantly narrows the performance gap between SLMs and their larger counterparts compared to merely relying on imitation. As a result, our research highlights the potential of using feedback as an additional dimension to data when transferring complex language abilities via distillation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18113v1,2024-02
LoRA-SP: Streamlined Partial Parameter Adaptation for Resource-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models,"Yichao Wu, Yafei Xiang, Shuning Huo, Yulu Gong, Penghao Liang","In addressing the computational and memory demands of fine-tuning Large Language Models(LLMs), we propose LoRA-SP(Streamlined Partial Parameter Adaptation), a novel approach utilizing randomized half-selective parameter freezing within the Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)framework. This method efficiently balances pre-trained knowledge retention and adaptability for task-specific optimizations. Through a randomized mechanism, LoRA-SP determines which parameters to update or freeze, significantly reducing computational and memory requirements without compromising model performance. We evaluated LoRA-SP across several benchmark NLP tasks, demonstrating its ability to achieve competitive performance with substantially lower resource consumption compared to traditional full-parameter fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient techniques. LoRA-SP innovative approach not only facilitates the deployment of advanced NLP models in resource-limited settings but also opens new research avenues into effective and efficient model adaptation strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08822v1,2024-02
Assessing the Efficacy of Grammar Error Correction: A Human Evaluation Approach in the Japanese Context,"Qiao Wang, Zheng Yuan","In this study, we evaluated the performance of the state-of-the-art sequence tagging grammar error detection and correction model (SeqTagger) using Japanese university students' writing samples. With an automatic annotation toolkit, ERRANT, we first evaluated SeqTagger's performance on error correction with human expert correction as the benchmark. Then a human-annotated approach was adopted to evaluate Seqtagger's performance in error detection using a subset of the writing dataset. Results indicated a precision of 63.66% and a recall of 20.19% for error correction in the full dataset. For the subset, after manual exclusion of irrelevant errors such as semantic and mechanical ones, the model shows an adjusted precision of 97.98% and an adjusted recall of 42.98% for error detection, indicating the model's high accuracy but also its conservativeness. Thematic analysis on errors undetected by the model revealed that determiners and articles, especially the latter, were predominant. Specifically, in terms of context-independent errors, the model occasionally overlooked basic ones and faced challenges with overly erroneous or complex structures. Meanwhile, context-dependent errors, notably those related to tense and noun number, as well as those possibly influenced by the students' first language (L1), remained particularly challenging.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18101v2,2024-02
Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large Language Models,"Derong Xu, Ziheng Zhang, Zhihong Zhu, Zhenxi Lin, Qidong Liu, Xian Wu, Tong Xu, Wanyu Wang, Yuyang Ye, Xiangyu Zhao, Enhong Chen, Yefeng Zheng","Model editing aims to precisely alter the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in relation to specific knowledge, while leaving unrelated knowledge intact. This approach has proven effective in addressing issues of hallucination and outdated information in LLMs. However, the potential of using model editing to modify knowledge in the medical field remains largely unexplored, even though resolving hallucination is a pressing need in this area. Our observations indicate that current methods face significant challenges in dealing with specialized and complex knowledge in medical domain. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. MedLaSA harnesses the strengths of both adding extra parameters and locate-then-edit methods for medical model editing. We utilize causal tracing to identify the association of knowledge in neurons across different layers, and generate a corresponding scale set from the association value for each piece of knowledge. Subsequently, we incorporate scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge, which allows for the adjustment of the adapter's weight and rank. The more similar the content, the more consistent the scale between them. This ensures precise editing of semantically identical knowledge while avoiding impact on unrelated knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact on the behaviours of LLMs, we propose two model editing studies for medical domain: (1) editing factual knowledge for medical specialization and (2) editing the explanatory ability for complex knowledge. We build two novel medical benchmarking datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics. Extensive experiments on medical LLMs demonstrate the editing efficiency of MedLaSA, without affecting unrelated knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18099v3,2024-02
Polos: Multimodal Metric Learning from Human Feedback for Image Captioning,"Yuiga Wada, Kanta Kaneda, Daichi Saito, Komei Sugiura","Establishing an automatic evaluation metric that closely aligns with human judgments is essential for effectively developing image captioning models. Recent data-driven metrics have demonstrated a stronger correlation with human judgments than classic metrics such as CIDEr; however they lack sufficient capabilities to handle hallucinations and generalize across diverse images and texts partially because they compute scalar similarities merely using embeddings learned from tasks unrelated to image captioning evaluation. In this study, we propose Polos, a supervised automatic evaluation metric for image captioning models. Polos computes scores from multimodal inputs, using a parallel feature extraction mechanism that leverages embeddings trained through large-scale contrastive learning. To train Polos, we introduce Multimodal Metric Learning from Human Feedback (M$^2$LHF), a framework for developing metrics based on human feedback. We constructed the Polaris dataset, which comprises 131K human judgments from 550 evaluators, which is approximately ten times larger than standard datasets. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art performance on Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, PASCAL-50S, FOIL, and the Polaris dataset, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18091v1,2024-02
On the use of Silver Standard Data for Zero-shot Classification Tasks in Information Extraction,"Jianwei Wang, Tianyin Wang, Ziqian Zeng","The superior performance of supervised classification methods in the information extraction (IE) area heavily relies on a large amount of gold standard data. Recent zero-shot classification methods converted the task to other NLP tasks (e.g., textual entailment) and used off-the-shelf models of these NLP tasks to directly perform inference on the test data without using a large amount of IE annotation data. A potentially valuable by-product of these methods is the large-scale silver standard data, i.e., pseudo-labeled data by the off-the-shelf models of other NLP tasks. However, there is no further investigation into the use of these data. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Clean-LaVe, which aims to utilize silver standard data to enhance the zero-shot performance. Clean-LaVe includes four phases: (1) Obtaining silver data; (2) Identifying relatively clean data from silver data; (3) Finetuning the off-the-shelf model using clean data; (4) Inference on the test data. The experimental results show that Clean-LaVe can outperform the baseline by 5% and 6% on TACRED and Wiki80 dataset in the zero-shot relation classification task, and by 3%-7% on Smile (Korean and Polish) in the zero-shot cross-lingual relation classification task, and by 8% on ACE05-E+ in the zero-shot event argument classification task.

Benchmarking Large Language Models on Answering and Explaining Challenging Medical Questions,"Hanjie Chen, Zhouxiang Fang, Yash Singla, Mark Dredze","LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in answering medical questions, such as achieving passing scores on medical licensing examinations. However, medical board exam or general clinical questions do not capture the complexity of realistic clinical cases. Moreover, the lack of reference explanations means we cannot easily evaluate the reasoning of model decisions, a crucial component of supporting doctors in making complex medical decisions. To address these challenges, we construct two new datasets: JAMA Clinical Challenge and Medbullets. JAMA Clinical Challenge consists of questions based on challenging clinical cases, while Medbullets comprises simulated clinical questions. Both datasets are structured as multiple-choice question-answering tasks, accompanied by expert-written explanations. We evaluate seven LLMs on the two datasets using various prompts. Experiments demonstrate that our datasets are harder than previous benchmarks. Human and automatic evaluations of model-generated explanations provide insights into the promise and deficiency of LLMs for explainable medical QA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18060v4,2024-02
Token-Specific Watermarking with Enhanced Detectability and Semantic Coherence for Large Language Models,"Mingjia Huo, Sai Ashish Somayajula, Youwei Liang, Ruisi Zhang, Farinaz Koushanfar, Pengtao Xie","Large language models generate high-quality responses with potential misinformation, underscoring the need for regulation by distinguishing AI-generated and human-written texts. Watermarking is pivotal in this context, which involves embedding hidden markers in texts during the LLM inference phase, which is imperceptible to humans. Achieving both the detectability of inserted watermarks and the semantic quality of generated texts is challenging. While current watermarking algorithms have made promising progress in this direction, there remains significant scope for improvement. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach for watermarking that utilizes lightweight networks to generate token-specific watermarking logits and splitting ratios. By leveraging MOO to optimize for both detection and semantic objective functions, our method simultaneously achieves detectability and semantic integrity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current watermarking techniques in enhancing the detectability of texts generated by LLMs while maintaining their semantic coherence.

Contextualizing Generated Citation Texts,"Biswadip Mandal, Xiangci Li, Jessica Ouyang","Abstractive citation text generation is usually framed as an infilling task, where a sequence-to-sequence model is trained to generate a citation given a reference paper and the context window around the target; the generated citation should be a brief discussion of the reference paper as it relates to the citing context. However, examining a recent LED-based citation generation system, we find that many of the generated citations are generic summaries of the reference papers main contribution, ignoring the citation contexts focus on a different topic. To address this problem, we propose a simple modification to the citation text generation task: the generation target is not only the citation itself, but the entire context window, including the target citation. This approach can be easily applied to any abstractive citation generation system, and our experimental results show that training in this way is preferred by human readers and allows the generation model to make use of contextual clues about what topic to discuss and what stance to take.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18054v1,2024-02

Therefore, we advocate a collaborative approach where humans and LLMs work together to produce reliable and high-quality labels. We present MEGAnno+, a human-LLM collaborative annotation system that offers effective LLM agent and annotation management, convenient and robust LLM annotation, and exploratory verification of LLM labels by humans.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18050v1,2024-02

Through experiments on four question answering (QA) datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness ohttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#abstractsf our proposed method.

Multi-FAct: Assessing Factuality of Multilingual LLMs using FActScore,"Sheikh Shafayat, Eunsu Kim, Juhyun Oh, Alice Oh","Evaluating the factuality of long-form large language model (LLM)-generated text is an important challenge. Recently there has been a surge of interest in factuality evaluation for English, but little is known about the factuality evaluation of multilingual LLMs, specially when it comes to long-form generation. %This paper systematically evaluates multilingual LLMs' factual accuracy across languages and geographic regions. We introduce a simple pipeline for multilingual factuality evaluation, by applying FActScore (Min et al., 2023) for diverse languages. In addition to evaluating multilingual factual generation, we evaluate the factual accuracy of long-form text generation in topics that reflect regional diversity. We also examine the feasibility of running the FActScore pipeline using non-English Wikipedia and provide comprehensive guidelines on multilingual factual evaluation for regionally diverse topics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18045v3,2024-02

It brings into a single public debate issues of energy dependency and sustainability, fair distribution of economic burdens and cost of living, as well as climate change, risk, and sustainability. In this paper, we investigate the public discourse around the energy crisis and cost of living to identify how these pivotal and contradictory issues are reconciled in this debate and to identify which social actors are involved and the role they play. We analyse a document corpus retrieved from UK newspapers from January 2014 to March 2023.

Datasets for Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey,"Yang Liu, Jiahuan Cao, Chongyu Liu, Kai Ding, Lianwen Jin","This paper embarks on an exploration into the Large Language Model (LLM) datasets, which play a crucial role in the remarkable advancements of LLMs. The datasets serve as the foundational infrastructure analogous to a root system that sustains and nurtures the development of LLMs. Consequently, examination of these datasets emerges as a critical topic in research. In order to address the current lack of a comprehensive overview and thorough analysis of LLM datasets, and to gain insights into their current status and future trends, this survey consolidates and categorizes the fundamental aspects of LLM datasets from five perspectives: (1) Pre-training Corpora; (2) Instruction Fine-tuning Datasets; (3) Preference Datasets; (4) Evaluation Datasets; (5) Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) Datasets.

ResLoRA: Identity Residual Mapping in Low-Rank Adaption,"Shuhua Shi, Shaohan Huang, Minghui Song, Zhoujun Li, Zihan Zhang, Haizhen Huang, Furu Wei, Weiwei Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang","As one of the most popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is commonly applied to fine-tune large language models (LLMs). However, updating the weights of LoRA blocks effectively and expeditiously is challenging due to the long calculation path in the original model. To address this, we propose ResLoRA, an improved framework of LoRA. By adding residual paths during training and using merging approaches to eliminate these extra paths during inference, our method can achieve better results in fewer training steps without any extra trainable parameters or inference cost compared to LoRA. The experiments on NLG, NLU, and text-to-image tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. To the best of our knowledge, ResLoRA is the first work that combines the residual path with LoRA.

Corpus-Steered Query Expansion with Large Language Models,"Yibin Lei, Yu Cao, Tianyi Zhou, Tao Shen, Andrew Yates","Recent studies demonstrate that query expansions generated by large language models (LLMs) can considerably enhance information retrieval systems by generating hypothetical documents that answer the queries as expansions. However, challenges arise from misalignments between the expansions and the retrieval corpus, resulting in issues like hallucinations and outdated information due to the limited intrinsic knowledge of LLMs. Inspired by Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF), we introduce Corpus-Steered Query Expansion (CSQE) to promote the incorporation of knowledge embedded within the corpus. CSQE utilizes the relevance assessing capability of LLMs to systematically identify pivotal sentences in the initially-retrieved documents. These corpus-originated texts are subsequently used to expand the query together with LLM-knowledge empowered expansions, improving the relevance prediction between the query and the target documents. Extensive experiments reveal that CSQE exhibits strong performance without necessitating any training, especially with queries for which LLMs lack knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18031v1,2024-02
Hire a Linguist!: Learning Endangered Languages with In-Context Linguistic Descriptions,"Kexun Zhang, Yee Man Choi, Zhenqiao Song, Taiqi He, William Yang Wang, Lei Li","How can large language models (LLMs) process and translate endangered languages? Many languages lack a large corpus to train a decent LLM; therefore existing LLMs rarely perform well in unseen, endangered languages. On the contrary, we observe that 2000 endangered languages, though without a large corpus, have a grammar book or a dictionary. We propose LINGOLLM, a training-free approach to enable an LLM to process unseen languages that hardly occur in its pre-training. Our key insight is to demonstrate linguistic knowledge of an unseen language in an LLM's prompt, including a dictionary, a grammar book, and morphologically analyzed input text. We implement LINGOLLM on top of two models, GPT-4 and Mixtral, and evaluate their performance on 5 tasks across 8 endangered or low-resource languages. Our results show that LINGOLLM elevates translation capability from GPT-4's 0 to 10.5 BLEU for 10 language directions. Our findings demonstrate the tremendous value of linguistic knowledge in the age of LLMs for endangered languages.

TroubleLLM: Align to Red Team Expert,"Zhuoer Xu, Jianping Zhang, Shiwen Cui, Changhua Meng, Weiqiang Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) become the start-of-the-art solutions for a variety of natural language tasks and are integrated into real-world applications. However, LLMs can be potentially harmful in manifesting undesirable safety issues like social biases and toxic content. It is imperative to assess its safety issues before deployment. However, the quality and diversity of test prompts generated by existing methods are still far from satisfactory. Not only are these methods labor-intensive and require large budget costs, but the controllability of test prompt generation is lacking for the specific testing domain of LLM applications. With the idea of LLM for LLM testing, we propose the first LLM, called TroubleLLM, to generate controllable test prompts on LLM safety issues.

Do Large Language Models Mirror Cognitive Language Processing?,"Yuqi Ren, Renren Jin, Tongxuan Zhang, Deyi Xiong","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in text comprehension and logical reasoning, indicating that the text representations learned by LLMs can facilitate their language processing capabilities. In cognitive science, brain cognitive processing signals are typically utilized to study human language processing. Therefore, it is natural to ask how well the text embeddings from LLMs align with the brain cognitive processing signals, and how training strategies affect the LLM-brain alignment? In this paper, we employ Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to measure the alignment between 23 mainstream LLMs and fMRI signals of the brain to evaluate how effectively LLMs simulate cognitive language processing. We empirically investigate the impact of various factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training, and prompts) on such LLM-brain alignment. Experimental results indicate that pre-training data size and model scaling are positively correlated with LLM-brain similarity, and alignment training can significantly improve LLM-brain similarity. Explicit prompts contribute to the consistency of LLMs with brain cognitive language processing, while nonsensical noisy prompts may attenuate such alignment. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of LLM evaluations (e.g., MMLU, Chatbot Arena) is highly correlated with the LLM-brain similarity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18023v2,2024-02
Merino: Entropy-driven Design for Generative Language Models on IoT Devices,"Youpeng Zhao, Ming Lin, Huadong Tang, Qiang Wu, Jun Wang","Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) stand as a revolutionary advancement in the modern era of artificial intelligence (AI). However, scaling down LLMs for resource-constrained hardware, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices requires non-trivial efforts and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel information-entropy framework for designing mobile-friendly generative language models. The whole design procedure involves solving a mathematical programming (MP) problem, which can be done on the CPU within minutes, making it nearly zero-cost. We evaluate our designed models, termed MeRino, across fourteen NLP downstream tasks, showing their competitive performance against the state-of-the-art autoregressive transformer models under the mobile setting. Notably, MeRino achieves similar or better performance on both language modeling and zero-shot learning tasks, compared to the 350M parameter OPT while being 4.9x faster on NVIDIA Jetson Nano with 5.5x reduction in model size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07921v2,2024-02

This paper aims to (a) give a summary of existing LLMs and approaches for adapting LLMs to downstream tasks; (b) elaborate recent advances in multi-turn dialogue systems, covering both LLM-based open-domain dialogue (ODD) and task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, along with datasets and evaluation metrics; (c) discuss some future emphasis and recent research problems arising from the development of LLMs and the increasing demands on multi-turn dialogue systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18013v1,2024-02
A Sentiment Consolidation Framework for Meta-Review Generation,"Miao Li, Jey Han Lau, Eduard Hovy","Modern natural language generation systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit the capability to generate a plausible summary of multiple documents; however, it is uncertain if they truly possess the capability of information consolidation to generate summaries, especially on documents with opinionated information. We focus on meta-review generation, a form of sentiment summarisation for the scientific domain. To make scientific sentiment summarization more grounded, we hypothesize that human meta-reviewers follow a three-layer framework of sentiment consolidation to write meta-reviews. Based on the framework, we propose novel prompting methods for LLMs to generate meta-reviews and evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated meta-reviews. Our framework is validated empirically as we find that prompting LLMs based on the framework -- compared with prompting them with simple instructions -- generates better meta-reviews.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18005v2,2024-02
FlattenQuant: Breaking Through the Inference Compute-bound for Large Language Models with Per-tensor Quantization,"Yi Zhang, Fei Yang, Shuang Peng, Fangyu Wang, Aimin Pan","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. However, the latency of inference and the large GPU memory consumption of LLMs restrict their deployment performance. Recently, there have been some efficient attempts to quantize LLMs, yet inference with large batch size or long sequence still has the issue of being compute-bound. Fine-grained quantization methods have showcased their proficiency in achieving low-bit quantization for LLMs, while requiring FP16 data type for linear layer computations, which is time-consuming when dealing with large batch size or long sequence. In this paper, we introduce a method called FlattenQuant, which significantly reduces the maximum value of the tensor by flattening the large channels in the tensor, to achieve low bit per-tensor quantization with minimal accuracy loss. Our experiments show that FlattenQuant can directly use 4 bits to achieve 48.29% of the linear layer calculation in LLMs, with the remaining layers using 8 bits. The 4-bit matrix multiplication introduced in the FlattenQuant method can effectively address the compute-bound caused by large matrix calculation. Our work achieves up to 2$\times$ speedup and 2.3$\times$ memory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17985v1,2024-02

The model is designed to leverage insights from both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels by facilitating a nuanced correlation between token and entity representations, addressing the complexities inherent in form documents. Additionally, we introduce new inter-grained and cross-grained loss functions to further refine diverse multi-teacher knowledge distillation transfer process, presenting distribution gaps and a harmonised understanding of form documents. Through a comprehensive evaluation across publicly available form document understanding datasets, our proposed model consistently outperforms existing baselines, showcasing its efficacy in handling the intricate structures and content of visually complex form documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17983v3,2024-02
Collaborative decoding of critical tokens for boosting factuality of large language models,"Lifeng Jin, Baolin Peng, Linfeng Song, Haitao Mi, Ye Tian, Dong Yu","The most common training pipeline for large language models includes pretraining, finetuning and aligning phases, with their respective resulting models, such as the pretrained model and the finetuned model. Finetuned and aligned models show improved abilities of instruction following and safe generation, however their abilities to stay factual about the world are impacted by the finetuning process. Furthermore, the common practice of using sampling during generation also increases chances of hallucination. In this work, we introduce a collaborative decoding framework to harness the high factuality within pretrained models through the concept of critical tokens. We first design a critical token classifier to decide which model to use for the next token, and subsequently generates the next token using different decoding strategies. Experiments with different models and datasets show that our decoding framework is able to reduce model hallucination significantly, showcasing the importance of the collaborative decoding framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17982v1,2024-02
All in an Aggregated Image for In-Image Learning,"Lei Wang, Wanyu Xu, Zhiqiang Hu, Yihuai Lan, Shan Dong, Hao Wang, Roy Ka-Wei Lee, Ee-Peng Lim","This paper introduces a new in-context learning (ICL) mechanism called In-Image Learning (I$^2$L) that combines demonstration examples, visual cues, and chain-of-thought reasoning into an aggregated image to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (e.g., GPT-4V) in multimodal reasoning tasks. Unlike previous approaches that rely on converting images to text or incorporating visual input into language models, I$^2$L consolidates all information into an aggregated image and leverages image processing, understanding, and reasoning abilities. This has several advantages: it reduces inaccurate textual descriptions of complex images, provides flexibility in positioning demonstration examples, and avoids multiple input images and lengthy prompts. We also introduce I$^2$L-Hybrid, a method that combines the strengths of I$^2$L with other ICL methods. Specifically, it uses an automatic strategy to select the most suitable method (I$^2$L or another certain ICL method) for a specific task instance. We conduct extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of I$^2$L and I$^2$L-Hybrid on MathVista, which covers a variety of complex multimodal reasoning tasks. Additionally, we investigate the influence of image resolution, the number of demonstration examples in a single image, and the positions of these demonstrations in the aggregated image on the effectiveness of I$^2$L.

ProtLLM: An Interleaved Protein-Language LLM with Protein-as-Word Pre-Training,"Le Zhuo, Zewen Chi, Minghao Xu, Heyan Huang, Heqi Zheng, Conghui He, Xian-Ling Mao, Wentao Zhang","We propose ProtLLM, a versatile cross-modal large language model (LLM) for both protein-centric and protein-language tasks. ProtLLM features a unique dynamic protein mounting mechanism, enabling it to handle complex inputs where the natural language text is interspersed with an arbitrary number of proteins. Besides, we propose the protein-as-word language modeling approach to train ProtLLM. By developing a specialized protein vocabulary, we equip the model with the capability to predict not just natural language but also proteins from a vast pool of candidates. Additionally, we construct a large-scale interleaved protein-text dataset, named InterPT, for pre-training. This dataset comprehensively encompasses both (1) structured data sources like protein annotations and (2) unstructured data sources like biological research papers, thereby endowing ProtLLM with crucial knowledge for understanding proteins. We evaluate ProtLLM on classic supervised protein-centric tasks and explore its novel protein-language applications. Experimental results demonstrate that ProtLLM not only achieves superior performance against protein-specialized baselines on protein-centric tasks but also induces zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities on protein-language tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07920v1,2024-02
An Iterative Associative Memory Model for Empathetic Response Generation,"Zhou Yang, Zhaochun Ren, Yufeng Wang, Chao Chen, Haizhou Sun, Xiaofei Zhu, Xiangwen Liao","Empathetic response generation aims to comprehend the cognitive and emotional states in dialogue utterances and generate proper responses. Psychological theories posit that comprehending emotional and cognitive states necessitates iteratively capturing and understanding associated words across dialogue utterances. However, existing approaches regard dialogue utterances as either a long sequence or independent utterances for comprehension, which are prone to overlook the associated words between them. To address this issue, we propose an Iterative Associative Memory Model (IAMM) for empathetic response generation. Specifically, we employ a novel second-order interaction attention mechanism to iteratively capture vital associated words between dialogue utterances and situations, dialogue history, and a memory module (for storing associated words), thereby accurately and nuancedly comprehending the utterances. We conduct experiments on the Empathetic-Dialogue dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations validate the efficacy of the model. Variant experiments on LLMs also demonstrate that attending to associated words improves empathetic comprehension and expression.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17959v2,2024-02
"Twists, Humps, and Pebbles: Multilingual Speech Recognition Models Exhibit Gender Performance Gaps","Giuseppe Attanasio, Beatrice Savoldi, Dennis Fucci, Dirk Hovy","Current automatic speech recognition (ASR) models are designed to be used across many languages and tasks without substantial changes. However, this broad language coverage hides performance gaps within languages, for example, across genders. Our study systematically evaluates the performance of two widely used multilingual ASR models on three datasets, encompassing 19 languages from eight language families and two speaking conditions. Our findings reveal clear gender disparities, with the advantaged group varying across languages and models. Surprisingly, those gaps are not explained by acoustic or lexical properties. However, probing internal model states reveals a correlation with gendered performance gap. That is, the easier it is to distinguish speaker gender in a language using probes, the more the gap reduces, favoring female speakers. Our results show that gender disparities persist even in state-of-the-art models. Our findings have implications for the improvement of multilingual ASR systems, underscoring the importance of accessibility to training data and nuanced evaluation to predict and mitigate gender gaps. We release all code and artifacts at https://github.com/g8a9/multilingual-asr-gender-gap.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17954v3,2024-02
Social Intelligence Data Infrastructure: Structuring the Present and Navigating the Future,"Minzhi Li, Weiyan Shi, Caleb Ziems, Diyi Yang","As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems become increasingly integrated into human social life, these technologies will need to increasingly rely on social intelligence. Although there are many valuable datasets that benchmark isolated dimensions of social intelligence, there does not yet exist any body of work to join these threads into a cohesive subfield in which researchers can quickly identify research gaps and future directions. Towards this goal, we build a Social AI Data Infrastructure, which consists of a comprehensive social AI taxonomy and a data library of 480 NLP datasets. Our infrastructure allows us to analyze existing dataset efforts, and also evaluate language models' performance in different social intelligence aspects. Our analyses demonstrate its utility in enabling a thorough understanding of current data landscape and providing a holistic perspective on potential directions for future dataset development. We show there is a need for multifaceted datasets, increased diversity in language and culture, more long-tailed social situations, and more interactive data in future social intelligence data efforts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14659v1,2024-02
SparseLLM: Towards Global Pruning for Pre-trained Language Models,"Guangji Bai, Yijiang Li, Chen Ling, Kibaek Kim, Liang Zhao","The transformative impact of large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and GPT on natural language processing is countered by their prohibitive computational demands. Pruning has emerged as a pivotal compression strategy, introducing sparsity to enhance both memory and computational efficiency. Yet, traditional global pruning is impractical for LLMs due to scalability issues, while local pruning, despite its efficiency, leads to suboptimal solutions. Addressing these challenges, we propose SparseLLM, a novel framework that redefines the global pruning process into manageable, coordinated subproblems, allowing for resource-efficient optimization with global optimality. SparseLLM's approach, which conceptualizes LLMs as a chain of modular functions and leverages auxiliary variables for problem decomposition, not only facilitates a pragmatic application on LLMs but also demonstrates significant performance improvements, particularly in high-sparsity regimes where it surpasses current state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17946v4,2024-02

To address the IP theft risks posed by malicious end-users, EmMark enables proprietors to authenticate ownership by querying the watermarked model weights and matching the inserted signatures. EmMark's novelty lies in its strategic watermark weight parameters selection, nsuring robustness and maintaining model quality.

Acquiring Linguistic Knowledge from Multimodal Input,"Theodor Amariucai, Alex Warstadt","In contrast to children, language models (LMs) exhibit considerably inferior data efficiency when acquiring language. In this submission to the BabyLM Challenge (Warstadt et al., 2023), we test the hypothesis that this data efficiency gap is partly caused by a lack of multimodal input and grounding in the learning environment of typical language models. Although previous work looking into this question found that multimodal training can even harm language-only performance, we speculate that these findings can be attributed to catastrophic forgetting of complex language due to fine-tuning on captions data. To test our hypothesis, we perform an ablation study on FLAVA (Singh et al., 2022), a multimodal vision-and-language model, independently varying the volume of text and vision input to quantify how much text data (if any) can be offset by vision at different data scales. We aim to limit catastrophic forgetting through a multitask pretraining regime that includes unimodal text-only tasks and data sampled from WiT, the relatively diverse Wikipedia-based dataset (Srinivasan et al., 2021). Our results are largely negative: Multimodal pretraining does not harm our models' language performance but does not consistently help either. That said, our conclusions are limited by our having been able to conduct only a small number of runs. While we must leave open the possibility that multimodal input explains some of the gap in data efficiency between LMs and humans, positive evidence for this hypothesis will require better architectures and techniques for multimodal training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17936v1,2024-02
Inducing Generalization across Languages and Tasks using Featurized Low-Rank Mixtures,"Chu-Cheng Lin, Xinyi Wang, Jonathan H. Clark, Han Lu, Yun Zhu, Chenxi Whitehouse, Hongkun Yu","Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to various downstream tasks in tens or hundreds of human languages is computationally expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces the adaptation cost, by tuning only a small amount of parameters. However, common PEFT methods LoRA (Hu et al., 2022) suffer from suboptimal performance on diverse dataset mixtures, due to aggressive parameter tying and negative interference among different datasets. In this work, we propose Featurized Low-rank Mixtures (FLix), a novel PEFT method designed for effective multitask multilingual adaptation. FLix associates each unique dataset feature, such as the dataset's language or task, with its own low-rank weight update parameters. By composing feature-specific parameters for each dataset, FLix can accommodate diverse dataset mixtures and generalize better to unseen datasets. Our experiments show that FLix leads to significant improvements over a variety of tasks for both supervised learning and zero-shot settings with gains of up to $14.2$ inexact match points in zero-shot semantic parsing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17934v2,2024-02
Pragmatic Instruction Following and Goal Assistance via Cooperative Language-Guided Inverse Planning,"Tan Zhi-Xuan, Lance Ying, Vikash Mansinghka, Joshua B. Tenenbaum","People often give instructions whose meaning is ambiguous without further context, expecting that their actions or goals will disambiguate their intentions. How can we build assistive agents that follow such instructions in a flexible, context-sensitive manner? This paper introduces cooperative language-guided inverse plan search (CLIPS), a Bayesian agent architecture for pragmatic instruction following and goal assistance. Our agent assists a human by modeling them as a cooperative planner who communicates joint plans to the assistant, then performs multimodal Bayesian inference over the human's goal from actions and language, using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the likelihood of an instruction given a hypothesized plan. Given this posterior, our assistant acts to minimize expected goal achievement cost, enabling it to pragmatically follow ambiguous instructions and provide effective assistance even when uncertain about the goal. We evaluate these capabilities in two cooperative planning domains (Doors, Keys & Gems and VirtualHome), finding that CLIPS significantly outperforms GPT-4V, LLM-based literal instruction following and unimodal inverse planning in both accuracy and helpfulness, while closely matching the inferences and assistive judgments provided by human raters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17930v1,2024-02
Adversarial Math Word Problem Generation,"Roy Xie, Chengxuan Huang, Junlin Wang, Bhuwan Dhingra","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed the educational landscape. As current plagiarism detection tools struggle to keep pace with LLMs' rapid advancements, the educational community faces the challenge of assessing students' true problem-solving abilities in the presence of LLMs. In this work, we explore a new paradigm for ensuring fair evaluation -- generating adversarial examples which preserve the structure and difficulty of the original questions aimed for assessment, but are unsolvable by LLMs. Focusing on the domain of math word problems, we leverage abstract syntax trees to structurally generate adversarial examples that cause LLMs to produce incorrect answers by simply editing the numeric values in the problems. We conduct experiments on various open- and closed-source LLMs, quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrating that our method significantly degrades their math problem-solving ability. We identify shared vulnerabilities among LLMs and propose a cost-effective approach to attack high-cost models. Additionally, we conduct automatic analysis to investigate the cause of failure, providing further insights into the limitations of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17916v3,2024-02

This is largely due to the complexity and nuance involved in studying various dialects. We present a novel approach to extract distinguishing lexical features of dialects by utilizing interpretable dialect classifiers, even in the absence of human experts. We explore both post-hoc and intrinsic approaches to interpretability, conduct experiments on Mandarin, Italian, and Low Saxon, and experimentally demonstrate that our method successfully identifies key language-specific lexical features that contribute to dialectal variations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17914v2,2024-02
A Language Model based Framework for New Concept Placement in Ontologies,"Hang Dong, Jiaoyan Chen, Yuan He, Yongsheng Gao, Ian Horrocks","We investigate the task of inserting new concepts extracted from texts into an ontology using language models. We explore an approach with three steps: edge search which is to find a set of candidate locations to insert (i.e., subsumptions between concepts), edge formation and enrichment which leverages the ontological structure to produce and enhance the edge candidates, and edge selection which eventually locates the edge to be placed into. In all steps, we propose to leverage neural methods, where we apply embedding-based methods and contrastive learning with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) such as BERT for edge search, and adapt a BERT fine-tuning-based multi-label Edge-Cross-encoder, and Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT series, FLAN-T5, and Llama 2, for edge selection. We evaluate the methods on recent datasets created using the SNOMED CT ontology and the MedMentions entity linking benchmark. The best settings in our framework use fine-tuned PLM for search and a multi-label Cross-encoder for selection. Zero-shot prompting of LLMs is still not adequate for the task, and we propose explainable instruction tuning of LLMs for improved performance. Our study shows the advantages of PLMs and highlights the encouraging performance of LLMs that motivates future studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17897v2,2024-02
"Researchy Questions: A Dataset of Multi-Perspective, Decompositional Questions for LLM Web Agents","Corby Rosset, Ho-Lam Chung, Guanghui Qin, Ethan C. Chau, Zhuo Feng, Ahmed Awadallah, Jennifer Neville, Nikhil Rao","Existing question answering (QA) datasets are no longer challenging to most powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional QA benchmarks like TriviaQA, NaturalQuestions, ELI5 and HotpotQA mainly study ``known unknowns'' with clear indications of both what information is missing, and how to find it to answer the question. Hence, good performance on these benchmarks provides a false sense of security. A yet unmet need of the NLP community is a bank of non-factoid, multi-perspective questions involving a great deal of unclear information needs, i.e. ``unknown uknowns''. We claim we can find such questions in search engine logs, which is surprising because most question-intent queries are indeed factoid. We present Researchy Questions, a dataset of search engine queries tediously filtered to be non-factoid, ``decompositional'' and multi-perspective. We show that users spend a lot of ``effort'' on these questions in terms of signals like clicks and session length, and that they are also challenging for GPT-4. We also show that ``slow thinking'' answering techniques, like decomposition into sub-questions shows benefit over answering directly.

JMLR: Joint Medical LLM and Retrieval Training for Enhancing Reasoning and Professional Question Answering Capability,"Junda Wang, Zhichao Yang, Zonghai Yao, Hong Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable potential in medical knowledge acquisition and question-answering. However, LLMs can potentially hallucinate and yield factually incorrect outcomes, even with domain-specific pretraining. Previously, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has limited success in addressing hallucinations. Unlike previous methods in RAG where the retrieval model was trained separately from the LLM, we introduce JMLR (for Jointly trains LLM and information Retrieval) during the fine-tuning phase. The synchronized training mechanism enhances JMLR's ability to retrieve clinical guidelines and leverage medical knowledge to reason and answer questions and reduces the demand for computational resources. We evaluated JMLR on the important medical question-answering application. Our experimental results demonstrate that JMLR-13B (70.5%) outperforms a previous state-of-the-art open-source model using conventional pre-training and fine-tuning Meditron-70B (68.9%) and Llama2-13B with RAG (67.7%) on a medical question-answering dataset. Comprehensive evaluations reveal JMLR-13B enhances reasoning quality and reduces hallucinations better than Claude3-Opus. Additionally, JMLR-13B (148 GPU hours) also trains much faster than Meditron-70B (42630 GPU hours). Through this work, we provide a new and efficient knowledge enhancement method for healthcare, demonstrating the potential of integrating retrieval and LLM training for medical question-answering systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17887v4,2024-02
BlendSQL: A Scalable Dialect for Unifying Hybrid Question Answering in Relational Algebra,"Parker Glenn, Parag Pravin Dakle, Liang Wang, Preethi Raghavan","Many existing end-to-end systems for hybrid question answering tasks can often be boiled down to a ""prompt-and-pray"" paradigm, where the user has limited control and insight into the intermediate reasoning steps used to achieve the final result. Additionally, due to the context size limitation of many transformer-based LLMs, it is often not reasonable to expect that the full structured and unstructured context will fit into a given prompt in a zero-shot setting, let alone a few-shot setting. We introduce BlendSQL, a superset of SQLite to act as a unified dialect for orchestrating reasoning across both unstructured and structured data. For hybrid question answering tasks involving multi-hop reasoning, we encode the full decomposed reasoning roadmap into a single interpretable BlendSQL query. Notably, we show that BlendSQL can scale to massive datasets and improve the performance of end-to-end systems while using 35% fewer tokens.

Automated Statistical Model Discovery with Language Models,"Michael Y. Li, Emily B. Fox, Noah D. Goodman","Statistical model discovery is a challenging search over a vast space of models subject to domain-specific constraints. Efficiently searching over this space requires expertise in modeling and the problem domain. Motivated by the domain knowledge and programming capabilities of large language models (LMs), we introduce a method for language model driven automated statistical model discovery. We cast our automated procedure within the principled framework of Box's Loop: the LM iterates between proposing statistical models represented as probabilistic programs, acting as a modeler, and critiquing those models, acting as a domain expert. By leveraging LMs, we do not have to define a domain-specific language of models or design a handcrafted search procedure, which are key restrictions of previous systems. We evaluate our method in three settings in probabilistic modeling: searching within a restricted space of models, searching over an open-ended space, and improving expert models under natural language constraints (e.g., this model should be interpretable to an ecologist). Our method identifies models on par with human expert designed models and extends classic models in interpretable ways. Our results highlight the promise of LM-driven model discovery.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17879v2,2024-02
Deep Learning Detection Method for Large Language Models-Generated Scientific Content,"Bushra Alhijawi, Rawan Jarrar, Aseel AbuAlRub, Arwa Bader","Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and BERT, reshape how textual content is written and communicated. These models have the potential to generate scientific content that is indistinguishable from that written by humans. Hence, LLMs carry severe consequences for the scientific community, which relies on the integrity and reliability of publications. This research paper presents a novel ChatGPT-generated scientific text detection method, AI-Catcher. AI-Catcher integrates two deep learning models, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The MLP learns the feature representations of the linguistic and statistical features. The CNN extracts high-level representations of the sequential patterns from the textual content. AI-Catcher is a multimodal model that fuses hidden patterns derived from MLP and CNN. In addition, a new ChatGPT-Generated scientific text dataset is collected to enhance AI-generated text detection tools, AIGTxt. AIGTxt contains 3000 records collected from published academic articles across ten domains and divided into three classes: Human-written, ChatGPT-generated, and Mixed text. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of AI-Catcher. The comparative results demonstrate the capability of AI-Catcher to distinguish between human-written and ChatGPT-generated scientific text more accurately than alternative methods.

Self-Refinement of Language Models from External Proxy Metrics Feedback,"Keshav Ramji, Young-Suk Lee, Ramón Fernandez Astudillo, Md Arafat Sultan, Tahira Naseem, Asim Munawar, Radu Florian, Salim Roukos","It is often desirable for Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture multiple objectives when providing a response. In document-grounded response generation, for example, agent responses are expected to be relevant to a user's query while also being grounded in a given document. In this paper, we introduce Proxy Metric-based Self-Refinement (ProMiSe), which enables an LLM to refine its own initial response along key dimensions of quality guided by external metrics feedback, yielding an overall better final response. ProMiSe leverages feedback on response quality through principle-specific proxy metrics, and iteratively refines its response one principle at a time. We apply ProMiSe to open source language models Flan-T5-XXL and Llama-2-13B-Chat, to evaluate its performance on document-grounded question answering datasets, MultiDoc2Dial and QuAC, demonstrating that self-refinement improves response quality. We further show that fine-tuning Llama-2-13B-Chat on the synthetic dialogue data generated by ProMiSe yields significant performance improvements over the zero-shot baseline as well as a supervised fine-tuned model on human annotated data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00827v1,2024-02
Follow My Instruction and Spill the Beans: Scalable Data Extraction from Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems,"Zhenting Qi, Hanlin Zhang, Eric Xing, Sham Kakade, Himabindu Lakkaraju","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves pre-trained models by incorporating external knowledge at test time to enable customized adaptation. We study the risk of datastore leakage in Retrieval-In-Context RAG Language Models (LMs). We show that an adversary can exploit LMs' instruction-following capabilities to easily extract text data verbatim from the datastore of RAG systems built with instruction-tuned LMs via prompt injection. The vulnerability exists for a wide range of modern LMs that span Llama2, Mistral/Mixtral, Vicuna, SOLAR, WizardLM, Qwen1.5, and Platypus2, and the exploitability exacerbates as the model size scales up. We also study multiple effects of RAG setup on the extractability of data, indicating that following unexpected instructions to regurgitate data can be an outcome of failure in effectively utilizing contexts for modern LMs, and further show that such vulnerability can be greatly mitigated by position bias elimination strategies. Extending our study to production RAG models GPTs, we design an attack that can cause datastore leakage with a 100% success rate on 25 randomly selected customized GPTs with at most 2 queries, and we extract text data verbatim at a rate of 41% from a book of 77,000 words and 3% from a corpus of 1,569,000 words by prompting the GPTs with only 100 queries generated by themselves.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17840v3,2024-02

The weights for both models are available via Hugging Face for anyone to download and use. The report contains thorough evaluations of these models, including zero- and few-shot benchmarks, multilingual benchmarks, and the MT benchmark focusing on multi-turn dialogues. At the time of publishing this report, StableLM 2 1.6B was the state-of-the-art open model under 2B parameters by a significant margin. Given its appealing small size, we also provide throughput measurements on a number of edge devices. In addition, we open source several quantized checkpoints and provide their performance metrics compared to the original model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17834v1,2024-02
Prediction-Powered Ranking of Large Language Models,"Ivi Chatzi, Eleni Straitouri, Suhas Thejaswi, Manuel Gomez Rodriguez","Large language models are often ranked according to their level of alignment with human preferences -- a model is better than other models if its outputs are more frequently preferred by humans. One of the popular ways to elicit human preferences utilizes pairwise comparisons between the outputs provided by different models to the same inputs. However, since gathering pairwise comparisons by humans is costly and time-consuming, it has become a common practice to gather pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model -- a model strongly aligned with human preferences. Surprisingly, practitioners cannot currently measure the uncertainty that any mismatch between human and model preferences may introduce in the constructed rankings. In this work, we develop a statistical framework to bridge this gap. Given a (small) set of pairwise comparisons by humans and a large set of pairwise comparisons by a model, our framework provides a rank-set -- a set of possible ranking positions -- for each of the models under comparison. Moreover, it guarantees that, with a probability greater than or equal to a user-specified value, the rank-sets cover the true ranking consistent with the distribution of human pairwise preferences asymptotically. Using pairwise comparisons made by humans in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform and pairwise comparisons made by three strong large language models, we empirically demonstrate the effectivity of our framework and show that the rank-sets constructed using only pairwise comparisons by the strong large language models are often inconsistent with (the distribution of) human pairwise preferences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17826v3,2024-02
The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits,"Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang, Lingxiao Ma, Lei Wang, Wenhui Wang, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Ruiping Wang, Jilong Xue, Furu Wei","Recent research, such as BitNet, is paving the way for a new era of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17764v1,2024-02
Massive Activations in Large Language Models,"Mingjie Sun, Xinlei Chen, J. Zico Kolter, Zhuang Liu","We observe an empirical phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- very few activations exhibit significantly larger values than others (e.g., 100,000 times larger). We call them massive activations. First, we demonstrate the widespread existence of massive activations across various LLMs and characterize their locations. Second, we find their values largely stay constant regardless of the input, and they function as indispensable bias terms in LLMs. Third, these massive activations lead to the concentration of attention probabilities to their corresponding tokens, and further, implicit bias terms in the self-attention output. Last, we also study massive activations in Vision Transformers. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/massive-activations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17762v2,2024-02
Towards Optimal Learning of Language Models,"Yuxian Gu, Li Dong, Yaru Hao, Qingxiu Dong, Minlie Huang, Furu Wei","This work studies the general principles of improving the learning of language models (LMs), which aims at reducing the necessary training steps for achieving superior performance. Specifically, we present a theory for the optimal learning of LMs. We first propose an objective that optimizes LM learning by maximizing the data compression ratio in an ""LM-training-as-lossless-compression"" view. Then, we derive a theorem, named Learning Law, to reveal the properties of the dynamics in the optimal learning process under our objective. The theorem is then validated by experiments on a linear classification and a real-world language modeling task. Finally, we empirically verify that the optimal learning of LMs essentially stems from the improvement of the coefficients in the scaling law of LMs, indicating great promise and significance for designing practical learning acceleration methods. Our code can be found at https://aka.ms/LearningLaw.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17759v2,2024-02
Evaluating Very Long-Term Conversational Memory of LLM Agents,"Adyasha Maharana, Dong-Ho Lee, Sergey Tulyakov, Mohit Bansal, Francesco Barbieri, Yuwei Fang","Existing works on long-term open-domain dialogues focus on evaluating model responses within contexts spanning no more than five chat sessions. Despite advancements in long-context large language models (LLMs) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques, their efficacy in very long-term dialogues remains unexplored. To address this research gap, we introduce a machine-human pipeline to generate high-quality, very long-term dialogues by leveraging LLM-based agent architectures and grounding their dialogues on personas and temporal event graphs. Moreover, we equip each agent with the capability of sharing and reacting to images. The generated conversations are verified and edited by human annotators for long-range consistency and grounding to the event graphs. Using this pipeline, we collect LoCoMo, a dataset of very long-term conversations, each encompassing 300 turns and 9K tokens on avg., over up to 35 sessions. Based on LoCoMo, we present a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to measure long-term memory in models, encompassing question answering, event summarization, and multi-modal dialogue generation tasks. Our experimental results indicate that LLMs exhibit challenges in understanding lengthy conversations and comprehending long-range temporal and causal dynamics within dialogues. Employing strategies like long-context LLMs or RAG can offer improvements but these models still substantially lag behind human performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17753v1,2024-02
Tower: An Open Multilingual Large Language Model for Translation-Related Tasks,"Duarte M. Alves, José Pombal, Nuno M. Guerreiro, Pedro H. Martins, João Alves, Amin Farajian, Ben Peters, Ricardo Rei, Patrick Fernandes, Sweta Agrawal, Pierre Colombo, José G. C. de Souza, André F. T. Martins","While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency on multiple tasks within the domain of translation, approaches based on open LLMs are competitive only when specializing on a single task. In this paper, we propose a recipe for tailoring LLMs to multiple tasks present in translation workflows. We perform continued pretraining on a multilingual mixture of monolingual and parallel data, creating TowerBase, followed by finetuning on instructions relevant for translation processes, creating TowerInstruct. Our final model surpasses open alternatives on several tasks relevant to translation workflows and is competitive with general-purpose closed LLMs. To facilitate future research, we release the Tower models, our specialization dataset, an evaluation framework for LLMs focusing on the translation ecosystem, and a collection of model generations, including ours, on our benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17733v1,2024-02
AmbigNLG: Addressing Task Ambiguity in Instruction for NLG,"Ayana Niwa, Hayate Iso","We introduce AmbigNLG, a novel task designed to tackle the challenge of task ambiguity in instructions for Natural Language Generation (NLG). Ambiguous instructions often impede the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in complex NLG tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose an ambiguity taxonomy that categorizes different types of instruction ambiguities and refines initial instructions with clearer specifications. Accompanying this task, we present AmbigSNI-NLG, a dataset comprising 2,500 instances annotated to facilitate research in AmbigNLG. Through comprehensive experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the alignment of generated text with user expectations, achieving up to a 15.02-point increase in ROUGE scores. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing task ambiguity to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs in NLG tasks. Furthermore, we confirm the effectiveness of our method in practical settings involving interactive ambiguity mitigation with users, underscoring the benefits of leveraging LLMs for interactive clarification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17717v4,2024-02
Case-Based or Rule-Based: How Do Transformers Do the Math?,"Yi Hu, Xiaojuan Tang, Haotong Yang, Muhan Zhang","Despite the impressive performance in a variety of complex tasks, modern large language models (LLMs) still have trouble dealing with some math problems that are simple and intuitive for humans, such as addition. While we can easily learn basic rules of addition and apply them to new problems of any length, LLMs struggle to do the same. Instead, they may rely on similar cases seen in the training corpus for help. We define these two different reasoning mechanisms as ""rule-based reasoning"" and ""case-based reasoning"". Since rule-based reasoning is essential for acquiring systematic generalization ability, we aim to explore exactly whether transformers use rule-based or case-based reasoning for math problems. Through carefully designed intervention experiments on five math tasks, we confirm that transformers are performing case-based reasoning, no matter whether scratchpad is used, which aligns with the previous observations that transformers use subgraph matching/shortcut learning to reason. To mitigate such problems, we propose a Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (RFFT) technique to teach transformers to perform rule-based reasoning. Specifically, we provide explicit rules in the input and then instruct transformers to recite and follow the rules step by step. Through RFFT, we successfully enable LLMs fine-tuned on 1-5 digit addition to generalize to up to 12-digit addition with over 95% accuracy, which is over 40% higher than scratchpad. The significant improvement demonstrates that teaching LLMs to use rules explicitly helps them learn rule-based reasoning and generalize better in length.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17709v2,2024-02
RAVEL: Evaluating Interpretability Methods on Disentangling Language Model Representations,"Jing Huang, Zhengxuan Wu, Christopher Potts, Mor Geva, Atticus Geiger","Individual neurons participate in the representation of multiple high-level concepts. To what extent can different interpretability methods successfully disentangle these roles? To help address this question, we introduce RAVEL (Resolving Attribute-Value Entanglements in Language Models), a dataset that enables tightly controlled, quantitative comparisons between a variety of existing interpretability methods. We use the resulting conceptual framework to define the new method of Multi-task Distributed Alignment Search (MDAS), which allows us to find distributed representations satisfying multiple causal criteria. With Llama2-7B as the target language model, MDAS achieves state-of-the-art results on RAVEL, demonstrating the importance of going beyond neuron-level analyses to identify features distributed across activations. We release our benchmark at https://github.com/explanare/ravel.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17700v2,2024-02
NextLevelBERT: Masked Language Modeling with Higher-Level Representations for Long Documents,"Tamara Czinczoll, Christoph Hönes, Maximilian Schall, Gerard de Melo","While (large) language models have significantly improved over the last years, they still struggle to sensibly process long sequences found, e.g., in books, due to the quadratic scaling of the underlying attention mechanism. To address this, we propose NextLevelBERT, a Masked Language Model operating not on tokens, but on higher-level semantic representations in the form of text embeddings. We pretrain NextLevelBERT to predict the vector representation of entire masked text chunks and evaluate the effectiveness of the resulting document vectors on three types of tasks: 1) Semantic Textual Similarity via zero-shot document embeddings, 2) Long document classification, 3) Multiple-choice question answering. We find that next-level Masked Language Modeling is an effective technique to tackle long-document use cases and can outperfor much larger embedding models as long as the required level of detail of semantic information is not too fine. Our models and code are publicly available online.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17682v2,2024-02
Beyond prompt brittleness: Evaluating the reliability and consistency of political worldviews in LLMs,"Tanise Ceron, Neele Falk, Ana Barić, Dmitry Nikolaev, Sebastian Padó","Due to the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), we need to understand whether they embed a specific ""worldview"" and what these views reflect. Recent studies report that, prompted with political questionnaires, LLMs show left-liberal leanings (Feng et al., 2023; Motoki et al., 2024). However, it is as yet unclear whether these leanings are reliable (robust to prompt variations) and whether the leaning is consistent across policies and political leaning. We propose a series of tests which assess the reliability and consistency of LLMs' stances on political statements based on a dataset of voting-advice questionnaires collected from seven EU countries and annotated for policy issues. We study LLMs ranging in size from 7B to 70B parameters and find that their reliability increases with parameter count. Larger models show overall stronger alignment with left-leaning parties but differ among policy programs: They show a (left-wing) positive stance towards environment protection, social welfare state and liberal society but also (right-wing) law and order, with no consistent preferences in the areas of foreign policy and migration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17649v3,2024-02
SongComposer: A Large Language Model for Lyric and Melody Composition in Song Generation,"Shuangrui Ding, Zihan Liu, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Rui Qian, Conghui He, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang","We present SongComposer, an innovative LLM designed for song composition. It could understand and generate melodies and lyrics in symbolic song representations, by leveraging the capability of LLM. Existing music-related LLM treated the music as quantized audio signals, while such implicit encoding leads to inefficient encoding and poor flexibility. In contrast, we resort to symbolic song representation, the mature and efficient way humans designed for music, and enable LLM to explicitly compose songs like humans. In practice, we design a novel tuple design to format lyric and three note attributes (pitch, duration, and rest duration) in the melody, which guarantees the correct LLM understanding of musical symbols and realizes precise alignment between lyrics and melody. To impart basic music understanding to LLM, we carefully collected SongCompose-PT, a large-scale song pretraining dataset that includes lyrics, melodies, and paired lyrics-melodies in either Chinese or English. After adequate pre-training, 10K carefully crafted QA pairs are used to empower the LLM with the instruction-following capability and solve diverse tasks. With extensive experiments, SongComposer demonstrates superior performance in lyric-to-melody generation, melody-to-lyric generation, song continuation, and text-to-song creation, outperforming advanced LLMs like GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17645v1,2024-02
Are LLMs Capable of Data-based Statistical and Causal Reasoning? Benchmarking Advanced Quantitative Reasoning with Data,"Xiao Liu, Zirui Wu, Xueqing Wu, Pan Lu, Kai-Wei Chang, Yansong Feng","Quantitative reasoning is a critical skill to analyze data, yet the assessment of such ability remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce the Quantitative Reasoning with Data (QRData) benchmark, aiming to evaluate Large Language Models' capability in statistical and causal reasoning with real-world data. The benchmark comprises a carefully constructed dataset of 411 questions accompanied by data sheets from textbooks, online learning materials, and academic papers. To compare models' quantitative reasoning abilities on data and text, we enrich the benchmark with an auxiliary set of 290 text-only questions, namely QRText. We evaluate natural language reasoning, program-based reasoning, and agent reasoning methods including Chain-of-Thought, Program-of-Thoughts, ReAct, and code interpreter assistants on diverse models. The strongest model GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 58%, which has much room for improvement. Among open-source models, Deepseek-coder-instruct, a code LLM pretrained on 2T tokens, gets the highest accuracy of 37%. Analysis reveals that models encounter difficulties in data analysis and causal reasoning, and struggle in using causal knowledge and provided data simultaneously.

Variational Learning is Effective for Large Deep Networks,"Yuesong Shen, Nico Daheim, Bai Cong, Peter Nickl, Gian Maria Marconi, Clement Bazan, Rio Yokota, Iryna Gurevych, Daniel Cremers, Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan, Thomas Möllenhoff","We give extensive empirical evidence against the common belief that variational learning is ineffective for large neural networks. We show that an optimizer called Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) consistently matches or outperforms Adam for training large networks such as GPT-2 and ResNets from scratch. IVON's computational costs are nearly identical to Adam but its predictive uncertainty is better. We show several new use cases of IVON where we improve finetuning and model merging in Large Language Models, accurately predict generalization error, and faithfully estimate sensitivity to data. We find overwhelming evidence that variational learning is effective.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17641v2,2024-02
From Text Segmentation to Smart Chaptering: A Novel Benchmark for Structuring Video Transcriptions,"Fabian Retkowski, Alexander Waibel","Text segmentation is a fundamental task in natural language processing, where documents are split into contiguous sections. However, prior research in this area has been constrained by limited datasets, which are either small in scale, synthesized, or only contain well-structured documents. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel benchmark YTSeg focusing on spoken content that is inherently more unstructured and both topically and structurally diverse. As part of this work, we introduce an efficient hierarchical segmentation model MiniSeg, that outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Lastly, we expand the notion of text segmentation to a more practical ""smart chaptering"" task that involves the segmentation of unstructured content, the generation of meaningful segment titles, and a potential real-time application of the models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17633v1,2024-02
Fine-Grained Natural Language Inference Based Faithfulness Evaluation for Diverse Summarisation Tasks,"Huajian Zhang, Yumo Xu, Laura Perez-Beltrachini","We study existing approaches to leverage off-the-shelf Natural Language Inference (NLI) models for the evaluation of summary faithfulness and argue that these are sub-optimal due to the granularity level considered for premises and hypotheses. That is, the smaller content unit considered as hypothesis is a sentence and premises are made up of a fixed number of document sentences. We propose a novel approach, namely InFusE, that uses a variable premise size and simplifies summary sentences into shorter hypotheses. Departing from previous studies which focus on single short document summarisation, we analyse NLI based faithfulness evaluation for diverse summarisation tasks. We introduce DiverSumm, a new benchmark comprising long form summarisation (long documents and summaries) and diverse summarisation tasks (e.g., meeting and multi-document summarisation). In experiments, InFusE obtains superior performance across the different summarisation tasks.

Neural Automated Writing Evaluation with Corrective Feedback,"Izia Xiaoxiao Wang, Xihan Wu, Edith Coates, Min Zeng, Jiexin Kuang, Siliang Liu, Mengyang Qiu, Jungyeul Park","The utilization of technology in second language learning and teaching has become ubiquitous. For the assessment of writing specifically, automated writing evaluation (AWE) and grammatical error correction (GEC) have become immensely popular and effective methods for enhancing writing proficiency and delivering instant and individualized feedback to learners. By leveraging the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, AWE and GEC systems have been developed separately to provide language learners with automated corrective feedback and more accurate and unbiased scoring that would otherwise be subject to examiners. In this paper, we propose an integrated system for automated writing evaluation with corrective feedback as a means of bridging the gap between AWE and GEC results for second language learners. This system enables language learners to simulate the essay writing tests: a student writes and submits an essay, and the system returns the assessment of the writing along with suggested grammatical error corrections. Given that automated scoring and grammatical correction are more efficient and cost-effective than human grading, this integrated system would also alleviate the burden of manually correcting innumerable essays.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17613v2,2024-02
Linguistic Knowledge Can Enhance Encoder-Decoder Models (If You Let It),"Alessio Miaschi, Felice Dell'Orletta, Giulia Venturi","In this paper, we explore the impact of augmenting pre-trained Encoder-Decoder models, specifically T5, with linguistic knowledge for the prediction of a target task. In particular, we investigate whether fine-tuning a T5 model on an intermediate task that predicts structural linguistic properties of sentences modifies its performance in the target task of predicting sentence-level complexity. Our study encompasses diverse experiments conducted on Italian and English datasets, employing both monolingual and multilingual T5 models at various sizes. Results obtained for both languages and in cross-lingual configurations show that linguistically motivated intermediate fine-tuning has generally a positive impact on target task performance, especially when applied to smaller models and in scenarios with limited data availability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17608v1,2024-02
FaultProfIT: Hierarchical Fault Profiling of Incident Tickets in Large-scale Cloud Systems,"Junjie Huang, Jinyang Liu, Zhuangbin Chen, Zhihan Jiang, Yichen LI, Jiazhen Gu, Cong Feng, Zengyin Yang, Yongqiang Yang, Michael R. Lyu","Postmortem analysis is essential in the management of incidents within cloud systems, which provides valuable insights to improve system's reliability and robustness. At CloudA, fault pattern profiling is performed during the postmortem phase, which involves the classification of incidents' faults into unique categories, referred to as fault pattern. By aggregating and analyzing these fault patterns, engineers can discern common faults, vulnerable components and emerging fault trends. However, this process is currently conducted by manual labeling, which has inherent drawbacks. On the one hand, the sheer volume of incidents means only the most severe ones are analyzed, causing a skewed overview of fault patterns. On the other hand, the complexity of the task demands extensive domain knowledge, which leads to errors and inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose an automated approach, named FaultProfIT, for Fault pattern Profiling of Incident Tickets. It leverages hierarchy-guided contrastive learning to train a hierarchy-aware incident encoder and predicts fault patterns with enhanced incident representations. We evaluate FaultProfIT using the production incidents from CloudA. The results demonstrate that FaultProfIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our ablation study and analysis also verify the effectiveness of hierarchy-guided contrastive learning. Additionally, we have deployed FaultProfIT at CloudA for six months. To date, FaultProfIT has analyzed 10,000+ incidents from 30+ cloud services, successfully revealing several fault trends that have informed system improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17583v1,2024-02
Agent-Pro: Learning to Evolve via Policy-Level Reflection and Optimization,"Wenqi Zhang, Ke Tang, Hai Wu, Mengna Wang, Yongliang Shen, Guiyang Hou, Zeqi Tan, Peng Li, Yueting Zhuang, Weiming Lu","Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit robust problem-solving capabilities for diverse tasks. However, most LLM-based agents are designed as specific task solvers with sophisticated prompt engineering, rather than agents capable of learning and evolving through interactions. These task solvers necessitate manually crafted prompts to inform task rules and regulate LLM behaviors, inherently incapacitating to address complex dynamic scenarios e.g., large interactive games. In light of this, we propose Agent-Pro: an LLM-based Agent with Policy-level Reflection and Optimization that can learn a wealth of expertise from interactive experiences and progressively elevate its behavioral policy. Specifically, it involves a dynamic belief generation and reflection process for policy evolution. Rather than action-level reflection, Agent-Pro iteratively reflects on past trajectories and beliefs, fine-tuning its irrational beliefs for a better policy. Moreover, a depth-first search is employed for policy optimization, ensuring continual enhancement in policy payoffs. Agent-Pro is evaluated across two games: Blackjack and Texas Hold'em, outperforming vanilla LLM and specialized models. Our results show Agent-Pro can learn and evolve in complex and dynamic scenes, which also benefits numerous LLM-based applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17574v3,2024-02
Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models as Prompt Optimizers: An Analogical Analysis with Gradient-based Model Optimizers,"Xinyu Tang, Xiaolei Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Siyuan Lu, Yaliang Li, Ji-Rong Wen","Automatic prompt optimization is an important approach to improving the performance of large language models (LLMs). Recent research demonstrates the potential of using LLMs as prompt optimizers, which can generate improved task prompts via iterative refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective to investigate the design of LLM-based prompt optimizers, by drawing an analogy with gradient-based model optimizers. To connect these two approaches, we identify two pivotal factors in model parameter learning: update direction and update method. Focused on the two aspects, we borrow the theoretical framework and learning methods from gradient-based optimization to design improved strategies for LLM-based prompt optimizers. By systematically analyzing a rich set of improvement strategies, we further develop a capable Gradient-inspired LLM-based Prompt Optimizer called GPO. At each step, it first retrieves relevant prompts from the optimization trajectory as the update direction. Then, it utilizes the generation-based refinement strategy to perform the update, while controlling the edit distance through a cosine-based decay strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GPO. In particular, GPO brings an additional improvement of up to 56.8% on Big-Bench Hard and 55.3% on MMLU compared to baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17564v2,2024-02
DropBP: Accelerating Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models by Dropping Backward Propagation,"Sunghyeon Woo, Baeseong Park, Byeongwook Kim, Minjung Jo, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsuk Jeon, Dongsoo Lee","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, training these LLMs typically involves substantial memory and computational costs during both forward and backward propagation. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) considerably reduces the training memory associated with parameters, it does not address the significant computational costs and activation memory. In this paper, we propose Dropping Backward Propagation (DropBP), a novel approach designed to reduce computational costs and activation memory while maintaining accuracy. DropBP randomly drops layers during backward propagation, which is essentially equivalent to training shallow submodules generated by undropped layers and residual connections. Additionally, DropBP calculates the sensitivity of each layer to assign an appropriate drop rate, thereby stabilizing the training process. DropBP is not only applicable to full fine-tuning but can also be orthogonally integrated with all types of PEFT by dropping layers during backward propagation. Specifically, DropBP can reduce training time by 44% with comparable accuracy to the baseline, accelerate convergence to the same perplexity by 1.5x, and enable training with a sequence length 6.2x larger on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU. Furthermore, our DropBP enabled a throughput increase of 79% on a NVIDIA A100 GPU and 117% on an Intel Gaudi2 HPU.

OmniACT: A Dataset and Benchmark for Enabling Multimodal Generalist Autonomous Agents for Desktop and Web,"Raghav Kapoor, Yash Parag Butala, Melisa Russak, Jing Yu Koh, Kiran Kamble, Waseem Alshikh, Ruslan Salakhutdinov","For decades, human-computer interaction has fundamentally been manual. Even today, almost all productive work done on the computer necessitates human input at every step. Autonomous virtual agents represent an exciting step in automating many of these menial tasks. Virtual agents would empower users with limited technical proficiency to harness the full possibilities of computer systems. They could also enable the efficient streamlining of numerous computer tasks, ranging from calendar management to complex travel bookings, with minimal human intervention. In this paper, we introduce OmniACT, the first-of-a-kind dataset and benchmark for assessing an agent's capability to generate executable programs to accomplish computer tasks. Our scope extends beyond traditional web automation, covering a diverse range of desktop applications. The dataset consists of fundamental tasks such as ""Play the next song"", as well as longer horizon tasks such as ""Send an email to John Doe mentioning the time and place to meet"". Specifically, given a pair of screen image and a visually-grounded natural language task, the goal is to generate a script capable of fully executing the task. We run several strong baseline language model agents on our benchmark. The strongest baseline, GPT-4, performs the best on our benchmark However, its performance level still reaches only 15% of the human proficiency in generating executable scripts capable of completing the task, demonstrating the challenge of our task for conventional web agents. Our benchmark provides a platform to measure and evaluate the progress of language model agents in automating computer tasks and motivates future work towards building multimodal models that bridge large language models and the visual grounding of computer screens.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17553v3,2024-02
TruthX: Alleviating Hallucinations by Editing Large Language Models in Truthful Space,"Shaolei Zhang, Tian Yu, Yang Feng","Large Language Models (LLMs) sometimes suffer from producing hallucinations, especially LLMs may generate untruthful responses despite knowing the correct knowledge. Activating the truthfulness within LLM is the key to fully unlocking LLM's knowledge potential. In this paper, we propose TruthX, an inference-time intervention method to activate the truthfulness of LLM by identifying and editing the features within LLM's internal representations that govern the truthfulness. TruthX employs an auto-encoder to map LLM's representations into semantic and truthful latent spaces respectively, and applies contrastive learning to identify a truthful editing direction within the truthful space. During inference, by editing LLM's internal representations in truthful space, TruthX effectively enhances the truthfulness of LLM. Experiments show that TruthX improves the truthfulness of 13 advanced LLMs by an average of 20% on TruthfulQA benchmark. Further analyses suggest that TruthX can control LLM to produce truthful or hallucinatory responses via editing only one vector in LLM's internal representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17811v2,2024-02

In this work, we develop a psychological counseling agent, referred to as CoCoA, that applies Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques to identify and address cognitive distortions inherent in the client's statements. Specifically, we construct a memory system to efficiently manage information necessary for counseling while extracting high-level insights about the client from their utterances. Additionally, to ensure that the counseling agent generates appropriate responses, we introduce dynamic prompting to flexibly apply CBT techniques and facilitate the appropriate retrieval of information. We conducted dialogues between CoCoA and characters from Character.ai, creating a dataset for evaluation.

Retrieval is Accurate Generation,"Bowen Cao, Deng Cai, Leyang Cui, Xuxin Cheng, Wei Bi, Yuexian Zou, Shuming Shi","Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary. We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.61% to 81.58% in open-ended text generation. Remarkably, our model also achieves the best performance and the lowest latency among several retrieval-augmented baselines. In conclusion, we assert that retrieval is more accurate generation and hope that our work will encourage further research on this new paradigm shift.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17532v3,2024-02
Nissist: An Incident Mitigation Copilot based on Troubleshooting Guides,"Kaikai An, Fangkai Yang, Junting Lu, Liqun Li, Zhixing Ren, Hao Huang, Lu Wang, Pu Zhao, Yu Kang, Hua Ding, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang","Effective incident management is pivotal for the smooth operation of enterprises-level cloud services. In order to expedite incident mitigation, service teams compile troubleshooting knowledge into Troubleshooting Guides (TSGs) accessible to on-call engineers (OCEs). While automated pipelines are enabled to resolve the most frequent and easy incidents, there still exist complex incidents that require OCEs' intervention. However, TSGs are often unstructured and incomplete, which requires manual interpretation by OCEs, leading to on-call fatigue and decreased productivity, especially among new-hire OCEs. In this work, we propose Nissist which leverages TSGs and incident mitigation histories to provide proactive suggestions, reducing human intervention. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM), Nissist extracts insights from unstructured TSGs and historical incident mitigation discussions, forming a comprehensive knowledge base. Its multi-agent system design enhances proficiency in precisely discerning user queries, retrieving relevant information, and delivering systematic plans consecutively. Through our user case and experiment, we demonstrate that Nissist significant reduce Time to Mitigate (TTM) in incident mitigation, alleviating operational burdens on OCEs and improving service reliability.

Predict the Next Word: Humans exhibit uncertainty in this task and language models _____,"Evgenia Ilia, Wilker Aziz","Language models (LMs) are statistical models trained to assign probability to human-generated text. As such, it is reasonable to question whether they approximate linguistic variability exhibited by humans well. This form of statistical assessment is difficult to perform at the passage level, for it requires acceptability judgements (i.e., human evaluation) or a robust automated proxy (which is non-trivial). At the word level, however, given some context, samples from an LM can be assessed via exact matching against a prerecorded dataset of alternative single-word continuations of the available context. We exploit this fact and evaluate the LM's ability to reproduce variability that humans (in particular, a population of English speakers) exhibit in the 'next word prediction' task. This can be seen as assessing a form of calibration, which, in the context of text classification, Baan et al. (2022) termed calibration to human uncertainty. We assess GPT2, BLOOM and ChatGPT and find that they exhibit fairly low calibration to human uncertainty. We also verify the failure of expected calibration error (ECE) to reflect this, and as such, advise the community against relying on it in this setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17527v2,2024-02
Latte: Latent Attention for Linear Time Transformers,"Rares Dolga, Lucas Maystre, Marius Cobzarenco, David Barber","The time complexity of the standard attention mechanism in transformers scales quadratically with sequence length. We propose a probabilistic framework for attention, enabling us to derive a novel low-rank linear re-parameterisation of both bidirectional and causal cases, based on defining a latent variable model. Our method can be seamlessly integrated as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Additionally, this framework provides a natural extension for combining local standard attention with our global linear attention. This approach allows us to extend the context length of existing large pre-trained models with only a few additional training steps. The resulting ``Latte Transformer'' achieves performance comparable to standard attention and other state-of-the-art models, while maintaining linear time and memory complexity, along with constant-time next-token prediction during inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17512v4,2024-02
Extreme Miscalibration and the Illusion of Adversarial Robustness,"Vyas Raina, Samson Tan, Volkan Cevher, Aditya Rawal, Sheng Zha, George Karypis","Deep learning-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where small perturbations can cause a model to misclassify. Adversarial Training (AT) is often used to increase model robustness. However, we have discovered an intriguing phenomenon: deliberately or accidentally miscalibrating models masks gradients in a way that interferes with adversarial attack search methods, giving rise to an apparent increase in robustness. We show that this observed gain in robustness is an illusion of robustness (IOR), and demonstrate how an adversary can perform various forms of test-time temperature calibration to nullify the aforementioned interference and allow the adversarial attack to find adversarial examples. Hence, we urge the NLP community to incorporate test-time temperature scaling into their robustness evaluations to ensure that any observed gains are genuine. Finally, we show how the temperature can be scaled during \textit{training} to improve genuine robustness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17509v3,2024-02
BASES: Large-scale Web Search User Simulation with Large Language Model based Agents,"Ruiyang Ren, Peng Qiu, Yingqi Qu, Jing Liu, Wayne Xin Zhao, Hua Wu, Ji-Rong Wen, Haifeng Wang","Due to the excellent capacities of large language models (LLMs), it becomes feasible to develop LLM-based agents for reliable user simulation. Considering the scarcity and limit (e.g., privacy issues) of real user data, in this paper, we conduct large-scale user simulation for web search, to improve the analysis and modeling of user search behavior. Specially, we propose BASES, a novel user simulation framework with LLM-based agents, designed to facilitate comprehensive simulations of web search user behaviors. Our simulation framework can generate unique user profiles at scale, which subsequently leads to diverse search behaviors. To demonstrate the effectiveness of BASES, we conduct evaluation experiments based on two human benchmarks in both Chinese and English, demonstrating that BASES can effectively simulate large-scale human-like search behaviors. To further accommodate the research on web search, we develop WARRIORS, a new large-scale dataset encompassing web search user behaviors, including both Chinese and English versions, which can greatly bolster research in the field of information retrieval.

REAR: A Relevance-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Open-Domain Question Answering,"Yuhao Wang, Ruiyang Ren, Junyi Li, Wayne Xin Zhao, Jing Liu, Ji-Rong Wen","Considering the limited internal parametric knowledge, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely used to extend the knowledge scope of large language models (LLMs). Despite the extensive efforts on RAG research, in existing methods, LLMs cannot precisely assess the relevance of retrieved documents, thus likely leading to misleading or even incorrect utilization of external knowledge (eg., retrieved documents). To address this issue, in this paper, we propose REAR, a RElevance-Aware Retrieval-augmented approach for open-domain question answering (QA). As the key motivation, we aim to enhance the self-awareness regarding the reliability of external knowledge for LLMs, so as to adaptively utilize external knowledge in RAG systems. Specially, we develop a novel architecture for LLM-based RAG systems, by incorporating a specially designed assessment module that precisely assesses the relevance of retrieved documents. Furthermore, we propose an improved training method based on bi-granularity relevance fusion and noise-resistant training. By combining the improvements in both architecture and training, our proposed REAR can better utilize external knowledge by effectively perceiving the relevance of retrieved documents. Experiments on four open-domain QA tasks show that REAR significantly outperforms previous a number of competitive RAG approaches.

Emotional Voice Messages (EMOVOME) database: emotion recognition in spontaneous voice messages,"Lucía Gómez Zaragozá, Rocío del Amor, Elena Parra Vargas, Valery Naranjo, Mariano Alcañiz Raya, Javier Marín-Morales","Emotional Voice Messages (EMOVOME) is a spontaneous speech dataset containing 999 audio messages from real conversations on a messaging app from 100 Spanish speakers, gender balanced. Voice messages were produced in-the-wild conditions before participants were recruited, avoiding any conscious bias due to laboratory environment. Audios were labeled in valence and arousal dimensions by three non-experts and two experts, which were then combined to obtain a final label per dimension. The experts also provided an extra label corresponding to seven emotion categories. To set a baseline for future investigations using EMOVOME, we implemented emotion recognition models using both speech and audio transcriptions. For speech, we used the standard eGeMAPS feature set and support vector machines, obtaining 49.27% and 44.71% unweighted accuracy for valence and arousal respectively. For text, we fine-tuned a multilingual BERT model and achieved 61.15% and 47.43% unweighted accuracy for valence and arousal respectively. This database will significantly contribute to research on emotion recognition in the wild, while also providing a unique natural and freely accessible resource for Spanish.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17496v2,2024-02
The Foundational Capabilities of Large Language Models in Predicting Postoperative Risks Using Clinical Notes,"Charles Alba, Bing Xue, Joanna Abraham, Thomas Kannampallil, Chenyang Lu","Clinical notes recorded during a patient's perioperative journey holds immense informational value. Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities for bridging this gap. Using 84,875 pre-operative notes and its associated surgical cases from 2018 to 2021, we examine the performance of LLMs in predicting six postoperative risks using various fine-tuning strategies. Pretrained LLMs outperformed traditional word embeddings by an absolute AUROC of 38.3% and AUPRC of 33.2%. Self-supervised fine-tuning further improved performance by 3.2% and 1.5%. Incorporating labels into training further increased AUROC by 1.8% and AUPRC by 2%. The highest performance was achieved with a unified foundation model, with improvements of 3.6% for AUROC and 2.6% for AUPRC compared to self-supervision, highlighting the foundational capabilities of LLMs in predicting postoperative risks, which could be potentially beneficial when deployed for perioperative care",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17493v5,2024-02
Can GPT-4 Identify Propaganda? Annotation and Detection of Propaganda Spans in News Articles,"Maram Hasanain, Fatema Ahmed, Firoj Alam","The use of propaganda has spiked on mainstream and social media, aiming to manipulate or mislead users. While efforts to automatically detect propaganda techniques in textual, visual, or multimodal content have increased, most of them primarily focus on English content. The majority of the recent initiatives targeting medium to low-resource languages produced relatively small annotated datasets, with a skewed distribution, posing challenges for the development of sophisticated propaganda detection models. To address this challenge, we carefully develop the largest propaganda dataset to date, ArPro, comprised of 8K paragraphs from newspaper articles, labeled at the text span level following a taxonomy of 23 propagandistic techniques. Furthermore, our work offers the first attempt to understand the performance of large language models (LLMs), using GPT-4, for fine-grained propaganda detection from text. Results showed that GPT-4's performance degrades as the task moves from simply classifying a paragraph as propagandistic or not, to the fine-grained task of detecting propaganda techniques and their manifestation in text. Compared to models fine-tuned on the dataset for propaganda detection at different classification granularities, GPT-4 is still far behind. Finally, we evaluate GPT-4 on a dataset consisting of six other languages for span detection, and results suggest that the model struggles with the task across languages. Our dataset and resources will be released to the community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17478v1,2024-02
Training-Free Long-Context Scaling of Large Language Models,"Chenxin An, Fei Huang, Jun Zhang, Shansan Gong, Xipeng Qiu, Chang Zhou, Lingpeng Kong","The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and generate coherent text is markedly weakened when the number of input tokens exceeds their pretraining length. Given the expensive overhead of finetuning large-scale models with longer sequences, we propose Dual Chunk Attention (DCA), which enables Llama2 70B to support context windows of more than 100k tokens without continual training. By decomposing the attention computation for long sequences into chunk-based modules, DCA manages to effectively capture the relative positional information of tokens within the same chunk (Intra-Chunk) and across distinct chunks (Inter-Chunk), as well as integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DCA achieves performance on practical long-context tasks that is comparable to or even better than that of finetuned models. When compared with proprietary models, our training-free 70B model attains 94% of the performance of gpt-3.5-16k, indicating it is a viable open-source alternative.

A Piece of Theatre: Investigating How Teachers Design LLM Chatbots to Assist Adolescent Cyberbullying Education,"Michael A. Hedderich, Natalie N. Bazarova, Wenting Zou, Ryun Shim, Xinda Ma, Qian Yang","Cyberbullying harms teenagers' mental health, and teaching them upstanding intervention is crucial. Wizard-of-Oz studies show chatbots can scale up personalized and interactive cyberbullying education, but implementing such chatbots is a challenging and delicate task. We created a no-code chatbot design tool for K-12 teachers. Using large language models and prompt chaining, our tool allows teachers to prototype bespoke dialogue flows and chatbot utterances. In offering this tool, we explore teachers' distinctive needs when designing chatbots to assist their teaching, and how chatbot design tools might better support them. Our findings reveal that teachers welcome the tool enthusiastically. Moreover, they see themselves as playwrights guiding both the students' and the chatbot's behaviors, while allowing for some improvisation. Their goal is to enable students to rehearse both desirable and undesirable reactions to cyberbullying in a safe environment. We discuss the design opportunities LLM-Chains offer for empowering teachers and the research opportunities this work opens up.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17456v1,2024-02
Deep Learning Based Named Entity Recognition Models for Recipes,"Mansi Goel, Ayush Agarwal, Shubham Agrawal, Janak Kapuriya, Akhil Vamshi Konam, Rishabh Gupta, Shrey Rastogi, Niharika, Ganesh Bagler","Food touches our lives through various endeavors, including flavor, nourishment, health, and sustainability. Recipes are cultural capsules transmitted across generations via unstructured text. Automated protocols for recognizing named entities, the building blocks of recipe text, are of immense value for various applications ranging from information extraction to novel recipe generation. Named entity recognition is a technique for extracting information from unstructured or semi-structured data with known labels. Starting with manually-annotated data of 6,611 ingredient phrases, we created an augmented dataset of 26,445 phrases cumulatively. Simultaneously, we systematically cleaned and analyzed ingredient phrases from RecipeDB, the gold-standard recipe data repository, and annotated them using the Stanford NER. Based on the analysis, we sampled a subset of 88,526 phrases using a clustering-based approach while preserving the diversity to create the machine-annotated dataset. A thorough investigation of NER approaches on these three datasets involving statistical, fine-tuning of deep learning-based language models and few-shot prompting on large language models (LLMs) provides deep insights. We conclude that few-shot prompting on LLMs has abysmal performance, whereas the fine-tuned spaCy-transformer emerges as the best model with macro-F1 scores of 95.9%, 96.04%, and 95.71% for the manually-annotated, augmented, and machine-annotated datasets, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17447v2,2024-02
Exploiting Emotion-Semantic Correlations for Empathetic Response Generation,"Zhou Yang, Zhaochun Ren, Yufeng Wang, Xiaofei Zhu, Zhihao Chen, Tiecheng Cai, Yunbing Wu, Yisong Su, Sibo Ju, Xiangwen Liao","Empathetic response generation aims to generate empathetic responses by understanding the speaker's emotional feelings from the language of dialogue. Recent methods capture emotional words in the language of communicators and construct them as static vectors to perceive nuanced emotions. However, linguistic research has shown that emotional words in language are dynamic and have correlations with other grammar semantic roles, i.e., words with semantic meanings, in grammar. Previous methods overlook these two characteristics, which easily lead to misunderstandings of emotions and neglect of key semantics. To address this issue, we propose a dynamical Emotion-Semantic Correlation Model (ESCM) for empathetic dialogue generation tasks. ESCM constructs dynamic emotion-semantic vectors through the interaction of context and emotions. We introduce dependency trees to reflect the correlations between emotions and semantics. Based on dynamic emotion-semantic vectors and dependency trees, we propose a dynamic correlation graph convolutional network to guide the model in learning context meanings in dialogue and generating empathetic responses. Experimental results on the EMPATHETIC-DIALOGUES dataset show that ESCM understands semantics and emotions more accurately and expresses fluent and informative empathetic responses. Our analysis results also indicate that the correlations between emotions and semantics are frequently used in dialogues, which is of great significance for empathetic perception and expression.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17437v1,2024-02
Enhancing EEG-to-Text Decoding through Transferable Representations from Pre-trained Contrastive EEG-Text Masked Autoencoder,"Jiaqi Wang, Zhenxi Song, Zhengyu Ma, Xipeng Qiu, Min Zhang, Zhiguo Zhang","Reconstructing natural language from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) holds great promise as a language decoding technology for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, EEG-based language decoding is still in its nascent stages, facing several technical issues such as: 1) Absence of a hybrid strategy that can effectively integrate cross-modality (between EEG and text) self-learning with intra-modality self-reconstruction of EEG features or textual sequences; 2) Under-utilization of large language models (LLMs) to enhance EEG-based language decoding. To address above issues, we propose the Contrastive EEG-Text Masked Autoencoder (CET-MAE), a novel model that orchestrates compound self-supervised learning across and within EEG and text through a dedicated multi-stream encoder. Furthermore, we develop a framework called E2T-PTR (EEG-to-Text decoding using Pretrained Transferable Representations), which leverages pre-trained modules alongside the EEG stream from CET-MAE and further enables an LLM (specifically BART) to decode text from EEG sequences. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the popular text-evoked EEG database, ZuCo, demonstrate the superiority of E2T-PTR, which outperforms the state-of-the-art in ROUGE-1 F1 and BLEU-4 scores by 8.34% and 32.21%, respectively. These results indicate significant advancements in the field and underscores the proposed framework's potential to enable more powerful and widespread BCI applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17433v3,2024-02
Consistency Matters: Explore LLMs Consistency From a Black-Box Perspective,"Fufangchen Zhao, Guoqiang Jin, Jiaheng Huang, Rui Zhao, Fei Tan","Nowadays both commercial and open-source academic LLM have become the mainstream models of NLP. However, there is still a lack of research on LLM consistency, meaning that throughout the various stages of LLM research and deployment, its internal parameters and capabilities should remain unchanged. This issue exists in both the industrial and academic sectors. The solution to this problem is often time-consuming and labor-intensive, and there is also an additional cost of secondary deployment, resulting in economic and time losses. To fill this gap, we build an LLM consistency task dataset and design several baselines. Additionally, we choose models of diverse scales for the main experiments. Specifically, in the LightGBM experiment, we used traditional NLG metrics (i.e., ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR) as the features needed for model training. The final result exceeds the manual evaluation and GPT3.5 as well as other models in the main experiment, achieving the best performance. In the end, we use the best performing LightGBM model as the base model to build the evaluation tool, which can effectively assist in the deployment of business models.

A Neural Rewriting System to Solve Algorithmic Problems,"Flavio Petruzzellis, Alberto Testolin, Alessandro Sperduti","Modern neural network architectures still struggle to learn algorithmic procedures that require to systematically apply compositional rules to solve out-of-distribution problem instances. In this work, we focus on formula simplification problems, a class of synthetic benchmarks used to study the systematic generalization capabilities of neural architectures. We propose a modular architecture designed to learn a general procedure for solving nested mathematical formulas by only relying on a minimal set of training examples. Inspired by rewriting systems, a classic framework in symbolic artificial intelligence, we include in the architecture three specialized and interacting modules: the Selector, trained to identify solvable sub-expressions; the Solver, mapping sub-expressions to their values; and the Combiner, replacing sub-expressions in the original formula with the solution provided by the Solver. We benchmark our system against the Neural Data Router, a recent model specialized for systematic generalization, and a state-of-the-art large language model (GPT-4) probed with advanced prompting strategies. We demonstrate that our approach achieves a higher degree of out-of-distribution generalization compared to these alternative approaches on three different types of formula simplification problems, and we discuss its limitations by analyzing its failures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17407v2,2024-02
Investigating Continual Pretraining in Large Language Models: Insights and Implications,"Çağatay Yıldız, Nishaanth Kanna Ravichandran, Prishruit Punia, Matthias Bethge, Beyza Ermis","This paper studies the evolving domain of Continual Learning (CL) in large language models (LLMs), with a focus on developing strategies for efficient and sustainable training. Our primary emphasis is on continual domain-adaptive pretraining, a process designed to equip LLMs with the ability to integrate new information from various domains while retaining previously learned knowledge and enhancing cross-domain knowledge transfer without relying on domain-specific identification. Unlike previous studies, which mostly concentrate on a limited selection of tasks or domains and primarily aim to address the issue of forgetting, our research evaluates the adaptability and capabilities of LLMs to changing data landscapes in practical scenarios. To this end, we introduce a new benchmark designed to measure the adaptability of LLMs to these evolving data environments, offering a comprehensive framework for evaluation. We examine the impact of model size on learning efficacy and forgetting, as well as how the progression and similarity of emerging domains affect the knowledge transfer within these models. Our findings uncover several key insights: (i) when the sequence of domains shows semantic similarity, continual pretraining enables LLMs to better specialize in the current domain compared to stand-alone fine-tuning, (ii) training across a diverse range of domains enhances both backward and forward knowledge transfer, and (iii) smaller models are particularly sensitive to continual pretraining, showing the most significant rates of both forgetting and learning. We posit that our research marks a shift towards establishing a more realistic benchmark for investigating CL in LLMs, and has the potential to play a key role in guiding the direction of future research in the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17400v1,2024-02
Benchmarking GPT-4 on Algorithmic Problems: A Systematic Evaluation of Prompting Strategies,"Flavio Petruzzellis, Alberto Testolin, Alessandro Sperduti","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing thanks to their ability to reuse knowledge acquired on massive text corpora on a wide variety of downstream tasks, with minimal (if any) tuning steps. At the same time, it has been repeatedly shown that LLMs lack systematic generalization, which allows to extrapolate the learned statistical regularities outside the training distribution. In this work, we offer a systematic benchmarking of GPT-4, one of the most advanced LLMs available, on three algorithmic tasks characterized by the possibility to control the problem difficulty with two parameters. We compare the performance of GPT-4 with that of its predecessor (GPT-3.5) and with a variant of the Transformer-Encoder architecture recently introduced to solve similar tasks, the Neural Data Router. We find that the deployment of advanced prompting techniques allows GPT-4 to reach superior accuracy on all tasks, demonstrating that state-of-the-art LLMs constitute a very strong baseline also in challenging tasks that require systematic generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17396v2,2024-02

This paper focuses on comparing structures of the coarse-grained partitions of semantic paths for human-written and bot-generated texts. We compare the clusterizations of datasets of n-grams from literary texts and texts generated by several bots. The hypothesis is that the structures and clusterizations are different.

FairBelief -- Assessing Harmful Beliefs in Language Models,"Mattia Setzu, Marta Marchiori Manerba, Pasquale Minervini, Debora Nozza","Language Models (LMs) have been shown to inherit undesired biases that might hurt minorities and underrepresented groups if such systems were integrated into real-world applications without careful fairness auditing. This paper proposes FairBelief, an analytical approach to capture and assess beliefs, i.e., propositions that an LM may embed with different degrees of confidence and that covertly influence its predictions. With FairBelief, we leverage prompting to study the behavior of several state-of-the-art LMs across different previously neglected axes, such as model scale and likelihood, assessing predictions on a fairness dataset specifically designed to quantify LMs' outputs' hurtfulness. Finally, we conclude with an in-depth qualitative assessment of the beliefs emitted by the models. We apply FairBelief to English LMs, revealing that, although these architectures enable high performances on diverse natural language processing tasks, they show hurtful beliefs about specific genders. Interestingly, training procedure and dataset, model scale, and architecture induce beliefs of different degrees of hurtfulness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17389v1,2024-02

KoDialogBench: Evaluating Conversational Understanding of Language Models with Korean Dialogue Benchmark,"Seongbo Jang, Seonghyeon Lee, Hwanjo Yu","As language models are often deployed as chatbot assistants, it becomes a virtue for models to engage in conversations in a user's first language. While these models are trained on a wide range of languages, a comprehensive evaluation of their proficiency in low-resource languages such as Korean has been lacking. In this work, we introduce KoDialogBench, a benchmark designed to assess language models' conversational capabilities in Korean. To this end, we collect native Korean dialogues on daily topics from public sources, or translate dialogues from other languages. We then structure these conversations into diverse test datasets, spanning from dialogue comprehension to response selection tasks. Leveraging the proposed benchmark, we conduct extensive evaluations and analyses of various language models to measure a foundational understanding of Korean dialogues. Experimental results indicate that there exists significant room for improvement in models' conversation skills. Furthermore, our in-depth comparisons across different language models highlight the effectiveness of recent training techniques in enhancing conversational proficiency. We anticipate that KoDialogBench will promote the progress towards conversation-aware Korean language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17377v2,2024-02

SoFA: Shielded On-the-fly Alignment via Priority Rule Following,"Xinyu Lu, Bowen Yu, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Haiyang Yu, Le Sun, Xianpei Han, Yongbin Li","The alignment problem in Large Language Models (LLMs) involves adapting them to the broad spectrum of human values. This requirement challenges existing alignment methods due to diversity of preferences and regulatory standards. This paper introduces a novel alignment paradigm, priority rule following, which defines rules as the primary control mechanism in each dialog, prioritizing them over user instructions. Our preliminary analysis reveals that even the advanced LLMs, such as GPT-4, exhibit shortcomings in understanding and prioritizing the rules. Therefore, we present PriorityDistill, a semi-automated approach for distilling priority following signals from LLM simulations to ensure robust rule integration and adherence. Our experiments show that this method not only effectively minimizes misalignments utilizing only one general rule but also adapts smoothly to various unseen rules, ensuring they are shielded from hijacking and that the model responds appropriately.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17358v1,2024-02
RECOST: External Knowledge Guided Data-efficient Instruction Tuning,"Qi Zhang, Yiming Zhang, Haobo Wang, Junbo Zhao","In the current landscape of large language models (LLMs), the process of instruction tuning serves as an essential step. Considering the high computing power overhead, data-efficient instruction tuning was proposed to reduce the training data size in this process, aiming at selecting high-quality instructional data. Nevertheless, we argue that most current data-efficient instruction-tuning methods are highly dependent on the quality of the original instruction-tuning dataset. When it comes to datasets synthesized by LLMs, a common scenario in this field, dirty samples will even be selected with a higher probability than other samples. To address these challenges, we utilized external knowledge (relevant examples or paragraphs) to evaluate those samples synthesized by LLMs with an in-context-based relative predictive entropy. Based on the new metric, we proposed a framework, dubbed as \textbf{RECOST}, which integrates external-knowledge-base re-ranking and diversity-consistent sampling into a single pipeline. Through extensive experiments on several synthetic datasets (Alpaca and Alpaca-gpt4), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and achieve even better results with only \textbf{1\%} of the full dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17355v1,2024-02

SKT5SciSumm -- Revisiting Extractive-Generative Approach for Multi-Document Scientific Summarization,"Huy Quoc To, Ming Liu, Guangyan Huang, Hung-Nghiep Tran, Andr'e Greiner-Petter, Felix Beierle, Akiko Aizawa","Summarization for scientific text has shown significant benefits both for the research community and human society. Given the fact that the nature of scientific text is distinctive and the input of the multi-document summarization task is substantially long, the task requires sufficient embedding generation and text truncation without losing important information. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose SKT5SciSumm - a hybrid framework for multi-document scientific summarization (MDSS). We leverage the Sentence-Transformer version of Scientific Paper Embeddings using Citation-Informed Transformers (SPECTER) to encode and represent textual sentences, allowing for efficient extractive summarization using k-means clustering. We employ the T5 family of models to generate abstractive summaries using extracted sentences. SKT5SciSumm achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Multi-XScience dataset. Through extensive experiments and evaluation, we showcase the benefits of our model by using less complicated models to achieve remarkable results, thereby highlighting its potential in advancing the field of multi-document summarization for scientific text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17311v2,2024-02
Probing Multimodal Large Language Models for Global and Local Semantic Representations,"Mingxu Tao, Quzhe Huang, Kun Xu, Liwei Chen, Yansong Feng, Dongyan Zhao","The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has greatly accelerated the development of applications in understanding integrated texts and images. Recent works leverage image-caption datasets to train MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on image-to-text tasks. However, there are few studies exploring which layers of MLLMs make the most effort to the global image information, which plays vital roles in multimodal comprehension and generation. In this study, we find that the intermediate layers of models can encode more global semantic information, whose representation vectors perform better on visual-language entailment tasks, rather than the topmost layers. We further probe models regarding local semantic representations through object recognition tasks. We find that the topmost layers may excessively focus on local information, leading to a diminished ability to encode global information.

Can LLM Generate Culturally Relevant Commonsense QA Data? Case Study in Indonesian and Sundanese,"Rifki Afina Putri, Faiz Ghifari Haznitrama, Dea Adhista, Alice Oh","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate synthetic data for training and evaluating models. However, it is unclear whether they can generate a good quality of question answering (QA) dataset that incorporates knowledge and cultural nuance embedded in a language, especially for low-resource languages. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of using LLMs in generating culturally relevant commonsense QA datasets for Indonesian and Sundanese languages. To do so, we create datasets for these languages using various methods involving both LLMs and human annotators, resulting in ~4.5K questions per language (~9K in total), making our dataset the largest of its kind. Our experiments show that automatic data adaptation from an existing English dataset is less effective for Sundanese. Interestingly, using the direct generation method on the target language, GPT-4 Turbo can generate questions with adequate general knowledge in both languages, albeit not as culturally 'deep' as humans. We also observe a higher occurrence of fluency errors in the Sundanese dataset, highlighting the discrepancy between medium- and lower-resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17302v3,2024-02
XMoE: Sparse Models with Fine-grained and Adaptive Expert Selection,"Yuanhang Yang, Shiyi Qi, Wenchao Gu, Chaozheng Wang, Cuiyun Gao, Zenglin Xu","Sparse models, including sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, have emerged as an effective approach for scaling Transformer models. However, they often suffer from computational inefficiency since a significant number of parameters are unnecessarily involved in computations via multiplying values by zero or low activation values. To address this issue, we present \tool, a novel MoE designed to enhance both the efficacy and efficiency of sparse MoE models. \tool leverages small experts and a threshold-based router to enable tokens to selectively engage only essential parameters. Our extensive experiments on language modeling and machine translation tasks demonstrate that \tool can enhance model performance while decreasing the computation load at MoE layers by over 50\% without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, we present the versatility of \tool by applying it to dense models, enabling sparse computation during inference. We provide a comprehensive analysis and make our code available at https://github.com/ysngki/XMoE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18926v2,2024-02
Comparing effectiveness of regularization methods on text classification: Simple and complex model in data shortage situation,"Jongga Lee, Jaeseung Yim, Seohee Park, Changwon Lim","Text classification is the task of assigning a document to a predefined class. However, it is expensive to acquire enough labeled documents or to label them. In this paper, we study the regularization methods' effects on various classification models when only a few labeled data are available. We compare a simple word embedding-based model, which is simple but effective, with complex models (CNN and BiLSTM). In supervised learning, adversarial training can further regularize the model. When an unlabeled dataset is available, we can regularize the model using semi-supervised learning methods such as the Pi model and virtual adversarial training. We evaluate the regularization effects on four text classification datasets (AG news, DBpedia, Yahoo! Answers, Yelp Polarity), using only 0.1% to 0.5% of the original labeled training documents. The simple model performs relatively well in fully supervised learning, but with the help of adversarial training and semi-supervised learning, both simple and complex models can be regularized, showing better results for complex models. Although the simple model is robust to overfitting, a complex model with well-designed prior beliefs can be also robust to overfitting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00825v1,2024-02
MELoRA: Mini-Ensemble Low-Rank Adapters for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning,"Pengjie Ren, Chengshun Shi, Shiguang Wu, Mengqi Zhang, Zhaochun Ren, Maarten de Rijke, Zhumin Chen, Jiahuan Pei","Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a popular method for tailoring pre-trained large language models (LLMs), especially as the models' scale and the diversity of tasks increase. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is based on the idea that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional, i.e., significant model changes can be represented with relatively few parameters. However, decreasing the rank encounters challenges with generalization errors for specific tasks when compared to full-parameter fine-tuning. We present MELoRA, a mini-ensemble low-rank adapters that uses fewer trainable parameters while maintaining a higher rank, thereby offering improved performance potential. The core idea is to freeze original pretrained weights and train a group of mini LoRAs with only a small number of parameters. This can capture a significant degree of diversity among mini LoRAs, thus promoting better generalization ability. We conduct a theoretical analysis and empirical studies on various NLP tasks. Our experimental results show that, compared to LoRA, MELoRA achieves better performance with 8 times fewer trainable parameters on natural language understanding tasks and 36 times fewer trainable parameters on instruction following tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of MELoRA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17263v2,2024-02
Speak Out of Turn: Safety Vulnerability of Large Language Models in Multi-turn Dialogue,"Zhenhong Zhou, Jiuyang Xiang, Haopeng Chen, Quan Liu, Zherui Li, Sen Su","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to generate illegal or unethical responses, particularly when subjected to ""jailbreak."" Research on jailbreak has highlighted the safety issues of LLMs. However, prior studies have predominantly focused on single-turn dialogue, ignoring the potential complexities and risks presented by multi-turn dialogue, a crucial mode through which humans derive information from LLMs. In this paper, we argue that humans could exploit multi-turn dialogue to induce LLMs into generating harmful information. LLMs may not intend to reject cautionary or borderline unsafe queries, even if each turn is closely served for one malicious purpose in a multi-turn dialogue. Therefore, by decomposing an unsafe query into several sub-queries for multi-turn dialogue, we induced LLMs to answer harmful sub-questions incrementally, culminating in an overall harmful response. Our experiments, conducted across a wide range of LLMs, indicate current inadequacies in the safety mechanisms of LLMs in multi-turn dialogue. Our findings expose vulnerabilities of LLMs in complex scenarios involving multi-turn dialogue, presenting new challenges for the safety of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17262v2,2024-02
Beyond the Known: Investigating LLMs Performance on Out-of-Domain Intent Detection,"Pei Wang, Keqing He, Yejie Wang, Xiaoshuai Song, Yutao Mou, Jingang Wang, Yunsen Xian, Xunliang Cai, Weiran Xu","Out-of-domain (OOD) intent detection aims to examine whether the user's query falls outside the predefined domain of the system, which is crucial for the proper functioning of task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. Previous methods address it by fine-tuning discriminative models. Recently, some studies have been exploring the application of large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT to various downstream tasks, but it is still unclear for their ability on OOD detection task.This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs under various experimental settings, and then outline the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs. We find that LLMs exhibit strong zero-shot and few-shot capabilities, but is still at a disadvantage compared to models fine-tuned with full resource. More deeply, through a series of additional analysis experiments, we discuss and summarize the challenges faced by LLMs and provide guidance for future work including injecting domain knowledge, strengthening knowledge transfer from IND(In-domain) to OOD, and understanding long instructions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17256v2,2024-02
Image-Text Matching with Multi-View Attention,"Rui Cheng, Wanqing Cui","Existing two-stream models for image-text matching show good performance while ensuring retrieval speed and have received extensive attention from industry and academia. These methods use a single representation to encode image and text separately and get a matching score with cosine similarity or the inner product of vectors. However, the performance of the two-stream model is often sub-optimal. On the one hand, a single representation is challenging to cover complex content comprehensively. On the other hand, in this framework of lack of interaction, it is challenging to match multiple meanings which leads to information being ignored. To address the problems mentioned above and facilitate the performance of the two-stream model, we propose a multi-view attention approach for two-stream image-text matching MVAM (\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{M}odel). It first learns multiple image and text representations by diverse attention heads with different view codes. And then concatenate these representations into one for matching. A diversity objective is also used to promote diversity between attention heads. With this method, models are able to encode images and text from different views and attend to more key points. So we can get representations that contain more information. When doing retrieval tasks, the matching scores between images and texts can be calculated from different aspects, leading to better matching performance. Experiment results on MSCOCO and Flickr30K show that our proposed model brings improvements over existing models. Further case studies show that different attention heads can focus on different contents and finally obtain a more comprehensive representation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17237v1,2024-02
MATHSENSEI: A Tool-Augmented Large Language Model for Mathematical Reasoning,"Debrup Das, Debopriyo Banerjee, Somak Aditya, Ashish Kulkarni","Tool-augmented Large Language Models (TALMs) are known to enhance the skillset of large language models (LLMs), thereby, leading to their improved reasoning abilities across many tasks. While, TALMs have been successfully employed in different question-answering benchmarks, their efficacy on complex mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and the potential complementary benefits offered by tools for knowledge retrieval and mathematical equation solving are open research questions. In this work, we present MathSensei, a tool-augmented large language model for mathematical reasoning. We study the complementary benefits of the tools - knowledge retriever (Bing Web Search), program generator + executor (Python), and symbolic equation solver (Wolfram-Alpha API) through evaluations on mathematical reasoning datasets. We perform exhaustive ablations on MATH, a popular dataset for evaluating mathematical reasoning on diverse mathematical disciplines. We also conduct experiments involving well-known tool planners to study the impact of tool sequencing on the model performance. MathSensei achieves 13.5% better accuracy over gpt-3.5-turbo with Chain-of-Thought on the MATH dataset. We further observe that TALMs are not as effective for simpler math word problems (in GSM-8K), and the benefit increases as the complexity and required knowledge increases (progressively over AQuA, MMLU-Math, and higher level complex questions in MATH). The code and data are available at https://github.com/Debrup-61/MathSensei.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17231v3,2024-02
Reasoning in Conversation: Solving Subjective Tasks through Dialogue Simulation for Large Language Models,"Xiaolong Wang, Yile Wang, Yuanchi Zhang, Fuwen Luo, Peng Li, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in objective tasks such as open-domain question answering and mathematical reasoning, which can often be solved through recalling learned factual knowledge or chain-of-thought style reasoning. However, we find that the performance of LLMs in subjective tasks is still unsatisfactory, such as metaphor recognition, dark humor detection, etc. Compared to objective tasks, subjective tasks focus more on interpretation or emotional response rather than a universally accepted reasoning pathway. Based on the characteristics of the tasks and the strong dialogue-generation capabilities of LLMs, we propose RiC (Reasoning in Conversation), a method that focuses on solving subjective tasks through dialogue simulation. The motivation of RiC is to mine useful contextual information by simulating dialogues instead of supplying chain-of-thought style rationales, thereby offering potential useful knowledge behind dialogues for giving the final answers. We evaluate both API-based and open-source LLMs including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and OpenChat across twelve tasks. Experimental results show that RiC can yield significant improvement compared with various baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17226v1,2024-02
Measuring Vision-Language STEM Skills of Neural Models,"Jianhao Shen, Ye Yuan, Srbuhi Mirzoyan, Ming Zhang, Chenguang Wang","We introduce a new challenge to test the STEM skills of neural models. The problems in the real world often require solutions, combining knowledge from STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Unlike existing datasets, our dataset requires the understanding of multimodal vision-language information of STEM. Our dataset features one of the largest and most comprehensive datasets for the challenge. It includes 448 skills and 1,073,146 questions spanning all STEM subjects. Compared to existing datasets that often focus on examining expert-level ability, our dataset includes fundamental skills and questions designed based on the K-12 curriculum. We also add state-of-the-art foundation models such as CLIP and GPT-3.5-Turbo to our benchmark. Results show that the recent model advances only help master a very limited number of lower grade-level skills (2.5% in the third grade) in our dataset. In fact, these models are still well below (averaging 54.7%) the performance of elementary students, not to mention near expert-level performance. To understand and increase the performance on our dataset, we teach the models on a training split of our dataset. Even though we observe improved performance, the model performance remains relatively low compared to average elementary students. To solve STEM problems, we will need novel algorithmic innovations from the community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17205v3,2024-02
"When Scaling Meets LLM Finetuning: The Effect of Data, Model and Finetuning Method","Biao Zhang, Zhongtao Liu, Colin Cherry, Orhan Firat","While large language models (LLMs) often adopt finetuning to unlock their capabilities for downstream applications, our understanding on the inductive biases (especially the scaling properties) of different finetuning methods is still limited. To fill this gap, we conduct systematic experiments studying whether and how different scaling factors, including LLM model size, pretraining data size, new finetuning parameter size and finetuning data size, affect the finetuning performance. We consider two types of finetuning -- full-model tuning (FMT) and parameter efficient tuning (PET, including prompt tuning and LoRA), and explore their scaling behaviors in the data-limited regime where the LLM model size substantially outweighs the finetuning data size. Based on two sets of pretrained bilingual LLMs from 1B to 16B and experiments on bilingual machine translation and multilingual summarization benchmarks, we find that 1) LLM finetuning follows a powerbased multiplicative joint scaling law between finetuning data size and each other scaling factor; 2) LLM finetuning benefits more from LLM model scaling than pretraining data scaling, and PET parameter scaling is generally ineffective; and 3) the optimal finetuning method is highly task- and finetuning data-dependent. We hope our findings could shed light on understanding, selecting and developing LLM finetuning methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17193v1,2024-02
"A Synergistic Approach to Wildfire Prevention and Management Using AI, ML, and 5G Technology in the United States","Stanley Chinedu Okoro, Alexander Lopez, Austine Unuriode","Over the past few years, wildfires have become a worldwide environmental emergency, resulting in substantial harm to natural habitats and playing a part in the acceleration of climate change. Wildfire management methods involve prevention, response, and recovery efforts. Despite improvements in detection techniques, the rising occurrence of wildfires demands creative solutions for prompt identification and effective control. This research investigates proactive methods for detecting and handling wildfires in the United States, utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and 5G technology. The specific objective of this research covers proactive detection and prevention of wildfires using advanced technology; Active monitoring and mapping with remote sensing and signaling leveraging on 5G technology; and Advanced response mechanisms to wildfire using drones and IOT devices. This study was based on secondary data collected from government databases and analyzed using descriptive statistics. In addition, past publications were reviewed through content analysis, and narrative synthesis was used to present the observations from various studies. The results showed that developing new technology presents an opportunity to detect and manage wildfires proactively. Utilizing advanced technology could save lives and prevent significant economic losses caused by wildfires. Various methods, such as AI-enabled remote sensing and 5G-based active monitoring, can enhance proactive wildfire detection and management. In addition, super intelligent drones and IOT devices can be used for safer responses to wildfires. This forms the core of the recommendation to the fire Management Agencies and the government.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14657v1,2024-02
An Effective Mixture-Of-Experts Approach For Code-Switching Speech Recognition Leveraging Encoder Disentanglement,"Tzu-Ting Yang, Hsin-Wei Wang, Yi-Cheng Wang, Chi-Han Lin, Berlin Chen","With the massive developments of end-to-end (E2E) neural networks, recent years have witnessed unprecedented breakthroughs in automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, the codeswitching phenomenon remains a major obstacle that hinders ASR from perfection, as the lack of labeled data and the variations between languages often lead to degradation of ASR performance. In this paper, we focus exclusively on improving the acoustic encoder of E2E ASR to tackle the challenge caused by the codeswitching phenomenon. Our main contributions are threefold: First, we introduce a novel disentanglement loss to enable the lower-layer of the encoder to capture inter-lingual acoustic information while mitigating linguistic confusion at the higher-layer of the encoder. Second, through comprehensive experiments, we verify that our proposed method outperforms the prior-art methods using pretrained dual-encoders, meanwhile having access only to the codeswitching corpus and consuming half of the parameterization. Third, the apparent differentiation of the encoders' output features also corroborates the complementarity between the disentanglement loss and the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17189v1,2024-02
Extreme Encoder Output Frame Rate Reduction: Improving Computational Latencies of Large End-to-End Models,"Rohit Prabhavalkar, Zhong Meng, Weiran Wang, Adam Stooke, Xingyu Cai, Yanzhang He, Arun Narayanan, Dongseong Hwang, Tara N. Sainath, Pedro J. Moreno","The accuracy of end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models continues to improve as they are scaled to larger sizes, with some now reaching billions of parameters. Widespread deployment and adoption of these models, however, requires computationally efficient strategies for decoding. In the present work, we study one such strategy: applying multiple frame reduction layers in the encoder to compress encoder outputs into a small number of output frames. While similar techniques have been investigated in previous work, we achieve dramatically more reduction than has previously been demonstrated through the use of multiple funnel reduction layers. Through ablations, we study the impact of various architectural choices in the encoder to identify the most effective strategies. We demonstrate that we can generate one encoder output frame for every 2.56 sec of input speech, without significantly affecting word error rate on a large-scale voice search task, while improving encoder and decoder latencies by 48% and 92% respectively, relative to a strong but computationally expensive baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17184v1,2024-02

Clustering Document Parts: Detecting and Characterizing Influence Campaigns from Documents,"Zhengxiang Wang, Owen Rambow","We propose a novel clustering pipeline to detect and characterize influence campaigns from documents. This approach clusters parts of document, detects clusters that likely reflect an influence campaign, and then identifies documents linked to an influence campaign via their association with the high-influence clusters. Our approach outperforms both the direct document-level classification and the direct document-level clustering approach in predicting if a document is part of an influence campaign. We propose various novel techniques to enhance our pipeline, including using an existing event factuality prediction system to obtain document parts, and aggregating multiple clustering experiments to improve the performance of both cluster and document classification. Classifying documents after clustering not only accurately extracts the parts of the documents that are relevant to influence campaigns, but also captures influence campaigns as a coordinated and holistic phenomenon. Our approach makes possible more fine-grained and interpretable characterizations of influence campaigns from documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17151v2,2024-02
MAGPIE: Multi-Task Media-Bias Analysis Generalization for Pre-Trained Identification of Expressions,"Tomáš Horych, Martin Wessel, Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Jerome Waßmuth, André Greiner-Petter, Akiko Aizawa, Bela Gipp, Timo Spinde","Media bias detection poses a complex, multifaceted problem traditionally tackled using single-task models and small in-domain datasets, consequently lacking generalizability. To address this, we introduce MAGPIE, the first large-scale multi-task pre-training approach explicitly tailored for media bias detection. To enable pre-training at scale, we present Large Bias Mixture (LBM), a compilation of 59 bias-related tasks. MAGPIE outperforms previous approaches in media bias detection on the Bias Annotation By Experts (BABE) dataset, with a relative improvement of 3.3% F1-score. MAGPIE also performs better than previous models on 5 out of 8 tasks in the Media Bias Identification Benchmark (MBIB). Using a RoBERTa encoder, MAGPIE needs only 15% of finetuning steps compared to single-task approaches. Our evaluation shows, for instance, that tasks like sentiment and emotionality boost all learning, all tasks enhance fake news detection, and scaling tasks leads to the best results. MAGPIE confirms that MTL is a promising approach for addressing media bias detection, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of existing models. Furthermore, LBM is the first available resource collection focused on media bias MTL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07910v2,2024-02
OSCaR: Object State Captioning and State Change Representation,"Nguyen Nguyen, Jing Bi, Ali Vosoughi, Yapeng Tian, Pooyan Fazli, Chenliang Xu","The capability of intelligent models to extrapolate and comprehend changes in object states is a crucial yet demanding aspect of AI research, particularly through the lens of human interaction in real-world settings. This task involves describing complex visual environments, identifying active objects, and interpreting their changes as conveyed through language. Traditional methods, which isolate object captioning and state change detection, offer a limited view of dynamic environments. Moreover, relying on a small set of symbolic words to represent changes has restricted the expressiveness of the language. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the Object State Captioning and State Change Representation (OSCaR) dataset and benchmark. OSCaR consists of 14,084 annotated video segments with nearly 1,000 unique objects from various egocentric video collections. It sets a new testbed for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our experiments demonstrate that while MLLMs show some skill, they lack a full understanding of object state changes.

Fact-and-Reflection (FaR) Improves Confidence Calibration of Large Language Models,"Xinran Zhao, Hongming Zhang, Xiaoman Pan, Wenlin Yao, Dong Yu, Tongshuang Wu, Jianshu Chen","For a LLM to be trustworthy, its confidence level should be well-calibrated with its actual performance. While it is now common sense that LLM performances are greatly impacted by prompts, the confidence calibration in prompting LLMs has yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we explore how different prompting strategies influence LLM confidence calibration and how it could be improved. We conduct extensive experiments on six prompting methods in the question-answering context and we observe that, while these methods help improve the expected LLM calibration, they also trigger LLMs to be over-confident when responding to some instances. Inspired by human cognition, we propose Fact-and-Reflection (FaR) prompting, which improves the LLM calibration in two steps. First, FaR elicits the known ""facts"" that are relevant to the input prompt from the LLM. And then it asks the model to ""reflect"" over them to generate the final answer. Experiments show that FaR prompting achieves significantly better calibration; it lowers the Expected Calibration Error by 23.5% on our multi-purpose QA tasks. Notably, FaR prompting even elicits the capability of verbally expressing concerns in less confident scenarios, which helps trigger retrieval augmentation for solving these harder instances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17124v2,2024-02
Creating Suspenseful Stories: Iterative Planning with Large Language Models,"Kaige Xie, Mark Riedl","Automated story generation has been one of the long-standing challenges in NLP. Among all dimensions of stories, suspense is very common in human-written stories but relatively under-explored in AI-generated stories. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly promoted language generation in general, state-of-the-art LLMs are still unreliable when it comes to suspenseful story generation. We propose a novel iterative-prompting-based planning method that is grounded in two theoretical foundations of story suspense from cognitive psychology and narratology. This theory-grounded method works in a fully zero-shot manner and does not rely on any supervised story corpora. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt at suspenseful story generation with LLMs. Extensive human evaluations of the generated suspenseful stories demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17119v1,2024-02
Sinkhorn Distance Minimization for Knowledge Distillation,"Xiao Cui, Yulei Qin, Yuting Gao, Enwei Zhang, Zihan Xu, Tong Wu, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li","Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely adopted to compress large language models (LLMs). Existing KD methods investigate various divergence measures including the Kullback-Leibler (KL), reverse Kullback-Leibler (RKL), and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergences. However, due to limitations inherent in their assumptions and definitions, these measures fail to deliver effective supervision when few distribution overlap exists between the teacher and the student. In this paper, we show that the aforementioned KL, RKL, and JS divergences respectively suffer from issues of mode-averaging, mode-collapsing, and mode-underestimation, which deteriorates logits-based KD for diverse NLP tasks. We propose the Sinkhorn Knowledge Distillation (SinKD) that exploits the Sinkhorn distance to ensure a nuanced and precise assessment of the disparity between teacher and student distributions. Besides, profit by properties of the Sinkhorn metric, we can get rid of sample-wise KD that restricts the perception of divergence in each teacher-student sample pair. Instead, we propose a batch-wise reformulation to capture geometric intricacies of distributions across samples in the high-dimensional space. Comprehensive evaluation on GLUE and SuperGLUE, in terms of comparability, validity, and generalizability, highlights our superiority over state-of-the-art methods on all kinds of LLMs with encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17110v1,2024-02
Information Flow Routes: Automatically Interpreting Language Models at Scale,"Javier Ferrando, Elena Voita","Information flows by routes inside the network via mechanisms implemented in the model. These routes can be represented as graphs where nodes correspond to token representations and edges to operations inside the network. We automatically build these graphs in a top-down manner, for each prediction leaving only the most important nodes and edges. In contrast to the existing workflows relying on activation patching, we do this through attribution: this allows us to efficiently uncover existing circuits with just a single forward pass. Additionally, the applicability of our method is far beyond patching: we do not need a human to carefully design prediction templates, and we can extract information flow routes for any prediction (not just the ones among the allowed templates). As a result, we can talk about model behavior in general, for specific types of predictions, or different domains. We experiment with Llama 2 and show that the role of some attention heads is overall important, e.g. previous token heads and subword merging heads. Next, we find similarities in Llama 2 behavior when handling tokens of the same part of speech. Finally, we show that some model components can be specialized on domains such as coding or multilingual texts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00824v2,2024-02
Re-Ex: Revising after Explanation Reduces the Factual Errors in LLM Responses,"Juyeon Kim, Jeongeun Lee, Yoonho Chang, Chanyeol Choi, Junseong Kim, Jy-yong Sohn","Mitigating hallucination issues is a key challenge that must be overcome to reliably deploy large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. Recently, various methods have been proposed to detect and revise factual errors in LLM-generated texts, in order to reduce hallucination. In this paper, we propose Re-Ex, a method for post-editing LLM-generated responses. Re-Ex introduces a novel reasoning step dubbed as the factual error explanation step. Re-Ex revises the initial response of LLMs using 3-steps : first, external tools are used to retrieve the evidences of the factual errors in the initial LLM response; next, LLM is instructed to explain the problematic parts of the response based on the gathered evidence; finally, LLM revises the initial response using the explanations provided in the previous step. In addition to the explanation step, Re-Ex also incorporates new prompting techniques to reduce the token count and inference time required for the response revision process. Compared with existing methods including FacTool, CoVE, and RARR, Re-Ex provides better detection and revision performance with less inference time and fewer tokens in multiple benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17097v2,2024-02
Adapting to Teammates in a Cooperative Language Game,"Christopher Archibald, Spencer Brosnahan","The game of Codenames has recently emerged as a domain of interest for intelligent agent design. The game is unique due to the way that language and coordination between teammates play important roles. Previous approaches to designing agents for this game have utilized a single internal language model to determine action choices. This often leads to good performance with some teammates and inferior performance with other teammates, as the agent cannot adapt to any specific teammate. In this paper we present the first adaptive agent for playing Codenames. We adopt an ensemble approach with the goal of determining, during the course of interacting with a specific teammate, which of our internal expert agents, each potentially with its own language model, is the best match. One difficulty faced in this approach is the lack of a single numerical metric that accurately captures the performance of a Codenames team. Prior Codenames research has utilized a handful of different metrics to evaluate agent teams. We propose a novel single metric to evaluate the performance of a Codenames team, whether playing a single team (solitaire) game, or a competitive game against another team. We then present and analyze an ensemble agent which selects an internal expert on each turn in order to maximize this proposed metric. Experimental analysis shows that this ensemble approach adapts to individual teammates and often performs nearly as well as the best internal expert with a teammate. Crucially, this success does not depend on any previous knowledge about the teammates, the ensemble agents, or their compatibility.

However, legal documents are often challenging to understand for people without legal backgrounds. In this paper, we present a novel application of large language models (LLMs) in legal education to help non-experts learn intricate legal concepts through storytelling, an effective pedagogical tool in conveying complex and abstract concepts. We also introduce a new dataset LegalStories, which consists of 294 complex legal doctrines, each accompanied by a story and a set of multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs. To construct the dataset, we experiment with various LLMs to generate legal stories explaining these concepts. Furthermore, we use an expert-in-the-loop approach to iteratively design multiple-choice questions. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of storytelling with LLMs through randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with legal novices on 10 samples from the dataset. We find that LLM-generated stories enhance comprehension of legal concepts and interest in law among non-native speakers compared to only definitions. Moreover, stories consistently help participants relate legal concepts to their lives. Finally, we find that learning with stories shows a higher retention rate for non-native speakers in the follow-up assessment. Our work has strong implications for using LLMs in promoting teaching and learning in the legal field and beyond.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17019v4,2024-02
Multi-Task Contrastive Learning for 8192-Token Bilingual Text Embeddings,"Isabelle Mohr, Markus Krimmel, Saba Sturua, Mohammad Kalim Akram, Andreas Koukounas, Michael Günther, Georgios Mastrapas, Vinit Ravishankar, Joan Fontanals Martínez, Feng Wang, Qi Liu, Ziniu Yu, Jie Fu, Saahil Ognawala, Susana Guzman, Bo Wang, Maximilian Werk, Nan Wang, Han Xiao","We introduce a novel suite of state-of-the-art bilingual text embedding models that are designed to support English and another target language. These models are capable of processing lengthy text inputs with up to 8192 tokens, making them highly versatile for a range of natural language processing tasks such as text retrieval, clustering, and semantic textual similarity (STS) calculations.   By focusing on bilingual models and introducing a unique multi-task learning objective, we have significantly improved the model performance on STS tasks, which outperforms the capabilities of existing multilingual models in both target language understanding and cross-lingual evaluation tasks. Moreover, our bilingual models are more efficient, requiring fewer parameters and less memory due to their smaller vocabulary needs. Furthermore, we have expanded the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) to include benchmarks for German and Spanish embedding models. This integration aims to stimulate further research and advancement in text embedding technologies for these languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17016v1,2024-02
Z-AGI Labs at ClimateActivism 2024: Stance and Hate Event Detection on Social Media,"Nikhil Narayan, Mrutyunjay Biswal","In the digital realm, rich data serves as a crucial source of insights into the complexities of social, political, and economic landscapes. Addressing the growing need for high-quality information on events and the imperative to combat hate speech, this research led to the establishment of the Shared Task on Climate Activism Stance and Hate Event Detection at CASE 2024. Focused on climate activists contending with hate speech on social media, our study contributes to hate speech identification from tweets. Analyzing three sub-tasks - Hate Speech Detection (Sub-task A), Targets of Hate Speech Identification (Sub-task B), and Stance Detection (Sub-task C) - Team Z-AGI Labs evaluated various models, including LSTM, Xgboost, and LGBM based on Tf-Idf. Results unveiled intriguing variations, with Catboost excelling in Subtask-B (F1: 0.5604) and Subtask-C (F1: 0.7081), while LGBM emerged as the top-performing model for Subtask-A (F1: 0.8684).

Towards Explainability and Fairness in Swiss Judgement Prediction: Benchmarking on a Multilingual Dataset,"Santosh T. Y. S. S, Nina Baumgartner, Matthias Stürmer, Matthias Grabmair, Joel Niklaus","The assessment of explainability in Legal Judgement Prediction (LJP) systems is of paramount importance in building trustworthy and transparent systems, particularly considering the reliance of these systems on factors that may lack legal relevance or involve sensitive attributes. This study delves into the realm of explainability and fairness in LJP models, utilizing Swiss Judgement Prediction (SJP), the only available multilingual LJP dataset. We curate a comprehensive collection of rationales that `support' and `oppose' judgement from legal experts for 108 cases in German, French, and Italian. By employing an occlusion-based explainability approach, we evaluate the explainability performance of state-of-the-art monolingual and multilingual BERT-based LJP models, as well as models developed with techniques such as data augmentation and cross-lingual transfer, which demonstrated prediction performance improvement. Notably, our findings reveal that improved prediction performance does not necessarily correspond to enhanced explainability performance, underscoring the significance of evaluating models from an explainability perspective. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation framework, Lower Court Insertion (LCI), which allows us to quantify the influence of lower court information on model predictions, exposing current models' biases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17013v1,2024-02
DiffuCOMET: Contextual Commonsense Knowledge Diffusion,"Silin Gao, Mete Ismayilzada, Mengjie Zhao, Hiromi Wakaki, Yuki Mitsufuji, Antoine Bosselut","Inferring contextually-relevant and diverse commonsense to understand narratives remains challenging for knowledge models. In this work, we develop a series of knowledge models, DiffuCOMET, that leverage diffusion to learn to reconstruct the implicit semantic connections between narrative contexts and relevant commonsense knowledge. Across multiple diffusion steps, our method progressively refines a representation of commonsense facts that is anchored to a narrative, producing contextually-relevant and diverse commonsense inferences for an input context. To evaluate DiffuCOMET, we introduce new metrics for commonsense inference that more closely measure knowledge diversity and contextual relevance. Our results on two different benchmarks, ComFact and WebNLG+, show that knowledge generated by DiffuCOMET achieves a better trade-off between commonsense diversity, contextual relevance and alignment to known gold references, compared to baseline knowledge models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17011v2,2024-02
Generative Retrieval with Large Language Models,"Ye Wang, Xinrun Xu, Rui Xie, Wenxin Hu, Wei Ye","When completing knowledge-intensive tasks, humans sometimes need not just an answer but also a corresponding reference passage for auxiliary reading. Previous methods required obtaining pre-segmented article chunks through additional retrieval models. This paper explores leveraging the parameterized knowledge stored during the pre-training phase of large language models (LLMs) to independently recall reference passage from any starting position. We propose a two-stage framework that simulates the scenario of humans recalling easily forgotten references. Initially, the LLM is prompted to recall document title identifiers to obtain a coarse-grained document set. Then, based on the acquired coarse-grained document set, it recalls fine-grained passage. In the two-stage recall process, we use constrained decoding to ensure that content outside of the stored documents is not generated. To increase speed, we only recall a short prefix in the second stage, then locate its position to retrieve a complete passage. Experiments on KILT knowledge-sensitive tasks have verified that LLMs can independently recall reference passage location in various task forms, and the obtained reference significantly assist downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17010v2,2024-02
Benchmarking LLMs on the Semantic Overlap Summarization Task,"John Salvador, Naman Bansal, Mousumi Akter, Souvika Sarkar, Anupam Das, Shubhra Kanti Karmaker","Semantic Overlap Summarization (SOS) is a constrained multi-document summarization task, where the constraint is to capture the common/overlapping information between two alternative narratives. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved superior performance in numerous summarization tasks, a benchmarking study of the SOS task using LLMs is yet to be performed. As LLMs' responses are sensitive to slight variations in prompt design, a major challenge in conducting such a benchmarking study is to systematically explore a variety of prompts before drawing a reliable conclusion. Fortunately, very recently, the TELeR taxonomy has been proposed which can be used to design and explore various prompts for LLMs. Using this TELeR taxonomy and 15 popular LLMs, this paper comprehensively evaluates LLMs on the SOS Task, assessing their ability to summarize overlapping information from multiple alternative narratives. For evaluation, we report well-established metrics like ROUGE, BERTscore, and SEM-F1$ on two different datasets of alternative narratives. We conclude the paper by analyzing the strengths and limitations of various LLMs in terms of their capabilities in capturing overlapping information The code and datasets used to conduct this study are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/llm_eval-E16D.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17008v1,2024-02
What Do Language Models Hear? Probing for Auditory Representations in Language Models,"Jerry Ngo, Yoon Kim","This work explores whether language models encode meaningfully grounded representations of sounds of objects. We learn a linear probe that retrieves the correct text representation of an object given a snippet of audio related to that object, where the sound representation is given by a pretrained audio model. This probe is trained via a contrastive loss that pushes the language representations and sound representations of an object to be close to one another. After training, the probe is tested on its ability to generalize to objects that were not seen during training. Across different language models and audio models, we find that the probe generalization is above chance in many cases, indicating that despite being trained only on raw text, language models encode grounded knowledge of sounds for some objects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16998v2,2024-02

This task presents unique challenges in capturing the key points, context, and nuances of multi-turn long conversations for summarization. It is worth noting that the summarization techniques may vary based on specific requirements such as in a shopping-chatbot scenario, the dialog summary helps to learn user preferences, whereas in the case of a customer call center, the summary may involve the problem attributes that a user specified, and the final resolution provided. This work emphasizes the significance of creating coherent and contextually rich summaries for effective communication in various applications. We explore current state-of-the-art approaches for long dialog summarization in different domains and benchmark metrics based evaluations show that one single model does not perform well across various areas for distinct summarization tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16986v1,2024-02
Dealing with Data for RE: Mitigating Challenges while using NLP and Generative AI,"Smita Ghaisas, Anmol Singhal","Across the dynamic business landscape today, enterprises face an ever-increasing range of challenges. These include the constantly evolving regulatory environment, the growing demand for personalization within software applications, and the heightened emphasis on governance. In response to these multifaceted demands, large enterprises have been adopting automation that spans from the optimization of core business processes to the enhancement of customer experiences. Indeed, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal element of modern software systems. In this context, data plays an indispensable role. AI-centric software systems based on supervised learning and operating at an industrial scale require large volumes of training data to perform effectively. Moreover, the incorporation of generative AI has led to a growing demand for adequate evaluation benchmarks. Our experience in this field has revealed that the requirement for large datasets for training and evaluation introduces a host of intricate challenges. This book chapter explores the evolving landscape of Software Engineering (SE) in general, and Requirements Engineering (RE) in particular, in this era marked by AI integration. We discuss challenges that arise while integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative AI into enterprise-critical software systems. The chapter provides practical insights, solutions, and examples to equip readers with the knowledge and tools necessary for effectively building solutions with NLP at their cores. We also reflect on how these text data-centric tasks sit together with the traditional RE process. We also highlight new RE tasks that may be necessary for handling the increasingly important text data-centricity involved in developing software systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16977v2,2024-02
Successfully Guiding Humans with Imperfect Instructions by Highlighting Potential Errors and Suggesting Corrections,"Lingjun Zhao, Khanh Nguyen, Hal Daumé III","Language models will inevitably err in situations with which they are unfamiliar. However, by effectively communicating uncertainties, they can still guide humans toward making sound decisions in those contexts. We demonstrate this idea by developing HEAR, a system that can successfully guide humans in simulated residential environments despite generating potentially inaccurate instructions. Diverging from systems that provide users with only the instructions they generate, HEAR warns users of potential errors in its instructions and suggests corrections. This rich uncertainty information effectively prevents misguidance and reduces the search space for users. Evaluation with 80 users shows that HEAR achieves a 13% increase in success rate and a 29% reduction in final location error distance compared to only presenting instructions to users. Interestingly, we find that offering users possibilities to explore, HEAR motivates them to make more attempts at the task, ultimately leading to a higher success rate. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to show the practical benefits of uncertainty communication in a long-horizon sequential decision-making problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16973v2,2024-02
GROUNDHOG: Grounding Large Language Models to Holistic Segmentation,"Yichi Zhang, Ziqiao Ma, Xiaofeng Gao, Suhaila Shakiah, Qiaozi Gao, Joyce Chai","Most multimodal large language models (MLLMs) learn language-to-object grounding through causal language modeling where grounded objects are captured by bounding boxes as sequences of location tokens. This paradigm lacks pixel-level representations that are important for fine-grained visual understanding and diagnosis. In this work, we introduce GROUNDHOG, an MLLM developed by grounding Large Language Models to holistic segmentation. GROUNDHOG incorporates a masked feature extractor and converts extracted features into visual entity tokens for the MLLM backbone, which then connects groundable phrases to unified grounding masks by retrieving and merging the entity masks. To train GROUNDHOG, we carefully curated M3G2, a grounded visual instruction tuning dataset with Multi-Modal Multi-Grained Grounding, by harvesting a collection of segmentation-grounded datasets with rich annotations. Our experimental results show that GROUNDHOG achieves superior performance on various language grounding tasks without task-specific fine-tuning, and significantly reduces object hallucination. GROUNDHOG also demonstrates better grounding towards complex forms of visual input and provides easy-to-understand diagnosis in failure cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16846v2,2024-02
"Think Big, Generate Quick: LLM-to-SLM for Fast Autoregressive Decoding","Benjamin Bergner, Andrii Skliar, Amelie Royer, Tijmen Blankevoort, Yuki Asano, Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi","Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in practice and are widely used for generation tasks such as translation, summarization and instruction following. However, their enormous size and reliance on autoregressive decoding increase deployment costs and complicate their use in latency-critical applications. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines language models of different sizes to increase the efficiency of autoregressive decoding while maintaining high performance. Our method utilizes a pretrained frozen LLM that encodes all prompt tokens once in parallel, and uses the resulting representations to condition and guide a small language model (SLM), which then generates the response more efficiently. We investigate the combination of encoder-decoder LLMs with both encoder-decoder and decoder-only SLMs from different model families and only require fine-tuning of the SLM. Experiments with various benchmarks show substantial speedups of up to $4\times$, with minor performance penalties of $1-2\%$ for translation and summarization tasks compared to the LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16844v3,2024-02
Multi-LoRA Composition for Image Generation,"Ming Zhong, Yelong Shen, Shuohang Wang, Yadong Lu, Yizhu Jiao, Siru Ouyang, Donghan Yu, Jiawei Han, Weizhu Chen","Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is extensively utilized in text-to-image models for the accurate rendition of specific elements like distinct characters or unique styles in generated images. Nonetheless, existing methods face challenges in effectively composing multiple LoRAs, especially as the number of LoRAs to be integrated grows, thus hindering the creation of complex imagery. In this paper, we study multi-LoRA composition through a decoding-centric perspective. We present two training-free methods: LoRA Switch, which alternates between different LoRAs at each denoising step, and LoRA Composite, which simultaneously incorporates all LoRAs to guide more cohesive image synthesis. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we establish ComposLoRA, a new comprehensive testbed as part of this research. It features a diverse range of LoRA categories with 480 composition sets. Utilizing an evaluation framework based on GPT-4V, our findings demonstrate a clear improvement in performance with our methods over the prevalent baseline, particularly evident when increasing the number of LoRAs in a composition.

MobiLlama: Towards Accurate and Lightweight Fully Transparent GPT,"Omkar Thawakar, Ashmal Vayani, Salman Khan, Hisham Cholakal, Rao M. Anwer, Michael Felsberg, Tim Baldwin, Eric P. Xing, Fahad Shahbaz Khan","""Bigger the better"" has been the predominant trend in recent Large Language Models (LLMs) development. However, LLMs do not suit well for scenarios that require on-device processing, energy efficiency, low memory footprint, and response efficiency. These requisites are crucial for privacy, security, and sustainable deployment. This paper explores the ""less is more"" paradigm by addressing the challenge of designing accurate yet efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) for resource constrained devices. Our primary contribution is the introduction of an accurate and fully transparent open-source 0.5 billion (0.5B) parameter SLM, named MobiLlama, catering to the specific needs of resource-constrained computing with an emphasis on enhanced performance with reduced resource demands. MobiLlama is a SLM design that initiates from a larger model and applies a careful parameter sharing scheme to reduce both the pre-training and the deployment cost.

Do Large Language Models Latently Perform Multi-Hop Reasoning?,"Sohee Yang, Elena Gribovskaya, Nora Kassner, Mor Geva, Sebastian Riedel","We study whether Large Language Models (LLMs) latently perform multi-hop reasoning with complex prompts such as ""The mother of the singer of 'Superstition' is"". We look for evidence of a latent reasoning pathway where an LLM (1) latently identifies ""the singer of 'Superstition'"" as Stevie Wonder, the bridge entity, and (2) uses its knowledge of Stevie Wonder's mother to complete the prompt. We analyze these two hops individually and consider their co-occurrence as indicative of latent multi-hop reasoning. For the first hop, we test if changing the prompt to indirectly mention the bridge entity instead of any other entity increases the LLM's internal recall of the bridge entity. For the second hop, we test if increasing this recall causes the LLM to better utilize what it knows about the bridge entity. We find strong evidence of latent multi-hop reasoning for the prompts of certain relation types, with the reasoning pathway used in more than 80% of the prompts. However, the utilization is highly contextual, varying across different types of prompts. Also, on average, the evidence for the second hop and the full multi-hop traversal is rather moderate and only substantial for the first hop. Moreover, we find a clear scaling trend with increasing model size for the first hop of reasoning but not for the second hop. Our experimental findings suggest potential challenges and opportunities for future development and applications of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16837v1,2024-02
PhyGrasp: Generalizing Robotic Grasping with Physics-informed Large Multimodal Models,"Dingkun Guo, Yuqi Xiang, Shuqi Zhao, Xinghao Zhu, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Mingyu Ding, Wei Zhan","Robotic grasping is a fundamental aspect of robot functionality, defining how robots interact with objects. Despite substantial progress, its generalizability to counter-intuitive or long-tailed scenarios, such as objects with uncommon materials or shapes, remains a challenge. In contrast, humans can easily apply their intuitive physics to grasp skillfully and change grasps efficiently, even for objects they have never seen before.   This work delves into infusing such physical commonsense reasoning into robotic manipulation. We introduce PhyGrasp, a multimodal large model that leverages inputs from two modalities: natural language and 3D point clouds, seamlessly integrated through a bridge module. The language modality exhibits robust reasoning capabilities concerning the impacts of diverse physical properties on grasping, while the 3D modality comprehends object shapes and parts. With these two capabilities, PhyGrasp is able to accurately assess the physical properties of object parts and determine optimal grasping poses. Additionally, the model's language comprehension enables human instruction interpretation, generating grasping poses that align with human preferences. To train PhyGrasp, we construct a dataset PhyPartNet with 195K object instances with varying physical properties and human preferences, alongside their corresponding language descriptions. Extensive experiments conducted in the simulation and on the real robots demonstrate that PhyGrasp achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in long-tailed cases, e.g., about 10% improvement in success rate over GraspNet.

Eight Methods to Evaluate Robust Unlearning in LLMs,"Aengus Lynch, Phillip Guo, Aidan Ewart, Stephen Casper, Dylan Hadfield-Menell","Machine unlearning can be useful for removing harmful capabilities and memorized text from large language models (LLMs), but there are not yet standardized methods for rigorously evaluating it. In this paper, we first survey techniques and limitations of existing unlearning evaluations. Second, we apply a comprehensive set of tests for the robustness and competitiveness of unlearning in the ""Who's Harry Potter"" (WHP) model from Eldan and Russinovich (2023). While WHP's unlearning generalizes well when evaluated with the ""Familiarity"" metric from Eldan and Russinovich, we find i) higher-than-baseline amounts of knowledge can reliably be extracted, ii) WHP performs on par with the original model on Harry Potter Q&A tasks, iii) it represents latent knowledge comparably to the original model, and iv) there is collateral unlearning in related domains.

Cross-Modal Projection in Multimodal LLMs Doesn't Really Project Visual Attributes to Textual Space,"Gaurav Verma, Minje Choi, Kartik Sharma, Jamelle Watson-Daniels, Sejoon Oh, Srijan Kumar","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) like LLaVA and GPT-4(V) enable general-purpose conversations about images with the language modality. As off-the-shelf MLLMs may have limited capabilities on images from domains like dermatology and agriculture, they must be fine-tuned to unlock domain-specific applications. The prevalent architecture of current open-source MLLMs comprises two major modules: an image-language (cross-modal) projection network and a large language model. It is desirable to understand the roles of these two modules in modeling domain-specific visual attributes to inform the design of future models and streamline the interpretability efforts on the current models. To this end, via experiments on 4 datasets and under 2 fine-tuning settings, we find that as the MLLM is fine-tuned, it indeed gains domain-specific visual capabilities, but the updates do not lead to the projection extracting relevant domain-specific visual attributes. Our results indicate that the domain-specific visual attributes are modeled by the LLM, even when only the projection is fine-tuned. Through this study, we offer a potential reinterpretation of the role of cross-modal projections in MLLM architectures.

In this paper, we contribute to this research domain by introducing SKILL, a novel method that conducts distillation across groups of layers instead of distilling individual arbitrarily selected layers within the teacher network. The identification of the layers to distill is achieved through a hierarchical clustering procedure applied to layer similarity measures.

GISTEmbed: Guided In-sample Selection of Training Negatives for Text Embedding Fine-tuning,Aivin V. Solatorio,"Embedding models are integral to AI applications like semantic search, personalized recommendations, and retrieval augmented generation for LLMs, necessitating high-quality training data. However, the limited scalability of manual data curation prompts the need for automated methods to ensure data integrity. Traditional unsupervised triplet mining automates training data generation, crucial for embedding model training, yet inadvertently injects biases and noise, thereby degrading model performance. Addressing this, we introduce GISTEmbed, a novel strategy that enhances in-batch negative selection during contrastive training through a guide model. This approach departs from reliance on random sampling and equal utility assumption of batch negatives, significantly reducing noise from data quality issues and improving model fine-tuning. Benchmarked against the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), GISTEmbed showcases consistent performance improvements across various model sizes and achieves state-of-the-art results in select categories. This framework enables significant enhancements for smaller models by leveraging the capabilities of powerful yet resource-intensive large models.

Making these technologies more accessible and cost-effective, especially for applications constrained by resources, significantly expands the impact and accessibility of state-of-the-art AI solutions across diverse sectors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16829v1,2024-02
A Survey on Data Selection for Language Models,"Alon Albalak, Yanai Elazar, Sang Michael Xie, Shayne Longpre, Nathan Lambert, Xinyi Wang, Niklas Muennighoff, Bairu Hou, Liangming Pan, Haewon Jeong, Colin Raffel, Shiyu Chang, Tatsunori Hashimoto, William Yang Wang","A major factor in the recent success of large language models is the use of enormous and ever-growing text datasets for unsupervised pre-training. However, naively training a model on all available data may not be optimal (or feasible), as the quality of available text data can vary. Filtering out data can also decrease the carbon footprint and financial costs of training models by reducing the amount of training required. Data selection methods aim to determine which candidate data points to include in the training dataset and how to appropriately sample from the selected data points. The promise of improved data selection methods has caused the volume of research in the area to rapidly expand. However, because deep learning is mostly driven by empirical evidence and experimentation on large-scale data is expensive, few organizations have the resources for extensive data selection research. Consequently, knowledge of effective data selection practices has become concentrated within a few organizations, many of which do not openly share their findings and methodologies. To narrow this gap in knowledge, we present a comprehensive review of existing literature on data selection methods and related research areas, providing a taxonomy of existing approaches. By describing the current landscape of research, this work aims to accelerate progress in data selection by establishing an entry point for new and established researchers.

Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. Focusing on the safety domain, we use Rainbow Teaming to target various state-of-the-art LLMs, including the Llama 2 and Llama 3 models. Our approach reveals hundreds of effective adversarial prompts, with an attack success rate exceeding 90% across all tested models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prompts generated by Rainbow Teaming are highly transferable and that fine-tuning models with synthetic data generated by our method significantly enhances their safety without sacrificing general performance or helpfulness.

Investigating the Effectiveness of HyperTuning via Gisting,Jason Phang,"Gisting (Mu et al., 2023) is a simple method for training models to compress information into fewer token representations using a modified attention mask, and can serve as an economical approach to training Transformer-based hypernetworks. We introduce HyperLlama, a set of Gisting-based hypernetworks built on Llama-2 models that generates task-specific soft prefixes based on few-shot inputs. In experiments across P3, Super-NaturalInstructions and Symbol Tuning datasets, we show that HyperLlama models can effectively compress information from few-shot examples into soft prefixes. However, they still underperform multi-task fine-tuned language models with full attention over few-shot in-context examples. We also show that HyperLlama-generated soft prefixes can serve as better initializations for further prefix tuning. Overall, Gisting-based hypernetworks are economical and easy to implement, but have mixed empirical performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16817v1,2024-02
A Surprising Failure? Multimodal LLMs and the NLVR Challenge,"Anne Wu, Kianté Brantley, Yoav Artzi","This study evaluates three state-of-the-art MLLMs -- GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and the open-source model IDEFICS -- on the compositional natural language vision reasoning task NLVR. Given a human-written sentence paired with a synthetic image, this task requires the model to determine the truth value of the sentence with respect to the image. Despite the strong performance demonstrated by these models, we observe they perform poorly on NLVR, which was constructed to require compositional and spatial reasoning, and to be robust for semantic and systematic biases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17793v1,2024-02
OncoGPT: A Medical Conversational Model Tailored with Oncology Domain Expertise on a Large Language Model Meta-AI (LLaMA),"Fujian Jia, Xin Liu, Lixi Deng, Jiwen Gu, Chunchao Pu, Tunan Bai, Mengjiang Huang, Yuanzhi Lu, Kang Liu","In the past year, there has been a growing trend in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to the field of medicine, particularly with the advent of advanced language models such as ChatGPT developed by OpenAI. However, there is limited research on LLMs specifically addressing oncology-related queries. The primary aim of this research was to develop a specialized language model that demonstrates improved accuracy in providing advice related to oncology. We performed an extensive data collection of online question-answer interactions centered around oncology, sourced from reputable doctor-patient platforms. Following data cleaning and anonymization, a dataset comprising over 180K+ oncology-related conversations was established. The conversations were categorized and meticulously reviewed by field specialists and clinicians to ensure precision. Employing the LLaMA model and other selected open-source datasets, we conducted iterative fine-tuning to enhance the model's proficiency in basic medical conversation and specialized oncology knowledge. We observed a substantial enhancement in the model's understanding of genuine patient inquiries and its reliability in offering oncology-related advice through the utilization of real online question-answer interactions in the fine-tuning process. We release database and models to the research community (https://github.com/OncoGPT1).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16810v1,2024-02
Set the Clock: Temporal Alignment of Pretrained Language Models,"Bowen Zhao, Zander Brumbaugh, Yizhong Wang, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Noah A. Smith","Language models (LMs) are trained on web text originating from many points in time and, in general, without any explicit temporal grounding. This work investigates the temporal chaos of pretrained LMs and explores various methods to align their internal knowledge to a target time, which we call ""temporal alignment."" To do this, we first automatically construct a dataset containing 20K time-sensitive questions and their answers for each year from 2000 to 2023. Based on this dataset, we empirically show that pretrained LMs (e.g., LLaMa2), despite having a recent pretraining cutoff (e.g., 2022), mostly answer questions using earlier knowledge (e.g., in 2019). We then develop several methods, from prompting to finetuning, to align LMs to use their most recent knowledge when answering questions, and investigate various factors in this alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that aligning LLaMa2 to the year 2022 can enhance its performance by up to 62% according to that year's answers. This improvement occurs even without explicitly mentioning time information, indicating the possibility of aligning models' internal sense of time after pretraining. Finally, we find that alignment to a historical time is also possible, with up to 2.8$\times$ the performance of the unaligned LM in 2010 if finetuning models to that year. These findings hint at the sophistication of LMs' internal knowledge organization and the necessity of tuning them properly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16797v2,2024-02
"If in a Crowdsourced Data Annotation Pipeline, a GPT-4","Zeyu He, Chieh-Yang Huang, Chien-Kuang Cornelia Ding, Shaurya Rohatgi, Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang","Recent studies indicated GPT-4 outperforms online crowd workers in data labeling accuracy, notably workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). However, these studies were criticized for deviating from standard crowdsourcing practices and emphasizing individual workers' performances over the whole data-annotation process. This paper compared GPT-4 and an ethical and well-executed MTurk pipeline, with 415 workers labeling 3,177 sentence segments from 200 scholarly articles using the CODA-19 scheme. Two worker interfaces yielded 127,080 labels, which were then used to infer the final labels through eight label-aggregation algorithms. Our evaluation showed that despite best practices, MTurk pipeline's highest accuracy was 81.5%, whereas GPT-4 achieved 83.6%. Interestingly, when combining GPT-4's labels with crowd labels collected via an advanced worker interface for aggregation, 2 out of the 8 algorithms achieved an even higher accuracy (87.5%, 87.0%). Further analysis suggested that, when the crowd's and GPT-4's labeling strengths are complementary, aggregating them could increase labeling accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16795v2,2024-02
Political Compass or Spinning Arrow? Towards More Meaningful Evaluations for Values and Opinions in Large Language Models,"Paul Röttger, Valentin Hofmann, Valentina Pyatkin, Musashi Hinck, Hannah Rose Kirk, Hinrich Schütze, Dirk Hovy","Much recent work seeks to evaluate values and opinions in large language models (LLMs) using multiple-choice surveys and questionnaires. Most of this work is motivated by concerns around real-world LLM applications. For example, politically-biased LLMs may subtly influence society when they are used by millions of people. Such real-world concerns, however, stand in stark contrast to the artificiality of current evaluations: real users do not typically ask LLMs survey questions. Motivated by this discrepancy, we challenge the prevailing constrained evaluation paradigm for values and opinions in LLMs and explore more realistic unconstrained evaluations. As a case study, we focus on the popular Political Compass Test (PCT). In a systematic review, we find that most prior work using the PCT forces models to comply with the PCT's multiple-choice format. We show that models give substantively different answers when not forced; that answers change depending on how models are forced; and that answers lack paraphrase robustness. Then, we demonstrate that models give different answers yet again in a more realistic open-ended answer setting. We distill these findings into recommendations and open challenges in evaluating values and opinions in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16786v2,2024-02
A Comprehensive Evaluation of Quantization Strategies for Large Language Models,"Renren Jin, Jiangcun Du, Wuwei Huang, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Deyi Xiong","Increasing the number of parameters in large language models (LLMs) usually improves performance in downstream tasks but raises compute and memory costs, making deployment difficult in resource-limited settings. Quantization techniques, which reduce the bits needed for model weights or activations with minimal performance loss, have become popular due to the rise of LLMs. However, most quantization studies use pre-trained LLMs, and the impact of quantization on instruction-tuned LLMs and the relationship between perplexity and benchmark performance of quantized LLMs are not well understood. Evaluation of quantized LLMs is often limited to language modeling and a few classification tasks, leaving their performance on other benchmarks unclear. To address these gaps, we propose a structured evaluation framework consisting of three critical dimensions: (1) knowledge \& capacity, (2) alignment, and (3) efficiency, and conduct extensive experiments across ten diverse benchmarks. Our experimental results indicate that LLMs with 4-bit quantization can retain performance comparable to their non-quantized counterparts, and perplexity can serve as a proxy metric for quantized LLMs on most benchmarks. Furthermore, quantized LLMs with larger parameter scales can outperform smaller LLMs. Despite the memory savings achieved through quantization, it can also slow down the inference speed of LLMs. Consequently, substantial engineering efforts and hardware support are imperative to achieve a balanced optimization of decoding speed and memory consumption in the context of quantized LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16775v2,2024-02
CorpusBrain++: A Continual Generative Pre-Training Framework for Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks,"Jiafeng Guo, Changjiang Zhou, Ruqing Zhang, Jiangui Chen, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng","Knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILTs) typically require retrieving relevant documents from trustworthy corpora, e.g., Wikipedia, to produce specific answers. Very recently, a pre-trained generative retrieval model for KILTs, named CorpusBrain, was proposed and reached new state-of-the-art retrieval performance. However, most existing research on KILTs, including CorpusBrain, has predominantly focused on a static document collection, overlooking the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where new documents are continuously being incorporated into the source corpus. To address this gap, it is crucial to explore the capability of retrieval models to effectively handle the dynamic retrieval scenario inherent in KILTs.   In this work, we first introduce the continual document learning (CDL) task for KILTs and build a novel benchmark dataset named KILT++ based on the original KILT dataset for evaluation. Then, we conduct a comprehensive study over the use of pre-trained CorpusBrain on KILT++. Unlike the promising results in the stationary scenario, CorpusBrain is prone to catastrophic forgetting in the dynamic scenario, hence hampering the retrieval performance. To alleviate this issue, we propose CorpusBrain++, a continual generative pre-training framework. Empirical results demonstrate the significant effectiveness and remarkable efficiency of CorpusBrain++ in comparison to both traditional and generative IR methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16767v1,2024-02
Value Preferences Estimation and Disambiguation in Hybrid Participatory Systems,"Enrico Liscio, Luciano C. Siebert, Catholijn M. Jonker, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah","Understanding citizens' values in participatory systems is crucial for citizen-centric policy-making. We envision a hybrid participatory system where participants make choices and provide motivations for those choices, and AI agents estimate their value preferences by interacting with them. We focus on situations where a conflict is detected between participants' choices and motivations, and propose methods for estimating value preferences while addressing detected inconsistencies by interacting with the participants. We operationalize the philosophical stance that ``valuing is deliberatively consequential."" That is, if a participant's choice is based on a deliberation of value preferences, the value preferences can be observed in the motivation the participant provides for the choice. Thus, we propose and compare value preferences estimation methods that prioritize the values estimated from motivations over the values estimated from choices alone. Then, we introduce a disambiguation strategy that combines Natural Language Processing and Active Learning to address the detected inconsistencies between choices and motivations. We evaluate the proposed methods on a dataset of a large-scale survey on energy transition. The results show that explicitly addressing inconsistencies between choices and motivations improves the estimation of an individual's value preferences. The disambiguation strategy does not show substantial improvements when compared to similar baselines -- however, we discuss how the novelty of the approach can open new research avenues and propose improvements to address the current limitations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16751v2,2024-02
CodeChameleon: Personalized Encryption Framework for Jailbreaking Large Language Models,"Huijie Lv, Xiao Wang, Yuansen Zhang, Caishuang Huang, Shihan Dou, Junjie Ye, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","Adversarial misuse, particularly through `jailbreaking' that circumvents a model's safety and ethical protocols, poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper delves into the mechanisms behind such successful attacks, introducing a hypothesis for the safety mechanism of aligned LLMs: intent security recognition followed by response generation. Grounded in this hypothesis, we propose CodeChameleon, a novel jailbreak framework based on personalized encryption tactics. To elude the intent security recognition phase, we reformulate tasks into a code completion format, enabling users to encrypt queries using personalized encryption functions. To guarantee response generation functionality, we embed a decryption function within the instructions, which allows the LLM to decrypt and execute the encrypted queries successfully. We conduct extensive experiments on 7 LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art average Attack Success Rate (ASR). Remarkably, our method achieves an 86.6\% ASR on GPT-4-1106.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16717v1,2024-02
Quantum linear algebra is all you need for Transformer architectures,"Naixu Guo, Zhan Yu, Matthew Choi, Aman Agrawal, Kouhei Nakaji, Alán Aspuru-Guzik, Patrick Rebentrost","Generative machine learning methods such as large-language models are revolutionizing the creation of text and images. While these models are powerful they also harness a large amount of computational resources. The transformer is a key component in large language models that aims to generate a suitable completion of a given partial sequence. In this work, we investigate transformer architectures under the lens of fault-tolerant quantum computing. The input model is one where trained weight matrices are given as block encodings and we construct the query, key, and value matrices for the transformer. We show how to prepare a block encoding of the self-attention matrix, with a new subroutine for the row-wise application of the softmax function. In addition, we combine quantum subroutines to construct important building blocks in the transformer, the residual connection and layer normalization, and the feed-forward neural network. Our subroutines prepare an amplitude encoding of the transformer output, which can be measured to obtain a prediction. Based on common open-source large-language models, we provide insights into the behavior of important parameters determining the run time of the quantum algorithm. We discuss the potential and challenges for obtaining a quantum advantage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16714v2,2024-02
SelectIT: Selective Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models via Uncertainty-Aware Self-Reflection,"Liangxin Liu, Xuebo Liu, Derek F. Wong, Dongfang Li, Ziyi Wang, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang","Instruction tuning (IT) is crucial to tailoring large language models (LLMs) towards human-centric interactions. Recent advancements have shown that the careful selection of a small, high-quality subset of IT data can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs. Despite this, common approaches often rely on additional models or data sets, which increases costs and limits widespread adoption. In this work, we propose a novel approach, termed SelectIT, that capitalizes on the foundational capabilities of the LLM itself. Specifically, we exploit the intrinsic uncertainty present in LLMs to more effectively select high-quality IT data, without the need for extra resources. Furthermore, we introduce a novel IT dataset, the Selective Alpaca, created by applying SelectIT to the Alpaca-GPT4 dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that IT using Selective Alpaca leads to substantial model ability enhancement. The robustness of SelectIT has also been corroborated in various foundation models and domain-specific tasks. Our findings suggest that longer and more computationally intensive IT data may serve as superior sources of IT, offering valuable insights for future research in this area.

Social Media as a Sensor: Analyzing Twitter Data for Breast Cancer Medication Effects Using Natural Language Processing,"Seibi Kobara, Alireza Rafiei, Masoud Nateghi, Selen Bozkurt, Rishikesan Kamaleswaran, Abeed Sarker","Breast cancer is a significant public health concern and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Despite advances in breast cancer treatments, medication non-adherence remains a major problem. As electronic health records do not typically capture patient-reported outcomes that may reveal information about medication-related experiences, social media presents an attractive resource for enhancing our understanding of the patients' treatment experiences. In this paper, we developed natural language processing (NLP) based methodologies to study information posted by an automatically curated breast cancer cohort from social media. We employed a transformer-based classifier to identify breast cancer patients/survivors on X (Twitter) based on their self-reported information, and we collected longitudinal data from their profiles. We then designed a multi-layer rule-based model to develop a breast cancer therapy-associated side effect lexicon and detect patterns of medication usage and associated side effects among breast cancer patients. 1,454,637 posts were available from 583,962 unique users, of which 62,042 were detected as breast cancer members using our transformer-based model. 198 cohort members mentioned breast cancer medications with tamoxifen as the most common. Our side effect lexicon identified well-known side effects of hormone and chemotherapy. Furthermore, it discovered a subject feeling towards cancer and medications, which may suggest a pre-clinical phase of side effects or emotional distress. This analysis highlighted not only the utility of NLP techniques in unstructured social media data to identify self-reported breast cancer posts, medication usage patterns, and treatment side effects but also the richness of social data on such clinical questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00821v1,2024-02
Generating Effective Ensembles for Sentiment Analysis,"Itay Etelis, Avi Rosenfeld, Abraham Itzhak Weinberg, David Sarne","In recent years, transformer models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving exceptional results across various tasks, including Sentiment Analysis (SA). As such, current state-of-the-art approaches for SA predominantly rely on transformer models alone, achieving impressive accuracy levels on benchmark datasets. In this paper, we show that the key for further improving the accuracy of such ensembles for SA is to include not only transformers, but also traditional NLP models, despite the inferiority of the latter compared to transformer models. However, as we empirically show, this necessitates a change in how the ensemble is constructed, specifically relying on the Hierarchical Ensemble Construction (HEC) algorithm we present. Our empirical studies across eight canonical SA datasets reveal that ensembles incorporating a mix of model types, structured via HEC, significantly outperform traditional ensembles. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis of the performance of the HEC and GPT-4, demonstrating that while GPT-4 closely approaches state-of-the-art SA methods, it remains outperformed by our proposed ensemble strategy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16700v1,2024-02
Look Before You Leap: Towards Decision-Aware and Generalizable Tool-Usage for Large Language Models,"Anchun Gui, Jian Li, Yong Dai, Nan Du, Han Xiao","Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are attracting widespread attention when accessing up-to-date knowledge and alleviating hallucination issues. Nowadays, advanced closed-source LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) have demonstrated surprising tool-usage capabilities through prompting and in-context learning techniques. To empower the capabilities of open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA) in manipulating tools, current efforts focus on either template-driven or token-triggered tool-usage. However, the former hampers LLMs' flexibility to address diverse user's queries due to constrained tool interactions, while the latter limits the generalizability when engaging with new tools, since tool-usage learning is based on task- and tool-specific datasets. To alleviate these concerns, in this paper, we propose a decision-aware and generalizable tool-usage framework (DEER). Specifically, we first construct the tool-usage samples with multiple decision branches via an automatic generation pipeline, thereby inspiring the decision-making awareness of LLMs under diverse scenarios. Meanwhile, we propose a novel tool sampling strategy to enhance the generalizability of LLMs over unseen tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DEER is effective and significantly outperforms baselines across various datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16696v3,2024-02
HumanEval-XL: A Multilingual Code Generation Benchmark for Cross-lingual Natural Language Generalization,"Qiwei Peng, Yekun Chai, Xuhong Li","Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in generating codes from textual prompts. However, existing benchmarks have mainly concentrated on translating English prompts to multilingual codes or have been constrained to very limited natural languages (NLs). These benchmarks have overlooked the vast landscape of massively multilingual NL to multilingual code, leaving a critical gap in the evaluation of multilingual LLMs. In response, we introduce HumanEval-XL, a massively multilingual code generation benchmark specifically crafted to address this deficiency. HumanEval-XL establishes connections between 23 NLs and 12 programming languages (PLs), and comprises of a collection of 22,080 prompts with an average of 8.33 test cases. By ensuring parallel data across multiple NLs and PLs, HumanEval-XL offers a comprehensive evaluation platform for multilingual LLMs, allowing the assessment of the understanding of different NLs.

Adaptation of Biomedical and Clinical Pretrained Models to French Long Documents: A Comparative Study,"Adrien Bazoge, Emmanuel Morin, Beatrice Daille, Pierre-Antoine Gourraud","Recently, pretrained language models based on BERT have been introduced for the French biomedical domain. Although these models have achieved state-of-the-art results on biomedical and clinical NLP tasks, they are constrained by a limited input sequence length of 512 tokens, which poses challenges when applied to clinical notes. In this paper, we present a comparative study of three adaptation strategies for long-sequence models, leveraging the Longformer architecture. We conducted evaluations of these models on 16 downstream tasks spanning both biomedical and clinical domains. Our findings reveal that further pre-training an English clinical model with French biomedical texts can outperform both converting a French biomedical BERT to the Longformer architecture and pre-training a French biomedical Longformer from scratch. The results underscore that long-sequence French biomedical models improve performance across most downstream tasks regardless of sequence length, but BERT based models remain the most efficient for named entity recognition tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16689v1,2024-02
StructLM: Towards Building Generalist Models for Structured Knowledge Grounding,"Alex Zhuang, Ge Zhang, Tianyu Zheng, Xinrun Du, Junjie Wang, Weiming Ren, Stephen W. Huang, Jie Fu, Xiang Yue, Wenhu Chen","Structured data sources, such as tables, graphs, and databases, are ubiquitous knowledge sources. Despite the demonstrated capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on plain text, their proficiency in interpreting and utilizing structured data remains limited. Our investigation reveals a notable deficiency in LLMs' ability to process structured data, e.g., ChatGPT lags behind state-of-the-art (SoTA) model by an average of 35%. To augment the Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) capabilities in LLMs, we have developed a comprehensive instruction tuning dataset comprising 1.1 million examples. Utilizing this dataset, we train a series of models, referred to as StructLM, based on the Mistral and the CodeLlama model family, ranging from 7B to 34B parameters. Our StructLM series surpasses task-specific models on 16 out of 18 evaluated datasets and establishes new SoTA performance on 8 SKG tasks. Furthermore, StructLM demonstrates strong generalization across 6 novel held-out SKG tasks, outperforming TableLlama by an average of 35\% and Flan-UL2 20B by an average of 10\%. Contrary to expectations, we observe that scaling model size offers marginal benefits, with StructLM-34B showing only slight improvements over StructLM-7B. This suggests that structured knowledge grounding is still a challenging task and requires more innovative design to push to a new level.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16671v7,2024-02

ESG Sentiment Analysis: comparing human and language model performance including GPT,Karim Derrick,"In this paper we explore the challenges of measuring sentiment in relation to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) social media. ESG has grown in importance in recent years with a surge in interest from the financial sector and the performance of many businesses has become based in part on their ESG related reputations. The use of sentiment analysis to measure ESG related reputation has developed and with it interest in the use of machines to do so. The era of digital media has created an explosion of new media sources, driven by the growth of social media platforms. This growing data environment has become an excellent source for behavioural insight studies across many disciplines that includes politics, healthcare and market research. Our study seeks to compare human performance with the cutting edge in machine performance in the measurement of ESG related sentiment. To this end researchers classify the sentiment of 150 tweets and a reliability measure is made. A gold standard data set is then established based on the consensus of 3 researchers and this data set is then used to measure the performance of different machine approaches: one based on the VADER dictionary approach to sentiment classification and then multiple language model approaches, including Llama2, T5, Mistral, Mixtral, FINBERT, GPT3.5 and GPT4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16650v1,2024-02

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structured design template, incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition, it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover, the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses.

Domain Embeddings for Generating Complex Descriptions of Concepts in Italian Language,Alessandro Maisto,"In this work, we propose a Distributional Semantic resource enriched with linguistic and lexical information extracted from electronic dictionaries, designed to address the challenge of bridging the gap between the continuous semantic values represented by distributional vectors and the discrete descriptions offered by general semantics theory. Recently, many researchers have concentrated on the nexus between embeddings and a comprehensive theory of semantics and meaning. This often involves decoding the representation of word meanings in Distributional Models into a set of discrete, manually constructed properties such as semantic primitives or features, using neural decoding techniques. Our approach introduces an alternative strategy grounded in linguistic data. We have developed a collection of domain-specific co-occurrence matrices, derived from two sources: a classification of Italian nouns categorized into 4 semantic traits and 20 concrete noun sub-categories, and a list of Italian verbs classified according to their semantic classes. In these matrices, the co-occurrence values for each word are calculated exclusively with a defined set of words pertinent to a particular lexical domain. The resource comprises 21 domain-specific matrices, one comprehensive matrix, and a Graphical User Interface. Our model facilitates the generation of reasoned semantic descriptions of concepts by selecting matrices directly associated with concrete conceptual knowledge, such as a matrix based on location nouns and the concept of animal habitats. We assessed the utility of the resource through two experiments, achieving promising outcomes in both: the automatic classification of animal nouns and the extraction of animal features.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16632v1,2024-02
Long-Context Language Modeling with Parallel Context Encoding,"Howard Yen, Tianyu Gao, Danqi Chen","Extending large language models (LLMs) to process longer inputs is crucial for a wide range of applications. However, the substantial computational cost of transformers and limited generalization of positional encoding restrict the size of their context window. We introduce Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE), a framework that can be applied to any existing decoder-only LLMs to extend their context window. CEPE employs a small encoder to process long inputs chunk by chunk, enabling the frozen decoder to utilize additional contexts via cross-attention. CEPE is efficient, generalizable, and versatile: trained with 8K-token documents, it extends the context window of LLAMA-2 to 128K tokens, offering 10x the throughput with only 1/6 of the memory. CEPE yields strong performance on language modeling and in-context learning. CEPE also excels in retrieval-augmented applications, while existing long-context models degenerate with retrieved contexts. We further introduce a CEPE variant that can extend the context window of instruction-tuned models using only unlabeled data, and showcase its effectiveness on LLAMA-2-CHAT, leading to a strong instruction-following model that can leverage very long contexts on downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16617v2,2024-02
PAQA: Toward ProActive Open-Retrieval Question Answering,"Pierre Erbacher, Jian-Yun Nie, Philippe Preux, Laure Soulier","Conversational systems have made significant progress in generating natural language responses. However, their potential as conversational search systems is currently limited due to their passive role in the information-seeking process. One major limitation is the scarcity of datasets that provide labelled ambiguous questions along with a supporting corpus of documents and relevant clarifying questions. This work aims to tackle the challenge of generating relevant clarifying questions by taking into account the inherent ambiguities present in both user queries and documents. To achieve this, we propose PAQA, an extension to the existing AmbiNQ dataset, incorporating clarifying questions. We then evaluate various models and assess how passage retrieval impacts ambiguity detection and the generation of clarifying questions. By addressing this gap in conversational search systems, we aim to provide additional supervision to enhance their active participation in the information-seeking process and provide users with more accurate results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16608v1,2024-02
Rethinking Negative Instances for Generative Named Entity Recognition,"Yuyang Ding, Juntao Li, Pinzheng Wang, Zecheng Tang, Bowen Yan, Min Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for generalizing in unseen tasks.

In this paper, we present the first Slovene dataset for evaluating semantic change detection systems, which contains aggregated semantic change scores for 104 target words obtained from more than 3000 manually annotated sentence pairs. We evaluate several existing semantic change detection methods on this dataset and also propose a novel approach based on optimal transport that improves on the existing state-of-the-art systems with an error reduction rate of 22.8%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16596v1,2024-02
Multi-Bit Distortion-Free Watermarking for Large Language Models,"Massieh Kordi Boroujeny, Ya Jiang, Kai Zeng, Brian Mark","Methods for watermarking large language models have been proposed that distinguish AI-generated text from human-generated text by slightly altering the model output distribution, but they also distort the quality of the text, exposing the watermark to adversarial detection. More recently, distortion-free watermarking methods were proposed that require a secret key to detect the watermark. The prior methods generally embed zero-bit watermarks that do not provide additional information beyond tagging a text as being AI-generated. We extend an existing zero-bit distortion-free watermarking method by embedding multiple bits of meta-information as part of the watermark. We also develop a computationally efficient decoder that extracts the embedded information from the watermark with low bit error rate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16578v1,2024-02
Two-stage Generative Question Answering on Temporal Knowledge Graph Using Large Language Models,"Yifu Gao, Linbo Qiao, Zhigang Kan, Zhihua Wen, Yongquan He, Dongsheng Li","Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) poses a significant challenge task, due to the temporal constraints hidden in questions and the answers sought from dynamic structured knowledge. Although large language models (LLMs) have made considerable progress in their reasoning ability over structured data, their application to the TKGQA task is a relatively unexplored area. This paper first proposes a novel generative temporal knowledge graph question answering framework, GenTKGQA, which guides LLMs to answer temporal questions through two phases: Subgraph Retrieval and Answer Generation. First, we exploit LLM's intrinsic knowledge to mine temporal constraints and structural links in the questions without extra training, thus narrowing down the subgraph search space in both temporal and structural dimensions. Next, we design virtual knowledge indicators to fuse the graph neural network signals of the subgraph and the text representations of the LLM in a non-shallow way, which helps the open-source LLM deeply understand the temporal order and structural dependencies among the retrieved facts through instruction tuning. Experimental results on two widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16568v2,2024-02
Aligning Large Language Models to a Domain-specific Graph Database for NL2GQL,"Yuanyuan Liang, Keren Tan, Tingyu Xie, Wenbiao Tao, Siyuan Wang, Yunshi Lan, Weining Qian","Graph Databases (Graph DB) find extensive application across diverse domains such as finance, social networks, and medicine. Yet, the translation of Natural Language (NL) into the Graph Query Language (GQL), referred to as NL2GQL, poses significant challenges owing to its intricate and specialized nature. Some approaches have sought to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to address analogous tasks like text2SQL. Nonetheless, in the realm of NL2GQL tasks tailored to a particular domain, the absence of domain-specific NL-GQL data pairs adds complexity to aligning LLMs with the graph DB. To tackle this challenge, we present a well-defined pipeline. Initially, we utilize ChatGPT to generate NL-GQL data pairs, leveraging the provided graph DB with self-instruction. Subsequently, we employ the generated data to fine-tune LLMs, ensuring alignment between LLMs and the graph DB. Moreover, we find the importance of relevant schema in efficiently generating accurate GQLs. Thus, we introduce a method to extract relevant schema as the input context. We evaluate our method using two carefully constructed datasets derived from graph DBs in the finance and medicine domains, named FinGQL and MediGQL. Experimental results reveal that our approach significantly outperforms a set of baseline methods, with improvements of 5.90 and 6.36 absolute points on EM, and 6.00 and 7.09 absolute points on EX for FinGQL and MediGQL, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16567v3,2024-02
"Retrieval Augmented Generation Systems: Automatic Dataset Creation, Evaluation and Boolean Agent Setup","Tristan Kenneweg, Philip Kenneweg, Barbara Hammer","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have seen huge popularity in augmenting Large-Language Model (LLM) outputs with domain specific and time sensitive data. Very recently a shift is happening from simple RAG setups that query a vector database for additional information with every user input to more sophisticated forms of RAG. However, different concrete approaches compete on mostly anecdotal evidence at the moment. In this paper we present a rigorous dataset creation and evaluation workflow to quantitatively compare different RAG strategies. We use a dataset created this way for the development and evaluation of a boolean agent RAG setup: A system in which a LLM can decide whether to query a vector database or not, thus saving tokens on questions that can be answered with internal knowledge. We publish our code and generated dataset online.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00820v1,2024-02
Integrating Large Language Models with Graphical Session-Based Recommendation,"Naicheng Guo, Hongwei Cheng, Qianqiao Liang, Linxun Chen, Bing Han","With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), various explorations have arisen to utilize LLMs capability of context understanding on recommender systems. While pioneering strategies have primarily transformed traditional recommendation tasks into challenges of natural language generation, there has been a relative scarcity of exploration in the domain of session-based recommendation (SBR) due to its specificity. SBR has been primarily dominated by Graph Neural Networks, which have achieved many successful outcomes due to their ability to capture both the implicit and explicit relationships between adjacent behaviors. The structural nature of graphs contrasts with the essence of natural language, posing a significant adaptation gap for LLMs. In this paper, we introduce large language models with graphical Session-Based recommendation, named LLMGR, an effective framework that bridges the aforementioned gap by harmoniously integrating LLMs with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for SBR tasks. This integration seeks to leverage the complementary strengths of LLMs in natural language understanding and GNNs in relational data processing, leading to a more powerful session-based recommender system that can understand and recommend items within a session. Moreover, to endow the LLM with the capability to empower SBR tasks, we design a series of prompts for both auxiliary and major instruction tuning tasks. These prompts are crafted to assist the LLM in understanding graph-structured data and align textual information with nodes, effectively translating nuanced user interactions into a format that can be understood and utilized by LLM architectures. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMGR outperforms several competitive baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing SBR tasks and its potential as a research direction for future exploration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16539v1,2024-02
LLM-based Privacy Data Augmentation Guided by Knowledge Distillation with a Distribution Tutor for Medical Text Classification,"Yiping Song, Juhua Zhang, Zhiliang Tian, Yuxin Yang, Minlie Huang, Dongsheng Li","As sufficient data are not always publically accessible for model training, researchers exploit limited data with advanced learning algorithms or expand the dataset via data augmentation (DA). Conducting DA in private domain requires private protection approaches (i.e. anonymization and perturbation), but those methods cannot provide protection guarantees. Differential privacy (DP) learning methods theoretically bound the protection but are not skilled at generating pseudo text samples with large models. In this paper, we transfer DP-based pseudo sample generation task to DP-based generated samples discrimination task, where we propose a DP-based DA method with a LLM and a DP-based discriminator for text classification on private domains. We construct a knowledge distillation model as the DP-based discriminator: teacher models, accessing private data, teaches students how to select private samples with calibrated noise to achieve DP. To constrain the distribution of DA's generation, we propose a DP-based tutor that models the noised private distribution and controls samples' generation with a low privacy cost. We theoretically analyze our model's privacy protection and empirically verify our model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16515v1,2024-02
Pre-training Cross-lingual Open Domain Question Answering with Large-scale Synthetic Supervision,"Fan Jiang, Tom Drummond, Trevor Cohn","Cross-lingual open domain question answering (CLQA) is a complex problem, comprising cross-lingual retrieval from a multilingual knowledge base, followed by answer generation in the query language. Both steps are usually tackled by separate models, requiring substantial annotated datasets, and typically auxiliary resources, like machine translation systems to bridge between languages. In this paper, we show that CLQA can be addressed using a single encoder-decoder model. To effectively train this model, we propose a self-supervised method based on exploiting the cross-lingual link structure within Wikipedia. We demonstrate how linked Wikipedia pages can be used to synthesise supervisory signals for cross-lingual retrieval, through a form of cloze query, and generate more natural questions to supervise answer generation. Together, we show our approach, \texttt{CLASS}, outperforms comparable methods on both supervised and zero-shot language adaptation settings, including those using machine translation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16508v3,2024-02
LLMArena: Assessing Capabilities of Large Language Models in Dynamic Multi-Agent Environments,"Junzhe Chen, Xuming Hu, Shuodi Liu, Shiyu Huang, Wei-Wei Tu, Zhaofeng He, Lijie Wen","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revealed their potential for achieving autonomous agents possessing human-level intelligence. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM Agents either use static datasets, potentially leading to data leakage or focus only on single-agent scenarios, overlooking the complexities of multi-agent interactions. There is a lack of a benchmark that evaluates the diverse capabilities of LLM agents in multi-agent, dynamic environments. To this end, we introduce LLMArena, a novel and easily extensible framework for evaluating the diverse capabilities of LLM in multi-agent dynamic environments. LLMArena encompasses seven distinct gaming environments, employing Trueskill scoring to assess crucial abilities in LLM agents, including spatial reasoning, strategic planning, numerical reasoning, risk assessment, communication, opponent modeling, and team collaboration. We conduct an extensive experiment and human evaluation among different sizes and types of LLMs, showing that LLMs still have a significant journey ahead in their development towards becoming fully autonomous agents, especially in opponent modeling and team collaboration. We hope LLMArena could guide future research towards enhancing these capabilities in LLMs, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and practical applications in dynamic, multi-agent settings.

On Languaging a Simulation Engine,"Han Liu, Liantang Li","Language model intelligence is revolutionizing the way we program materials simulations. However, the diversity of simulation scenarios renders it challenging to precisely transform human language into a tailored simulator. Here, using three functionalized types of language model, we propose a language-to-simulation (Lang2Sim) framework that enables interactive navigation on languaging a simulation engine, by taking a scenario instance of water sorption in porous matrices. Unlike line-by-line coding of a target simulator, the language models interpret each simulator as an assembly of invariant tool function and its variant input-output pair. Lang2Sim enables the precise transform of textual description by functionalizing and sequentializing the language models of, respectively, rationalizing the tool categorization, customizing its input-output combinations, and distilling the simulator input into executable format. Importantly, depending on its functionalized type, each language model features a distinct processing of chat history to best balance its memory limit and information completeness, thus leveraging the model intelligence to unstructured nature of human request. Overall, this work establishes language model as an intelligent platform to unlock the era of languaging a simulation engine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16482v1,2024-02
mEdIT: Multilingual Text Editing via Instruction Tuning,"Vipul Raheja, Dimitris Alikaniotis, Vivek Kulkarni, Bashar Alhafni, Dhruv Kumar","We introduce mEdIT, a multi-lingual extension to CoEdIT -- the recent state-of-the-art text editing models for writing assistance. mEdIT models are trained by fine-tuning multi-lingual large, pre-trained language models (LLMs) via instruction tuning. They are designed to take instructions from the user specifying the attributes of the desired text in the form of natural language instructions, such as Grammatik korrigieren (German) or Parafrasee la oraci\'on (Spanish). We build mEdIT by curating data from multiple publicly available human-annotated text editing datasets for three text editing tasks (Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), Text Simplification, and Paraphrasing) across diverse languages belonging to six different language families. We detail the design and training of mEdIT models and demonstrate their strong performance on many multi-lingual text editing benchmarks against other multilingual LLMs. We also find that mEdIT generalizes effectively to new languages over multilingual baselines.

Unveiling Vulnerability of Self-Attention,"Khai Jiet Liong, Hongqiu Wu, Hai Zhao","Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are shown to be vulnerable to minor word changes, which poses a big threat to real-world systems. While previous studies directly focus on manipulating word inputs, they are limited by their means of generating adversarial samples, lacking generalization to versatile real-world attack. This paper studies the basic structure of transformer-based PLMs, the self-attention (SA) mechanism. (1) We propose a powerful perturbation technique \textit{HackAttend}, which perturbs the attention scores within the SA matrices via meticulously crafted attention masks. We show that state-of-the-art PLMs fall into heavy vulnerability that minor attention perturbations $(1\%)$ can produce a very high attack success rate $(98\%)$. Our paper expands the conventional text attack of word perturbations to more general structural perturbations. (2) We introduce \textit{S-Attend}, a novel smoothing technique that effectively makes SA robust via structural perturbations. We empirically demonstrate that this simple yet effective technique achieves robust performance on par with adversarial training when facing various text attackers.

Defending LLMs against Jailbreaking Attacks via Backtranslation,"Yihan Wang, Zhouxing Shi, Andrew Bai, Cho-Jui Hsieh","Although many large language models (LLMs) have been trained to refuse harmful requests, they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks which rewrite the original prompt to conceal its harmful intent. In this paper, we propose a new method for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks by ``backtranslation''. Specifically, given an initial response generated by the target LLM from an input prompt, our backtranslation prompts a language model to infer an input prompt that can lead to the response. The inferred prompt is called the backtranslated prompt which tends to reveal the actual intent of the original prompt, since it is generated based on the LLM's response and not directly manipulated by the attacker. We then run the target LLM again on the backtranslated prompt, and we refuse the original prompt if the model refuses the backtranslated prompt. We explain that the proposed defense provides several benefits on its effectiveness and efficiency. We empirically demonstrate that our defense significantly outperforms the baselines, in the cases that are hard for the baselines, and our defense also has little impact on the generation quality for benign input prompts. Our implementation is based on our library for LLM jailbreaking defense algorithms at \url{https://github.com/YihanWang617/llm-jailbreaking-defense}, and the code for reproducing our experiments is available at \url{https://github.com/YihanWang617/LLM-Jailbreaking-Defense-Backtranslation}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16459v3,2024-02

Our focus is on measuring and mitigating biases derived from spurious associations between swear words and incidents occurring as a result of such data collection strategies. After demonstrating and quantifying these biases, we introduce ID-XCB, the first data-independent debiasing technique that combines adversarial training, bias constraints and debias fine-tuning approach aimed at alleviating model attention to bias-inducing words without impacting overall model performance. We explore ID-XCB on two popular session-based cyberbullying datasets along with comprehensive ablation and generalisation studies. We show that ID-XCB learns robust cyberbullying detection capabilities while mitigating biases, outperforming state-of-the-art debiasing methods in both performance and bias mitigation. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate its generalisability to unseen data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16458v2,2024-02
RetrievalQA: Assessing Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Short-form Open-Domain Question Answering,"Zihan Zhang, Meng Fang, Ling Chen","Adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (ARAG) aims to dynamically determine the necessity of retrieval for queries instead of retrieving indiscriminately to enhance the efficiency and relevance of the sourced information. However, previous works largely overlook the evaluation of ARAG approaches, leading to their effectiveness being understudied. This work presents a benchmark, RetrievalQA, comprising 1,271 short-form questions covering new world and long-tail knowledge. The knowledge necessary to answer the questions is absent from LLMs; therefore, external information must be retrieved to answer correctly. This makes RetrievalQA a suitable testbed to evaluate existing ARAG methods. We observe that calibration-based methods heavily rely on threshold tuning, while vanilla prompting is inadequate for guiding LLMs to make reliable retrieval decisions. Based on our findings, we propose Time-Aware Adaptive Retrieval (TA-ARE), a simple yet effective method that helps LLMs assess the necessity of retrieval without calibration or additional training.

Language-Specific Neurons: The Key to Multilingual Capabilities in Large Language Models,"Tianyi Tang, Wenyang Luo, Haoyang Huang, Dongdong Zhang, Xiaolei Wang, Xin Zhao, Furu Wei, Ji-Rong Wen","Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable multilingual capabilities without being pre-trained on specially curated multilingual parallel corpora. It remains a challenging problem to explain the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs process multilingual texts. In this paper, we delve into the composition of Transformer architectures in LLMs to pinpoint language-specific regions. Specially, we propose a novel detection method, language activation probability entropy (LAPE), to identify language-specific neurons within LLMs. Based on LAPE, we conduct comprehensive experiments on several representative LLMs, such as LLaMA-2, BLOOM, and Mistral. Our findings indicate that LLMs' proficiency in processing a particular language is predominantly due to a small subset of neurons, primarily situated in the models' top and bottom layers. Furthermore, we showcase the feasibility to ""steer"" the output language of LLMs by selectively activating or deactivating language-specific neurons.

However, recent studies have raised concerns about the robustness of LLMs when prompted with instructions combining textual adversarial samples. In this paper, drawing inspiration from recent works that LLMs are sensitive to the design of the instructions, we utilize instructions in code style, which are more structural and less ambiguous, to replace typically natural language instructions. Through this conversion, we provide LLMs with more precise instructions and strengthen the robustness of LLMs. Moreover, under few-shot scenarios, we propose a novel method to compose in-context demonstrations using both clean and adversarial samples (\textit{adversarial context method}) to further boost the robustness of the LLMs. Experiments on eight robustness datasets show that our method consistently outperforms prompting LLMs with natural language instructions. For example, with gpt-3.5-turbo, our method achieves an improvement of 5.68\% in test set accuracy and a reduction of 5.66 points in Attack Success Rate (ASR).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16431v1,2024-02

HealMe: Harnessing Cognitive Reframing in Large Language Models for Psychotherapy,"Mengxi Xiao, Qianqian Xie, Ziyan Kuang, Zhicheng Liu, Kailai Yang, Min Peng, Weiguang Han, Jimin Huang","Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a vital role in psychotherapy by adeptly handling the crucial task of cognitive reframing and overcoming challenges such as shame, distrust, therapist skill variability, and resource scarcity. Previous LLMs in cognitive reframing mainly converted negative emotions to positive ones, but these approaches have limited efficacy, often not promoting clients' self-discovery of alternative perspectives. In this paper, we unveil the Helping and Empowering through Adaptive Language in Mental Enhancement (HealMe) model. This novel cognitive reframing therapy method effectively addresses deep-rooted negative thoughts and fosters rational, balanced perspectives. Diverging from traditional LLM methods, HealMe employs empathetic dialogue based on psychotherapeutic frameworks. It systematically guides clients through distinguishing circumstances from feelings, brainstorming alternative viewpoints, and developing empathetic, actionable suggestions. Moreover, we adopt the first comprehensive and expertly crafted psychological evaluation metrics, specifically designed to rigorously assess the performance of cognitive reframing, in both AI-simulated dialogues and real-world therapeutic conversations.

From RAGs to riches: Using large language models to write documents for clinical trials,"Nigel Markey, Ilyass El-Mansouri, Gaetan Rensonnet, Casper van Langen, Christoph Meier","Clinical trials require numerous documents to be written -- protocols, consent forms, clinical study reports and others.

We find that an offthe-shelf LLM delivers reasonable results, especially when assessing content relevance and the correct use of terminology. However, deficiencies remain: specifically clinical thinking and logic, and appropriate use of references. To improve performance, we used retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to prompt an LLM with accurate up-to-date information.

However, there is limited understanding of how well LLMs perform in specific domains (e.g, the intellectual property (IP) domain). In this paper, we contribute a new benchmark, the first Multilingual-oriented quiZ on Intellectual Property (MoZIP), for the evaluation of LLMs in the IP domain. The MoZIP benchmark includes three challenging tasks: IP multiple-choice quiz (IPQuiz), IP question answering (IPQA), and patent matching (PatentMatch).

While this emerging threat (harmful fine-tuning attacks) has been characterized by previous work, there is little understanding of how we should proceed in constructing and validating defenses against these attacks especially in the case where defenders would not have control of the fine-tuning process. We introduce a formal framework based on the training budget of an attacker which we call ""Immunization"" conditions. Using a formal characterisation of the harmful fine-tuning problem, we provide a thorough description of what a successful defense must comprise of and establish a set of guidelines on how rigorous defense research that gives us confidence should proceed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16382v2,2024-02
An Automated End-to-End Open-Source Software for High-Quality Text-to-Speech Dataset Generation,"Ahmet Gunduz, Kamer Ali Yuksel, Kareem Darwish, Golara Javadi, Fabio Minazzi, Nicola Sobieski, Sebastien Bratieres","Data availability is crucial for advancing artificial intelligence applications, including voice-based technologies.

TEaR: Improving LLM-based Machine Translation with Systematic Self-Refinement,"Zhaopeng Feng, Yan Zhang, Hao Li, Bei Wu, Jiayu Liao, Wenqiang Liu, Jun Lang, Yang Feng, Jian Wu, Zuozhu Liu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in Machine Translation (MT). However, careful evaluations by human reveal that the translations produced by LLMs still contain multiple errors. Importantly, feeding back such error information into the LLMs can lead to self-refinement and result in improved translation performance. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a systematic LLM-based self-refinement translation framework, named \textbf{TEaR}, which stands for \textbf{T}ranslate, \textbf{E}stimate, \textbf{a}nd \textbf{R}efine, marking a significant step forward in this direction. Our findings demonstrate that 1) our self-refinement framework successfully assists LLMs in improving their translation quality across a wide range of languages, whether it's from high-resource languages to low-resource ones or whether it's English-centric or centered around other languages; 2) TEaR exhibits superior systematicity and interpretability; 3) different estimation strategies yield varied impacts, directly affecting the effectiveness of the final corrections. Additionally, traditional neural translation models and evaluation models operate separately, often focusing on singular tasks due to their limited capabilities, while general-purpose LLMs possess the capability to undertake both tasks simultaneously. We further conduct cross-model correction experiments to investigate the potential relationship between the translation and evaluation capabilities of general-purpose LLMs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/fzp0424/self_correct_mt",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16379v3,2024-02
Unraveling Babel: Exploring Multilingual Activation Patterns of LLMs and Their Applications,"Weize Liu, Yinlong Xu, Hongxia Xu, Jintai Chen, Xuming Hu, Jian Wu","Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous breakthroughs in the field of NLP, but still lack understanding of their internal neuron activities when processing different languages. We designed a method to convert dense LLMs into fine-grained MoE architectures, and then visually studied the multilingual activation patterns of LLMs through expert activation frequency heatmaps. Through comprehensive experiments on different model families, different model sizes, and different variants, we analyzed the similarities and differences in the internal neuron activation patterns of LLMs when processing different languages. Specifically, we investigated the distribution of high-frequency activated experts, multilingual shared experts, whether multilingual activation patterns are related to language families, and the impact of instruction tuning on activation patterns. We further explored leveraging the discovered differences in expert activation frequencies to guide sparse activation and pruning. Experimental results demonstrated that our method significantly outperformed random expert pruning and even exceeded the performance of unpruned models in some languages. Additionally, we found that configuring different pruning rates for different layers based on activation level differences could achieve better results. Our findings reveal the multilingual processing mechanisms within LLMs and utilize these insights to offer new perspectives for applications such as sparse activation and model pruning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16367v3,2024-02
Where Do We Go from Here? Multi-scale Allocentric Relational Inference from Natural Spatial Descriptions,"Tzuf Paz-Argaman, Sayali Kulkarni, John Palowitch, Jason Baldridge, Reut Tsarfaty","When communicating routes in natural language, the concept of acquired spatial knowledge is crucial for geographic information retrieval (GIR) and in spatial cognitive research. However, NLP navigation studies often overlook the impact of such acquired knowledge on textual descriptions. Current navigation studies concentrate on egocentric local descriptions (e.g., `it will be on your right') that require reasoning over the agent's local perception. These instructions are typically given as a sequence of steps, with each action-step explicitly mentioning and being followed by a landmark that the agent can use to verify they are on the right path (e.g., `turn right and then you will see...'). In contrast, descriptions based on knowledge acquired through a map provide a complete view of the environment and capture its overall structure. These instructions (e.g., `it is south of Central Park and a block north of a police station') are typically non-sequential, contain allocentric relations, with multiple spatial relations and implicit actions, without any explicit verification. This paper introduces the Rendezvous (RVS) task and dataset, which includes 10,404 examples of English geospatial instructions for reaching a target location using map-knowledge. Our analysis reveals that RVS exhibits a richer use of spatial allocentric relations, and requires resolving more spatial relations simultaneously compared to previous text-based navigation benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16364v2,2024-02
LLM Inference Unveiled: Survey and Roofline Model Insights,"Zhihang Yuan, Yuzhang Shang, Yang Zhou, Zhen Dong, Zhe Zhou, Chenhao Xue, Bingzhe Wu, Zhikai Li, Qingyi Gu, Yong Jae Lee, Yan Yan, Beidi Chen, Guangyu Sun, Kurt Keutzer","The field of efficient Large Language Model (LLM) inference is rapidly evolving, presenting a unique blend of opportunities and challenges. Although the field has expanded and is vibrant, there hasn't been a concise framework that analyzes the various methods of LLM Inference to provide a clear understanding of this domain. Our survey stands out from traditional literature reviews by not only summarizing the current state of research but also by introducing a framework based on roofline model for systematic analysis of LLM inference techniques. This framework identifies the bottlenecks when deploying LLMs on hardware devices and provides a clear understanding of practical problems, such as why LLMs are memory-bound, how much memory and computation they need, and how to choose the right hardware. We systematically collate the latest advancements in efficient LLM inference, covering crucial areas such as model compression (e.g., Knowledge Distillation and Quantization), algorithm improvements (e.g., Early Exit and Mixture-of-Expert), and both hardware and system-level enhancements. Our survey stands out by analyzing these methods with roofline model, helping us understand their impact on memory access and computation. This distinctive approach not only showcases the current research landscape but also delivers valuable insights for practical implementation, positioning our work as an indispensable resource for researchers new to the field as well as for those seeking to deepen their understanding of efficient LLM deployment.

Layer-wise Regularized Dropout for Neural Language Models,"Shiwen Ni, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu, Chengming Li, Xiping Hu","Among the various pre-trained neural language models that are popular today, dropout is already an indispensable regularization technique. To solve the inconsistency between training and inference caused by the randomness of dropout, some studies use consistency training to regularize dropout at the output layer. In this paper, we propose a novel Layer-wise Regularized Dropout (LR-Drop), which is specially designed for Transformer-based Language models. Specifically, LR-Drop layer-wise regularizes each Transformer layer using the consistency training strategy. Each training sample passes through the two siamese sub-models sampled by dropout, and then LR-Drop forces the hidden states, multi-head attention matrices, and output distribution of the two siamese sub-models to be consistent. The proposed LR-Drop can be regarded as a ""self-distillation"" framework, in which each sub-model generated by dropout is the other's ""teacher"" model and ""student"" model. Through extensive experiments on 8 natural language understanding datasets, 6 neural machine translation datasets, and 1 abstractive summarization dataset (a total of 15 datasets), we show that LR-Drop achieves superior performances, including state-of-the-art results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16361v1,2024-02
An Integrated Data Processing Framework for Pretraining Foundation Models,"Yiding Sun, Feng Wang, Yutao Zhu, Wayne Xin Zhao, Jiaxin Mao","The ability of the foundation models heavily relies on large-scale, diverse, and high-quality pretraining data. In order to improve data quality, researchers and practitioners often have to manually curate datasets from difference sources and develop dedicated data cleansing pipeline for each data repository. Lacking a unified data processing framework, this process is repetitive and cumbersome. To mitigate this issue, we propose a data processing framework that integrates a Processing Module which consists of a series of operators at different granularity levels, and an Analyzing Module which supports probing and evaluation of the refined data. The proposed framework is easy to use and highly flexible. In this demo paper, we first introduce how to use this framework with some example use cases and then demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the data quality with an automated evaluation with ChatGPT and an end-to-end evaluation in pretraining the GPT-2 model. The code and demonstration videos are accessible on GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16358v2,2024-02
Language-guided Skill Learning with Temporal Variational Inference,"Haotian Fu, Pratyusha Sharma, Elias Stengel-Eskin, George Konidaris, Nicolas Le Roux, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Xingdi Yuan","We present an algorithm for skill discovery from expert demonstrations. The algorithm first utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose an initial segmentation of the trajectories. Following that, a hierarchical variational inference framework incorporates the LLM-generated segmentation information to discover reusable skills by merging trajectory segments. To further control the trade-off between compression and reusability, we introduce a novel auxiliary objective based on the Minimum Description Length principle that helps guide this skill discovery process. Our results demonstrate that agents equipped with our method are able to discover skills that help accelerate learning and outperform baseline skill learning approaches on new long-horizon tasks in BabyAI, a grid world navigation environment, as well as ALFRED, a household simulation environment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16354v2,2024-02
MathGenie: Generating Synthetic Data with Question Back-translation for Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning of LLMs,"Zimu Lu, Aojun Zhou, Houxing Ren, Ke Wang, Weikang Shi, Junting Pan, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited great potential in mathematical reasoning. However, there remains a performance gap in this area between existing open-source models and closed-source models such as GPT-4. In this paper, we introduce MathGenie, a novel method for generating diverse and reliable math problems from a small-scale problem-solution dataset (denoted as seed data). We augment the ground-truth solutions of our seed data and train a back-translation model to translate the augmented solutions back into new questions. Subsequently, we generate code-integrated solutions for the new questions. To ensure the correctness of the code-integrated solutions, we employ rationale-based strategy for solution verification. Various pretrained models, ranging from 7B to 70B, are trained on the newly curated data to test the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation technique, resulting in a family of models known as MathGenieLM. These models consistently outperform previous open-source models across five representative mathematical reasoning datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. In particular, MathGenieLM-InternLM2 achieves an accuracy of 87.7% on GSM8K and 55.7% on MATH, securing the best overall score among open-source language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16352v2,2024-02
CodeS: Towards Building Open-source Language Models for Text-to-SQL,"Haoyang Li, Jing Zhang, Hanbing Liu, Ju Fan, Xiaokang Zhang, Jun Zhu, Renjie Wei, Hongyan Pan, Cuiping Li, Hong Chen","Language models have shown promising performance on the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). However, most of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches rely on powerful yet closed-source large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, which may have the limitations of unclear model architectures, data privacy risks, and expensive inference overheads. To address the limitations, we introduce CodeS, a series of pre-trained language models with parameters ranging from 1B to 15B, specifically designed for the text-to-SQL task. CodeS is a fully open-source language model, which achieves superior accuracy with much smaller parameter sizes. This paper studies the research challenges in building CodeS. To enhance the SQL generation abilities of CodeS, we adopt an incremental pre-training approach using a specifically curated SQL-centric corpus. Based on this, we address the challenges of schema linking and rapid domain adaptation through strategic prompt construction and a bi-directional data augmentation technique. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including the widely used Spider benchmark, the newly released BIRD benchmark, robustness-diagnostic benchmarks such as Spider-DK, Spider-Syn, Spider-Realistic, and Dr.Spider, as well as two real-world datasets created for financial and academic applications. The experimental results show that our CodeS achieves new SOTA accuracy and robustness on nearly all challenging text-to-SQL benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16347v1,2024-02
Unveiling the Truth and Facilitating Change: Towards Agent-based Large-scale Social Movement Simulation,"Xinyi Mou, Zhongyu Wei, Xuanjing Huang","Social media has emerged as a cornerstone of social movements, wielding significant influence in driving societal change. Simulating the response of the public and forecasting the potential impact has become increasingly important. However, existing methods for simulating such phenomena encounter challenges concerning their efficacy and efficiency in capturing the behaviors of social movement participants. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid framework HiSim for social media user simulation, wherein users are categorized into two types. Core users are driven by Large Language Models, while numerous ordinary users are modeled by deductive agent-based models. We further construct a Twitter-like environment to replicate their response dynamics following trigger events. Subsequently, we develop a multi-faceted benchmark SoMoSiMu-Bench for evaluation and conduct comprehensive experiments across real-world datasets.

Data-freeWeight Compress and Denoise for Large Language Models,"Runyu Peng, Yunhua Zhou, Qipeng Guo, Yang Gao, Hang Yan, Xipeng Qiu, Dahua Lin","Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the research landscape in artificial intelligence, particularly as model parameters scale up significantly, unlocking remarkable capabilities across various domains. Nevertheless, the scalability of model parameters faces constraints due to limitations in GPU memory and computational speed. To address these constraints, various weight compression methods have emerged, such as Pruning and Quantization. Given the low-rank nature of weight matrices in language models, the reduction of weights through matrix decomposition undoubtedly holds significant potential and promise. In this paper, drawing upon the intrinsic structure of LLMs, we propose a novel approach termed Data-free Joint Rank-k Approximation for compressing the parameter matrices. Significantly, our method is characterized by without necessitating additional involvement of any corpus, while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in conjunction with pruning and quantization methods. We achieve a model pruning of 80% parameters while retaining 93.43% of the original performance without any calibration data. Additionally, we explore the fundamental properties of the weight matrix of LLMs undergone Rank-k Approximation and conduct comprehensive experiments to elucidate our hypothesis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16319v1,2024-02
Finer: Investigating and Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Concept Recognition in Large Vision Language Models,"Jeonghwan Kim, Heng Ji","Recent advances in instruction-tuned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have imbued the models with the ability to generate high-level, image-grounded explanations with ease. While such capability is largely attributed to the rich world knowledge contained within the Large Language Models (LLMs), our work reveals their shortcomings in fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC) across six different benchmark settings. Most recent state-of-the-art LVLMs like LLaVa-1.5, InstructBLIP and GPT-4V not only severely deteriorate in terms of classification performance, e.g., average drop of 65.58 in EM for Stanford Dogs for LLaVA-1.5, but also struggle to generate an accurate explanation with detailed attributes based on the concept that appears within an input image despite their capability to generate holistic image-level descriptions. In-depth analyses show that instruction-tuned LVLMs exhibit modality gap, showing discrepancy when given textual and visual inputs that correspond to the same concept, preventing the image modality from leveraging the rich parametric knowledge within the LLMs. In an effort to further the community's endeavor in this direction, we propose a multiple granularity attribute-centric evaluation benchmark, Finer, which aims to establish a ground to evaluate LVLMs' fine-grained visual comprehension ability and provide significantly improved explainability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16315v4,2024-02

Chain-of-Discussion: A Multi-Model Framework for Complex Evidence-Based Question Answering,"Mingxu Tao, Dongyan Zhao, Yansong Feng","Open-ended question answering requires models to find appropriate evidence to form wellreasoned, comprehensive and helpful answers. In practical applications, models also need to engage in extended discussions on potential scenarios closely relevant to the question. With augmentation of retrieval module, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce coherent answers often with different focuses, but are still sub-optimal in terms of reliable evidence selection and in-depth question analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel Chain-ofDiscussion framework to leverage the synergy among multiple open-source LLMs aiming to provide more correct and more comprehensive answers for open-ended QA, although they are not strong enough individually. Our experiments show that discussions among multiple LLMs play a vital role in enhancing the quality of answers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16313v3,2024-02

Our research introduces PerLTQA, an innovative QA dataset that combines semantic and episodic memories, including world knowledge, profiles, social relationships, events, and dialogues. This dataset is collected to investigate the use of personalized memories, focusing on social interactions and events in the QA task. PerLTQA features two types of memory and a comprehensive benchmark of 8,593 questions for 30 characters, facilitating the exploration and application of personalized memories in Large Language Models (LLMs). Based on PerLTQA, we propose a novel framework for memory integration and generation, consisting of three main components: Memory Classification, Memory Retrieval, and Memory Synthesis.

A Self-matching Training Method with Annotation Embedding Models for Ontology Subsumption Prediction,"Yukihiro Shiraishi, Ken Kaneiwa","Recently, ontology embeddings representing entities in a low-dimensional space have been proposed for ontology completion. However, the ontology embeddings for concept subsumption prediction do not address the difficulties of similar and isolated entities and fail to extract the global information of annotation axioms from an ontology. In this paper, we propose a self-matching training method for the two ontology embedding models: Inverted-index Matrix Embedding (InME) and Co-occurrence Matrix Embedding (CoME). The two embeddings capture the global and local information in annotation axioms by means of the occurring locations of each word in a set of axioms and the co-occurrences of words in each axiom. The self-matching training method increases the robustness of the concept subsumption prediction when predicted superclasses are similar to subclasses and are isolated to other entities in an ontology. Our evaluation experiments show that the self-matching training method with InME outperforms the existing ontology embeddings for the GO and FoodOn ontologies and that the method with the concatenation of CoME and OWL2Vec* outperforms them for the HeLiS ontology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16278v3,2024-02
UniRetriever: Multi-task Candidates Selection for Various Context-Adaptive Conversational Retrieval,"Hongru Wang, Boyang Xue, Baohang Zhou, Rui Wang, Fei Mi, Weichao Wang, Yasheng Wang, Kam-Fai Wong","Conversational retrieval refers to an information retrieval system that operates in an iterative and interactive manner, requiring the retrieval of various external resources, such as persona, knowledge, and even response, to effectively engage with the user and successfully complete the dialogue. However, most previous work trained independent retrievers for each specific resource, resulting in sub-optimal performance and low efficiency. Thus, we propose a multi-task framework function as a universal retriever for three dominant retrieval tasks during the conversation: persona selection, knowledge selection, and response selection. To this end, we design a dual-encoder architecture consisting of a context-adaptive dialogue encoder and a candidate encoder, aiming to attention to the relevant context from the long dialogue and retrieve suitable candidates by simply a dot product. Furthermore, we introduce two loss constraints to capture the subtle relationship between dialogue context and different candidates by regarding historically selected candidates as hard negatives. Extensive experiments and analysis establish state-of-the-art retrieval quality both within and outside its training domain, revealing the promising potential and generalization capability of our model to serve as a universal retriever for different candidate selection tasks simultaneously.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16261v2,2024-02

In order to improve the generation diversity, we propose a novel copy mechanism model with a content selection module that integrates rich semantic knowledge from the language model into the decoder. Furthermore, we introduce the improved prefix tuning method to train the model, enabling it to adapt to varying input complexities. In addition, we have contributed a new Chinese dataset for TEG tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can improve the generated text diversity by 35\% to 59\% compared to the state-of-the-art method, while maintaining a high level of topic consistency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16248v1,2024-02
Learning Translations: Emergent Communication Pretraining for Cooperative Language Acquisition,"Dylan Cope, Peter McBurney","In Emergent Communication (EC) agents learn to communicate with one another, but the protocols that they develop are specialised to their training community. This observation led to research into Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC) for learning communication strategies that are robust to agents not encountered during training. However, ZSC typically assumes that no prior data is available about the agents that will be encountered in the zero-shot setting. In many cases, this presents an unnecessarily hard problem and rules out communication via preestablished conventions. We propose a novel AI challenge called a Cooperative Language Acquisition Problem (CLAP) in which the ZSC assumptions are relaxed by allowing a 'joiner' agent to learn from a dataset of interactions between agents in a target community. We propose and compare two methods for solving CLAPs: Imitation Learning (IL), and Emergent Communication pretraining and Translation Learning (ECTL), in which an agent is trained in self-play with EC and then learns from the data to translate between the emergent protocol and the target community's protocol.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16247v1,2024-02
Social Orientation: A New Feature for Dialogue Analysis,"Todd Morrill, Zhaoyuan Deng, Yanda Chen, Amith Ananthram, Colin Wayne Leach, Kathleen McKeown","There are many settings where it is useful to predict and explain the success or failure of a dialogue. Circumplex theory from psychology models the social orientations (e.g., Warm-Agreeable, Arrogant-Calculating) of conversation participants and can be used to predict and explain the outcome of social interactions. Our work is novel in its systematic application of social orientation tags to modeling conversation outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a new data set of dialogue utterances machine-labeled with social orientation tags. We show that social orientation tags improve task performance, especially in low-resource settings, on both English and Chinese language benchmarks. We also demonstrate how social orientation tags help explain the outcomes of social interactions when used in neural models. Based on these results showing the utility of social orientation tags for dialogue outcome prediction tasks, we release our data sets, code, and models that are fine-tuned to predict social orientation tags on dialogue utterances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04770v1,2024-02

HypoTermQA: Hypothetical Terms Dataset for Benchmarking Hallucination Tendency of LLMs,"Cem Uluoglakci, Tugba Taskaya Temizel","Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability and alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), limiting their widespread acceptance beyond chatbot applications. Despite ongoing efforts, hallucinations remain a prevalent challenge in LLMs. The detection of hallucinations itself is also a formidable task, frequently requiring manual labeling or constrained evaluations. This paper introduces an automated scalable framework that combines benchmarking LLMs' hallucination tendencies with efficient hallucination detection. We leverage LLMs to generate challenging tasks related to hypothetical phenomena, subsequently employing them as agents for efficient hallucination detection. The framework is domain-agnostic, allowing the use of any language model for benchmark creation or evaluation in any domain. We introduce the publicly available HypoTermQA Benchmarking Dataset, on which state-of-the-art models' performance ranged between 3% and 11%, and evaluator agents demonstrated a 6% error rate in hallucination prediction. The proposed framework provides opportunities to test and improve LLMs. Additionally, it has the potential to generate benchmarking datasets tailored to specific domains, such as law, health, and finance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16211v1,2024-02

ASEM: Enhancing Empathy in Chatbot through Attention-based Sentiment and Emotion Modeling,"Omama Hamad, Ali Hamdi, Khaled Shaban","Effective feature representations play a critical role in enhancing the performance of text generation models that rely on deep neural networks. However, current approaches suffer from several drawbacks, such as the inability to capture the deep semantics of language and sensitivity to minor input variations, resulting in significant changes in the generated text. In this paper, we present a novel solution to these challenges by employing a mixture of experts, multiple encoders, to offer distinct perspectives on the emotional state of the user's utterance while simultaneously enhancing performance. We propose an end-to-end model architecture called ASEM that performs emotion analysis on top of sentiment analysis for open-domain chatbots, enabling the generation of empathetic responses that are fluent and relevant. In contrast to traditional attention mechanisms, the proposed model employs a specialized attention strategy that uniquely zeroes in on sentiment and emotion nuances within the user's utterance. This ensures the generation of context-rich representations tailored to the underlying emotional tone and sentiment intricacies of the text. Our approach outperforms existing methods for generating empathetic embeddings, providing empathetic and diverse responses. The performance of our proposed model significantly exceeds that of existing models, enhancing emotion detection accuracy by 6.2% and lexical diversity by 1.4%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16194v1,2024-02
Defending Large Language Models against Jailbreak Attacks via Semantic Smoothing,"Jiabao Ji, Bairu Hou, Alexander Robey, George J. Pappas, Hamed Hassani, Yang Zhang, Eric Wong, Shiyu Chang","Aligned large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, which bypass the safeguards of targeted LLMs and fool them into generating objectionable content. While initial defenses show promise against token-based threat models, there do not exist defenses that provide robustness against semantic attacks and avoid unfavorable trade-offs between robustness and nominal performance. To meet this need, we propose SEMANTICSMOOTH, a smoothing-based defense that aggregates the predictions of multiple semantically transformed copies of a given input prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMANTICSMOOTH achieves state-of-the-art robustness against GCG, PAIR, and AutoDAN attacks while maintaining strong nominal performance on instruction following benchmarks such as InstructionFollowing and AlpacaEval.

No Free Lunch in LLM Watermarking: Trade-offs in Watermarking Design Choices,"Qi Pang, Shengyuan Hu, Wenting Zheng, Virginia Smith","Advances in generative models have made it possible for AI-generated text, code, and images to mirror human-generated content in many applications. Watermarking, a technique that aims to embed information in the output of a model to verify its source, is useful for mitigating the misuse of such AI-generated content. However, we show that common design choices in LLM watermarking schemes make the resulting systems surprisingly susceptible to attack -- leading to fundamental trade-offs in robustness, utility, and usability. To navigate these trade-offs, we rigorously study a set of simple yet effective attacks on common watermarking systems, and propose guidelines and defenses for LLM watermarking in practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16187v3,2024-02
"Hitting ""Probe""rty with Non-Linearity, and More","Avik Pal, Madhura Pawar","Structural probes learn a linear transformation to find how dependency trees are embedded in the hidden states of language models.

Hence, to investigate the structure of the encoded information to its full extent, we incorporate non-linear structural probes. We reformulate the design of non-linear structural probes introduced by White et al. making its design simpler yet effective. We also design a visualization framework that lets us qualitatively assess how strongly two words in a sentence are connected in the predicted dependency tree. We use this technique to understand which non-linear probe variant is good at encoding syntactical information. Additionally, we also use it to qualitatively investigate the structure of dependency trees that BERT encodes in each of its layers.

DrAttack: Prompt Decomposition and Reconstruction Makes Powerful LLM Jailbreakers,"Xirui Li, Ruochen Wang, Minhao Cheng, Tianyi Zhou, Cho-Jui Hsieh","The safety alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is vulnerable to both manual and automated jailbreak attacks, which adversarially trigger LLMs to output harmful content. However, current methods for jailbreaking LLMs, which nest entire harmful prompts, are not effective at concealing malicious intent and can be easily identified and rejected by well-aligned LLMs. This paper discovers that decomposing a malicious prompt into separated sub-prompts can effectively obscure its underlying malicious intent by presenting it in a fragmented, less detectable form, thereby addressing these limitations. We introduce an automatic prompt \textbf{D}ecomposition and \textbf{R}econstruction framework for jailbreak \textbf{Attack} (DrAttack). DrAttack includes three key components: (a) `Decomposition' of the original prompt into sub-prompts, (b) `Reconstruction' of these sub-prompts implicitly by in-context learning with semantically similar but harmless reassembling demo, and (c) a `Synonym Search' of sub-prompts, aiming to find sub-prompts' synonyms that maintain the original intent while jailbreaking LLMs. An extensive empirical study across multiple open-source and closed-source LLMs demonstrates that, with a significantly reduced number of queries, DrAttack obtains a substantial gain of success rate over prior SOTA prompt-only attackers. Notably, the success rate of 78.0\% on GPT-4 with merely 15 queries surpassed previous art by 33.1\%.

DistALANER: Distantly Supervised Active Learning Augmented Named Entity Recognition in the Open Source Software Ecosystem,"Somnath Banerjee, Avik Dutta, Aaditya Agrawal, Rima Hazra, Animesh Mukherjee","With the AI revolution in place, the trend for building automated systems to support professionals in different domains such as the open source software systems, healthcare systems, banking systems, transportation systems and many others have become increasingly prominent. A crucial requirement in the automation of support tools for such systems is the early identification of named entities, which serves as a foundation for developing specialized functionalities. However, due to the specific nature of each domain, different technical terminologies and specialized languages, expert annotation of available data becomes expensive and challenging. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel named entity recognition (NER) technique specifically tailored for the open-source software systems. Our approach aims to address the scarcity of annotated software data by employing a comprehensive two-step distantly supervised annotation process. This process strategically leverages language heuristics, unique lookup tables, external knowledge sources, and an active learning approach. By harnessing these powerful techniques, we not only enhance model performance but also effectively mitigate the limitations associated with cost and the scarcity of expert annotators. It is noteworthy that our model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art LLMs by a substantial margin.

Our model is capable of composing well-structured, full-length music, conditioned on texts, chords, melodies, motifs, musical forms, etc, surpassing GPT-4 baseline. On our meticulously curated college-level music understanding benchmark, MusicTheoryBench, ChatMusician surpasses LLaMA2 and GPT-3.5 on zero-shot setting by a noticeable margin.

From Text to Transformation: A Comprehensive Review of Large Language Models' Versatility,"Pravneet Kaur, Gautam Siddharth Kashyap, Ankit Kumar, Md Tabrez Nafis, Sandeep Kumar, Vikrant Shokeen","This groundbreaking study explores the expanse of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) across varied domains ranging from technology, finance, healthcare to education. Despite their established prowess in Natural Language Processing (NLP), these LLMs have not been systematically examined for their impact on domains such as fitness, and holistic well-being, urban planning, climate modelling as well as disaster management. This review paper, in addition to furnishing a comprehensive analysis of the vast expanse and extent of LLMs' utility in diverse domains, recognizes the research gaps and realms where the potential of LLMs is yet to be harnessed. This study uncovers innovative ways in which LLMs can leave a mark in the fields like fitness and wellbeing, urban planning, climate modelling and disaster response which could inspire future researches and applications in the said avenues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16142v1,2024-02
PeriodicLoRA: Breaking the Low-Rank Bottleneck in LoRA Optimization,"Xiangdi Meng, Damai Dai, Weiyao Luo, Zhe Yang, Shaoxiang Wu, Xiaochen Wang, Peiyi Wang, Qingxiu Dong, Liang Chen, Zhifang Sui","Supervised fine-tuning is the most common method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but full fine-tuning LLMs requires massive computational resources. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been widely studied due to its cost-effectiveness. LoRA is one of the most widely used methods, which assumes that the optimization process is essentially low-dimensional. Although LoRA fine-tuning is effective, there is still a performance gap compared to full fine-tuning, since its weight update is limited to low-rank matrices. In order to break the low-rank bottleneck in LoRA Optimization, we propose PeriodicLoRA (PLoRA), which accumulates low-rank update matrices multiple times to achieve a higher update rank. PLoRA has multiple training stages. During each stage, we still update only the LoRA weights. However, at the end of each stage, we unload the LoRA weights into the backbone parameters and then reinitialize the LoRA states. Experimental results show that PLoRA has stronger learning ability, approximately 1.8 times that of LoRA's learning ability at most, but it does not increase memory usage. Further, we introduce a momentum-based unloading strategy for PLoRA to mitigate the training instability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16141v1,2024-02
What Generative Artificial Intelligence Means for Terminological Definitions,Antonio San Martín,"This paper examines the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT on the creation and consumption of terminological definitions. From the terminologist's point of view, the strategic use of GenAI tools can streamline the process of crafting definitions, reducing both time and effort, while potentially enhancing quality. GenAI tools enable AI-assisted terminography, notably post-editing terminography, where the machine produces a definition that the terminologist then corrects or refines. However, the potential of GenAI tools to fulfill all the terminological needs of a user, including term definitions, challenges the very existence of terminological definitions and resources as we know them. Unlike terminological definitions, GenAI tools can describe the knowledge activated by a term in a specific context. However, a main drawback of these tools is that their output can contain errors. For this reason, users requiring reliability will likely still resort to terminological resources for definitions. Nevertheless, with the inevitable integration of AI into terminology work, the distinction between human-created and AI-created content will become increasingly blurred.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16139v3,2024-02
LSTPrompt: Large Language Models as Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters by Long-Short-Term Prompting,"Haoxin Liu, Zhiyuan Zhao, Jindong Wang, Harshavardhan Kamarthi, B. Aditya Prakash","Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Prompting off-the-shelf Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrates strong zero-shot TSF capabilities while preserving computational efficiency. However, existing prompting methods oversimplify TSF as language next-token predictions, overlooking its dynamic nature and lack of integration with state-of-the-art prompt strategies such as Chain-of-Thought. Thus, we propose LSTPrompt, a novel approach for prompting LLMs in zero-shot TSF tasks. LSTPrompt decomposes TSF into short-term and long-term forecasting sub-tasks, tailoring prompts to each. LSTPrompt guides LLMs to regularly reassess forecasting mechanisms to enhance adaptability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate consistently better performance of LSTPrompt than existing prompting methods, and competitive results compared to foundation TSF models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16132v1,2024-02
InstructEdit: Instruction-based Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models,"Ningyu Zhang, Bozhong Tian, Siyuan Cheng, Xiaozhuan Liang, Yi Hu, Kouying Xue, Yanjie Gou, Xi Chen, Huajun Chen","Knowledge editing for large language models can offer an efficient solution to alter a model's behavior without negatively impacting the overall performance. However, the current approaches encounter issues with limited generalizability across tasks, necessitating one distinct editor for each task, significantly hindering the broader applications. To address this, we take the first step to analyze the multi-task generalization issue in knowledge editing. Specifically, we develop an instruction-based editing technique, termed InstructEdit, which facilitates the editor's adaptation to various task performances simultaneously using simple instructions. With only one unified editor for each LLM, we empirically demonstrate that InstructEdit can improve the editor's control, leading to an average 14.86% increase in Reliability in multi-task editing setting. Furthermore, experiments involving holdout unseen task illustrate that InstructEdit consistently surpass previous strong baselines. To further investigate the underlying mechanisms of instruction-based knowledge editing, we analyze the principal components of the editing gradient directions, which unveils that instructions can help control optimization direction with stronger OOD generalization.

Knowledge Fusion of Chat LLMs: A Preliminary Technical Report,"Fanqi Wan, Ziyi Yang, Longguang Zhong, Xiaojun Quan, Xinting Huang, Wei Bi","Recently, FuseLLM introduced the concept of knowledge fusion to transfer the collective knowledge of multiple structurally varied LLMs into a target LLM through lightweight continual training. In this report, we extend the scalability and flexibility of the FuseLLM framework to realize the fusion of chat LLMs, resulting in FusionChat. FusionChat comprises two main stages. Firstly, we undertake knowledge fusion for structurally and scale-varied source LLMs to derive multiple target LLMs of identical structure and size via lightweight fine-tuning. Then, these target LLMs are merged within the parameter space, wherein we propose a novel method for determining the merging weights based on the variation ratio of parameter matrices before and after fine-tuning. We validate our approach using three prominent chat LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, namely NH2-Mixtral-8x7B, NH2-Solar-10.7B, and OpenChat-3.5-7B. Experimental results spanning various chat domains demonstrate the superiority of FusionChat-7B across a broad spectrum of chat LLMs at 7B and 34B scales, even surpassing GPT-3.5 (March) and approaching Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16107v6,2024-02
Interpreting Predictive Probabilities: Model Confidence or Human Label Variation?,"Joris Baan, Raquel Fernández, Barbara Plank, Wilker Aziz","With the rise of increasingly powerful and user-facing NLP systems, there is growing interest in assessing whether they have a good representation of uncertainty by evaluating the quality of their predictive distribution over outcomes. We identify two main perspectives that drive starkly different evaluation protocols. The first treats predictive probability as an indication of model confidence; the second as an indication of human label variation. We discuss their merits and limitations, and take the position that both are crucial for trustworthy and fair NLP systems, but that exploiting a single predictive distribution is limiting. We recommend tools and highlight exciting directions towards models with disentangled representations of uncertainty about predictions and uncertainty about human labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16102v1,2024-02
UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models,"Zhonghang Li, Lianghao Xia, Jiabin Tang, Yong Xu, Lei Shi, Long Xia, Dawei Yin, Chao Huang","Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00813v3,2024-02
Training a Bilingual Language Model by Mapping Tokens onto a Shared Character Space,"Aviad Rom, Kfir Bar","We train a bilingual Arabic-Hebrew language model using a transliterated version of Arabic texts in Hebrew, to ensure both languages are represented in the same script. Given the morphological, structural similarities, and the extensive number of cognates shared among Arabic and Hebrew, we assess the performance of a language model that employs a unified script for both languages, on machine translation which requires cross-lingual knowledge. The results are promising: our model outperforms a contrasting model which keeps the Arabic texts in the Arabic script, demonstrating the efficacy of the transliteration step. Despite being trained on a dataset approximately 60% smaller than that of other existing language models, our model appears to deliver comparable performance in machine translation across both translation directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16065v1,2024-02
Citation-Enhanced Generation for LLM-based Chatbots,"Weitao Li, Junkai Li, Weizhi Ma, Yang Liu","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful general intelligence across diverse scenarios, including their integration into chatbots. However, a vital challenge of LLM-based chatbots is that they may produce hallucinated content in responses, which significantly limits their applicability. Various efforts have been made to alleviate hallucination, such as retrieval augmented generation and reinforcement learning with human feedback, but most of them require additional training and data annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel post-hoc Citation-Enhanced Generation (CEG) approach combined with retrieval argumentation. Unlike previous studies that focus on preventing hallucinations during generation, our method addresses this issue in a post-hoc way. It incorporates a retrieval module to search for supporting documents relevant to the generated content, and employs a natural language inference-based citation generation module. Once the statements in the generated content lack of reference, our model can regenerate responses until all statements are supported by citations. Note that our method is a training-free plug-and-play plugin that is capable of various LLMs. Experiments on various hallucination-related datasets show our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both hallucination detection and response regeneration on three benchmarks. Our codes and dataset will be publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16063v3,2024-02
Evaluating Robustness of Generative Search Engine on Adversarial Factual Questions,"Xuming Hu, Xiaochuan Li, Junzhe Chen, Yinghui Li, Yangning Li, Xiaoguang Li, Yasheng Wang, Qun Liu, Lijie Wen, Philip S. Yu, Zhijiang Guo","Generative search engines have the potential to transform how people seek information online, but generated responses from existing large language models (LLMs)-backed generative search engines may not always be accurate. Nonetheless, retrieval-augmented generation exacerbates safety concerns, since adversaries may successfully evade the entire system by subtly manipulating the most vulnerable part of a claim. To this end, we propose evaluating the robustness of generative search engines in the realistic and high-risk setting, where adversaries have only black-box system access and seek to deceive the model into returning incorrect responses. Through a comprehensive human evaluation of various generative search engines, such as Bing Chat, PerplexityAI, and YouChat across diverse queries, we demonstrate the effectiveness of adversarial factual questions in inducing incorrect responses. Moreover, retrieval-augmented generation exhibits a higher susceptibility to factual errors compared to LLMs without retrieval. These findings highlight the potential security risks of these systems and emphasize the need for rigorous evaluation before deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12077v1,2024-02
How Large Language Models Encode Context Knowledge? A Layer-Wise Probing Study,"Tianjie Ju, Weiwei Sun, Wei Du, Xinwei Yuan, Zhaochun Ren, Gongshen Liu","Previous work has showcased the intriguing capability of large language models (LLMs) in retrieving facts and processing context knowledge. However, only limited research exists on the layer-wise capability of LLMs to encode knowledge, which challenges our understanding of their internal mechanisms. In this paper, we devote the first attempt to investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs through probing tasks. We leverage the powerful generative capability of ChatGPT to construct probing datasets, providing diverse and coherent evidence corresponding to various facts. We employ $\mathcal V$-usable information as the validation metric to better reflect the capability in encoding context knowledge across different layers. Our experiments on conflicting and newly acquired knowledge show that LLMs: (1) prefer to encode more context knowledge in the upper layers; (2) primarily encode context knowledge within knowledge-related entity tokens at lower layers while progressively expanding more knowledge within other tokens at upper layers; and (3) gradually forget the earlier context knowledge retained within the intermediate layers when provided with irrelevant evidence.

Say More with Less: Understanding Prompt Learning Behaviors through Gist Compression,"Xinze Li, Zhenghao Liu, Chenyan Xiong, Shi Yu, Yukun Yan, Shuo Wang, Ge Yu","Large language models (LLMs) require lengthy prompts as the input context to produce output aligned with user intentions, a process that incurs extra costs during inference. In this paper, we propose the Gist COnditioned deCOding (Gist-COCO) model, introducing a novel method for compressing prompts which also can assist the prompt interpretation and engineering. Gist-COCO employs an encoder-decoder based language model and then incorporates an additional encoder as a plugin module to compress prompts with inputs using gist tokens. It finetunes the compression plugin module and uses the representations of gist tokens to emulate the raw prompts in the vanilla language model. By verbalizing the representations of gist tokens into gist prompts, the compression ability of Gist-COCO can be generalized to different LLMs with high compression rates. Our experiments demonstrate that Gist-COCO outperforms previous prompt compression models in both passage and instruction compression tasks. Further analysis on gist verbalization results suggests that our gist prompts serve different functions in aiding language models. They may directly provide potential answers, generate the chain-of-thought, or simply repeat the inputs.

Efficient Temporal Extrapolation of Multimodal Large Language Models with Temporal Grounding Bridge,"Yuxuan Wang, Yueqian Wang, Pengfei Wu, Jianxin Liang, Dongyan Zhao, Yang Liu, Zilong Zheng","Despite progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the challenge of interpreting long-form videos in response to linguistic queries persists, largely due to the inefficiency in temporal grounding and limited pre-trained context window size. In this work, we introduce Temporal Grounding Bridge (TGB), a novel framework that bootstraps MLLMs with advanced temporal grounding capabilities and broadens their contextual scope. Our framework significantly enhances the temporal capabilities of current MLLMs through three key innovations: an efficient multi-span temporal grounding algorithm applied to low-dimension temporal features projected from flow; a multimodal length extrapolation training paradigm that utilizes low-dimension temporal features to extend the training context window size; and a bootstrapping framework that bridges our model with pluggable MLLMs without requiring annotation. We validate TGB across seven video benchmarks and demonstrate substantial performance improvements compared with prior MLLMs. Notably, our model, initially trained on sequences of four frames, effectively handles sequences up to 16 longer without sacrificing performance, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in real-world applications.

How Likely Do LLMs with CoT Mimic Human Reasoning?,"Guangsheng Bao, Hongbo Zhang, Cunxiang Wang, Linyi Yang, Yue Zhang","Chain-of-thought emerges as a promising technique for eliciting reasoning capabilities from Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it does not always improve task performance or accurately represent reasoning processes, leaving unresolved questions about its usage. In this paper, we diagnose the underlying mechanism by comparing the reasoning process of LLMs with humans, using causal analysis to understand the relationships between the problem instruction, reasoning, and the answer in LLMs. Our empirical study reveals that LLMs often deviate from the ideal causal chain, resulting in spurious correlations and potential consistency errors (inconsistent reasoning and answers). We also examine various factors influencing the causal structure, finding that in-context learning with examples strengthens it, while post-training techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on human feedback weaken it. To our surprise, the causal structure cannot be strengthened by enlarging the model size only, urging research on new techniques. We hope that this preliminary study will shed light on understanding and improving the reasoning process in LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16048v3,2024-02
Detecting Machine-Generated Texts by Multi-Population Aware Optimization for Maximum Mean Discrepancy,"Shuhai Zhang, Yiliao Song, Jiahao Yang, Yuanqing Li, Bo Han, Mingkui Tan","Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have exhibited remarkable performance in generating human-like texts. However, machine-generated texts (MGTs) may carry critical risks, such as plagiarism issues, misleading information, or hallucination issues. Therefore, it is very urgent and important to detect MGTs in many situations. Unfortunately, it is challenging to distinguish MGTs and human-written texts because the distributional discrepancy between them is often very subtle due to the remarkable performance of LLMs. In this paper, we seek to exploit \textit{maximum mean discrepancy} (MMD) to address this issue in the sense that MMD can well identify distributional discrepancies. However, directly training a detector with MMD using diverse MGTs will incur a significantly increased variance of MMD since MGTs may contain \textit{multiple text populations} due to various LLMs. This will severely impair MMD's ability to measure the difference between two samples. To tackle this, we propose a novel \textit{multi-population} aware optimization method for MMD called MMD-MP, which can \textit{avoid variance increases} and thus improve the stability to measure the distributional discrepancy. Relying on MMD-MP, we develop two methods for paragraph-based and sentence-based detection, respectively. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, \eg, GPT2 and ChatGPT, show superior detection performance of our MMD-MP.

EHRNoteQA: An LLM Benchmark for Real-World Clinical Practice Using Discharge Summaries,"Sunjun Kweon, Jiyoun Kim, Heeyoung Kwak, Dongchul Cha, Hangyul Yoon, Kwanghyun Kim, Jeewon Yang, Seunghyun Won, Edward Choi","Discharge summaries in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are crucial for clinical decision-making, but their length and complexity make information extraction challenging, especially when dealing with accumulated summaries across multiple patient admissions. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing this challenge by efficiently analyzing vast and complex data. Existing benchmarks, however, fall short in properly evaluating LLMs' capabilities in this context, as they typically focus on single-note information or limited topics, failing to reflect the real-world inquiries required by clinicians. To bridge this gap, we introduce EHRNoteQA, a novel benchmark built on the MIMIC-IV EHR, comprising 962 different QA pairs each linked to distinct patients' discharge summaries. Every QA pair is initially generated using GPT-4 and then manually reviewed and refined by three clinicians to ensure clinical relevance. EHRNoteQA includes questions that require information across multiple discharge summaries and covers eight diverse topics, mirroring the complexity and diversity of real clinical inquiries. We offer EHRNoteQA in two formats: open-ended and multi-choice question answering, and propose a reliable evaluation method for each. We evaluate 27 LLMs using EHRNoteQA and examine various factors affecting the model performance (e.g., the length and number of discharge summaries). Furthermore, to validate EHRNoteQA as a reliable proxy for expert evaluations in clinical practice, we measure the correlation between the LLM performance on EHRNoteQA, and the LLM performance manually evaluated by clinicians. Results show that LLM performance on EHRNoteQA have higher correlation with clinician-evaluated performance (Spearman: 0.78, Kendall: 0.62) compared to other benchmarks, demonstrating its practical relevance in evaluating LLMs in clinical settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16040v5,2024-02
Understanding Public Perceptions of AI Conversational Agents: A Cross-Cultural Analysis,"Zihan Liu, Han Li, Anfan Chen, Renwen Zhang, Yi-Chieh Lee","Conversational Agents (CAs) have increasingly been integrated into everyday life, sparking significant discussions on social media. While previous research has examined public perceptions of AI in general, there is a notable lack in research focused on CAs, with fewer investigations into cultural variations in CA perceptions. To address this gap, this study used computational methods to analyze about one million social media discussions surrounding CAs and compared people's discourses and perceptions of CAs in the US and China. We find Chinese participants tended to view CAs hedonically, perceived voice-based and physically embodied CAs as warmer and more competent, and generally expressed positive emotions. In contrast, US participants saw CAs more functionally, with an ambivalent attitude. Warm perception was a key driver of positive emotions toward CAs in both countries. We discussed practical implications for designing contextually sensitive and user-centric CAs to resonate with various users' preferences and needs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16039v1,2024-02

GraphWiz: An Instruction-Following Language Model for Graph Problems,"Nuo Chen, Yuhan Li, Jianheng Tang, Jia Li","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success across several fields, but their proficiency in understanding and resolving complex graph problems is less explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GraphInstruct, a novel and comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset designed to equip language models with the ability to tackle a broad spectrum of graph problems using explicit reasoning paths. Utilizing GraphInstruct, we build GraphWiz, an open-source language model capable of resolving various graph problem types while generating clear reasoning processes.

HiGPT: Heterogeneous Graph Language Model,"Jiabin Tang, Yuhao Yang, Wei Wei, Lei Shi, Long Xia, Dawei Yin, Chao Huang","Heterogeneous graph learning aims to capture complex relationships and diverse relational semantics among entities in a heterogeneous graph to obtain meaningful representations for nodes and edges. Recent advancements in heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance by considering relation heterogeneity and using specialized message functions and aggregation rules. However, existing frameworks for heterogeneous graph learning have limitations in generalizing across diverse heterogeneous graph datasets. Most of these frameworks follow the ""pre-train"" and ""fine-tune"" paradigm on the same dataset, which restricts their capacity to adapt to new and unseen data. This raises the question: ""Can we generalize heterogeneous graph models to be well-adapted to diverse downstream learning tasks with distribution shifts in both node token sets and relation type heterogeneity?'' To tackle those challenges, we propose HiGPT, a general large graph model with Heterogeneous graph instruction-tuning paradigm. Our framework enables learning from arbitrary heterogeneous graphs without the need for any fine-tuning process from downstream datasets. To handle distribution shifts in heterogeneity, we introduce an in-context heterogeneous graph tokenizer that captures semantic relationships in different heterogeneous graphs, facilitating model adaptation. We incorporate a large corpus of heterogeneity-aware graph instructions into our HiGPT, enabling the model to effectively comprehend complex relation heterogeneity and distinguish between various types of graph tokens. Furthermore, we introduce the Mixture-of-Thought (MoT) instruction augmentation paradigm to mitigate data scarcity by generating diverse and informative instructions.

However, the limited number of paired multi-modal data and the large computational requirements in multi-modal learning hinder the development. We propose a novel Tri-Modal Translation (TMT) model that translates between arbitrary modalities spanning speech, image, and text. We introduce a novel viewpoint, where we interpret different modalities as different languages, and treat multi-modal translation as a well-established machine translation problem. To this end, we tokenize speech and image data into discrete tokens, which provide a unified interface across modalities and significantly decrease the computational cost. In the proposed TMT, a multi-modal encoder-decoder conducts the core translation, whereas modality-specific processing is conducted only within the tokenization and detokenization stages. We evaluate the proposed TMT on all six modality translation tasks. TMT outperforms single model counterparts consistently, demonstrating that unifying tasks is beneficial not only for practicality but also for performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16021v1,2024-02
LoRA Meets Dropout under a Unified Framework,"Sheng Wang, Liheng Chen, Jiyue Jiang, Boyang Xue, Lingpeng Kong, Chuan Wu","With the remarkable capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as essential elements in numerous NLP applications, while parameter-efficient finetuning, especially LoRA, has gained popularity as a lightweight approach for model customization. Meanwhile, various dropout methods, initially designed for full finetuning with all the parameters updated, alleviates overfitting associated with excessive parameter redundancy. Hence, a possible contradiction arises from negligible trainable parameters of LoRA and the effectiveness of previous dropout methods, which has been largely overlooked. To fill this gap, we first confirm that parameter-efficient LoRA is also overfitting-prone. We then revisit transformer-specific dropout methods, and establish their equivalence and distinctions mathematically and empirically. Building upon this comparative analysis, we introduce a unified framework for a comprehensive investigation, which instantiates these methods based on dropping position, structural pattern and compensation measure. Through this framework, we reveal the new preferences and performance comparisons of them when involved with limited trainable parameters. This framework also allows us to amalgamate the most favorable aspects into a novel dropout method named HiddenKey.

The billion-scale citation relations between papers hinder researchers from understanding the evolution of science efficiently. To date, there is still a lack of an accurate and scalable dataset constructed by professional researchers to identify the direct source of their studied papers, based on which automatic algorithms can be developed to expand the evolutionary knowledge of science. In this paper, we study the problem of paper source tracing (PST) and construct a high-quality and ever-increasing dataset PST-Bench in computer science. Based on PST-Bench, we reveal several intriguing discoveries, such as the differing evolution patterns across various topics. An exploration of various methods underscores the hardness of PST-Bench, pinpointing potential directions on this topic.

ASETF: A Novel Method for Jailbreak Attack on LLMs through Translate Suffix Embeddings,"Hao Wang, Hao Li, Minlie Huang, Lei Sha","The safety defense methods of Large language models(LLMs) stays limited because the dangerous prompts are manually curated to just few known attack types, which fails to keep pace with emerging varieties. Recent studies found that attaching suffixes to harmful instructions can hack the defense of LLMs and lead to dangerous outputs. However, similar to traditional text adversarial attacks, this approach, while effective, is limited by the challenge of the discrete tokens. This gradient based discrete optimization attack requires over 100,000 LLM calls, and due to the unreadable of adversarial suffixes, it can be relatively easily penetrated by common defense methods such as perplexity filters. To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we proposes an Adversarial Suffix Embedding Translation Framework (ASETF), aimed at transforming continuous adversarial suffix embeddings into coherent and understandable text. This method greatly reduces the computational overhead during the attack process and helps to automatically generate multiple adversarial samples, which can be used as data to strengthen LLMs security defense. Experimental evaluations were conducted on Llama2, Vicuna, and other prominent LLMs, employing harmful directives sourced from the Advbench dataset. The results indicate that our method significantly reduces the computation time of adversarial suffixes and achieves a much better attack success rate to existing techniques, while significantly enhancing the textual fluency of the prompts. In addition, our approach can be generalized into a broader method for generating transferable adversarial suffixes that can successfully attack multiple LLMs, even black-box LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Gemini.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16006v2,2024-02
A Machine Learning Approach to Detect Customer Satisfaction From Multiple Tweet Parameters,"Md Mahmudul Hasan, Shaikh Anowarul Fattah","Since internet technologies have advanced, one of the primary factors in company development is customer happiness. Online platforms have become prominent places for sharing reviews. Twitter is one of these platforms where customers frequently post their thoughts. Reviews of flights on these platforms have become a concern for the airline business. A positive review can help the company grow, while a negative one can quickly ruin its revenue and reputation. So it's vital for airline businesses to examine the feedback and experiences of their customers and enhance their services to remain competitive. But studying thousands of tweets and analyzing them to find the satisfaction of the customer is quite a difficult task. This tedious process can be made easier by using a machine learning approach to analyze tweets to determine client satisfaction levels. Some work has already been done on this strategy to automate the procedure using machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, they are all purely concerned with assessing the text's sentiment. In addition to the text, the tweet also includes the time, location, username, airline name, and so on. This additional information can be crucial for improving the model's outcome. To provide a machine learning based solution, this work has broadened its perspective to include these qualities. And it has come as no surprise that the additional features beyond text sentiment analysis produce better outcomes in machine learning based models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15992v1,2024-02
$C^3$: Confidence Calibration Model Cascade for Inference-Efficient Cross-Lingual Natural Language Understanding,"Taixi Lu, Haoyu Wang, Huajie Shao, Jing Gao, Huaxiu Yao","Cross-lingual natural language understanding (NLU) is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP). Recent advancements have seen multilingual pre-trained language models (mPLMs) significantly enhance the performance of these tasks. However, mPLMs necessitate substantial resources and incur high computational costs during inference, posing challenges for deployment in real-world and real-time systems. Existing model cascade methods seek to enhance inference efficiency by greedily selecting the lightest model capable of processing the current input from a variety of models, based on model confidence scores. Nonetheless, deep models tend to exhibit overconfidence, and confidence distributions vary across languages. This leads to the emission of confident but incorrect predictions by smaller models, hindering their ability to generalize effectively across test languages. In this study, we introduce a confidence calibration model cascade ($C^3$) method. This approach, simple yet effective, involves calibration prior to cascade inference, thereby enhancing cascade accuracy through more reliable predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on three cross-lingual benchmarks demonstrate that $C^3$ significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15991v1,2024-02
Likelihood-based Mitigation of Evaluation Bias in Large Language Models,"Masanari Ohi, Masahiro Kaneko, Ryuto Koike, Mengsay Loem, Naoaki Okazaki","Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate natural language generation tasks as automated metrics. However, the likelihood, a measure of LLM's plausibility for a sentence, can vary due to superficial differences in sentences, such as word order and sentence structure. It is therefore possible that there might be a likelihood bias if LLMs are used for evaluation: they might overrate sentences with higher likelihoods while underrating those with lower likelihoods. In this paper, we investigate the presence and impact of likelihood bias in LLM-based evaluators. We also propose a method to mitigate the likelihood bias. Our method utilizes highly biased instances as few-shot examples for in-context learning. Our experiments in evaluating the data-to-text and grammatical error correction tasks reveal that several LLMs we test display a likelihood bias. Furthermore, our proposed method successfully mitigates this bias, also improving evaluation performance (in terms of correlation of models with human scores) significantly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15987v3,2024-02
Phonetic and Lexical Discovery of a Canine Language using HuBERT,"Xingyuan Li, Sinong Wang, Zeyu Xie, Mengyue Wu, Kenny Q.

We present a self-supervised approach with HuBERT, enabling the accurate classification of phoneme labels and the identification of vocal patterns that suggest a rudimentary vocabulary within dog vocalizations. Our findings indicate a significant acoustic consistency in these identified canine vocabulary, covering the entirety of observed dog vocalization sequences. We further develop a web-based dog vocalization labeling system. This system can highlight phoneme n-grams, present in the vocabulary, in the dog audio uploaded by users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15985v1,2024-02
Direct Punjabi to English speech translation using discrete units,"Prabhjot Kaur, L. Andrew M. Bush, Weisong Shi","Speech-to-speech translation is yet to reach the same level of coverage as text-to-text translation systems. The current speech technology is highly limited in its coverage of over 7000 languages spoken worldwide, leaving more than half of the population deprived of such technology and shared experiences. With voice-assisted technology (such as social robots and speech-to-text apps) and auditory content (such as podcasts and lectures) on the rise, ensuring that the technology is available for all is more important than ever. Speech translation can play a vital role in mitigating technological disparity and creating a more inclusive society. With a motive to contribute towards speech translation research for low-resource languages, our work presents a direct speech-to-speech translation model for one of the Indic languages called Punjabi to English. Additionally, we explore the performance of using a discrete representation of speech called discrete acoustic units as input to the Transformer-based translation model. The model, abbreviated as Unit-to-Unit Translation (U2UT), takes a sequence of discrete units of the source language (the language being translated from) and outputs a sequence of discrete units of the target language (the language being translated to). Our results show that the U2UT model performs better than the Speech-to-Unit Translation (S2UT) model by a 3.69 BLEU score.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15967v1,2024-02
Cognitive Bias in Decision-Making with LLMs,"Jessica Echterhoff, Yao Liu, Abeer Alessa, Julian McAuley, Zexue He","Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential as tools to support an expanding range of decision-making tasks. Given their training on human (created) data, LLMs have been shown to inherit societal biases against protected groups, as well as be subject to bias functionally resembling cognitive bias. Human-like bias can impede fair and explainable decisions made with LLM assistance. Our work introduces BiasBuster, a framework designed to uncover, evaluate, and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes decision-making tasks. Inspired by prior research in psychology and cognitive science, we develop a dataset containing 13,465 prompts to evaluate LLM decisions on different cognitive biases (e.g., prompt-induced, sequential, inherent). We test various bias mitigation strategies, while proposing a novel method utilizing LLMs to debias their own human-like cognitive bias within prompts. Our analysis provides a comprehensive picture of the presence and effects of cognitive bias across commercial and open-source models. We demonstrate that our selfhelp debiasing effectively mitigates model answers that display patterns akin to human cognitive bias without having to manually craft examples for each bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00811v3,2024-02
DetoxLLM: A Framework for Detoxification with Explanations,"Md Tawkat Islam Khondaker, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, Laks V. S. Lakshmanan","Prior works on detoxification are scattered in the sense that they do not cover all aspects of detoxification needed in a real-world scenario. Notably, prior works restrict the task of developing detoxification models to only a seen subset of platforms, leaving the question of how the models would perform on unseen platforms unexplored. Additionally, these works do not address non-detoxifiability, a phenomenon whereby the toxic text cannot be detoxified without altering the meaning. We propose DetoxLLM, the first comprehensive end-to-end detoxification framework, which attempts to alleviate the aforementioned limitations. We first introduce a cross-platform pseudo-parallel corpus applying multi-step data processing and generation strategies leveraging ChatGPT. We then train a suite of detoxification models with our cross-platform corpus. We show that our detoxification models outperform the SoTA model trained with human-annotated parallel corpus. We further introduce explanation to promote transparency and trustworthiness. DetoxLLM additionally offers a unique paraphrase detector especially dedicated for the detoxification task to tackle the non-detoxifiable cases. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our cross-platform corpus and the robustness of DetoxLLM against adversarial toxicity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15951v2,2024-02
Bootstrapping Cognitive Agents with a Large Language Model,"Feiyu Zhu, Reid Simmons","Large language models contain noisy general knowledge of the world, yet are hard to train or fine-tune. On the other hand cognitive architectures have excellent interpretability and are flexible to update but require a lot of manual work to instantiate. In this work, we combine the best of both worlds: bootstrapping a cognitive-based model with the noisy knowledge encoded in large language models. Through an embodied agent doing kitchen tasks, we show that our proposed framework yields better efficiency compared to an agent based entirely on large language models. Our experiments indicate that large language models are a good source of information for cognitive architectures, and the cognitive architecture in turn can verify and update the knowledge of large language models to a specific domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00810v1,2024-02
Debug like a Human: A Large Language Model Debugger via Verifying Runtime Execution Step-by-step,"Li Zhong, Zilong Wang, Jingbo Shang","Large language models (LLMs) are leading significant progress in code generation. Beyond one-pass code generation, recent works further integrate unit tests and program verifiers into LLMs to iteratively refine the generated programs. However, these works consider the generated programs as an indivisible entity, which falls short for LLMs in debugging the programs, especially when the programs contain complex logic flows and data operations. In contrast, when human developers debug programs, they typically set breakpoints and selectively examine runtime execution information. The execution flow and the intermediate variables play a crucial role in the debugging process, yet they are underutilized in the existing literature on code generation. In this study, we introduce Large Language Model Debugger (LDB), a novel debugging framework that enables LLMs to refine their generated programs with the runtime execution information. Specifically, LDB segments the programs into basic blocks and tracks the values of intermediate variables after each block throughout the runtime execution. This allows LLMs to concentrate on simpler code units within the overall execution flow, verify their correctness against the task description block by block, and efficiently pinpoint any potential errors. Experiments demonstrate that LDB consistently enhances the baseline performance by up to 9.8% across the HumanEval, MBPP, and TransCoder benchmarks, archiving new state-of-the-art performance in code debugging for various LLM selections.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16906v6,2024-02
Generalization or Memorization: Data Contamination and Trustworthy Evaluation for Large Language Models,"Yihong Dong, Xue Jiang, Huanyu Liu, Zhi Jin, Bin Gu, Mengfei Yang, Ge Li","Recent statements about the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are usually supported by evaluating on open-access benchmarks. Considering the vast size and wide-ranging sources of LLMs' training data, it could explicitly or implicitly include test data, leading to LLMs being more susceptible to data contamination. However, due to the opacity of training data, the black-box access of models, and the rapid growth of synthetic training data, detecting and mitigating data contamination for LLMs faces significant challenges. In this paper, we propose CDD, which stands for Contamination Detection via output Distribution for LLMs. CDD necessitates only the sampled texts to detect data contamination, by identifying the peakedness of LLM's output distribution. To mitigate the impact of data contamination in evaluation, we also present TED: Trustworthy Evaluation via output Distribution, based on the correction of LLM's output distribution. To facilitate this study, we introduce two benchmarks, i.e., DetCon and ComiEval, for data contamination detection and contamination mitigation evaluation tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CDD achieves the average relative improvements of 21.8\%-30.2\% over other contamination detection approaches in terms of Accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC metrics, and can effectively detect implicit contamination. TED substantially mitigates performance improvements up to 66.9\% attributed to data contamination across various contamination setups. In real-world applications, we reveal that ChatGPT exhibits a high potential to suffer from data contamination on HumanEval benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15938v3,2024-02
Bridging the Gap between 2D and 3D Visual Question Answering: A Fusion Approach for 3D VQA,"Wentao Mo, Yang Liu","In 3D Visual Question Answering (3D VQA), the scarcity of fully annotated data and limited visual content diversity hampers the generalization to novel scenes and 3D concepts (e.g., only around 800 scenes are utilized in ScanQA and SQA dataset). Current approaches resort supplement 3D reasoning with 2D information. However, these methods face challenges: either they use top-down 2D views that introduce overly complex and sometimes question-irrelevant visual clues, or they rely on globally aggregated scene/image-level representations from 2D VLMs, losing the fine-grained vision-language correlations. To overcome these limitations, our approach utilizes question-conditional 2D view selection procedure, pinpointing semantically relevant 2D inputs for crucial visual clues. We then integrate this 2D knowledge into the 3D-VQA system via a two-branch Transformer structure. This structure, featuring a Twin-Transformer design, compactly combines 2D and 3D modalities and captures fine-grained correlations between modalities, allowing them mutually augmenting each other. Integrating proposed mechanisms above, we present BridgeQA, that offers a fresh perspective on multi-modal transformer-based architectures for 3D-VQA. Experiments validate that BridgeQA achieves state-of-the-art on 3D-VQA datasets and significantly outperforms existing solutions.

Evaluating Prompting Strategies for Grammatical Error Correction Based on Language Proficiency,"Min Zeng, Jiexin Kuang, Mengyang Qiu, Jayoung Song, Jungyeul Park","The writing examples of English language learners may be different from those of native speakers. Given that there is a significant differences in second language (L2) learners' error types by their proficiency levels, this paper attempts to reduce overcorrection by examining the interaction between LLM's performance and L2 language proficiency. Our method focuses on zero-shot and few-shot prompting and fine-tuning models for GEC for learners of English as a foreign language based on the different proficiency. We investigate GEC results and find that overcorrection happens primarily in advanced language learners' writing (proficiency C) rather than proficiency A (a beginner level) and proficiency B (an intermediate level). Fine-tuned LLMs, and even few-shot prompting with writing examples of English learners, actually tend to exhibit decreased recall measures. To make our claim concrete, we conduct a comprehensive examination of GEC outcomes and their evaluation results based on language proficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15930v1,2024-02
Decoding Intelligence: A Framework for Certifying Knowledge Comprehension in LLMs,"Isha Chaudhary, Vedaant V. Jain, Gagandeep Singh","Knowledge comprehension capability is an important aspect of human intelligence. As Large Language Models (LLMs) are being envisioned as superhuman agents, it is crucial for them to be proficient at knowledge comprehension. However, existing benchmarking studies do not provide consistent, generalizable, and formal guarantees on the knowledge comprehension capabilities of LLMs. In this work, we propose the first framework to certify knowledge comprehension in LLMs with formal probabilistic guarantees. Our certificates are quantitative -- they consist of high-confidence, tight bounds on the probability that a target LLM gives the correct answer on any knowledge comprehension prompt sampled from a distribution. We design and certify novel specifications that precisely represent distributions of knowledge comprehension prompts leveraging knowledge graphs. We certify SOTA LLMs for specifications over the Wikidata5m knowledge graph. We find that the knowledge comprehension capability improves significantly with scaling the size of the models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15929v2,2024-02
MultiContrievers: Analysis of Dense Retrieval Representations,"Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant, Pedro Rodriguez, Jane Dwivedi-Yu, Patrick Lewis","Dense retrievers compress source documents into (possibly lossy) vector representations, yet there is little analysis of what information is lost versus preserved, and how it affects downstream tasks. We conduct the first analysis of the information captured by dense retrievers compared to the language models they are based on (e.g., BERT versus Contriever). We use 25 MultiBert checkpoints as randomized initialisations to train MultiContrievers, a set of 25 contriever models. We test whether specific pieces of information -- such as gender and occupation -- can be extracted from contriever vectors of wikipedia-like documents. We measure this extractability via information theoretic probing. We then examine the relationship of extractability to performance and gender bias, as well as the sensitivity of these results to many random initialisations and data shuffles. We find that (1) contriever models have significantly increased extractability, but extractability usually correlates poorly with benchmark performance 2) gender bias is present, but is not caused by the contriever representations 3) there is high sensitivity to both random initialisation and to data shuffle, suggesting that future retrieval research should test across a wider spread of both.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15925v2,2024-02
PRP: Propagating Universal Perturbations to Attack Large Language Model Guard-Rails,"Neal Mangaokar, Ashish Hooda, Jihye Choi, Shreyas Chandrashekaran, Kassem Fawaz, Somesh Jha, Atul Prakash","Large language models (LLMs) are typically aligned to be harmless to humans. Unfortunately, recent work has shown that such models are susceptible to automated jailbreak attacks that induce them to generate harmful content. More recent LLMs often incorporate an additional layer of defense, a Guard Model, which is a second LLM that is designed to check and moderate the output response of the primary LLM. Our key contribution is to show a novel attack strategy, PRP, that is successful against several open-source (e.g., Llama 2) and closed-source (e.g., GPT 3.5) implementations of Guard Models. PRP leverages a two step prefix-based attack that operates by (a) constructing a universal adversarial prefix for the Guard Model, and (b) propagating this prefix to the response. We find that this procedure is effective across multiple threat models, including ones in which the adversary has no access to the Guard Model at all. Our work suggests that further advances are required on defenses and Guard Models before they can be considered effective.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15911v1,2024-02

SportQA: A Benchmark for Sports Understanding in Large Language Models,"Haotian Xia, Zhengbang Yang, Yuqing Wang, Rhys Tracy, Yun Zhao, Dongdong Huang, Zezhi Chen, Yan Zhu, Yuan-fang Wang, Weining Shen","A deep understanding of sports, a field rich in strategic and dynamic content, is crucial for advancing Natural Language Processing (NLP). This holds particular significance in the context of evaluating and advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), given the existing gap in specialized benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SportQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs in the context of sports understanding. SportQA encompasses over 70,000 multiple-choice questions across three distinct difficulty levels, each targeting different aspects of sports knowledge from basic historical facts to intricate, scenario-based reasoning tasks. We conducted a thorough evaluation of prevalent LLMs, mainly utilizing few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Our results reveal that while LLMs exhibit competent performance in basic sports knowledge, they struggle with more complex, scenario-based sports reasoning, lagging behind human expertise. The introduction of SportQA marks a significant step forward in NLP, offering a tool for assessing and enhancing sports understanding in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15862v2,2024-02
MATHWELL: Generating Educational Math Word Problems Using Teacher Annotations,"Bryan R Christ, Jonathan Kropko, Thomas Hartvigsen","Math word problems are critical K-8 educational tools, but writing them is time consuming and requires extensive expertise. To be educational, problems must be solvable, have accurate answers, and, most importantly, be educationally appropriate. We propose that language models have potential to support K-8 math education by automatically generating word problems. However, evaluating educational appropriateness is hard to quantify. We fill this gap by having teachers evaluate problems generated by LLMs, who find existing models and data often fail to be educationally appropriate. We then explore automatically generating educational word problems, ultimately using our expert annotations to finetune a 70B language model. Our model, MATHWELL, is the first K-8 word problem generator targeted at educational appropriateness. Further expert studies find MATHWELL generates problems far more solvable, accurate, and appropriate than public models. MATHWELL also matches GPT-4's problem quality while attaining more appropriate reading levels for K-8 students and avoiding generating harmful questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15861v5,2024-02
Prompt Perturbation Consistency Learning for Robust Language Models,"Yao Qiang, Subhrangshu Nandi, Ninareh Mehrabi, Greg Ver Steeg, Anoop Kumar, Anna Rumshisky, Aram Galstyan","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on a number of natural language processing tasks, such as question answering and text summarization. However, their performance on sequence labeling tasks such as intent classification and slot filling (IC-SF), which is a central component in personal assistant systems, lags significantly behind discriminative models. Furthermore, there is a lack of substantive research on the robustness of LLMs to various perturbations in the input prompts. The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we show that fine-tuning sufficiently large LLMs can produce IC-SF performance comparable to discriminative models. Next, we systematically analyze the performance deterioration of those fine-tuned models due to three distinct yet relevant types of input perturbations - oronyms, synonyms, and paraphrasing. Finally, we propose an efficient mitigation approach, Prompt Perturbation Consistency Learning (PPCL), which works by regularizing the divergence between losses from clean and perturbed samples. Our experiments demonstrate that PPCL can recover on average 59% and 69% of the performance drop for IC and SF tasks, respectively. Furthermore, PPCL beats the data augmentation approach while using ten times fewer augmented data samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15833v1,2024-02
IPED: An Implicit Perspective for Relational Triple Extraction based on Diffusion Model,"Jianli Zhao, Changhao Xu, Bin Jiang","Relational triple extraction is a fundamental task in the field of information extraction, and a promising framework based on table filling has recently gained attention as a potential baseline for entity relation extraction. However, inherent shortcomings such as redundant information and incomplete triple recognition remain problematic. To address these challenges, we propose an Implicit Perspective for relational triple Extraction based on Diffusion model (IPED), an innovative approach for extracting relational triples. Our classifier-free solution adopts an implicit strategy using block coverage to complete the tables, avoiding the limitations of explicit tagging methods. Additionally, we introduce a generative model structure, the block-denoising diffusion model, to collaborate with our implicit perspective and effectively circumvent redundant information disruptions. Experimental results on two popular datasets demonstrate that IPED achieves state-of-the-art performance while gaining superior inference speed and low computational complexity.

Linguistic Intelligence in Large Language Models for Telecommunications,"Tasnim Ahmed, Nicola Piovesan, Antonio De Domenico, Salimur Choudhury","Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language generation and other language-centric tasks. Despite their evaluation across a multitude of analytical and reasoning tasks in various scientific domains, a comprehensive exploration of their knowledge and understanding within the realm of natural language tasks in the telecommunications domain is still needed. This study, therefore, seeks to evaluate the knowledge and understanding capabilities of LLMs within this domain. To achieve this, we conduct an exhaustive zero-shot evaluation of four prominent LLMs-Llama-2, Falcon, Mistral, and Zephyr. These models require fewer resources than ChatGPT, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments. Their performance is compared with state-of-the-art, fine-tuned models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extensively evaluate and compare the understanding of LLMs across multiple language-centric tasks in this domain. Our evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLMs can achieve performance levels comparable to the current state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. This indicates that pretraining on extensive text corpora equips LLMs with a degree of specialization, even within the telecommunications domain. We also observe that no single LLM consistently outperforms others, and the performance of different LLMs can fluctuate. Although their performance lags behind fine-tuned models, our findings underscore the potential of LLMs as a valuable resource for understanding various aspects of this field that lack large annotated data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15818v1,2024-02
On Efficiently Representing Regular Languages as RNNs,"Anej Svete, Robin Shing Moon Chan, Ryan Cotterell","Recent work by Hewitt et al. (2020) provides an interpretation of the empirical success of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as language models (LMs). It shows that RNNs can efficiently represent bounded hierarchical structures that are prevalent in human language. This suggests that RNNs' success might be linked to their ability to model hierarchy. However, a closer inspection of Hewitt et al.'s (2020) construction shows that it is not inherently limited to hierarchical structures. This poses a natural question: What other classes of LMs can RNNs efficiently represent? To this end, we generalize Hewitt et al.'s (2020) construction and show that RNNs can efficiently represent a larger class of LMs than previously claimed -- specifically, those that can be represented by a pushdown automaton with a bounded stack and a specific stack update function. Altogether, the efficiency of representing this diverse class of LMs with RNN LMs suggests novel interpretations of their inductive bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15814v2,2024-02
Measuring Bargaining Abilities of LLMs: A Benchmark and A Buyer-Enhancement Method,"Tian Xia, Zhiwei He, Tong Ren, Yibo Miao, Zhuosheng Zhang, Yang Yang, Rui Wang","Bargaining is an important and unique part of negotiation between humans. As LLM-driven agents learn to negotiate and act like real humans, how to evaluate agents' bargaining abilities remains an open problem. For the first time, we formally described the Bargaining task as an asymmetric incomplete information game, defining the gains of the Buyer and Seller in multiple bargaining processes. It allows us to quantitatively assess an agent's performance in the Bargain task. We collected a real product price dataset, AmazonHistoryPrice, and conducted evaluations of various LLM agents' bargaining abilities. We find that playing a Buyer is much harder than a Seller, and increasing model size can not effectively improve the Buyer's performance. To address the challenge, we propose a novel approach called OG-Narrator that integrates a deterministic Offer Generator to control the price range of Buyer's offers, and an LLM Narrator to create natural language sentences for generated offers. Experimental results show that OG-Narrator improves the buyer's deal rates from 26.67% to 88.88% and brings a ten times multiplication of profits on all baselines, even a model that has not been aligned.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15813v3,2024-02

We propose new data annotation strategies for certain tasks and offer a suite of data pre-processing codes, algorithm implementations, and standardized evaluation protocols to facilitate academic graph mining. Extensive experiments reveal that even advanced algorithms like large language models (LLMs) encounter difficulties in addressing key challenges in certain tasks, such as paper source tracing and scholar profiling. We also introduce the Open Academic Graph Challenge (OAG-Challenge) to encourage community input and sharing. We envisage that OAG-Bench can serve as a common ground for the community to evaluate and compare algorithms in academic graph mining, thereby accelerating algorithm development and advancement in this field.

Empowering Large Language Model Agents through Action Learning,"Haiteng Zhao, Chang Ma, Guoyin Wang, Jing Su, Lingpeng Kong, Jingjing Xu, Zhi-Hong Deng, Hongxia Yang","Large Language Model (LLM) Agents have recently garnered increasing interest yet they are limited in their ability to learn from trial and error, a key element of intelligent behavior. In this work, we argue that the capacity to learn new actions from experience is fundamental to the advancement of learning in LLM agents. While humans naturally expand their action spaces and develop skills through experiential learning, LLM agents typically operate within fixed action spaces, limiting their potential for growth. To address these challenges, our study explores open-action learning for language agents. We introduce a framework LearnAct with an iterative learning strategy to create and improve actions in the form of Python functions. In each iteration, LLM revises and updates the currently available actions based on the errors identified in unsuccessful training tasks, thereby enhancing action effectiveness. Our experimental evaluations across Robotic Planning and Alfworld environments reveal that after learning on a few training task instances, our approach to open-action learning markedly improves agent performance for the type of task (by 32 percent in AlfWorld compared to ReAct+Reflexion, for instance) highlighting the importance of experiential action learning in the development of more intelligent LLM agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15809v2,2024-02
Enhancing Cloud-Based Large Language Model Processing with Elasticsearch and Transformer Models,"Chunhe Ni, Jiang Wu, Hongbo Wang, Wenran Lu, Chenwei Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of generative AI models built using the Transformer network, capable of leveraging vast datasets to identify, summarize, translate, predict, and generate language. LLMs promise to revolutionize society, yet training these foundational models poses immense challenges. Semantic vector search within large language models is a potent technique that can significantly enhance search result accuracy and relevance. Unlike traditional keyword-based search methods, semantic search utilizes the meaning and context of words to grasp the intent behind queries and deliver more precise outcomes. Elasticsearch emerges as one of the most popular tools for implementing semantic search an exceptionally scalable and robust search engine designed for indexing and searching extensive datasets. In this article, we delve into the fundamentals of semantic search and explore how to harness Elasticsearch and Transformer models to bolster large language model processing paradigms. We gain a comprehensive understanding of semantic search principles and acquire practical skills for implementing semantic search in real-world model application scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00807v1,2024-02
Enhanced User Interaction in Operating Systems through Machine Learning Language Models,"Chenwei Zhang, Wenran Lu, Chunhe Ni, Hongbo Wang, Jiang Wu","With the large language model showing human-like logical reasoning and understanding ability, whether agents based on the large language model can simulate the interaction behavior of real users, so as to build a reliable virtual recommendation A/B test scene to help the application of recommendation research is an urgent, important and economic value problem. The combination of interaction design and machine learning can provide a more efficient and personalized user experience for products and services. This personalized service can meet the specific needs of users and improve user satisfaction and loyalty. Second, the interactive system can understand the user's views and needs for the product by providing a good user interface and interactive experience, and then use machine learning algorithms to improve and optimize the product. This iterative optimization process can continuously improve the quality and performance of the product to meet the changing needs of users. At the same time, designers need to consider how these algorithms and tools can be combined with interactive systems to provide a good user experience. This paper explores the potential applications of large language models, machine learning and interaction design for user interaction in recommendation systems and operating systems.

Look Before You Leap: Problem Elaboration Prompting Improves Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Haoran Liao, Jidong Tian, Shaohua Hu, Hao He, Yaohui Jin","Large language models (LLMs) still grapple with complex tasks like mathematical reasoning. Despite significant efforts invested in improving prefix prompts or reasoning process, the crucial role of problem context might have been neglected. Accurate recognition of inputs is fundamental for solving mathematical tasks, as ill-formed problems could potentially mislead LLM's reasoning. In this study, we propose a new approach named Problem Elaboration Prompting (PEP) to enhance the mathematical capacities of LLMs. Specifically, PEP decomposes and elucidates the problem context before reasoning, therefore enhancing the context modeling and parsing efficiency. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate promising performances: (1) PEP demonstrates an overall enhancement in various mathematical tasks. For instance, with the GPT-3.5 model, PEP exhibits improvements of 9.93% and 8.80% on GSM8k through greedy decoding and self-consistency, respectively. (2) PEP can be easily implemented and integrated with other prompting methods. (3) PEP shows particular strength in handling distraction problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15764v2,2024-02
Stepwise Self-Consistent Mathematical Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Zilong Zhao, Yao Rong, Dongyang Guo, Emek Gözlüklü, Emir Gülboy, Enkelejda Kasneci","Using Large Language Models for complex mathematical reasoning is difficult, primarily due to the complexity of multi-step reasoning. The main challenges of this process include (1) selecting critical intermediate results to advance the procedure, and (2) limited exploration of potential solutions. To address these issues, we introduce a novel algorithm, namely Stepwise Self-Consistent Chain-of-Thought (SSC-CoT). SSC-CoT employs a strategy of selecting intermediate steps based on the intersection of various reasoning chains. Additionally, SSC-CoT enables the model to discover critical intermediate steps by querying a knowledge graph comprising relevant domain knowledge. To validate SSC-CoT, we present a new dataset, TriMaster100, tailored for complex trigonometry problems. This dataset contains 100 questions, with each solution broken down into scored intermediate steps, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of the mathematical reasoning process. On TriMaster100, SSC-CoT triples the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we benchmark SSC-CoT on the widely recognized complex mathematical question dataset, MATH level 5, and it surpasses the second-best method by 7.2% in accuracy.

Chimera: A Lossless Decoding Method for Accelerating Large Language Models Inference by Fusing all Tokens,"Ziqian Zeng, Jiahong Yu, Qianshi Pang, Zihao Wang, Huiping Zhuang, Hongen Shao, Xiaofeng Zou","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, their widespread application is hindered by the resource-intensive decoding process. To address this challenge, current approaches have incorporated additional decoding heads to enable parallel prediction of multiple subsequent tokens, thereby achieving inference acceleration. Nevertheless, the accuracy of these decoding heads falls short of the auto-regressive decoding approach.   In light of these limitations, we propose Chimera, a novel framework specifically designed for speculative sampling. Within this framework, we introduce a lightweight draft model that effectively utilizes previously generated tokens to predict subsequent words. To ensure both accuracy and efficiency, we present two strategies within the lightweight draft model. Firstly, we focus on capturing short-range dependencies at the bottom layer. Secondly, we leverage the readily available representations from the original LLM.Through empirical evaluation on the Vicuna and LlaMA-2 series, Chimera demonstrates impressive results, achieving an average latency speedup ratio of 2.7x compared to the vanilla auto-regressive decoding approach. This highlights the potential of our proposed framework in significantly improving the efficiency of large language models during the decoding process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15758v2,2024-02
Dental Severity Assessment through Few-shot Learning and SBERT Fine-tuning,Mohammad Dehghani,"Dental diseases have a significant impact on a considerable portion of the population, leading to various health issues that can detrimentally affect individuals' overall well-being. The integration of automated systems in oral healthcare has become increasingly crucial. Machine learning approaches offer a viable solution to address challenges such as diagnostic difficulties, inefficiencies, and errors in oral disease diagnosis. These methods prove particularly useful when physicians struggle to predict or diagnose diseases at their early stages. In this study, thirteen different machine learning, deep learning, and large language models were employed to determine the severity level of oral health issues based on radiologists' reports. The results revealed that the Few-shot learning with SBERT and Multi-Layer Perceptron model outperformed all other models across various experiments, achieving an impressive accuracy of 94.1% as the best result. Consequently, this model exhibits promise as a reliable tool for evaluating the severity of oral diseases, enabling patients to receive more effective treatment and aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation and the management of high-risk patients.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15755v2,2024-02
HD-Eval: Aligning Large Language Model Evaluators Through Hierarchical Criteria Decomposition,"Yuxuan Liu, Tianchi Yang, Shaohan Huang, Zihan Zhang, Haizhen Huang, Furu Wei, Weiwei Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to expensive human evaluations. However, the alignment and coverage of LLM-based evaluations are often limited by the scope and potential bias of the evaluation prompts and criteria. To address this challenge, we propose HD-Eval, a novel framework that iteratively aligns LLM-based evaluators with human preference via Hierarchical Criteria Decomposition. HD-Eval inherits the essence from the evaluation mindset of human experts and enhances the alignment of LLM-based evaluators by decomposing a given evaluation task into finer-grained criteria, aggregating them according to estimated human preferences, pruning insignificant criteria with attribution, and further decomposing significant criteria. By integrating these steps within an iterative alignment training process, we obtain a hierarchical decomposition of criteria that comprehensively captures aspects of natural language at multiple levels of granularity. Implemented as a white box, the human preference-guided aggregator is efficient to train and more explainable than relying solely on prompting, and its independence from model parameters makes it applicable to closed-source LLMs. Extensive experiments on three evaluation domains demonstrate the superiority of HD-Eval in further aligning state-of-the-art evaluators and providing deeper insights into the explanation of evaluation results and the task itself.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15754v1,2024-02
Sparse MeZO: Less Parameters for Better Performance in Zeroth-Order LLM Fine-Tuning,"Yong Liu, Zirui Zhu, Chaoyu Gong, Minhao Cheng, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Yang You","While fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks often yields impressive results, it comes at the cost of memory inefficiency due to back-propagation in gradient-based training. Memory-efficient Zeroth-order (MeZO) optimizers, recently proposed to address this issue, only require forward passes during training, making them more memory-friendly. However, the quality of gradient estimates in zeroth order optimization often depends on the data dimensionality, potentially explaining why MeZO still exhibits significant performance drops compared to standard fine-tuning across various tasks. Inspired by the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), this paper introduces Sparse MeZO, a novel memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization approach that applies ZO only to a carefully chosen subset of parameters. We propose a simple yet effective parameter selection scheme that yields significant performance gains with Sparse-MeZO. Additionally, we develop a memory-optimized implementation for sparse masking, ensuring the algorithm requires only inference-level memory consumption, allowing Sparse-MeZO to fine-tune LLaMA-30b on a single A100 GPU. Experimental results illustrate that Sparse-MeZO consistently improves both performance and convergence speed over MeZO without any overhead. For example, it achieves a 9\% absolute accuracy improvement and 3.5x speedup over MeZO on the RTE task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15751v1,2024-02
GAOKAO-MM: A Chinese Human-Level Benchmark for Multimodal Models Evaluation,"Yi Zong, Xipeng Qiu","The Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated great abilities in image perception and language understanding. However, existing multimodal benchmarks focus on primary perception abilities and commonsense knowledge which are insufficient to reflect the comprehensive capabilities of LVLMs. We propose GAOKAO-MM, a multimodal benchmark based on the Chinese College Entrance Examination (GAOKAO), comprising of 8 subjects and 12 types of images, such as diagrams, function graphs, maps and photos. GAOKAO-MM derives from native Chinese context and sets human-level requirements for the model's abilities, including perception, understanding, knowledge and reasoning. We evaluate 10 LVLMs and find that the accuracies of all of them are lower than 50%, with GPT-4-Vison (48.1%), Qwen-VL-Plus (41.2%) and Gemini-Pro-Vision (35.1%) ranking in the top three positions.

Despite the development of several meme-generation tools, there remains a gap in their systematic evaluation and their ability to effectively communicate ideologies. Addressing this, we introduce MemeCraft, an innovative meme generator that leverages large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) to produce memes advocating specific social movements. MemeCraft presents an end-to-end pipeline, transforming user prompts into compelling multimodal memes without manual intervention.

ArEEG_Chars: Dataset for Envisioned Speech Recognition using EEG for Arabic Characters,"Hazem Darwish, Abdalrahman Al Malah, Khloud Al Jallad, Nada Ghneim","Brain-computer interfaces is an important and hot research topic that revolutionize how people interact with the world, especially for individuals with neurological disorders. While extensive research has been done in EEG signals of English letters and words, a major limitation remains: the lack of publicly available EEG datasets for many non-English languages, such as Arabic. Although Arabic is one of the most spoken languages worldwide, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available dataset for EEG signals of Arabic characters until now. To address this gap, we introduce ArEEG_Chars, a novel EEG dataset for Arabic 31 characters collected from 30 participants (21 males and 9 females), these records were collected using Epoc X 14 channels device for 10 seconds long for each char record. The number of recorded signals were 930 EEG recordings. To make the EEG signals suitable for analyzing, each recording has been split into multiple signals with a time duration of 250ms, respectively. Therefore, a total of 39857 recordings of EEG signals have been collected in this study. Moreover, ArEEG_Chars will be publicly available for researchers. We do hope that this dataset will fill an important gap in the research of Arabic EEG benefiting Arabic-speaking individuals with disabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15733v3,2024-02
How Do Humans Write Code? Large Models Do It the Same Way Too,"Long Li, Xuzheng He, Haozhe Wang, Linlin Wang, Liang He","Program-of-Thought (PoT) replaces natural language-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as the most popular method in Large Language Models (LLMs) mathematical reasoning tasks by utilizing external tool calls to circumvent computational errors. However, our evaluation of the GPT-4 and Llama series reveals that using PoT introduces more reasoning errors, such as incorrect formulas or flawed logic, compared to CoT. To address this issue, we propose Human-Think Language (HTL), which leverages a suite of strategies that help integrate PoT and CoT, encompassing: (1) a new generation paradigm that uses full CoT reasoning to control code generation. (2) Focus Attention, that directs model attention to the CoT reasoning during PoT to generate more logical code. (3) reinforcement learning that utilizes the accuracy of both CoT and PoT responses as rewards to prevent repetitive reasoning steps in LLMs when solving difficult math problems. Our method achieves an average improvement of 6.5% on the Llama-Base model and 4.3% on the Mistral-Base model across 8 mathematical calculation datasets. It also shows significant effectiveness on five out-of-domain datasets by controlling the model's information flow, exhibiting strong transferability. Additionally, HTL shows the most significant improvement in non-mathematical natural language inference task, contributing to a unified reasoning task framework",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15729v3,2024-02

Previous hallucination evaluation studies on LVLMs have identified hallucinations in terms of objects, attributes, and relations but overlooked complex hallucinations that create an entire narrative around a fictional entity. In this paper, we introduce a refined taxonomy of hallucinations, featuring a new category: Event Hallucination. We then utilize advanced LLMs to generate and filter fine grained hallucinatory data consisting of various types of hallucinations, with a particular focus on event hallucinations, laying the groundwork for integrating discriminative and generative evaluation methods within our universal evaluation framework. The proposed benchmark distinctively assesses LVLMs ability to tackle a broad spectrum of hallucinations, making it a reliable and comprehensive tool for gauging LVLMs efficacy in handling hallucinations.

Making Pre-trained Language Models Better Continual Few-Shot Relation Extractors,"Shengkun Ma, Jiale Han, Yi Liang, Bo Cheng","Continual Few-shot Relation Extraction (CFRE) is a practical problem that requires the model to continuously learn novel relations while avoiding forgetting old ones with few labeled training data. The primary challenges are catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. This paper harnesses prompt learning to explore the implicit capabilities of pre-trained language models to address the above two challenges, thereby making language models better continual few-shot relation extractors. Specifically, we propose a Contrastive Prompt Learning framework, which designs prompt representation to acquire more generalized knowledge that can be easily adapted to old and new categories, and margin-based contrastive learning to focus more on hard samples, therefore alleviating catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. To further remedy overfitting in low-resource scenarios, we introduce an effective memory augmentation strategy that employs well-crafted prompts to guide ChatGPT in generating diverse samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin and significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and overfitting in low-resource scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15713v1,2024-02
Query Augmentation by Decoding Semantics from Brain Signals,"Ziyi Ye, Jingtao Zhan, Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu, Maarten de Rijke, Christina Lioma, Tuukka Ruotsalo","Query augmentation is a crucial technique for refining semantically imprecise queries. Traditionally, query augmentation relies on extracting information from initially retrieved, potentially relevant documents. If the quality of the initially retrieved documents is low, then the effectiveness of query augmentation would be limited as well. We propose Brain-Aug, which enhances a query by incorporating semantic information decoded from brain signals. BrainAug generates the continuation of the original query with a prompt constructed with brain signal information and a ranking-oriented inference approach. Experimental results on fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) datasets show that Brain-Aug produces semantically more accurate queries, leading to improved document ranking performance. Such improvement brought by brain signals is particularly notable for ambiguous queries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15708v2,2024-02
CoRelation: Boosting Automatic ICD Coding Through Contextualized Code Relation Learning,"Junyu Luo, Xiaochen Wang, Jiaqi Wang, Aofei Chang, Yaqing Wang, Fenglong Ma","Automatic International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding plays a crucial role in the extraction of relevant information from clinical notes for proper recording and billing. One of the most important directions for boosting the performance of automatic ICD coding is modeling ICD code relations. However, current methods insufficiently model the intricate relationships among ICD codes and often overlook the importance of context in clinical notes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, a contextualized and flexible framework, to enhance the learning of ICD code representations. Our approach, unlike existing methods, employs a dependent learning paradigm that considers the context of clinical notes in modeling all possible code relations.

Foot In The Door: Understanding Large Language Model Jailbreaking via Cognitive Psychology,"Zhenhua Wang, Wei Xie, Baosheng Wang, Enze Wang, Zhiwen Gui, Shuoyoucheng Ma, Kai Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have gradually become the gateway for people to acquire new knowledge. However, attackers can break the model's security protection (""jail"") to access restricted information, which is called ""jailbreaking."" Previous studies have shown the weakness of current LLMs when confronted with such jailbreaking attacks. Nevertheless, comprehension of the intrinsic decision-making mechanism within the LLMs upon receipt of jailbreak prompts is noticeably lacking. Our research provides a psychological explanation of the jailbreak prompts. Drawing on cognitive consistency theory, we argue that the key to jailbreak is guiding the LLM to achieve cognitive coordination in an erroneous direction. Further, we propose an automatic black-box jailbreaking method based on the Foot-in-the-Door (FITD) technique. This method progressively induces the model to answer harmful questions via multi-step incremental prompts. We instantiated a prototype system to evaluate the jailbreaking effectiveness on 8 advanced LLMs, yielding an average success rate of 83.9%.

Leveraging ChatGPT in Pharmacovigilance Event Extraction: An Empirical Study,"Zhaoyue Sun, Gabriele Pergola, Byron C.

This research aims to investigate the ability of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT, in the context of pharmacovigilance event extraction, of which the main goal is to identify and extract adverse events or potential therapeutic events from textual medical sources. We conduct extensive experiments to assess the performance of ChatGPT in the pharmacovigilance event extraction task, employing various prompts and demonstration selection strategies. The findings demonstrate that while ChatGPT demonstrates reasonable performance with appropriate demonstration selection strategies, it still falls short compared to fully fine-tuned small models. Additionally, we explore the potential of leveraging ChatGPT for data augmentation. However, our investigation reveals that the inclusion of synthesized data into fine-tuning may lead to a decrease in performance, possibly attributed to noise in the ChatGPT-generated labels. To mitigate this, we explore different filtering strategies and find that, with the proper approach, more stable performance can be achieved, although constant improvement remains elusive.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15663v1,2024-02
Uncovering Customer Issues through Topological Natural Language Analysis,"Shu-Ting Pi, Sidarth Srinivasan, Yuying Zhu, Michael Yang, Qun Liu","E-commerce companies deal with a high volume of customer service requests daily. While a simple annotation system is often used to summarize the topics of customer contacts, thoroughly exploring each specific issue can be challenging. This presents a critical concern, especially during an emerging outbreak where companies must quickly identify and address specific issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel machine learning algorithm that leverages natural language techniques and topological data analysis to monitor emerging and trending customer issues. Our approach involves an end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously tags the primary question sentence of each customer's transcript and generates sentence embedding vectors. We then whiten the embedding vectors and use them to construct an undirected graph. From there, we define trending and emerging issues based on the topological properties of each transcript.

We construct a simple simulated environment and demonstrate examples of where, in a zero-shot setting, both text and multimodal LLMs display atomic world knowledge about various objects but fail to compose this knowledge in correct solutions for an object manipulation and placement task. We also use BLIP, a vision-language model trained with more sophisticated cross-modal attention, to identify cases relevant to object physical properties that that model fails to ground.

Addressing Order Sensitivity of In-Context Demonstration Examples in Causal Language Models,"Yanzheng Xiang, Hanqi Yan, Lin Gui, Yulan He","In-context learning has become a popular paradigm in natural language processing. However, its performance can be significantly influenced by the order of in-context demonstration examples. In this paper, we found that causal language models (CausalLMs) are more sensitive to this order compared to prefix language models (PrefixLMs). We attribute this phenomenon to the auto-regressive attention masks within CausalLMs, which restrict each token from accessing information from subsequent tokens. This results in different receptive fields for samples at different positions, thereby leading to representation disparities across positions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce an unsupervised fine-tuning method, termed the Information-Augmented and Consistency-Enhanced approach. This approach utilizes contrastive learning to align representations of in-context examples across different positions and introduces a consistency loss to ensure similar representations for inputs with different permutations. This enhances the model's predictive consistency across permutations. Experimental results on five benchmarks suggest that our proposed method can reduce the sensitivity of CausalLMs to the order of in-context examples and exhibit robust generalizability, particularly when demonstrations are sourced from a candidate pool different from that used in the training phase, or when the number of in-context examples differs from what is used during training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15637v2,2024-02
Fine-Grained Self-Endorsement Improves Factuality and Reasoning,"Ante Wang, Linfeng Song, Baolin Peng, Ye Tian, Lifeng Jin, Haitao Mi, Jinsong Su, Dong Yu","This work studies improving large language model (LLM) generations at inference time by mitigating fact-conflicting hallucinations. Particularly, we propose a self-endorsement framework that leverages the fine-grained fact-level comparisons across multiple sampled responses. Compared with prior ensemble methods (Wang et al., 2022;Chen et al., 2023)) that perform response-level selection, our approach can better alleviate hallucinations, especially for longform generation tasks. Our approach can broadly benefit smaller and open-source LLMs as it mainly conducts simple content-based comparisons. Experiments on Biographies show that our method can effectively improve the factuality of generations with simple and intuitive prompts across different scales of LLMs. Besides, comprehensive analyses on TriviaQA and GSM8K demonstrate the potential of self-endorsement for broader application.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15631v1,2024-02
Language-Based User Profiles for Recommendation,"Joyce Zhou, Yijia Dai, Thorsten Joachims","Most conventional recommendation methods (e.g., matrix factorization) represent user profiles as high-dimensional vectors. Unfortunately, these vectors lack interpretability and steerability, and often perform poorly in cold-start settings. To address these shortcomings, we explore the use of user profiles that are represented as human-readable text. We propose the Language-based Factorization Model (LFM), which is essentially an encoder/decoder model where both the encoder and the decoder are large language models (LLMs). The encoder LLM generates a compact natural-language profile of the user's interests from the user's rating history. The decoder LLM uses this summary profile to complete predictive downstream tasks. We evaluate our LFM approach on the MovieLens dataset, comparing it against matrix factorization and an LLM model that directly predicts from the user's rating history. In cold-start settings, we find that our method can have higher accuracy than matrix factorization. Furthermore, we find that generating a compact and human-readable summary often performs comparably with or better than direct LLM prediction, while enjoying better interpretability and shorter model input length. Our results motivate a number of future research directions and potential improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15623v1,2024-02
Towards Efficient Active Learning in NLP via Pretrained Representations,"Artem Vysogorets, Achintya Gopal","Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) is now a common approach for text classification in a wide range of applications. When labeled documents are scarce, active learning helps save annotation efforts but requires retraining of massive models on each acquisition iteration. We drastically expedite this process by using pretrained representations of LLMs within the active learning loop and, once the desired amount of labeled data is acquired, fine-tuning that or even a different pretrained LLM on this labeled data to achieve the best performance. As verified on common text classification benchmarks with pretrained BERT and RoBERTa as the backbone, our strategy yields similar performance to fine-tuning all the way through the active learning loop but is orders of magnitude less computationally expensive. The data acquired with our procedure generalizes across pretrained networks, allowing flexibility in choosing the final model or updating it as newer versions get released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15613v1,2024-02
"Selective ""Selective Prediction"": Reducing Unnecessary Abstention in Vision-Language Reasoning","Tejas Srinivasan, Jack Hessel, Tanmay Gupta, Bill Yuchen Lin, Yejin Choi, Jesse Thomason, Khyathi Raghavi Chandu","Selective prediction minimizes incorrect predictions from vision-language models (VLMs) by allowing them to abstain from answering when uncertain. However, when deploying a vision-language system with low tolerance for inaccurate predictions, selective prediction may be over-cautious and abstain too frequently, even on many correct predictions. We introduce ReCoVERR, an inference-time algorithm to reduce the over-abstention of a selective vision-language system without increasing the error rate of the system's predictions. When the VLM makes a low-confidence prediction, instead of abstaining ReCoVERR tries to find relevant clues in the image that provide additional evidence for the prediction. ReCoVERR uses an LLM to pose related questions to the VLM, collects high-confidence evidences, and if enough evidence confirms the prediction the system makes a prediction instead of abstaining. ReCoVERR enables three VLMs (BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and LLaVA-1.5) to answer up to 20% more questions on the VQAv2 and A-OKVQA tasks without decreasing system accuracy, thus improving overall system reliability.

Alternating Weak Triphone/BPE Alignment Supervision from Hybrid Model Improves End-to-End ASR,"Jintao Jiang, Yingbo Gao, Mohammad Zeineldeen, Zoltan Tuske","In this paper, alternating weak triphone/BPE alignment supervision is proposed to improve end-to-end model training. Towards this end, triphone and BPE alignments are extracted using a pre-existing hybrid ASR system. Then, regularization effect is obtained by cross-entropy based intermediate auxiliary losses computed on such alignments at a mid-layer representation of the encoder for triphone alignments and at the encoder for BPE alignments. Weak supervision is achieved through strong label smoothing with parameter of 0.5. Experimental results on TED-LIUM 2 indicate that either triphone or BPE alignment based weak supervision improves ASR performance over standard CTC auxiliary loss. Moreover, their combination lowers the word error rate further. We also investigate the alternation of the two auxiliary tasks during model training, and additional performance gain is observed. Overall, the proposed techniques result in over 10% relative error rate reduction over a CTC-regularized baseline system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15594v1,2024-02
Prompting LLMs to Compose Meta-Review Drafts from Peer-Review Narratives of Scholarly Manuscripts,"Shubhra Kanti Karmaker Santu, Sanjeev Kumar Sinha, Naman Bansal, Alex Knipper, Souvika Sarkar, John Salvador, Yash Mahajan, Sri Guttikonda, Mousumi Akter, Matthew Freestone, Matthew C. Williams Jr","One of the most important yet onerous tasks in the academic peer-reviewing process is composing meta-reviews, which involves understanding the core contributions, strengths, and weaknesses of a scholarly manuscript based on peer-review narratives from multiple experts and then summarizing those multiple experts' perspectives into a concise holistic overview. Given the latest major developments in generative AI, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), it is very compelling to rigorously study the utility of LLMs in generating such meta-reviews in an academic peer-review setting. In this paper, we perform a case study with three popular LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, and PaLM2, to automatically generate meta-reviews by prompting them with different types/levels of prompts based on the recently proposed TELeR taxonomy. Finally, we perform a detailed qualitative study of the meta-reviews generated by the LLMs and summarize our findings and recommendations for prompting LLMs for this complex task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15589v1,2024-02
DOSA: A Dataset of Social Artifacts from Different Indian Geographical Subcultures,"Agrima Seth, Sanchit Ahuja, Kalika Bali, Sunayana Sitaram","Generative models are increasingly being used in various applications, such as text generation, commonsense reasoning, and question-answering. To be effective globally, these models must be aware of and account for local socio-cultural contexts, making it necessary to have benchmarks to evaluate the models for their cultural familiarity. Since the training data for LLMs is web-based and the Web is limited in its representation of information, it does not capture knowledge present within communities that are not on the Web. Thus, these models exacerbate the inequities, semantic misalignment, and stereotypes from the Web. There has been a growing call for community-centered participatory research methods in NLP. In this work, we respond to this call by using participatory research methods to introduce $\textit{DOSA}$, the first community-generated $\textbf{D}$ataset $\textbf{o}$f 615 $\textbf{S}$ocial $\textbf{A}$rtifacts, by engaging with 260 participants from 19 different Indian geographic subcultures. We use a gamified framework that relies on collective sensemaking to collect the names and descriptions of these artifacts such that the descriptions semantically align with the shared sensibilities of the individuals from those cultures. Next, we benchmark four popular LLMs and find that they show significant variation across regional sub-cultures in their ability to infer the artifacts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14651v1,2024-02
CI w/o TN: Context Injection without Task Name for Procedure Planning,Xinjie Li,"This paper explores the challenge of procedure planning in instructional videos, which involves creating goal-directed plans based on visual start and goal observations from videos. Previous research has tackled this problem with gradually weaker training supervision, from heavy intermediate visual observations or language instructions to task class supervision. However, with the advent of large language models, even given only the task name, these models can produce a detailed plan. In this study, we propose a much weaker setting without task name as supervision, which is not currently solvable by existing large language models since they require good prompts with sufficient information. Specifically, we hypothesize that previous intermediate supervisions can serve as context information, and we use captions of visual start and goal observations as a much cheaper form of supervision. This approach greatly reduces the labeling cost since the captions can be easily obtained by large pre-trained vision-language foundation models. Technically, we apply BLIP to generate captions as supervision to train the context feature with contrastive learning loss. Afterward, the context feature is fed into the generator to aid in plan generation. Our experiments on two datasets with varying scales demonstrate that our model can achieve comparable performance on multiple metrics, which validates our hypothesis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15579v1,2024-02
Social Convos: Capturing Agendas and Emotions on Social Media,"Ankita Bhaumik, Ning Sa, Gregorios Katsios, Tomek Strzalkowski","Social media platforms are popular tools for disseminating targeted information during major public events like elections or pandemics. Systematic analysis of the message traffic can provide valuable insights into prevailing opinions and social dynamics among different segments of the population. We are specifically interested in influence spread, and in particular whether more deliberate influence operations can be detected. However, filtering out the essential messages with telltale influence indicators from the extensive and often chaotic social media traffic is a major challenge. In this paper we present a novel approach to extract influence indicators from messages circulating among groups of users discussing particular topics. We build upon the concept of a convo to identify influential authors who are actively promoting some particular agenda around that topic within the group. We focus on two influence indicators: the (control of) agenda and the use of emotional language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15571v1,2024-02
Fast Adversarial Attacks on Language Models In One GPU Minute,"Vinu Sankar Sadasivan, Shoumik Saha, Gaurang Sriramanan, Priyatham Kattakinda, Atoosa Chegini, Soheil Feizi","In this paper, we introduce a novel class of fast, beam search-based adversarial attack (BEAST) for Language Models (LMs). BEAST employs interpretable parameters, enabling attackers to balance between attack speed, success rate, and the readability of adversarial prompts. The computational efficiency of BEAST facilitates us to investigate its applications on LMs for jailbreaking, eliciting hallucinations, and privacy attacks. Our gradient-free targeted attack can jailbreak aligned LMs with high attack success rates within one minute. For instance, BEAST can jailbreak Vicuna-7B-v1.5 under one minute with a success rate of 89% when compared to a gradient-based baseline that takes over an hour to achieve 70% success rate using a single Nvidia RTX A6000 48GB GPU. Additionally, we discover a unique outcome wherein our untargeted attack induces hallucinations in LM chatbots. Through human evaluations, we find that our untargeted attack causes Vicuna-7B-v1.5 to produce ~15% more incorrect outputs when compared to LM outputs in the absence of our attack. We also learn that 22% of the time, BEAST causes Vicuna to generate outputs that are not relevant to the original prompt. Further, we use BEAST to generate adversarial prompts in a few seconds that can boost the performance of existing membership inference attacks for LMs. We believe that our fast attack, BEAST, has the potential to accelerate research in LM security and privacy.

Self-Retrieval: End-to-End Information Retrieval with One Large Language Model,"Qiaoyu Tang, Jiawei Chen, Zhuoqun Li, Bowen Yu, Yaojie Lu, Cheng Fu, Haiyang Yu, Hongyu Lin, Fei Huang, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Yongbin Li","The rise of large language models (LLMs) has significantly transformed both the construction and application of information retrieval (IR) systems. However, current interactions between IR systems and LLMs remain limited, with LLMs merely serving as part of components within IR systems, and IR systems being constructed independently of LLMs. This separated architecture restricts knowledge sharing and deep collaboration between them. In this paper, we introduce Self-Retrieval, a novel end-to-end LLM-driven information retrieval architecture. Self-Retrieval unifies all essential IR functions within a single LLM, leveraging the inherent capabilities of LLMs throughout the IR process. Specifically, Self-Retrieval internalizes the retrieval corpus through self-supervised learning, transforms the retrieval process into sequential passage generation, and performs relevance assessment for reranking. Experimental results demonstrate that Self-Retrieval not only outperforms existing retrieval approaches by a significant margin, but also substantially enhances the performance of LLM-driven downstream applications like retrieval-augmented generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00801v2,2024-02
The Good and The Bad: Exploring Privacy Issues in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),"Shenglai Zeng, Jiankun Zhang, Pengfei He, Yue Xing, Yiding Liu, Han Xu, Jie Ren, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Yi Chang, Jiliang Tang","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful technique to facilitate language model with proprietary and private data, where data privacy is a pivotal concern. Whereas extensive research has demonstrated the privacy risks of large language models (LLMs), the RAG technique could potentially reshape the inherent behaviors of LLM generation, posing new privacy issues that are currently under-explored. In this work, we conduct extensive empirical studies with novel attack methods, which demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG systems on leaking the private retrieval database. Despite the new risk brought by RAG on the retrieval data, we further reveal that RAG can mitigate the leakage of the LLMs' training data. Overall, we provide new insights in this paper for privacy protection of retrieval-augmented LLMs, which benefit both LLMs and RAG systems builders.

Prejudice and Volatility: A Statistical Framework for Measuring Social Discrimination in Large Language Models,"Y Liu, K Yang, Z Qi, X Liu, Y Yu, C Zhai","This study investigates why and how inconsistency in the generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) might induce or exacerbate societal injustice. For instance, LLMs frequently exhibit contrasting gender stereotypes regarding the same career depending on varied contexts, highlighting the arguably harmful unpredictability of LLMs' behavioral patterns. To augment the existing discrimination assessment with the capability to account for variation in LLM generation, we formulate the Prejudice-Volatility Framework (PVF) that precisely defines behavioral metrics for assessing LLMs, which delineate the probability distribution of LLMs' stereotypes from the perspective of token prediction probability. Specifically, we employ a data-mining approach to approximate the possible applied contexts of LLMs and devise statistical metrics to evaluate the corresponding contextualized societal discrimination risk. Further, we mathematically dissect the aggregated discrimination risk of LLMs into prejudice risk, originating from their system bias, and volatility risk, stemming from their generation inconsistency. While initially intended for assessing discrimination in LLMs, our proposed PVF facilitates the comprehensive and flexible measurement of any inductive biases, including knowledge alongside prejudice, across various modality models.   We apply PVF to 12 most commonly adopted LLMs and compare their risk levels. Our findings reveal that: i) prejudice risk is the primary cause of discrimination risk in LLMs, indicating that inherent biases in these models lead to stereotypical outputs; ii) most LLMs exhibit significant pro-male stereotypes across nearly all careers; iii) alignment with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback lowers discrimination by reducing prejudice, but increases volatility; iv) discrimination risk in LLMs correlates with socio-economic factors like profession salaries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15481v4,2024-02
Leveraging Domain Knowledge for Efficient Reward Modelling in RLHF: A Case-Study in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization,"Swaroop Nath, Tejpalsingh Siledar, Sankara Sri Raghava Ravindra Muddu, Rupasai Rangaraju, Harshad Khadilkar, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Suman Banerjee, Amey Patil, Sudhanshu Shekhar Singh, Muthusamy Chelliah, Nikesh Garera","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a dominating strategy in aligning Language Models (LMs) with human values/goals. The key to the strategy is learning a reward model ($\varphi$), which can reflect the latent reward model of humans. While this strategy has proven effective, the training methodology requires a lot of human preference annotation (usually in the order of tens of thousands) to train $\varphi$. Such a large-scale annotation is justifiable when it's a one-time effort, and the reward model is universally applicable. However, human goals are subjective and depend on the task, requiring task-specific preference annotations, which can be impractical to fulfill. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to infuse domain knowledge into $\varphi$, which reduces the amount of preference annotation required ($21\times$), omits Alignment Tax, and provides some interpretability. We validate our approach in E-Commerce Opinion Summarization, with a significant reduction in dataset size (to just $940$ samples) while advancing the SOTA ($\sim4$ point ROUGE-L improvement, $68\%$ of times preferred by humans over SOTA). Our contributions include a novel Reward Modeling technique and two new datasets: PromptOpinSumm (supervised data for Opinion Summarization) and OpinPref (a gold-standard human preference dataset). The proposed methodology opens up avenues for efficient RLHF, making it more adaptable to applications with varying human values. We release the artifacts (Code: github.com/efficient-rlhf.

Repetition Improves Language Model Embeddings,"Jacob Mitchell Springer, Suhas Kotha, Daniel Fried, Graham Neubig, Aditi Raghunathan","Recent approaches to improving the extraction of text embeddings from autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have largely focused on improvements to data, backbone pretrained language models, or improving task-differentiation via instructions. In this work, we address an architectural limitation of autoregressive models: token embeddings cannot contain information from tokens that appear later in the input. To address this limitation, we propose a simple approach, ""echo embeddings,"" in which we repeat the input twice in context and extract embeddings from the second occurrence. We show that echo embeddings of early tokens can encode information about later tokens, allowing us to maximally leverage high-quality LLMs for embeddings. On the MTEB leaderboard, echo embeddings improve over classical embeddings by over 9% zero-shot and by around 0.7% when fine-tuned. Echo embeddings with a Mistral-7B model achieve state-of-the-art compared to prior open source models that do not leverage synthetic fine-tuning data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15449v1,2024-02
A Data-Centric Approach To Generate Faithful and High Quality Patient Summaries with Large Language Models,"Stefan Hegselmann, Shannon Zejiang Shen, Florian Gierse, Monica Agrawal, David Sontag, Xiaoyi Jiang","Patients often face difficulties in understanding their hospitalizations, while healthcare workers have limited resources to provide explanations. In this work, we investigate the potential of large language models to generate patient summaries based on doctors' notes and study the effect of training data on the faithfulness and quality of the generated summaries. To this end, we release (i) a rigorous labeling protocol for errors in medical texts and (ii) a publicly available dataset of annotated hallucinations in 100 doctor-written and 100 generated summaries. We show that fine-tuning on hallucination-free data effectively reduces hallucinations from 2.60 to 1.55 per summary for Llama 2, while preserving relevant information. We observe a similar effect on GPT-4 (0.70 to 0.40), when the few-shot examples are hallucination-free. We also conduct a qualitative evaluation using hallucination-free and improved training data. We find that common quantitative metrics do not correlate well with faithfulness and quality. Finally, we test GPT-4 for automatic hallucination detection, which clearly outperforms common baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15422v2,2024-02
PREDILECT: Preferences Delineated with Zero-Shot Language-based Reasoning in Reinforcement Learning,"Simon Holk, Daniel Marta, Iolanda Leite","Preference-based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a new field in robot learning, where humans play a pivotal role in shaping robot behavior by expressing preferences on different sequences of state-action pairs. However, formulating realistic policies for robots demands responses from humans to an extensive array of queries. In this work, we approach the sample-efficiency challenge by expanding the information collected per query to contain both preferences and optional text prompting. To accomplish this, we leverage the zero-shot capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to reason from the text provided by humans. To accommodate the additional query information, we reformulate the reward learning objectives to contain flexible highlights -- state-action pairs that contain relatively high information and are related to the features processed in a zero-shot fashion from a pretrained LLM. In both a simulated scenario and a user study, we reveal the effectiveness of our work by analyzing the feedback and its implications. Additionally, the collective feedback collected serves to train a robot on socially compliant trajectories in a simulated social navigation landscape.

Faithful Temporal Question Answering over Heterogeneous Sources,"Zhen Jia, Philipp Christmann, Gerhard Weikum","Temporal question answering (QA) involves time constraints, with phrases such as ""... in 2019"" or ""... before COVID"". In the former, time is an explicit condition, in the latter it is implicit. State-of-the-art methods have limitations along three dimensions. First, with neural inference, time constraints are merely soft-matched, giving room to invalid or inexplicable answers. Second, questions with implicit time are poorly supported. Third, answers come from a single source: either a knowledge base (KB) or a text corpus. We propose a temporal QA system that addresses these shortcomings. First, it enforces temporal constraints for faithful answering with tangible evidence. Second, it properly handles implicit questions. Third, it operates over heterogeneous sources, covering KB, text and web tables in a unified manner. The method has three stages: (i) understanding the question and its temporal conditions, (ii) retrieving evidence from all sources, and (iii) faithfully answering the question. As implicit questions are sparse in prior benchmarks, we introduce a principled method for generating diverse questions. Experiments show superior performance over a suite of baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15400v1,2024-02
Explorations of Self-Repair in Language Models,"Cody Rushing, Neel Nanda","Prior interpretability research studying narrow distributions has preliminarily identified self-repair, a phenomena where if components in large language models are ablated, later components will change their behavior to compensate. Our work builds off this past literature, demonstrating that self-repair exists on a variety of models families and sizes when ablating individual attention heads on the full training distribution. We further show that on the full training distribution self-repair is imperfect, as the original direct effect of the head is not fully restored, and noisy, since the degree of self-repair varies significantly across different prompts (sometimes overcorrecting beyond the original effect). We highlight two different mechanisms that contribute to self-repair, including changes in the final LayerNorm scaling factor and sparse sets of neurons implementing Anti-Erasure. We additionally discuss the implications of these results for interpretability practitioners and close with a more speculative discussion on the mystery of why self-repair occurs in these models at all, highlighting evidence for the Iterative Inference hypothesis in language models, a framework that predicts self-repair.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15390v2,2024-02
Dual Encoder: Exploiting the Potential of Syntactic and Semantic for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction,"Xiaowei Zhao, Yong Zhou, Xiujuan Xu","Aspect Sentiment Triple Extraction (ASTE) is an emerging task in fine-grained sentiment analysis. Recent studies have employed Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to model the syntax-semantic relationships inherent in triplet elements. However, they have yet to fully tap into the vast potential of syntactic and semantic information within the ASTE task. In this work, we propose a \emph{Dual Encoder: Exploiting the potential of Syntactic and Semantic} model (D2E2S), which maximizes the syntactic and semantic relationships among words. Specifically, our model utilizes a dual-channel encoder with a BERT channel to capture semantic information, and an enhanced LSTM channel for comprehensive syntactic information capture. Subsequently, we introduce the heterogeneous feature interaction module to capture intricate interactions between dependency syntax and attention semantics, and to dynamically select vital nodes. We leverage the synergy of these modules to harness the significant potential of syntactic and semantic information in ASTE tasks. Testing on public benchmarks, our D2E2S model surpasses the current state-of-the-art(SOTA), demonstrating its effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15370v1,2024-02

Ranking Entities along Conceptual Space Dimensions with LLMs: An Analysis of Fine-Tuning Strategies,"Nitesh Kumar, Usashi Chatterjee, Steven Schockaert","Conceptual spaces represent entities in terms of their primitive semantic features. Such representations are highly valuable but they are notoriously difficult to learn, especially when it comes to modelling perceptual and subjective features. Distilling conceptual spaces from Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a promising strategy, but existing work has been limited to probing pre-trained LLMs using relatively simple zero-shot strategies. We focus in particular on the task of ranking entities according to a given conceptual space dimension. Unfortunately, we cannot directly fine-tune LLMs on this task, because ground truth rankings for conceptual space dimensions are rare. We therefore use more readily available features as training data and analyse whether the ranking capabilities of the resulting models transfer to perceptual and subjective features. We find that this is indeed the case, to some extent, but having at least some perceptual and subjective features in the training data seems essential for achieving the best results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15337v2,2024-02
GPTVQ: The Blessing of Dimensionality for LLM Quantization,"Mart van Baalen, Andrey Kuzmin, Markus Nagel, Peter Couperus, Cedric Bastoul, Eric Mahurin, Tijmen Blankevoort, Paul Whatmough","In this work we show that the size versus accuracy trade-off of neural network quantization can be significantly improved by increasing the quantization dimensionality. We propose the GPTVQ method, a new fast method for post-training vector quantization (VQ) that scales well to Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method interleaves quantization of one or more columns with updates to the remaining unquantized weights, using information from the Hessian of the per-layer output reconstruction MSE. Quantization codebooks are initialized using an efficient data-aware version of the EM algorithm. The codebooks are then updated, and further compressed by using integer quantization and SVD-based compression. GPTVQ establishes a new state-of-the art in the size vs accuracy trade-offs on a wide range of LLMs such as Llama-v2 and Mistral. Furthermore, our method is efficient: on a single H100 it takes between 3 and 11 hours to process a Llamav2-70B model, depending on quantization setting. Lastly, with on-device timings for VQ decompression on a mobile CPU we show that VQ leads to improved latency compared to using a 4-bit integer format.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15319v1,2024-02
ArabianGPT: Native Arabic GPT-based Large Language Model,"Anis Koubaa, Adel Ammar, Lahouari Ghouti, Omar Najar, Serry Sibaee","The predominance of English and Latin-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a notable deficit in native Arabic LLMs. This discrepancy is accentuated by the prevalent inclusion of English tokens in existing Arabic models, detracting from their efficacy in processing native Arabic's intricate morphology and syntax. Consequently, there is a theoretical and practical imperative for developing LLMs predominantly focused on Arabic linguistic elements. To address this gap, this paper proposes ArabianGPT, a series of transformer-based models within the ArabianLLM suite designed explicitly for Arabic. These models, including ArabianGPT-0.1B and ArabianGPT-0.3B, vary in size and complexity, aligning with the nuanced linguistic characteristics of Arabic. The AraNizer tokenizer, integral to these models, addresses the unique morphological aspects of Arabic script, ensuring more accurate text processing. Empirical results from fine-tuning the models on tasks like sentiment analysis and summarization demonstrate significant improvements. For sentiment analysis, the fine-tuned ArabianGPT-0.1B model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 95%, a substantial increase from the base model's 56%. Similarly, in summarization tasks, fine-tuned models showed enhanced F1 scores, indicating improved precision and recall in generating concise summaries. Comparative analysis of fine-tuned ArabianGPT models against their base versions across various benchmarks reveals nuanced differences in performance, with fine-tuning positively impacting specific tasks like question answering and summarization. These findings underscore the efficacy of fine-tuning in aligning ArabianGPT models more closely with specific NLP tasks, highlighting the potential of tailored transformer architectures in advancing Arabic NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15313v2,2024-02
Counterfactual Generation with Identifiability Guarantees,"Hanqi Yan, Lingjing Kong, Lin Gui, Yuejie Chi, Eric Xing, Yulan He, Kun Zhang","Counterfactual generation lies at the core of various machine learning tasks, including image translation and controllable text generation. This generation process usually requires the identification of the disentangled latent representations, such as content and style, that underlie the observed data. However, it becomes more challenging when faced with a scarcity of paired data and labeling information. Existing disentangled methods crucially rely on oversimplified assumptions, such as assuming independent content and style variables, to identify the latent variables, even though such assumptions may not hold for complex data distributions. For instance, food reviews tend to involve words like tasty, whereas movie reviews commonly contain words such as thrilling for the same positive sentiment. This problem is exacerbated when data are sampled from multiple domains since the dependence between content and style may vary significantly over domains. In this work, we tackle the domain-varying dependence between the content and the style variables inherent in the counterfactual generation task. We provide identification guarantees for such latent-variable models by leveraging the relative sparsity of the influences from different latent variables. Our theoretical insights enable the development of a doMain AdapTive counTerfactual gEneration model, called (MATTE). Our theoretically grounded framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised style transfer tasks, where neither paired data nor style labels are utilized, across four large-scale datasets.

How (un)ethical are instruction-centric responses of LLMs? Unveiling the vulnerabilities of safety guardrails to harmful queries,"Somnath Banerjee, Sayan Layek, Rima Hazra, Animesh Mukherjee","In this study, we tackle a growing concern around the safety and ethical use of large language models (LLMs). Despite their potential, these models can be tricked into producing harmful or unethical content through various sophisticated methods, including 'jailbreaking' techniques and targeted manipulation. Our work zeroes in on a specific issue: to what extent LLMs can be led astray by asking them to generate responses that are instruction-centric such as a pseudocode, a program or a software snippet as opposed to vanilla text. To investigate this question, we introduce TechHazardQA, a dataset containing complex queries which should be answered in both text and instruction-centric formats (e.g., pseudocodes), aimed at identifying triggers for unethical responses. We query a series of LLMs -- Llama-2-13b, Llama-2-7b, Mistral-V2 and Mistral 8X7B -- and ask them to generate both text and instruction-centric responses. For evaluation we report the harmfulness score metric as well as judgements from GPT-4 and humans. Overall, we observe that asking LLMs to produce instruction-centric responses enhances the unethical response generation by ~2-38% across the models. As an additional objective, we investigate the impact of model editing using the ROME technique, which further increases the propensity for generating undesirable content. In particular, asking edited LLMs to generate instruction-centric responses further increases the unethical response generation by ~3-16% across the different models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15302v5,2024-02
Causal Graph Discovery with Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Large Language Models,"Yuzhe Zhang, Yipeng Zhang, Yidong Gan, Lina Yao, Chen Wang","Causal graph recovery is traditionally done using statistical estimation-based methods or based on individual's knowledge about variables of interests. They often suffer from data collection biases and limitations of individuals' knowledge. The advance of large language models (LLMs) provides opportunities to address these problems. We propose a novel method that leverages LLMs to deduce causal relationships in general causal graph recovery tasks. This method leverages knowledge compressed in LLMs and knowledge LLMs extracted from scientific publication database as well as experiment data about factors of interest to achieve this goal. Our method gives a prompting strategy to extract associational relationships among those factors and a mechanism to perform causality verification for these associations. Comparing to other LLM-based methods that directly instruct LLMs to do the highly complex causal reasoning, our method shows clear advantage on causal graph quality on benchmark datasets. More importantly, as causality among some factors may change as new research results emerge, our method show sensitivity to new evidence in the literature and can provide useful information for updating causal graphs accordingly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15301v2,2024-02
Seeing is Believing: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via CLIP-Guided Decoding,"Ailin Deng, Zhirui Chen, Bryan Hooi","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to object hallucinations, an issue in which their generated text contains non-existent objects, greatly limiting their reliability and practicality. Current approaches often rely on the model's token likelihoods or other internal information, instruction tuning on additional datasets, or incorporating complex external tools. We first perform empirical analysis on sentence-level LVLM hallucination, finding that CLIP similarity to the image acts as a stronger and more robust indicator of hallucination compared to token likelihoods. Motivated by this, we introduce our CLIP-Guided Decoding (CGD) approach, a straightforward but effective training-free approach to reduce object hallucination at decoding time. CGD uses CLIP to guide the model's decoding process by enhancing visual grounding of generated text with the image. Experiments demonstrate that CGD effectively mitigates object hallucination across multiple LVLM families while preserving the utility of text generation. Codes are available at https://github.com/d-ailin/CLIP-Guided-Decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15300v2,2024-02
Let's Rectify Step by Step: Improving Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Diffusion Models,"Shunyu Liu, Jie Zhou, Qunxi Zhu, Qin Chen, Qingchun Bai, Jun Xiao, Liang He","Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) stands as a crucial task in predicting the sentiment polarity associated with identified aspects within text. However, a notable challenge in ABSA lies in precisely determining the aspects' boundaries (start and end indices), especially for long ones, due to users' colloquial expressions. We propose DiffusionABSA, a novel diffusion model tailored for ABSA, which extracts the aspects progressively step by step. Particularly, DiffusionABSA gradually adds noise to the aspect terms in the training process, subsequently learning a denoising process that progressively restores these terms in a reverse manner. To estimate the boundaries, we design a denoising neural network enhanced by a syntax-aware temporal attention mechanism to chronologically capture the interplay between aspects and surrounding text. Empirical evaluations conducted on eight benchmark datasets underscore the compelling advantages offered by DiffusionABSA when compared against robust baseline models. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Qlb6x/DiffusionABSA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15289v1,2024-02
MemoryPrompt: A Light Wrapper to Improve Context Tracking in Pre-trained Language Models,"Nathanaël Carraz Rakotonirina, Marco Baroni","Transformer-based language models (LMs) track contextual information through large, hard-coded input windows. We introduce MemoryPrompt, a leaner approach in which the LM is complemented by a small auxiliary recurrent network that passes information to the LM by prefixing its regular input with a sequence of vectors, akin to soft prompts, without requiring LM finetuning. Tested on a task designed to probe a LM's ability to keep track of multiple fact updates, a MemoryPrompt-augmented LM outperforms much larger LMs that have access to the full input history. We also test MemoryPrompt on a long-distance dialogue dataset, where its performance is comparable to that of a model conditioned on the entire conversation history. In both experiments we also observe that, unlike full-finetuning approaches, MemoryPrompt does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapted to new tasks, thus not disrupting the generalist capabilities of the underlying LM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15268v1,2024-02
"CloChat: Understanding How People Customize, Interact, and Experience Personas in Large Language Models","Juhye Ha, Hyeon Jeon, DaEun Han, Jinwook Seo, Changhoon Oh","Large language models (LLMs) have facilitated significant strides in generating conversational agents, enabling seamless, contextually relevant dialogues across diverse topics. However, the existing LLM-driven conversational agents have fixed personalities and functionalities, limiting their adaptability to individual user needs. Creating personalized agent personas with distinct expertise or traits can address this issue. Nonetheless, we lack knowledge of how people customize and interact with agent personas. In this research, we investigated how users customize agent personas and their impact on interaction quality, diversity, and dynamics. To this end, we developed CloChat, an interface supporting easy and accurate customization of agent personas in LLMs. We conducted a study comparing how participants interact with CloChat and ChatGPT. The results indicate that participants formed emotional bonds with the customized agents, engaged in more dynamic dialogues, and showed interest in sustaining interactions. These findings contribute to design implications for future systems with conversational agents using LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15265v1,2024-02
DEEM: Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling for Stance Detection,"Xiaolong Wang, Yile Wang, Sijie Cheng, Peng Li, Yang Liu","Recent work has made a preliminary attempt to use large language models (LLMs) to solve the stance detection task, showing promising results. However, considering that stance detection usually requires detailed background knowledge, the vanilla reasoning method may neglect the domain knowledge to make a professional and accurate analysis. Thus, there is still room for improvement of LLMs reasoning, especially in leveraging the generation capability of LLMs to simulate specific experts (i.e., multi-agents) to detect the stance. In this paper, different from existing multi-agent works that require detailed descriptions and use fixed experts, we propose a Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling (DEEM) method which can leverage the generated experienced experts and let LLMs reason in a semi-parametric way, making the experts more generalizable and reliable. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEM consistently achieves the best results on three standard benchmarks, outperforms methods with self-consistency reasoning, and reduces the bias of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15264v3,2024-02
Chitchat as Interference: Adding User Backstories to Task-Oriented Dialogues,"Armand Stricker, Patrick Paroubek","During task-oriented dialogues (TODs), human users naturally introduce chitchat that is beyond the immediate scope of the task, interfering with the flow of the conversation. To address this issue without the need for expensive manual data creation, we use few-shot prompting with Llama-2-70B to enhance the MultiWOZ dataset with user backstories, a typical example of chitchat interference in TODs. We assess the impact of this addition by testing two models: one trained solely on TODs and another trained on TODs with a preliminary chitchat interaction. Our analysis demonstrates that our enhanced dataset poses a challenge for these systems. Moreover, we demonstrate that our dataset can be effectively used for training purposes, enabling a system to consistently acknowledge the user's backstory while also successfully moving the task forward in the same turn, as confirmed by human evaluation. These findings highlight the benefits of generating novel chitchat-TOD scenarios to test TOD systems more thoroughly and improve their resilience to natural user interferences",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15248v3,2024-02
GPT-HateCheck: Can LLMs Write Better Functional Tests for Hate Speech Detection?,"Yiping Jin, Leo Wanner, Alexander Shvets","Online hate detection suffers from biases incurred in data sampling, annotation, and model pre-training. Therefore, measuring the averaged performance over all examples in held-out test data is inadequate. Instead, we must identify specific model weaknesses and be informed when it is more likely to fail. A recent proposal in this direction is HateCheck, a suite for testing fine-grained model functionalities on synthesized data generated using templates of the kind ""You are just a [slur] to me."" However, despite enabling more detailed diagnostic insights, the HateCheck test cases are often generic and have simplistic sentence structures that do not match the real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose GPT-HateCheck, a framework to generate more diverse and realistic functional tests from scratch by instructing large language models (LLMs). We employ an additional natural language inference (NLI) model to verify the generations. Crowd-sourced annotation demonstrates that the generated test cases are of high quality. Using the new functional tests, we can uncover model weaknesses that would be overlooked using the original HateCheck dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15238v2,2024-02
ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and Two-Phase Partition,"Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li","Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15220v4,2024-02
BSPA: Exploring Black-box Stealthy Prompt Attacks against Image Generators,"Yu Tian, Xiao Yang, Yinpeng Dong, Heming Yang, Hang Su, Jun Zhu","Extremely large image generators offer significant transformative potential across diverse sectors. It allows users to design specific prompts to generate realistic images through some black-box APIs. However, some studies reveal that image generators are notably susceptible to attacks and generate Not Suitable For Work (NSFW) contents by manually designed toxin texts, especially imperceptible to human observers. We urgently need a multitude of universal and transferable prompts to improve the safety of image generators, especially black-box-released APIs. Nevertheless, they are constrained by labor-intensive design processes and heavily reliant on the quality of the given instructions. To achieve this, we introduce a black-box stealthy prompt attack (BSPA) that adopts a retriever to simulate attacks from API users. It can effectively harness filter scores to tune the retrieval space of sensitive words for matching the input prompts, thereby crafting stealthy prompts tailored for image generators. Significantly, this approach is model-agnostic and requires no internal access to the model's features, ensuring its applicability to a wide range of image generators. Building on BSPA, we have constructed an automated prompt tool and a comprehensive prompt attack dataset (NSFWeval). Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSPA effectively explores the security vulnerabilities in a variety of state-of-the-art available black-box models, including Stable Diffusion XL, Midjourney, and DALL-E 2/3. Furthermore, we develop a resilient text filter and offer targeted recommendations to ensure the security of image generators against prompt attacks in the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15218v1,2024-02
Fine-Grained Detoxification via Instance-Level Prefixes for Large Language Models,"Xin Yi, Linlin Wang, Xiaoling Wang, Liang He","Impressive results have been achieved in natural language processing (NLP) tasks through the training of large language models (LLMs). However, these models occasionally produce toxic content such as insults, threats, and profanity in response to certain prompts, thereby constraining their practical utility. To tackle this issue, various finetuning-based and decoding-based approaches have been utilized to mitigate toxicity. However, these methods typically necessitate additional costs such as high-quality training data or auxiliary models. In this paper, we propose fine-grained detoxification via instance-level prefixes (FGDILP) to mitigate toxic text without additional cost. Specifically, FGDILP contrasts the contextualized representation in attention space using a positive prefix-prepended prompt against multiple negative prefix-prepended prompts at the instance level. This allows for constructing fine-grained subtoxicity vectors, which enables collaborative detoxification by fusing them to correct the normal generation process when provided with a raw prompt. We validate that FGDILP enables controlled text generation with regard to toxicity at both the utterance and context levels. Our method surpasses prompt-based baselines in detoxification, although at a slight cost to generation fluency and diversity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15202v2,2024-02
DeMPT: Decoding-enhanced Multi-phase Prompt Tuning for Making LLMs Be Better Context-aware Translators,"Xinglin Lyu, Junhui Li, Yanqing Zhao, Min Zhang, Daimeng Wei, Shimin Tao, Hao Yang, Min Zhang","Generally, the decoder-only large language models (LLMs) are adapted to context-aware neural machine translation (NMT) in a concatenating way, where LLMs take the concatenation of the source sentence (i.e., intra-sentence context) and the inter-sentence context as the input, and then to generate the target tokens sequentially. This adaptation strategy, i.e., concatenation mode, considers intra-sentence and inter-sentence contexts with the same priority, despite an apparent difference between the two kinds of contexts. In this paper, we propose an alternative adaptation approach, named Decoding-enhanced Multi-phase Prompt Tuning (DeMPT), to make LLMs discriminately model and utilize the inter- and intra-sentence context and more effectively adapt LLMs to context-aware NMT. First, DeMPT divides the context-aware NMT process into three separate phases. During each phase, different continuous prompts are introduced to make LLMs discriminately model various information. Second, DeMPT employs a heuristic way to further discriminately enhance the utilization of the source-side inter- and intra-sentence information at the final decoding phase. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the concatenation method, and further improves the performance of LLMs in discourse modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15200v2,2024-02
Biomedical Entity Linking as Multiple Choice Question Answering,"Zhenxi Lin, Ziheng Zhang, Xian Wu, Yefeng Zheng","Although biomedical entity linking (BioEL) has made significant progress with pre-trained language models, challenges still exist for fine-grained and long-tailed entities. To address these challenges, we present BioELQA, a novel model that treats Biomedical Entity Linking as Multiple Choice Question Answering. BioELQA first obtains candidate entities with a fast retriever, jointly presents the mention and candidate entities to a generator, and then outputs the predicted symbol associated with its chosen entity. This formulation enables explicit comparison of different candidate entities, thus capturing fine-grained interactions between mentions and entities, as well as among entities themselves. To improve generalization for long-tailed entities, we retrieve similar labeled training instances as clues and concatenate the input with retrieved instances for the generator. Extensive experimental results show that BioELQA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on several datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15189v2,2024-02
Break the Breakout: Reinventing LM Defense Against Jailbreak Attacks with Self-Refinement,"Heegyu Kim, Sehyun Yuk, Hyunsouk Cho","Caution: This paper includes offensive words that could potentially cause unpleasantness. Language models (LMs) are vulnerable to exploitation for adversarial misuse. Training LMs for safety alignment is extensive and makes it hard to respond to fast-developing attacks immediately, such as jailbreaks. We propose self-refine with formatting that achieves outstanding safety even in non-safety-aligned LMs and evaluate our method alongside several defense baselines, demonstrating that it is the safest training-free method against jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we proposed a formatting method that improves the efficiency of the self-refine process while reducing attack success rates in fewer iterations. We've also observed that non-safety-aligned LMs outperform safety-aligned LMs in safety tasks by giving more helpful and safe responses. In conclusion, our findings can achieve less safety risk with fewer computational costs, allowing non-safety LM to be easily utilized in real-world service.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15180v2,2024-02
Advancing Parameter Efficiency in Fine-tuning via Representation Editing,"Muling Wu, Wenhao Liu, Xiaohua Wang, Tianlong Li, Changze Lv, Zixuan Ling, Jianhao Zhu, Cenyuan Zhang, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang","Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques have drawn significant attention due to their ability to yield competitive results while updating only a small portion of the adjustable parameters. However, existing PEFT methods pose challenges in hyperparameter selection, such as choosing the rank for LoRA or Adapter, or specifying the length of soft prompts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach for neural models, named Representation EDiting (RED), which modifies the representations generated at some layers through the application of scaling and biasing operations. While existing PEFT methods still demonstrate over-parameterization that could potentially undermine the generalization ability acquired from pre-training, RED can substantially reduce the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 25, 700 compared to full parameter fine-tuning and by a factor of 32 relative to LoRA. Remarkably, RED achieves results comparable or superior to both full parameter fine-tuning and other PEFT methods. Extensive experiments across various model architectures and scales, including RoBERTa, GPT-2, T5, and LLaMA-2, have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of RED1, thereby positioning it as a promising PEFT strategy for large-scale neural models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15179v3,2024-02
Entity-level Factual Adaptiveness of Fine-tuning based Abstractive Summarization Models,"Jongyoon Song, Nohil Park, Bongkyu Hwang, Jaewoong Yun, Seongho Joe, Youngjune L. Gwon, Sungroh Yoon","Abstractive summarization models often generate factually inconsistent content particularly when the parametric knowledge of the model conflicts with the knowledge in the input document. In this paper, we analyze the robustness of fine-tuning based summarization models to the knowledge conflict, which we call factual adaptiveness. We utilize pre-trained language models to construct evaluation sets and find that factual adaptiveness is not strongly correlated with factual consistency on original datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a controllable counterfactual data augmentation method where the degree of knowledge conflict within the augmented data can be adjustable. Our experimental results on two pre-trained language models (PEGASUS and BART) and two fine-tuning datasets (XSum and CNN/DailyMail) demonstrate that our method enhances factual adaptiveness while achieving factual consistency on original datasets on par with the contrastive learning baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15162v1,2024-02
Machine Unlearning of Pre-trained Large Language Models,"Jin Yao, Eli Chien, Minxin Du, Xinyao Niu, Tianhao Wang, Zezhou Cheng, Xiang Yue","This study investigates the concept of the `right to be forgotten' within the context of large language models (LLMs). We explore machine unlearning as a pivotal solution, with a focus on pre-trained models--a notably under-researched area. Our research delineates a comprehensive framework for machine unlearning in pre-trained LLMs, encompassing a critical analysis of seven diverse unlearning methods. Through rigorous evaluation using curated datasets from arXiv, books, and GitHub, we establish a robust benchmark for unlearning performance, demonstrating that these methods are over $10^5$ times more computationally efficient than retraining. Our results show that integrating gradient ascent with gradient descent on in-distribution data improves hyperparameter robustness. We also provide detailed guidelines for efficient hyperparameter tuning in the unlearning process. Our findings advance the discourse on ethical AI practices, offering substantive insights into the mechanics of machine unlearning for pre-trained LLMs and underscoring the potential for responsible AI development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15159v3,2024-02
Speech Corpus for Korean Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Towards Automatic Assessment Systems,"Seonwoo Lee, Jihyun Mun, Sunhee Kim, Minhwa Chung","Despite the growing demand for digital therapeutics for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), there is currently no speech corpus available for Korean children with ASD. This paper introduces a speech corpus specifically designed for Korean children with ASD, aiming to advance speech technologies such as pronunciation and severity evaluation. Speech recordings from speech and language evaluation sessions were transcribed, and annotated for articulatory and linguistic characteristics. Three speech and language pathologists rated these recordings for social communication severity (SCS) and pronunciation proficiency (PP) using a 3-point Likert scale. The total number of participants will be 300 for children with ASD and 50 for typically developing (TD) children. The paper also analyzes acoustic and linguistic features extracted from speech data collected and completed for annotation from 73 children with ASD and 9 TD children to investigate the characteristics of children with ASD and identify significant features that correlate with the clinical scores. The results reveal some speech and linguistic characteristics in children with ASD that differ from those in TD children or another subgroup of ASD categorized by clinical scores, demonstrating the potential for developing automatic assessment systems for SCS and PP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15539v1,2024-02
Self-Adaptive Reconstruction with Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Sentence Embeddings,"Junlong Liu, Xichen Shang, Huawen Feng, Junhao Zheng, Qianli Ma","Unsupervised sentence embeddings task aims to convert sentences to semantic vector representations. Most previous works directly use the sentence representations derived from pretrained language models. However, due to the token bias in pretrained language models, the models can not capture the fine-grained semantics in sentences, which leads to poor predictions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Self-Adaptive Reconstruction Contrastive Sentence Embeddings (SARCSE) framework, which reconstructs all tokens in sentences with an AutoEncoder to help the model to preserve more fine-grained semantics during tokens aggregating. In addition, we proposed a self-adaptive reconstruction loss to alleviate the token bias towards frequency. Experimental results show that SARCSE gains significant improvements compared with the strong baseline SimCSE on the 7 STS tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15153v1,2024-02
Where Visual Speech Meets Language: VSP-LLM Framework for Efficient and Context-Aware Visual Speech Processing,"Jeong Hun Yeo, Seunghee Han, Minsu Kim, Yong Man Ro","In visual speech processing, context modeling capability is one of the most important requirements due to the ambiguous nature of lip movements. For example, homophenes, words that share identical lip movements but produce different sounds, can be distinguished by considering the context. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Visual Speech Processing incorporated with LLMs (VSP-LLM), to maximize the context modeling ability by bringing the overwhelming power of LLMs. Specifically, VSP-LLM is designed to perform multi-tasks of visual speech recognition and translation, where the given instructions control the type of task. The input video is mapped to the input latent space of an LLM by employing a self-supervised visual speech model. Focused on the fact that there is redundant information in input frames, we propose a novel deduplication method that reduces the embedded visual features by employing visual speech units. Through the proposed deduplication and Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), VSP-LLM can be trained in a computationally efficient manner. In the translation dataset, the MuAViC benchmark, we demonstrate that VSP-LLM trained on just 30 hours of labeled data can more effectively translate lip movements compared to the recent model trained with 433 hours of data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15151v2,2024-02
Improving Sentence Embeddings with Automatic Generation of Training Data Using Few-shot Examples,"Soma Sato, Hayato Tsukagoshi, Ryohei Sasano, Koichi Takeda","Decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have shown high performance on many tasks in natural language processing. This is also true for sentence embedding learning, where a decoder-based model, PromptEOL, has achieved the best performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. However, PromptEOL requires a manually annotated natural language inference (NLI) dataset for fine-tuning. We aim to improve sentence embeddings without using large manually annotated datasets by automatically generating an NLI dataset with an LLM and using it for fine-tuning of PromptEOL. To achieve this, we explore methods of data generation suitable for sentence embedding learning in this study. Specifically, we will focus on automatic dataset generation through few-shot learning and explore the appropriate methods to leverage few-shot examples. Experimental results on the STS tasks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing models in settings without large manually annotated datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15132v2,2024-02
Interactive-KBQA: Multi-Turn Interactions for Knowledge Base Question Answering with Large Language Models,"Guanming Xiong, Junwei Bao, Wen Zhao","This study explores the realm of knowledge base question answering (KBQA). KBQA is considered a challenging task, particularly in parsing intricate questions into executable logical forms. Traditional semantic parsing (SP)-based methods require extensive data annotations, which result in significant costs. Recently, the advent of few-shot in-context learning, powered by large language models (LLMs), has showcased promising capabilities. However, fully leveraging LLMs to parse questions into logical forms in low-resource scenarios poses a substantial challenge. To tackle these hurdles, we introduce Interactive-KBQA, a framework designed to generate logical forms through direct interaction with knowledge bases (KBs). Within this framework, we have developed three generic APIs for KB interaction. For each category of complex question, we devised exemplars to guide LLMs through the reasoning processes. Our method achieves competitive results on the WebQuestionsSP, ComplexWebQuestions, KQA Pro, and MetaQA datasets with a minimal number of examples (shots). Importantly, our approach supports manual intervention, allowing for the iterative refinement of LLM outputs.

In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of LLM-driven multimodal agents, which we refer to as large multimodal agents ( LMAs for short). First, we introduce the essential components involved in developing LMAs and categorize the current body of research into four distinct types. Subsequently, we review the collaborative frameworks integrating multiple LMAs , enhancing collective efficacy. One of the critical challenges in this field is the diverse evaluation methods used across existing studies, hindering effective comparison among different LMAs . Therefore, we compile these evaluation methodologies and establish a comprehensive framework to bridge the gaps.

Executing Natural Language-Described Algorithms with Large Language Models: An Investigation,"Xin Zheng, Qiming Zhu, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun","Executing computer programs described in natural language has long been a pursuit of computer science. With the advent of enhanced natural language understanding capabilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs), the path toward this goal has been illuminated. In this paper, we seek to examine the capacity of present-day LLMs to comprehend and execute algorithms outlined in natural language. We established an algorithm test set sourced from Introduction to Algorithm, a well-known textbook that contains many representative widely-used algorithms. To systematically assess LLMs' code execution abilities, we selected 30 algorithms, generated 300 random-sampled instances in total, and evaluated whether popular LLMs can understand and execute these algorithms. Our findings reveal that LLMs, notably GPT-4, can effectively execute programs described in natural language, as long as no heavy numeric computation is involved. We believe our findings contribute to evaluating LLMs' code execution abilities and would encourage further investigation and application for the computation power of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00795v2,2024-02
A First Look at GPT Apps: Landscape and Vulnerability,"Zejun Zhang, Li Zhang, Xin Yuan, Anlan Zhang, Mengwei Xu, Feng Qian","Following OpenAI's introduction of GPTs, a surge in GPT apps has led to the launch of dedicated LLM app stores. Nevertheless, given its debut, there is a lack of sufficient understanding of this new ecosystem. To fill this gap, this paper presents a first comprehensive longitudinal (5-month) study of the evolution, landscape, and vulnerability of the emerging LLM app ecosystem, focusing on two GPT app stores: \textit{GPTStore.AI} and the official \textit{OpenAI GPT Store}. Specifically, we develop two automated tools and a TriLevel configuration extraction strategy to efficiently gather metadata (\ie names, creators, descriptions, \etc) and user feedback for all GPT apps across these two stores, as well as configurations (\ie system prompts, knowledge files, and APIs) for the top 10,000 popular apps. Our extensive analysis reveals: (1) the user enthusiasm for GPT apps consistently rises, whereas creator interest plateaus within three months of GPTs' launch; (2) nearly 90\% system prompts can be easily accessed due to widespread failure to secure GPT app configurations, leading to considerable plagiarism and duplication among apps. Our findings highlight the necessity of enhancing the LLM app ecosystem by the app stores, creators, and users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15105v3,2024-02
Evaluating the Performance of ChatGPT for Spam Email Detection,"Shijing Si, Yuwei Wu, Le Tang, Yugui Zhang, Jedrek Wosik","Email continues to be a pivotal and extensively utilized communication medium within professional and commercial domains. Nonetheless, the prevalence of spam emails poses a significant challenge for users, disrupting their daily routines and diminishing productivity. Consequently, accurately identifying and filtering spam based on content has become crucial for cybersecurity. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large language models like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performance in tasks such as question answering and text generation. However, its potential in spam identification remains underexplored. To fill in the gap, this study attempts to evaluate ChatGPT's capabilities for spam identification in both English and Chinese email datasets. We employ ChatGPT for spam email detection using in-context learning, which requires a prompt instruction and a few demonstrations. We also investigate how the number of demonstrations in the prompt affects the performance of ChatGPT. For comparison, we also implement five popular benchmark methods, including naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), feedforward dense neural networks (DNN), and BERT classifiers. Through extensive experiments, the performance of ChatGPT is significantly worse than deep supervised learning methods in the large English dataset, while it presents superior performance on the low-resourced Chinese dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15537v2,2024-02
AttributionBench: How Hard is Automatic Attribution Evaluation?,"Yifei Li, Xiang Yue, Zeyi Liao, Huan Sun","Modern generative search engines enhance the reliability of large language model (LLM) responses by providing cited evidence. However, evaluating the answer's attribution, i.e., whether every claim within the generated responses is fully supported by its cited evidence, remains an open problem. This verification, traditionally dependent on costly human evaluation, underscores the urgent need for automatic attribution evaluation methods. To bridge the gap in the absence of standardized benchmarks for these methods, we present AttributionBench, a comprehensive benchmark compiled from various existing attribution datasets. Our extensive experiments on AttributionBench reveal the challenges of automatic attribution evaluation, even for state-of-the-art LLMs. Specifically, our findings show that even a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 only achieves around 80% macro-F1 under a binary classification formulation. A detailed analysis of more than 300 error cases indicates that a majority of failures stem from the model's inability to process nuanced information, and the discrepancy between the information the model has access to and that human annotators do.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15089v1,2024-02
Hands-Free VR,"Jorge Askur Vazquez Fernandez, Jae Joong Lee, Santiago Andrés Serrano Vacca, Alejandra Magana, Radim Pesam, Bedrich Benes, Voicu Popescu","The paper introduces Hands-Free VR, a voice-based natural-language interface for VR. The user gives a command using their voice, the speech audio data is converted to text using a speech-to-text deep learning model that is fine-tuned for robustness to word phonetic similarity and to spoken English accents, and the text is mapped to an executable VR command using a large language model that is robust to natural language diversity. Hands-Free VR was evaluated in a controlled within-subjects study (N = 22) that asked participants to find specific objects and to place them in various configurations. In the control condition participants used a conventional VR user interface to grab, carry, and position the objects using the handheld controllers. In the experimental condition participants used Hands-Free VR. The results confirm that: (1) Hands-Free VR is robust to spoken English accents, as for 20 of our participants English was not their first language, and to word phonetic similarity, correctly transcribing the voice command 96.71% of the time; (2) Hands-Free VR is robust to natural language diversity, correctly mapping the transcribed command to an executable command in 97.83% of the time; (3) Hands-Free VR had a significant efficiency advantage over the conventional VR interface in terms of task completion time, total viewpoint translation, total view direction rotation, and total left and right hand translations; (4) Hands-Free VR received high user preference ratings in terms of ease of use, intuitiveness, ergonomics, reliability, and desirability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15083v2,2024-02
PEMT: Multi-Task Correlation Guided Mixture-of-Experts Enables Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning,"Zhisheng Lin, Han Fu, Chenghao Liu, Zhuo Li, Jianling Sun","Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as an effective method for adapting pre-trained language models to various tasks efficiently. Recently, there has been a growing interest in transferring knowledge from one or multiple tasks to the downstream target task to achieve performance improvements. However, current approaches typically either train adapters on individual tasks or distill shared knowledge from source tasks, failing to fully exploit task-specific knowledge and the correlation between source and target tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose PEMT, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework based on multi-task transfer learning. PEMT extends the mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework to capture the transferable knowledge as a weighted combination of adapters trained on source tasks. These weights are determined by a gated unit, measuring the correlation between the target and each source task using task description prompt vectors. To fully exploit the task-specific knowledge, we also propose the Task Sparsity Loss to improve the sparsity of the gated unit. We conduct experiments on a broad range of tasks over 17 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate our PEMT yields stable improvements over full fine-tuning, and state-of-the-art PEFT and knowledge transferring methods on various tasks. The results highlight the effectiveness of our method which is capable of sufficiently exploiting the knowledge and correlation features across multiple tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15082v2,2024-02
Infusing Hierarchical Guidance into Prompt Tuning: A Parameter-Efficient Framework for Multi-level Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition,"Haodong Zhao, Ruifang He, Mengnan Xiao, Jing Xu","Multi-level implicit discourse relation recognition (MIDRR) aims at identifying hierarchical discourse relations among arguments. Previous methods achieve the promotion through fine-tuning PLMs. However, due to the data scarcity and the task gap, the pre-trained feature space cannot be accurately tuned to the task-specific space, which even aggravates the collapse of the vanilla space. Besides, the comprehension of hierarchical semantics for MIDRR makes the conversion much harder. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based Parameter-Efficient Multi-level IDRR (PEMI) framework to solve the above problems. First, we leverage parameter-efficient prompt tuning to drive the inputted arguments to match the pre-trained space and realize the approximation with few parameters. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical label refining (HLR) method for the prompt verbalizer to deeply integrate hierarchical guidance into the prompt tuning. Finally, our model achieves comparable results on PDTB 2.0 and 3.0 using about 0.1% trainable parameters compared with baselines and the visualization demonstrates the effectiveness of our HLR method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15080v1,2024-02
Getting Serious about Humor: Crafting Humor Datasets with Unfunny Large Language Models,"Zachary Horvitz, Jingru Chen, Rahul Aditya, Harshvardhan Srivastava, Robert West, Zhou Yu, Kathleen McKeown","Humor is a fundamental facet of human cognition and interaction. Yet, despite recent advances in natural language processing, humor detection remains a challenging task that is complicated by the scarcity of datasets that pair humorous texts with similar non-humorous counterparts. In our work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs), can generate synthetic data for humor detection via editing texts. We benchmark LLMs on an existing human dataset and show that current LLMs display an impressive ability to 'unfun' jokes, as judged by humans and as measured on the downstream task of humor detection. We extend our approach to a code-mixed English-Hindi humor dataset, where we find that GPT-4's synthetic data is highly rated by bilingual annotators and provides challenging adversarial examples for humor classifiers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00794v2,2024-02
"Don't Just Say ""I don't know""! Self-aligning Large Language Models for Responding to Unknown Questions with Explanations","Yang Deng, Yong Zhao, Moxin Li, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua","Despite the remarkable abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer questions, they often display a considerable level of overconfidence even when the question does not have a definitive answer. To avoid providing hallucinated answers to these unknown questions, existing studies typically investigate approaches to refusing to answer these questions. In this work, we propose a novel and scalable self-alignment method to utilize the LLM itself to enhance its response-ability to different types of unknown questions, being capable of not only refusing to answer but also providing explanation to the unanswerability of unknown questions. Specifically, the Self-Align method first employ a two-stage class-aware self-augmentation approach to generate a large amount of unknown question-response data. Then we conduct disparity-driven self-curation to select qualified data for fine-tuning the LLM itself for aligning the responses to unknown questions as desired. Experimental results on two datasets across four types of unknown questions validate the superiority of the Self-Align method over existing baselines in terms of three types of task formulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15062v2,2024-02
Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Domain-specific Machine Translation,"Jiawei Zheng, Hanghai Hong, Feiyan Liu, Xiaoli Wang, Jingsong Su, Yonggui Liang, Shikai Wu","Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in domain-specific machine translation (MT). However, one major issue is that LLMs pre-trained on general domain corpus might not generalize well to specific domains due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge. To address this issue, this paper focuses on enhancing the domain-specific MT capability of LLMs, by providing high-quality training datasets and proposing a novel fine-tuning framework denoted by DragFT. DragFT augments LLMs via three techniques: (i) Dictionary-enhanced prompting integrates dictionary information into prompts to improve the translation of domain-specific terminology.; (ii) RAG-based few-shot example selection provides high-quality examples that simulate both the domain and style characteristics; (iii) Fine-tuning with few-shot examples further enhances performance when using in-domain examples. We deploy DragFT on three well-known LLM backbones with 13B training parameters to validate its effectiveness. The results on three domain-specific datasets show that DragFT achieves a significant performance boost and shows superior performance compared to advanced models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. The drastic performance improvement of DragFT over existing LLMs can be attributed to incorporating relevant knowledge while mitigating noise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15061v2,2024-02
ColBERT-XM: A Modular Multi-Vector Representation Model for Zero-Shot Multilingual Information Retrieval,"Antoine Louis, Vageesh Saxena, Gijs van Dijck, Gerasimos Spanakis","State-of-the-art neural retrievers predominantly focus on high-resource languages like English, which impedes their adoption in retrieval scenarios involving other languages. Current approaches circumvent the lack of high-quality labeled data in non-English languages by leveraging multilingual pretrained language models capable of cross-lingual transfer. However, these models require substantial task-specific fine-tuning across multiple languages, often perform poorly in languages with minimal representation in the pretraining corpus, and struggle to incorporate new languages after the pretraining phase. In this work, we present a novel modular dense retrieval model that learns from the rich data of a single high-resource language and effectively zero-shot transfers to a wide array of languages, thereby eliminating the need for language-specific labeled data. Our model, ColBERT-XM, demonstrates competitive performance against existing state-of-the-art multilingual retrievers trained on more extensive datasets in various languages. Further analysis reveals that our modular approach is highly data-efficient, effectively adapts to out-of-distribution data, and significantly reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions. By demonstrating its proficiency in zero-shot scenarios, ColBERT-XM marks a shift towards more sustainable and inclusive retrieval systems, enabling effective information accessibility in numerous languages. We publicly release our code and models for the community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15059v1,2024-02
On the Multi-turn Instruction Following for Conversational Web Agents,"Yang Deng, Xuan Zhang, Wenxuan Zhang, Yifei Yuan, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua","Web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in planning and executing multi-step interactions within complex web-based environments, fulfilling a wide range of web navigation tasks. Despite these advancements, the potential for LLM-powered agents to effectively engage with sequential user instructions in real-world scenarios has not been fully explored. In this work, we introduce a new task of Conversational Web Navigation, which necessitates sophisticated interactions that span multiple turns with both the users and the environment, supported by a specially developed dataset named Multi-Turn Mind2Web (MT-Mind2Web). To tackle the limited context length of LLMs and the context-dependency issue of the conversational tasks, we further propose a novel framework, named self-reflective memory-augmented planning (Self-MAP), which employs memory utilization and self-reflection techniques. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark the MT-Mind2Web dataset, and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15057v1,2024-02
Interpreting Context Look-ups in Transformers: Investigating Attention-MLP Interactions,"Clement Neo, Shay B. Cohen, Fazl Barez","Understanding the inner workings of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing their theoretical foundations and real-world applications. While the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) have been studied independently, their interactions remain largely unexplored. This study investigates how attention heads and next-token neurons interact in LLMs to predict new words. We propose a methodology to identify next-token neurons, find prompts that highly activate them, and determine the upstream attention heads responsible. We then generate and evaluate explanations for the activity of these attention heads in an automated manner. Our findings reveal that some attention heads recognize specific contexts relevant to predicting a token and activate a downstream token-predicting neuron accordingly. This mechanism provides a deeper understanding of how attention heads work with MLP neurons to perform next-token prediction. Our approach offers a foundation for further research into the intricate workings of LLMs and their impact on text generation and understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15055v2,2024-02
ToMBench: Benchmarking Theory of Mind in Large Language Models,"Zhuang Chen, Jincenzi Wu, Jinfeng Zhou, Bosi Wen, Guanqun Bi, Gongyao Jiang, Yaru Cao, Mengting Hu, Yunghwei Lai, Zexuan Xiong, Minlie Huang","Theory of Mind (ToM) is the cognitive capability to perceive and ascribe mental states to oneself and others. Recent research has sparked a debate over whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit a form of ToM. However, existing ToM evaluations are hindered by challenges such as constrained scope, subjective judgment, and unintended contamination, yielding inadequate assessments. To address this gap, we introduce ToMBench with three key characteristics: a systematic evaluation framework encompassing 8 tasks and 31 abilities in social cognition, a multiple-choice question format to support automated and unbiased evaluation, and a build-from-scratch bilingual inventory to strictly avoid data leakage. Based on ToMBench, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ToM performance of 10 popular LLMs across tasks and abilities. We find that even the most advanced LLMs like GPT-4 lag behind human performance by over 10% points, indicating that LLMs have not achieved a human-level theory of mind yet. Our aim with ToMBench is to enable an efficient and effective evaluation of LLMs' ToM capabilities, thereby facilitating the development of LLMs with inherent social intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15052v2,2024-02
Unlocking the Power of Large Language Models for Entity Alignment,"Xuhui Jiang, Yinghan Shen, Zhichao Shi, Chengjin Xu, Wei Li, Zixuan Li, Jian Guo, Huawei Shen, Yuanzhuo Wang","Entity Alignment (EA) is vital for integrating diverse knowledge graph (KG) data, playing a crucial role in data-driven AI applications. Traditional EA methods primarily rely on comparing entity embeddings, but their effectiveness is constrained by the limited input KG data and the capabilities of the representation learning techniques. Against this backdrop, we introduce ChatEA, an innovative framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) to improve EA. To address the constraints of limited input KG data, ChatEA introduces a KG-code translation module that translates KG structures into a format understandable by LLMs, thereby allowing LLMs to utilize their extensive background knowledge to improve EA accuracy. To overcome the over-reliance on entity embedding comparisons, ChatEA implements a two-stage EA strategy that capitalizes on LLMs' capability for multi-step reasoning in a dialogue format, thereby enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. Our experimental results verify ChatEA's superior performance, highlighting LLMs' potential in facilitating EA tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15048v2,2024-02
CARBD-Ko: A Contextually Annotated Review Benchmark Dataset for Aspect-Level Sentiment Classification in Korean,"Dongjun Jang, Jean Seo, Sungjoo Byun, Taekyoung Kim, Minseok Kim, Hyopil Shin","This paper explores the challenges posed by aspect-based sentiment classification (ABSC) within pretrained language models (PLMs), with a particular focus on contextualization and hallucination issues. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce CARBD-Ko (a Contextually Annotated Review Benchmark Dataset for Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification in Korean), a benchmark dataset that incorporates aspects and dual-tagged polarities to distinguish between aspect-specific and aspect-agnostic sentiment classification. The dataset consists of sentences annotated with specific aspects, aspect polarity, aspect-agnostic polarity, and the intensity of aspects. To address the issue of dual-tagged aspect polarities, we propose a novel approach employing a Siamese Network. Our experimental findings highlight the inherent difficulties in accurately predicting dual-polarities and underscore the significance of contextualized sentiment analysis models. The CARBD-Ko dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research endeavors in aspect-level sentiment classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15046v1,2024-02
KIEval: A Knowledge-grounded Interactive Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models,"Zhuohao Yu, Chang Gao, Wenjin Yao, Yidong Wang, Wei Ye, Jindong Wang, Xing Xie, Yue Zhang, Shikun Zhang","Automatic evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) are hindered by data contamination, leading to inflated assessments of their effectiveness. Existing strategies, which aim to detect contaminated texts, focus on quantifying contamination status instead of accurately gauging model performance. In this paper, we introduce KIEval, a Knowledge-grounded Interactive Evaluation framework, which incorporates an LLM-powered ""interactor"" role for the first time to accomplish a dynamic contamination-resilient evaluation. Starting with a question in a conventional LLM benchmark involving domain-specific knowledge, KIEval utilizes dynamically generated, multi-round, and knowledge-focused dialogues to determine whether a model's response is merely a recall of benchmark answers or demonstrates a deep comprehension to apply knowledge in more complex conversations. Extensive experiments on seven leading LLMs across five datasets validate KIEval's effectiveness and generalization. We also reveal that data contamination brings no contribution or even negative effect to models' real-world applicability and understanding, and existing contamination detection methods for LLMs can only identify contamination in pre-training but not during supervised fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15043v2,2024-02
CLoVe: Encoding Compositional Language in Contrastive Vision-Language Models,"Santiago Castro, Amir Ziai, Avneesh Saluja, Zhuoning Yuan, Rada Mihalcea","Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the performance of Vision and Language tasks. Foundational Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have been leveraged in multiple settings and demonstrated remarkable performance across several tasks. Such models excel at object-centric recognition yet learn text representations that seem invariant to word order, failing to compose known concepts in novel ways. However, no evidence exists that any VLM, including large-scale single-stream models such as GPT-4V, identifies compositions successfully. In this paper, we introduce a framework to significantly improve the ability of existing models to encode compositional language, with over 10% absolute improvement on compositionality benchmarks, while maintaining or improving the performance on standard object-recognition and retrieval benchmarks.

Towards Probabilistically-Sound Beam Search with Masked Language Models,"Creston Brooks, Robert Calef, Charlie Cowen-Breen, Anna Sappington","Beam search with masked language models (MLMs) is challenging in part because joint probability distributions over sequences are not readily available, unlike for autoregressive models. However, estimating such distributions has important domain-specific applications such as ancient text restoration and protein engineering. Here we present probabilistically-sound methods for beam search with MLMs. First, we clarify the conditions under which it is theoretically sound to perform text infilling with MLMs using standard beam search. When these conditions fail, we provide a probabilistically-sound inference time modification with no additional computational complexity and demonstrate that it is superior to the aforementioned beam search in the expected conditions. We then present empirical results comparing several infilling approaches with MLMs across several domains. Notably, our method probes the inductive biases of MLMs and explores the surprising contextual sensitivity of mask tokens for text infilling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15020v3,2024-02
Unintended Impacts of LLM Alignment on Global Representation,"Michael J. Ryan, William Held, Diyi Yang","Before being deployed for user-facing applications, developers align Large Language Models (LLMs) to user preferences through a variety of procedures, such as Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Current evaluations of these procedures focus on benchmarks of instruction following, reasoning, and truthfulness. However, human preferences are not universal, and aligning to specific preference sets may have unintended effects. We explore how alignment impacts performance along three axes of global representation: English dialects, multilingualism, and opinions from and about countries worldwide. Our results show that current alignment procedures create disparities between English dialects and global opinions. We find alignment improves capabilities in several languages. We conclude by discussing design decisions that led to these unintended impacts and recommendations for more equitable preference tuning. We make our code and data publicly available on Github.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15018v2,2024-02
Towards Few-Shot Adaptation of Foundation Models via Multitask Finetuning,"Zhuoyan Xu, Zhenmei Shi, Junyi Wei, Fangzhou Mu, Yin Li, Yingyu Liang","Foundation models have emerged as a powerful tool for many AI problems. Despite the tremendous success of foundation models, effective adaptation to new tasks, particularly those with limited labels, remains an open question and lacks theoretical understanding. An emerging solution with recent success in vision and NLP involves finetuning a foundation model on a selection of relevant tasks, before its adaptation to a target task with limited labeled samples. In this paper, we study the theoretical justification of this multitask finetuning approach. Our theoretical analysis reveals that with a diverse set of related tasks, this multitask finetuning leads to reduced error in the target task, in comparison to directly adapting the same pretrained model. We quantify the relationship between finetuning tasks and target tasks by diversity and consistency metrics, and further propose a practical task selection algorithm. We substantiate our theoretical claims with extensive empirical evidence. Further, we present results affirming our task selection algorithm adeptly chooses related finetuning tasks, providing advantages to the model performance on target tasks. We believe our study shed new light on the effective adaptation of foundation models to new tasks that lack abundant labels.

Ar-Spider: Text-to-SQL in Arabic,"Saleh Almohaimeed, Saad Almohaimeed, Mansour Al Ghanim, Liqiang Wang","In Natural Language Processing (NLP), one of the most important tasks is text-to-SQL semantic parsing, which focuses on enabling users to interact with the database in a more natural manner. In recent years, text-to-SQL has made significant progress, but most were English-centric. In this paper, we introduce Ar-Spider 1, the first Arabic cross-domain text-to-SQL dataset. Due to the unique nature of the language, two major challenges have been encountered, namely schema linguistic and SQL structural challenges. In order to handle these issues and conduct the experiments, we adopt two baseline models LGESQL [4] and S2SQL [12], both of which are tested with two cross-lingual models to alleviate the effects of schema linguistic and SQL structure linking challenges. The baselines demonstrate decent single-language performance on our Arabic text-to-SQL dataset, Ar-Spider, achieving 62.48% for S2SQL and 65.57% for LGESQL, only 8.79% below the highest results achieved by the baselines when trained in English dataset. To achieve better performance on Arabic text-to-SQL, we propose the context similarity relationship (CSR) approach, which results in a significant increase in the overall performance of about 1.52% for S2SQL and 1.06% for LGESQL and closes the gap between Arabic and English languages to 7.73%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15012v1,2024-02
How Important Is Tokenization in French Medical Masked Language Models?,"Yanis Labrak, Adrien Bazoge, Beatrice Daille, Mickael Rouvier, Richard Dufour","Subword tokenization has become the prevailing standard in the field of natural language processing (NLP) over recent years, primarily due to the widespread utilization of pre-trained language models. This shift began with Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and was later followed by the adoption of SentencePiece and WordPiece. While subword tokenization consistently outperforms character and word-level tokenization, the precise factors contributing to its success remain unclear. Key aspects such as the optimal segmentation granularity for diverse tasks and languages, the influence of data sources on tokenizers, and the role of morphological information in Indo-European languages remain insufficiently explored. This is particularly pertinent for biomedical terminology, characterized by specific rules governing morpheme combinations. Despite the agglutinative nature of biomedical terminology, existing language models do not explicitly incorporate this knowledge, leading to inconsistent tokenization strategies for common terms. In this paper, we seek to delve into the complexities of subword tokenization in French biomedical domain across a variety of NLP tasks and pinpoint areas where further enhancements can be made. We analyze classical tokenization algorithms, including BPE and SentencePiece, and introduce an original tokenization strategy that integrates morpheme-enriched word segmentation into existing tokenization methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15010v2,2024-02
CommVQA: Situating Visual Question Answering in Communicative Contexts,"Nandita Shankar Naik, Christopher Potts, Elisa Kreiss","Current visual question answering (VQA) models tend to be trained and evaluated on image-question pairs in isolation. However, the questions people ask are dependent on their informational needs and prior knowledge about the image content. To evaluate how situating images within naturalistic contexts shapes visual questions, we introduce CommVQA, a VQA dataset consisting of images, image descriptions, real-world communicative scenarios where the image might appear (e.g., a travel website), and follow-up questions and answers conditioned on the scenario and description. CommVQA, which contains 1000 images and 8,949 question-answer pairs, poses a challenge for current models. Error analyses and a human-subjects study suggest that generated answers still contain high rates of hallucinations, fail to fittingly address unanswerable questions, and don't suitably reflect contextual information. Overall, we show that access to contextual information is essential for solving CommVQA, leading to the highest performing VQA model and highlighting the relevance of situating systems within communicative scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15002v2,2024-02
Divide-or-Conquer? Which Part Should You Distill Your LLM?,"Zhuofeng Wu, He Bai, Aonan Zhang, Jiatao Gu, VG Vinod Vydiswaran, Navdeep Jaitly, Yizhe Zhang","Recent methods have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve reasoning tasks better when they are encouraged to solve subtasks of the main task first. In this paper we devise a similar strategy that breaks down reasoning tasks into a problem decomposition phase and a problem solving phase and show that the strategy is able to outperform a single stage solution. Further, we hypothesize that the decomposition should be easier to distill into a smaller model compared to the problem solving because the latter requires large amounts of domain knowledge while the former only requires learning general problem solving strategies. We propose methods to distill these two capabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference cost. We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the same time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models. However, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing performance and the resulting distilled model struggles with generalization. These results indicate that by using smaller, distilled problem decomposition models in combination with problem solving LLMs we can achieve reasoning with cost-efficient inference and local adaptation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15000v3,2024-02
tinyBenchmarks: evaluating LLMs with fewer examples,"Felipe Maia Polo, Lucas Weber, Leshem Choshen, Yuekai Sun, Gongjun Xu, Mikhail Yurochkin","The versatility of large language models (LLMs) led to the creation of diverse benchmarks that thoroughly test a variety of language models' abilities. These benchmarks consist of tens of thousands of examples making evaluation of LLMs very expensive. In this paper, we investigate strategies to reduce the number of evaluations needed to assess the performance of an LLM on several key benchmarks. For example, we show that to accurately estimate the performance of an LLM on MMLU, a popular multiple-choice QA benchmark consisting of 14K examples, it is sufficient to evaluate this LLM on 100 curated examples. We release evaluation tools and tiny versions of popular benchmarks: Open LLM Leaderboard, MMLU, HELM, and AlpacaEval 2.0.

Optimizing Language Models for Human Preferences is a Causal Inference Problem,"Victoria Lin, Eli Ben-Michael, Louis-Philippe Morency","As large language models (LLMs) see greater use in academic and commercial settings, there is increasing interest in methods that allow language models to generate texts aligned with human preferences. In this paper, we present an initial exploration of language model optimization for human preferences from direct outcome datasets, where each sample consists of a text and an associated numerical outcome measuring the reader's response. We first propose that language model optimization should be viewed as a causal problem to ensure that the model correctly learns the relationship between the text and the outcome. We formalize this causal language optimization problem, and we develop a method--causal preference optimization (CPO)--that solves an unbiased surrogate objective for the problem. We further extend CPO with doubly robust CPO (DR-CPO), which reduces the variance of the surrogate objective while retaining provably strong guarantees on bias. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of (DR-)CPO in optimizing state-of-the-art LLMs for human preferences on direct outcome data, and we validate the robustness of DR-CPO under difficult confounding conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14979v2,2024-02
GenCeption: Evaluate Multimodal LLMs with Unlabeled Unimodal Data,"Lele Cao, Valentin Buchner, Zineb Senane, Fangkai Yang","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are typically assessed using expensive annotated multimodal benchmarks, which often lag behind the rapidly evolving demands of MLLM evaluation. This paper outlines and validates GenCeption, a novel, annotation-free evaluation method that requires only unimodal data to measure inter-modality semantic coherence and inversely assesses MLLMs' tendency to hallucinate. This approach eliminates the need for costly data annotation, minimizes the risk of training data contamination, results in slower benchmark saturation, and avoids the illusion of emerging abilities. Inspired by the DrawCeption game, GenCeption begins with a non-textual sample and proceeds through iterative description and generation steps. The semantic drift across iterations is quantified using the GC@T metric. Based on the GenCeption method, we establish the MMECeption benchmark for evaluating Vision LLMs (VLLMs), and compare performance of several popular VLLMs and human annotators. Our empirical results validate GenCeption's effectiveness, demonstrating strong correlations with established VLLM benchmarks. VLLMs still significantly lack behind human performance and struggle especially with text-intensive tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14973v3,2024-02
MultiLS: A Multi-task Lexical Simplification Framework,"Kai North, Tharindu Ranasinghe, Matthew Shardlow, Marcos Zampieri","Lexical Simplification (LS) automatically replaces difficult to read words for easier alternatives while preserving a sentence's original meaning.

Mitigating Fine-tuning based Jailbreak Attack with Backdoor Enhanced Safety Alignment,"Jiongxiao Wang, Jiazhao Li, Yiquan Li, Xiangyu Qi, Junjie Hu, Yixuan Li, Patrick McDaniel, Muhao Chen, Bo Li, Chaowei Xiao","Despite the general capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM), these models still request fine-tuning or adaptation with customized data when meeting specific business demands. However, this process inevitably introduces new threats, particularly against the Fine-tuning based Jailbreak Attack (FJAttack) under the setting of Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS), where the model's safety has been significantly compromised by fine-tuning users' uploaded examples contain just a few harmful examples. Though potential defenses have been proposed that the service providers can integrate safety examples into the fine-tuning dataset to reduce safety issues, such approaches require incorporating a substantial amount of data, making it inefficient. To effectively defend against the FJAttack with limited safety examples under LMaaS, we propose the Backdoor Enhanced Safety Alignment method inspired by an analogy with the concept of backdoor attacks. In particular, service providers will construct prefixed safety examples with a secret prompt, acting as a ""backdoor trigger"". By integrating prefixed safety examples into the fine-tuning dataset, the subsequent fine-tuning process effectively acts as the ""backdoor attack"", establishing a strong correlation between the secret prompt and safety generations. Consequently, safe responses are ensured once service providers prepend this secret prompt ahead of any user input during inference. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that through the Backdoor Enhanced Safety Alignment with adding as few as 11 prefixed safety examples, the maliciously fine-tuned LLMs will achieve similar safety performance as the original aligned models without harming the benign performance. Furthermore, we also present the effectiveness of our method in a more practical setting where the fine-tuning data consists of both FJAttack examples and the fine-tuning task data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14968v3,2024-02
Mirror: A Multiple-perspective Self-Reflection Method for Knowledge-rich Reasoning,"Hanqi Yan, Qinglin Zhu, Xinyu Wang, Lin Gui, Yulan He","While Large language models (LLMs) have the capability to iteratively reflect on their own outputs, recent studies have observed their struggles with knowledge-rich problems without access to external resources. In addition to the inefficiency of LLMs in self-assessment, we also observe that LLMs struggle to revisit their predictions despite receiving explicit negative feedback. Therefore, We propose Mirror, a Multiple-perspective self-reflection method for knowledge-rich reasoning, to avoid getting stuck at a particular reflection iteration. Mirror enables LLMs to reflect from multiple-perspective clues, achieved through a heuristic interaction between a Navigator and a Reasoner. It guides agents toward diverse yet plausibly reliable reasoning trajectory without access to ground truth by encouraging (1) diversity of directions generated by Navigator and (2) agreement among strategically induced perturbations in responses generated by the Reasoner. The experiments on five reasoning datasets demonstrate that Mirror's superiority over several contemporary self-reflection approaches. Additionally, the ablation study studies clearly indicate that our strategies alleviate the aforementioned challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14963v2,2024-02

In contrast, using only linear attention must incur an irreducible additive approximation error. Furthermore, we establish a correspondence between LTB and one-step gradient descent estimators with learnable initialization ($\mathsf{GD}\text{-}\mathbf{\beta}$), in the sense that every $\mathsf{GD}\text{-}\mathbf{\beta}$ estimator can be implemented by an LTB estimator and every optimal LTB estimator that minimizes the in-class ICL risk is effectively a $\mathsf{GD}\text{-}\mathbf{\beta}$ estimator. Finally, we show that $\mathsf{GD}\text{-}\mathbf{\beta}$ estimators can be efficiently optimized with gradient flow, despite a non-convex training objective. Our results reveal that LTB achieves ICL by implementing $\mathsf{GD}\text{-}\mathbf{\beta}$, and they highlight the role of MLP layers in reducing approximation error.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14951v1,2024-02
L+M-24: Building a Dataset for Language + Molecules @ ACL 2024,"Carl Edwards, Qingyun Wang, Lawrence Zhao, Heng Ji","Language-molecule models have emerged as an exciting direction for molecular discovery and understanding. However, training these models is challenging due to the scarcity of molecule-language pair datasets. At this point, datasets have been released which are 1) small and scraped from existing databases, 2) large but noisy and constructed by performing entity linking on the scientific literature, and 3) built by converting property prediction datasets to natural language using templates. In this document, we detail the $\textit{L+M-24}$ dataset, which has been created for the Language + Molecules Workshop shared task at ACL 2024. In particular, $\textit{L+M-24}$ is designed to focus on three key benefits of natural language in molecule design: compositionality, functionality, and abstraction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00791v2,2024-02
Re-Examine Distantly Supervised NER: A New Benchmark and a Simple Approach,"Yuepei Li, Kang Zhou, Qiao Qiao, Qing Wang, Qi Li","Distantly-Supervised Named Entity Recognition (DS-NER) uses knowledge bases or dictionaries for annotations, reducing manual efforts but rely on large human labeled validation set. In this paper, we introduce a real-life DS-NER dataset, QTL, where the training data is annotated using domain dictionaries and the test data is annotated by domain experts. This dataset has a small validation set, reflecting real-life scenarios. Existing DS-NER approaches fail when applied to QTL, which motivate us to re-examine existing DS-NER approaches. We found that many of them rely on large validation sets and some used test set for tuning inappropriately. To solve this issue, we proposed a new approach, token-level Curriculum-based Positive-Unlabeled Learning (CuPUL), which uses curriculum learning to order training samples from easy to hard. This method stabilizes training, making it robust and effective on small validation sets. CuPUL also addresses false negative issues using the Positive-Unlabeled learning paradigm, demonstrating improved performance in real-life applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14948v3,2024-02
PALO: A Polyglot Large Multimodal Model for 5B People,"Muhammad Maaz, Hanoona Rasheed, Abdelrahman Shaker, Salman Khan, Hisham Cholakal, Rao M. Anwer, Tim Baldwin, Michael Felsberg, Fahad S. Khan","In pursuit of more inclusive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), this study introduces a Large Multilingual Multimodal Model called PALO. PALO offers visual reasoning capabilities in 10 major languages, including English, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, French, Arabic, Bengali, Russian, Urdu, and Japanese, that span a total of ~5B people (65% of the world population). Our approach involves a semi-automated translation approach to adapt the multimodal instruction dataset from English to the target languages using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, thereby ensuring high linguistic fidelity while allowing scalability due to minimal manual effort. The incorporation of diverse instruction sets helps us boost overall performance across multiple languages especially those that are underrepresented like Hindi, Arabic, Bengali, and Urdu. The resulting models are trained across three scales (1.7B, 7B and 13B parameters) to show the generalization and scalability where we observe substantial improvements compared to strong baselines. We also propose the first multilingual multimodal benchmark for the forthcoming approaches to evaluate their vision-language reasoning capabilities across languages.

Fine-Tuning Enhances Existing Mechanisms: A Case Study on Entity Tracking,"Nikhil Prakash, Tamar Rott Shaham, Tal Haklay, Yonatan Belinkov, David Bau","Fine-tuning on generalized tasks such as instruction following, code generation, and mathematics has been shown to enhance language models' performance on a range of tasks. Nevertheless, explanations of how such fine-tuning influences the internal computations in these models remain elusive. We study how fine-tuning affects the internal mechanisms implemented in language models. As a case study, we explore the property of entity tracking, a crucial facet of language comprehension, where models fine-tuned on mathematics have substantial performance gains. We identify the mechanism that enables entity tracking and show that (i) in both the original model and its fine-tuned versions primarily the same circuit implements entity tracking. In fact, the entity tracking circuit of the original model on the fine-tuned versions performs better than the full original model. (ii) The circuits of all the models implement roughly the same functionality: Entity tracking is performed by tracking the position of the correct entity in both the original model and its fine-tuned versions. (iii) Performance boost in the fine-tuned models is primarily attributed to its improved ability to handle the augmented positional information. To uncover these findings, we employ: Patch Patching, DCM, which automatically detects model components responsible for specific semantics, and CMAP, a new approach for patching activations across models to reveal improved mechanisms. Our findings suggest that fine-tuning enhances, rather than fundamentally alters, the mechanistic operation of the model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14811v1,2024-02
CriticBench: Benchmarking LLMs for Critique-Correct Reasoning,"Zicheng Lin, Zhibin Gou, Tian Liang, Ruilin Luo, Haowei Liu, Yujiu Yang","The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to critique and refine their reasoning is crucial for their application in evaluation, feedback provision, and self-improvement. This paper introduces CriticBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess LLMs' abilities to critique and rectify their reasoning across a variety of tasks. CriticBench encompasses five reasoning domains: mathematical, commonsense, symbolic, coding, and algorithmic. It compiles 15 datasets and incorporates responses from three LLM families. Utilizing CriticBench, we evaluate and dissect the performance of 17 LLMs in generation, critique, and correction reasoning, i.e., GQC reasoning. Our findings reveal: (1) a linear relationship in GQC capabilities, with critique-focused training markedly enhancing performance; (2) a task-dependent variation in correction effectiveness, with logic-oriented tasks being more amenable to correction; (3) GQC knowledge inconsistencies that decrease as model size increases; and (4) an intriguing inter-model critiquing dynamic, where stronger models are better at critiquing weaker ones, while weaker models can surprisingly surpass stronger ones in their self-critique. We hope these insights into the nuanced critique-correct reasoning of LLMs will foster further research in LLM critique and self-improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14809v4,2024-02

We focus on designing top-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters, a practical choice for mobile deployment. Contrary to prevailing belief emphasizing the pivotal role of data and parameter quantity in determining model quality, our investigation underscores the significance of model architecture for sub-billion scale LLMs. Leveraging deep and thin architectures, coupled with embedding sharing and grouped-query attention mechanisms, we establish a strong baseline network denoted as MobileLLM, which attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose an immediate block-wise weight-sharing approach with no increase in model size and only marginal latency overhead. The resultant models, denoted as MobileLLM-LS, demonstrate a further accuracy enhancement of 0.7%/0.8% than MobileLLM 125M/350M. Moreover, MobileLLM model family shows significant improvements compared to previous sub-billion models on chat benchmarks, and demonstrates close correctness to LLaMA-v2 7B in API calling tasks, highlighting the capability of small models for common on-device use cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14905v2,2024-02
RelayAttention for Efficient Large Language Model Serving with Long System Prompts,"Lei Zhu, Xinjiang Wang, Wayne Zhang, Rynson W. H. Lau","A practical large language model (LLM) service may involve a long system prompt, which specifies the instructions, examples, and knowledge documents of the task and is reused across requests. However, the long system prompt causes throughput/latency bottlenecks as the cost of generating the next token grows w.r.t. the sequence length. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of LLM services that involve long system prompts. Our key observation is that handling these system prompts requires heavily redundant memory accesses in existing causal attention computation algorithms. Specifically, for batched requests, the cached hidden states (\ie, key-value pairs) of system prompts are transferred from off-chip DRAM to on-chip SRAM multiple times, each corresponding to an individual request. To eliminate such a redundancy, we propose RelayAttention, an attention algorithm that allows reading these hidden states from DRAM exactly once for a batch of input tokens. RelayAttention is a free lunch: it maintains the generation quality while requiring no model retraining, as it is based on a mathematical reformulation of causal attention. We have observed significant performance improvements to a production-level system, vLLM, through integration with RelayAttention. The improvements are even more profound with longer system prompts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14808v3,2024-02
Identifying Multiple Personalities in Large Language Models with External Evaluation,"Xiaoyang Song, Yuta Adachi, Jessie Feng, Mouwei Lin, Linhao Yu, Frank Li, Akshat Gupta, Gopala Anumanchipalli, Simerjot Kaur","As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated with human daily applications rapidly, many societal and ethical concerns are raised regarding the behavior of LLMs. One of the ways to comprehend LLMs' behavior is to analyze their personalities. Many recent studies quantify LLMs' personalities using self-assessment tests that are created for humans. Yet many critiques question the applicability and reliability of these self-assessment tests when applied to LLMs. In this paper, we investigate LLM personalities using an alternate personality measurement method, which we refer to as the external evaluation method, where instead of prompting LLMs with multiple-choice questions in the Likert scale, we evaluate LLMs' personalities by analyzing their responses toward open-ended situational questions using an external machine learning model. We first fine-tuned a Llama2-7B model as the MBTI personality predictor that outperforms the state-of-the-art models as the tool to analyze LLMs' responses. Then, we prompt the LLMs with situational questions and ask them to generate Twitter posts and comments, respectively, in order to assess their personalities when playing two different roles. Using the external personality evaluation method, we identify that the obtained personality types for LLMs are significantly different when generating posts versus comments, whereas humans show a consistent personality profile in these two different situations. This shows that LLMs can exhibit different personalities based on different scenarios, thus highlighting a fundamental difference between personality in LLMs and humans. With our work, we call for a re-evaluation of personality definition and measurement in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14805v1,2024-02
Measuring Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning with MATH-Vision Dataset,"Ke Wang, Junting Pan, Weikang Shi, Zimu Lu, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li","Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising results in mathematical reasoning within visual contexts, with models approaching human-level performance on existing benchmarks such as MathVista.

Not All Experts are Equal: Efficient Expert Pruning and Skipping for Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models,"Xudong Lu, Qi Liu, Yuhui Xu, Aojun Zhou, Siyuan Huang, Bo Zhang, Junchi Yan, Hongsheng Li","A pivotal advancement in the progress of large language models (LLMs) is the emergence of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Compared to traditional LLMs, MoE LLMs can achieve higher performance with fewer parameters, but it is still hard to deploy them due to their immense parameter sizes. Different from previous weight pruning methods that rely on specifically designed hardware, this paper mainly aims to enhance the deployment efficiency of MoE LLMs by introducing plug-and-play expert-level sparsification techniques. Specifically, we propose, for the first time to our best knowledge, post-training approaches for task-agnostic and task-specific expert pruning and skipping of MoE LLMs, tailored to improve deployment efficiency while maintaining model performance across a wide range of tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed methods can simultaneously reduce model sizes and increase the inference speed, while maintaining satisfactory performance.

Watermarking Makes Language Models Radioactive,"Tom Sander, Pierre Fernandez, Alain Durmus, Matthijs Douze, Teddy Furon","We investigate the radioactivity of text generated by large language models (LLM), i.e. whether it is possible to detect that such synthetic input was used to train a subsequent LLM. Current methods like membership inference or active IP protection either work only in settings where the suspected text is known or do not provide reliable statistical guarantees. We discover that, on the contrary, it is possible to reliably determine if a language model was trained on synthetic data if that data is output by a watermarked LLM. Our new methods, specialized for radioactivity, detects with a provable confidence weak residuals of the watermark signal in the fine-tuned LLM. We link the radioactivity contamination level to the following properties: the watermark robustness, its proportion in the training set, and the fine-tuning process. For instance, if the suspect model is open-weight, we demonstrate that training on watermarked instructions can be detected with high confidence ($p$-value $< 10^{-5}$) even when as little as $5\%$ of training text is watermarked.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14904v2,2024-02
Enhancing Systematic Decompositional Natural Language Inference Using Informal Logic,"Nathaniel Weir, Kate Sanders, Orion Weller, Shreya Sharma, Dongwei Jiang, Zhengping Jiang, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Jansen, Peter Clark, Benjamin Van Durme","Recent language models enable new opportunities for structured reasoning with text, such as the construction of intuitive, proof-like textual entailment trees without relying on brittle formal logic. However, progress in this direction has been hampered by a long-standing lack of a clear protocol for determining what valid compositional entailment is. This absence causes noisy datasets and limited performance gains by modern neuro-symbolic engines. To address these problems, we formulate a consistent and theoretically grounded approach to annotating decompositional entailment and evaluate its impact on LLM-based textual inference. We find that our new dataset, RDTE (Recognizing Decompositional Textual Entailment), has a substantially higher internal consistency (+9%) than prior decompositional entailment datasets. We also find that training an RDTE-oriented entailment classifier via knowledge distillation and employing it in an entailment tree reasoning engine significantly improves both accuracy and proof quality, illustrating the practical benefit of this advance for textual inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14798v3,2024-02
Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in instruction tuning of large language models,"Nadezhda Chirkova, Vassilina Nikoulina","Instruction tuning (IT) is widely used to teach pretrained large language models (LLMs) to follow arbitrary instructions, but is under-studied in multilingual settings. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in IT, when an LLM is instruction-tuned on English-only data and then tested on user prompts in other languages. We advocate for the importance of evaluating various aspects of model responses in multilingual instruction following and investigate the influence of different model configuration choices. We find that cross-lingual transfer does happen successfully in IT even if all stages of model training are English-centric, but only if multiliguality is taken into account in hyperparameter tuning and with large enough IT data. English-trained LLMs are capable of generating correct-language, comprehensive and helpful responses in other languages, but suffer from low factuality and may occasionally have fluency errors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14778v2,2024-02
2D Matryoshka Sentence Embeddings,"Xianming Li, Zongxi Li, Jing Li, Haoran Xie, Qing Li","Common approaches rely on fixed-length embedding vectors from language models as sentence embeddings for downstream tasks such as semantic textual similarity (STS). Such methods are limited in their flexibility due to unknown computational constraints and budgets across various applications. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) \cite{aditya2022matryoshka} encodes information at finer granularities, i.e., with lower embedding dimensions, to adaptively accommodate \emph{ad hoc} tasks. Similar accuracy can be achieved with a smaller embedding size, leading to speedups in downstream tasks. Despite its improved efficiency, MRL still requires traversing all Transformer layers before obtaining the embedding, which remains the dominant factor in time and memory consumption. This prompts consideration of whether the fixed number of Transformer layers affects representation quality and whether using intermediate layers for sentence representation is feasible. In this paper, we introduce a novel sentence embedding model called \textit{Two-dimensional Matryoshka Sentence Embedding} (2DMSE)\footnote{Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/SeanLee97/AnglE/blob/main/README_2DMSE.md}.}. It supports elastic settings for both embedding sizes and Transformer layers, offering greater flexibility and efficiency than MRL. We conduct extensive experiments on STS tasks and downstream applications. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in dynamically supporting different embedding sizes and Transformer layers, allowing it to be highly adaptable to various scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14776v3,2024-02
MT-Bench-101: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Multi-Turn Dialogues,"Ge Bai, Jie Liu, Xingyuan Bu, Yancheng He, Jiaheng Liu, Zhanhui Zhou, Zhuoran Lin, Wenbo Su, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng, Wanli Ouyang","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has drastically enhanced dialogue systems. However, comprehensively evaluating the dialogue abilities of LLMs remains a challenge. Previous benchmarks have primarily focused on single-turn dialogues or provided coarse-grained and incomplete assessments of multi-turn dialogues, overlooking the complexity and fine-grained nuances of real-life dialogues. To address this issue, we introduce MT-Bench-101, specifically designed to evaluate the fine-grained abilities of LLMs in multi-turn dialogues. By conducting a detailed analysis of real multi-turn dialogue data, we construct a three-tier hierarchical ability taxonomy comprising 4208 turns across 1388 multi-turn dialogues in 13 distinct tasks. We then evaluate 21 popular LLMs based on MT-Bench-101, conducting comprehensive analyses from both ability and task perspectives and observing differing trends in LLMs performance across dialogue turns within various tasks. Further analysis indicates that neither utilizing common alignment techniques nor chat-specific designs has led to obvious enhancements in the multi-turn abilities of LLMs. Extensive case studies suggest that our designed tasks accurately assess the corresponding multi-turn abilities.

Generalizing Reward Modeling for Out-of-Distribution Preference Learning,Chen Jia,"Preference learning (PL) with large language models (LLMs) aims to align the LLMs' generations with human preferences. Previous work on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has demonstrated promising results in in-distribution PL. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining human feedback, discretely training reward models for every encountered distribution is challenging. Thus, out-of-distribution (OOD) PL is practically useful for enhancing the generalization ability of LLMs with limited preference feedback. This work addresses OOD PL by optimizing a general reward model through a meta-learning approach. During meta-training, a bilevel optimization algorithm is utilized to learn a reward model capable of guiding policy learning to align with human preferences across various distributions. When encountering a test distribution, the meta-test procedure conducts regularized policy optimization using the learned reward model for PL. We theoretically demonstrate the convergence rate of the bilevel optimization algorithm under reasonable assumptions. Additionally, we conduct experiments on two text generation tasks across 20 held-out domains and outperform a variety of strong baselines across various evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14760v2,2024-02
Tokenization counts: the impact of tokenization on arithmetic in frontier LLMs,"Aaditya K. Singh, DJ Strouse","Tokenization, the division of input text into input tokens, is an often overlooked aspect of the large language model (LLM) pipeline and could be the source of useful or harmful inductive biases. Historically, LLMs have relied on byte pair encoding, without care to specific input domains. With the increased use of LLMs for reasoning, various number-specific tokenization schemes have been adopted, with popular models like LLaMa and PaLM opting for single-digit tokenization while GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have separate tokens for each 1-, 2-, and 3-digit numbers. In this work, we study the effect this choice has on numerical reasoning through the use of arithmetic tasks. We consider left-to-right and right-to-left tokenization for GPT-3.5 and -4, finding that right-to-left tokenization (enforced by comma separating numbers at inference time) leads to largely improved performance. Furthermore, we find that model errors when using standard left-to-right tokenization follow stereotyped error patterns, suggesting that model computations are systematic rather than approximate. We show that the model is able to convert between tokenizations easily, thus allowing chain-of-thought-inspired approaches to recover performance on left-to-right tokenized inputs. We also find the gap between tokenization directions decreases when models are scaled, possibly indicating that larger models are better able to override this tokenization-dependent inductive bias. In summary, our work performs the first study of how number tokenization choices lead to differences in model performance on arithmetic tasks, accompanied by a thorough analysis of error patterns. We hope this work inspires practitioners to more carefully ablate number tokenization-related choices when working towards general models of numerical reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14903v1,2024-02
A Usage-centric Take on Intent Understanding in E-Commerce,"Wendi Zhou, Tianyi Li, Pavlos Vougiouklis, Mark Steedman, Jeff Z. Pan","Identifying and understanding user intents is a pivotal task for E-Commerce. Despite its essential role in product recommendation and business user profiling analysis, intent understanding has not been consistently defined or accurately benchmarked. In this paper, we focus on predicative user intents as ""how a customer uses a product"", and pose intent understanding as a natural language reasoning task, independent of product ontologies. We identify two weaknesses of FolkScope, the SOTA E-Commerce Intent Knowledge Graph: category-rigidity and property-ambiguity. They limit its ability to strongly align user intents with products having the most desirable property, and to recommend useful products across diverse categories. Following these observations, we introduce a Product Recovery Benchmark featuring a novel evaluation framework and an example dataset.

Scaling Efficient LLMs,B. N. Kausik,"Trained LLMs are typically sparse in that most of the parameters are zero, raising questions on efficiency. In response, we inquire into efficient LLMs, i.e. those with the fewest parameters that achieve the desired accuracy on a training corpus. Specifically, we compare theoretical and empirical estimates for training loss to obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of unique sequences in a natural training corpus as a function of its size. Our result implies (1) to double the number of skills represented in a training corpus, the corpus must scale more than four fold (2) for efficient LLMs, the number of parameters N and the size D of a natural training corpus scale as $N \propto D^{0.44}$; (3) if the number of parameters of an LLM is smaller than the number of unique sequences in the training corpus, scaling up can uncover emergent skills.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14746v3,2024-02

Chain-of-Thought Unfaithfulness as Disguised Accuracy,"Oliver Bentham, Nathan Stringham, Ana Marasović","Understanding the extent to which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generations align with a large language model's (LLM) internal computations is critical for deciding whether to trust an LLM's output. As a proxy for CoT faithfulness, Lanham et al. (2023) propose a metric that measures a model's dependence on its CoT for producing an answer. Within a single family of proprietary models, they find that LLMs exhibit a scaling-then-inverse-scaling relationship between model size and their measure of faithfulness, and that a 13 billion parameter model exhibits increased faithfulness compared to models ranging from 810 million to 175 billion parameters in size. We evaluate whether these results generalize as a property of all LLMs. We replicate the experimental setup in their section focused on scaling experiments with three different families of models and, under specific conditions, successfully reproduce the scaling trends for CoT faithfulness they report. However, after normalizing the metric to account for a model's bias toward certain answer choices, unfaithfulness drops significantly for smaller less-capable models. This normalized faithfulness metric is also strongly correlated ($R^2$=0.74) with accuracy, raising doubts about its validity for evaluating faithfulness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14897v3,2024-02
Efficient and Effective Vocabulary Expansion Towards Multilingual Large Language Models,"Seungduk Kim, Seungtaek Choi, Myeongho Jeong","This report introduces \texttt{EEVE-Korean-v1.0}, a Korean adaptation of large language models that exhibit remarkable capabilities across English and Korean text understanding.

Meanwhile, we introduce an innovative LLM-enhanced loss to enable the distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into a small-size LS system. From that, complex words within sentences are masked and a Difficulty-aware Filling module is crafted to replace masked positions with simpler words.

InfFeed: Influence Functions as a Feedback to Improve the Performance of Subjective Tasks,"Somnath Banerjee, Maulindu Sarkar, Punyajoy Saha, Binny Mathew, Animesh Mukherjee","Recently, influence functions present an apparatus for achieving explainability for deep neural models by quantifying the perturbation of individual train instances that might impact a test prediction. Our objectives in this paper are twofold. First we incorporate influence functions as a feedback into the model to improve its performance. Second, in a dataset extension exercise, using influence functions to automatically identify data points that have been initially `silver' annotated by some existing method and need to be cross-checked (and corrected) by annotators to improve the model performance. To meet these objectives, in this paper, we introduce InfFeed, which uses influence functions to compute the influential instances for a target instance. Toward the first objective, we adjust the label of the target instance based on its influencer(s) label. In doing this, InfFeed outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines (including LLMs) by a maximum macro F1-score margin of almost 4% for hate speech classification, 3.5% for stance classification, and 3% for irony and 2% for sarcasm detection. Toward the second objective we show that manually re-annotating only those silver annotated data points in the extension set that have a negative influence can immensely improve the model performance bringing it very close to the scenario where all the data points in the extension set have gold labels. This allows for huge reduction of the number of data points that need to be manually annotated since out of the silver annotated extension dataset, the influence function scheme picks up ~1/1000 points that need manual correction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14702v2,2024-02
COMPASS: Computational Mapping of Patient-Therapist Alliance Strategies with Language Modeling,"Baihan Lin, Djallel Bouneffouf, Yulia Landa, Rachel Jespersen, Cheryl Corcoran, Guillermo Cecchi","The therapeutic working alliance is a critical factor in predicting the success of psychotherapy treatment. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach utilizes advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze transcripts of psychotherapy sessions and compare them with distributed representations of statements in the working alliance inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions covering diverse psychiatric conditions including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal tendencies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories and offering interpretability for clinical psychiatry and in identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and their evolution at a turn-level resolution. This combined framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enabling timely feedback for therapists regarding the quality of therapeutic relationships and providing interpretable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14701v2,2024-02
Unveiling Linguistic Regions in Large Language Models,"Zhihao Zhang, Jun Zhao, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable cross-lingual alignment and generalization ability. Current research primarily focuses on improving LLMs' cross-lingual generalization capabilities. However, there is still a lack of research on the intrinsic mechanisms of how LLMs achieve cross-lingual alignment. From the perspective of region partitioning, this paper conducts several investigations on the linguistic competence of LLMs. We discover a core region in LLMs that corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters. Removing this core region by setting parameters to zero results in a significant performance decrease across 30 different languages. Furthermore, this core region exhibits significant dimensional dependence, perturbations to even a single parameter on specific dimensions leading to a loss of linguistic competence. Moreover, we discover that distinct monolingual regions exist for different languages, and disruption to these specific regions substantially reduces the LLMs' proficiency in those corresponding languages. Our research also indicates that freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training can mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a common phenomenon observed during further pre-training of LLMs. Overall, exploring the LLMs' functional regions provides insights into the foundation of their intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14700v3,2024-02
UFO: a Unified and Flexible Framework for Evaluating Factuality of Large Language Models,"Zhaoheng Huang, Zhicheng Dou, Yutao Zhu, Ji-rong Wen","Large language models (LLMs) may generate text that lacks consistency with human knowledge, leading to factual inaccuracies or \textit{hallucination}. Existing research for evaluating the factuality of LLMs involves extracting fact claims using an LLM and verifying them against a predefined fact source. However, these evaluation metrics are task-specific, and not scalable, and the substitutability of fact sources in different tasks is under-explored. To address these challenges, we categorize four available fact sources: human-written evidence, reference documents, search engine results, and LLM knowledge, along with five text generation tasks containing six representative datasets. Then, we propose \texttt{UFO}, an LLM-based unified and flexible evaluation framework to verify facts against plug-and-play fact sources. We implement five evaluation scenarios based on this framework. Experimental results show that for most QA tasks, human-written evidence and reference documents are crucial, and they can substitute for each other in retrieval-augmented QA tasks. In news fact generation tasks, search engine results and LLM knowledge are essential. Our dataset and code are available at \url{https://github.com/WaldenRUC/UFO}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14690v1,2024-02
On Evaluation Protocols for Data Augmentation in a Limited Data Scenario,"Frédéric Piedboeuf, Philippe Langlais","Textual data augmentation (DA) is a prolific field of study where novel techniques to create artificial data are regularly proposed, and that has demonstrated great efficiency on small data settings, at least for text classification tasks. In this paper, we challenge those results, showing that classical data augmentation (which modify sentences) is simply a way of performing better fine-tuning, and that spending more time doing so before applying data augmentation negates its effect. This is a significant contribution as it answers several questions that were left open in recent years, namely~: which DA technique performs best (all of them as long as they generate data close enough to the training set, as to not impair training) and why did DA show positive results (facilitates training of network). We further show that zero- and few-shot DA via conversational agents such as ChatGPT or LLama2 can increase performances, confirming that this form of data augmentation is preferable to classical methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14895v2,2024-02

Middleware for LLMs: Tools Are Instrumental for Language Agents in Complex Environments,"Yu Gu, Yiheng Shu, Hao Yu, Xiao Liu, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Jayanth Srinivasa, Hugo Latapie, Yu Su","The applications of large language models (LLMs) have expanded well beyond the confines of text processing, signaling a new era where LLMs are envisioned as generalist agents capable of operating within complex environments. These environments are often highly expansive, making it impossible for the LLM to process them within its short-term memory. Motivated by recent research on extending the capabilities of LLMs with tools, we seek to investigate the intriguing potential of tools to augment LLMs in handling such complexity by introducing a novel class of tools, termed middleware, to aid in the proactive exploration within these massive environments. Such specialized tools can serve as a middleware layer shielding the LLM from environmental complexity. In two representative complex environments -- knowledge bases (KBs) and databases -- we demonstrate the significant potential of augmenting language agents with tools in complex environments. Notably, equipped with the middleware, GPT-4 achieves 2.8X the performance of the best baseline in tasks requiring access to database content and 2.2X in KB tasks. Our findings illuminate the path for advancing language agents in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14672v2,2024-02

Unlike traditional benchmarks that evaluate general mathematical reasoning with an average accuracy, ConceptMath systematically organizes math problems under a hierarchy of math concepts, so that mathematical reasoning can be evaluated at different granularity with concept-wise accuracies. Based on our ConcepthMath, we evaluate a broad range of LLMs, and we observe existing LLMs, though achieving high average accuracies on traditional benchmarks, exhibit significant performance variations across different math concepts and may even fail catastrophically on the most basic ones. Besides, we also introduce an efficient fine-tuning strategy to enhance the weaknesses of existing LLMs. Finally, we hope ConceptMath could guide the developers to understand the fine-grained mathematical abilities of their models and facilitate the growth of foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14660v2,2024-02
OpenCodeInterpreter: Integrating Code Generation with Execution and Refinement,"Tianyu Zheng, Ge Zhang, Tianhao Shen, Xueling Liu, Bill Yuchen Lin, Jie Fu, Wenhu Chen, Xiang Yue","The introduction of large language models has significantly advanced code generation. However, open-source models often lack the execution capabilities and iterative refinement of advanced systems like the GPT-4 Code Interpreter. To address this, we introduce OpenCodeInterpreter, a family of open-source code systems designed for generating, executing, and iteratively refining code. Supported by Code-Feedback, a dataset featuring 68K multi-turn interactions, OpenCodeInterpreter integrates execution and human feedback for dynamic code refinement. Our comprehensive evaluation of OpenCodeInterpreter across key benchmarks such as HumanEval, MBPP, and their enhanced versions from EvalPlus reveals its exceptional performance. Notably, OpenCodeInterpreter-33B achieves an accuracy of 83.2 (76.4) on the average (and plus versions) of HumanEval and MBPP, closely rivaling GPT-4's 84.2 (76.2) and further elevates to 91.6 (84.6) with synthesized human feedback from GPT-4.

Cleaner Pretraining Corpus Curation with Neural Web Scraping,"Zhipeng Xu, Zhenghao Liu, Yukun Yan, Zhiyuan Liu, Ge Yu, Chenyan Xiong","The web contains large-scale, diverse, and abundant information to satisfy the information-seeking needs of humans. Through meticulous data collection, preprocessing, and curation, webpages can be used as a fundamental data resource for language model pretraining. However, when confronted with the progressively revolutionized and intricate nature of webpages, rule-based/feature-based web scrapers are becoming increasingly inadequate. This paper presents a simple, fast, and effective Neural web Scraper (NeuScraper) to help extract primary and clean text contents from webpages. Experimental results show that NeuScraper surpasses the baseline scrapers by achieving more than a 20% improvement, demonstrating its potential in extracting higher-quality data to facilitate the language model pretraining.

However, previous studies put much effort into general common sense reasoning and task planning capabilities of large-scale language or multi-modal models, relatively little effort on ensuring the deployability of generated code on real robots, and other fundamental components of autonomous robot systems including robot perception, motion planning, and control. To bridge this ``ideal-to-real'' gap, this paper presents \textbf{RobotScript}, a platform for 1) a deployable robot manipulation pipeline powered by code generation; and 2) a code generation benchmark for robot manipulation tasks in free-form natural language. The RobotScript platform addresses this gap by emphasizing the unified interface with both simulation and real robots, based on abstraction from the Robot Operating System (ROS), ensuring syntax compliance and simulation validation with Gazebo. We demonstrate the adaptability of our code generation framework across multiple robot embodiments, including the Franka and UR5 robot arms, and multiple grippers. Additionally, our benchmark assesses reasoning abilities for physical space and constraints, highlighting the differences between GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Gemini in handling complex physical interactions.

From Keywords to Structured Summaries: Streamlining Scholarly Information Access,"Mahsa Shamsabadi, Jennifer D'Souza","This paper highlights the growing importance of information retrieval (IR) engines in the scientific community, addressing the inefficiency of traditional keyword-based search engines due to the rising volume of publications. The proposed solution involves structured records, underpinning advanced information technology (IT) tools, including visualization dashboards, to revolutionize how researchers access and filter articles, replacing the traditional text-heavy approach. This vision is exemplified through a proof of concept centered on the ""reproductive number estimate of infectious diseases"" research theme, using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to automate the creation of structured records to populate a backend database that now goes beyond keywords.

The Impact of Word Splitting on the Semantic Content of Contextualized Word Representations,"Aina Garí Soler, Matthieu Labeau, Chloé Clavel","When deriving contextualized word representations from language models, a decision needs to be made on how to obtain one for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words that are segmented into subwords. What is the best way to represent these words with a single vector, and are these representations of worse quality than those of in-vocabulary words? We carry out an intrinsic evaluation of embeddings from different models on semantic similarity tasks involving OOV words. Our analysis reveals, among other interesting findings, that the quality of representations of words that are split is often, but not always, worse than that of the embeddings of known words. Their similarity values, however, must be interpreted with caution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14616v1,2024-02
Two Counterexamples to Tokenization and the Noiseless Channel,"Marco Cognetta, Vilém Zouhar, Sangwhan Moon, Naoaki Okazaki","In Tokenization and the Noiseless Channel (Zouhar et al., 2023a), R\'enyi efficiency is suggested as an intrinsic mechanism for evaluating a tokenizer: for NLP tasks, the tokenizer which leads to the highest R\'enyi efficiency of the unigram distribution should be chosen. The R\'enyi efficiency is thus treated as a predictor of downstream performance (e.g., predicting BLEU for a machine translation task), without the expensive step of training multiple models with different tokenizers. Although useful, the predictive power of this metric is not perfect, and the authors note there are additional qualities of a good tokenization scheme that R\'enyi efficiency alone cannot capture.   We describe two variants of BPE tokenization which can arbitrarily increase R\'enyi efficiency while decreasing the downstream model performance. These counterexamples expose cases where R\'enyi efficiency fails as an intrinsic tokenization metric and thus give insight for building more accurate predictors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14614v2,2024-02
LLM-DA: Data Augmentation via Large Language Models for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition,"Junjie Ye, Nuo Xu, Yikun Wang, Jie Zhou, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang","Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs), their performance on information extraction tasks is still not entirely satisfactory. However, their remarkable rewriting capabilities and extensive world knowledge offer valuable insights to improve these tasks. In this paper, we propose $LLM-DA$, a novel data augmentation technique based on LLMs for the few-shot NER task. To overcome the limitations of existing data augmentation methods that compromise semantic integrity and address the uncertainty inherent in LLM-generated text, we leverage the distinctive characteristics of the NER task by augmenting the original data at both the contextual and entity levels. Our approach involves employing 14 contextual rewriting strategies, designing entity replacements of the same type, and incorporating noise injection to enhance robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing NER model performance with limited data. Furthermore, additional analyses provide further evidence supporting the assertion that the quality of the data we generate surpasses that of other existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14568v1,2024-02
SIMPLOT: Enhancing Chart Question Answering by Distilling Essentials,"Wonjoong Kim, Sangwu Park, Yeonjun In, Seokwon Han, Chanyoung Park","Recently, interpreting complex charts with logical reasoning has emerged as challenges due to the development of vision-language models. A prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) model has presented an end-to-end method that leverages the vision-language model to convert charts into table format utilizing Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning. However, unlike natural images, charts contain a mix of essential and irrelevant information required for chart reasoning, and we discover that this characteristic can lower the performance of chart-to-table extraction. In this paper, we introduce SIMPLOT, a method designed to extract only the elements necessary for chart reasoning. The proposed method involves two steps: 1) training to mimic a simple plot that contains only the essential information from a complex chart for table extraction, followed by 2) performing reasoning based on the table. Our model enables accurate chart reasoning without the need for additional annotations or datasets, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through various experiments. Furthermore, we propose a novel prompt mimicking how human interpret charts for more accurate reasoning.

This transformative shift driven by LLMs underscores the need to explore the underlying associated challenges and avenues for enhancement in their utilization. In this paper, our objective is to unravel and evaluate the obstacles and opportunities inherent in leveraging LLMs within an industrial context. To this end, we conduct a survey involving a group of industry practitioners, develop four research questions derived from the insights gathered, and examine 68 industry papers to address these questions and derive meaningful conclusions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14558v1,2024-02
OmniPred: Language Models as Universal Regressors,"Xingyou Song, Oscar Li, Chansoo Lee, Bangding Yang, Daiyi Peng, Sagi Perel, Yutian Chen","Regression is a powerful tool to accurately predict the outcome metric of a system given a set of parameters, but has traditionally been restricted to methods which are only applicable to a specific task. In this paper, we propose OmniPred, a framework for training language models as universal end-to-end regressors over $(x,y)$ data from arbitrary formats. Using data sourced from Google Vizier, one of the largest proprietary blackbox optimization databases in the world, our extensive experiments demonstrate that language models are capable of very precise numerical regression using only textual representations of mathematical parameters and values, and if given the opportunity to train at scale over multiple tasks, can significantly outperform traditional regression models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14547v5,2024-02
Less is More: Mitigating Multimodal Hallucination from an EOS Decision Perspective,"Zihao Yue, Liang Zhang, Qin Jin","Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often suffer from multimodal hallucinations, wherein they may create content that is not present in the visual inputs. In this paper, we explore a new angle of this issue: overly detailed training data hinders the model's ability to timely terminate generation, leading to continued outputs beyond visual perception limits. By investigating how the model decides to terminate generation with EOS, the special end-of-sentence token, we find that the model assesses the completeness of the entire sequence by comparing the generated text with the image. This observation suggests that the model possesses an inherent potential of making proper EOS decisions based on its visual perception to avoid overly lengthy outputs. To take advantage of such potential, we explore two methods to mitigate multimodal hallucinations: a training objective that enables the model to reduce hallucinations by learning from regular instruction data, and a data filtering strategy to prevent harmful training data from exacerbating model hallucinations. Both methods significantly improve the hallucination performance of LMMs, without requiring any additional data or knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14545v2,2024-02
Domain Generalization via Causal Adjustment for Cross-Domain Sentiment Analysis,"Siyin Wang, Jie Zhou, Qin Chen, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang","Domain adaption has been widely adapted for cross-domain sentiment analysis to transfer knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. Whereas, most methods are proposed under the assumption that the target (test) domain is known, making them fail to generalize well on unknown test data that is not always available in practice. In this paper, we focus on the problem of domain generalization for cross-domain sentiment analysis. Specifically, we propose a backdoor adjustment-based causal model to disentangle the domain-specific and domain-invariant representations that play essential roles in tackling domain shift. First, we rethink the cross-domain sentiment analysis task in a causal view to model the causal-and-effect relationships among different variables. Then, to learn an invariant feature representation, we remove the effect of domain confounders (e.g., domain knowledge) using the backdoor adjustment. A series of experiments over many homologous and diverse datasets show the great performance and robustness of our model by comparing it with the state-of-the-art domain generalization baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14536v1,2024-02

Through a comprehensive linguistic analysis, we compare the vocabulary, Part-Of-Speech (POS) distribution, dependency distribution, and sentiment of texts generated by three of the most popular LLMS today (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard) to diverse inputs. The results point to significant linguistic variations which, in turn, enable us to attribute a given text to its LLM origin with a favorable 88\% accuracy using a simple off-the-shelf classification model.

Should We Respect LLMs? A Cross-Lingual Study on the Influence of Prompt Politeness on LLM Performance,"Ziqi Yin, Hao Wang, Kaito Horio, Daisuke Kawahara, Satoshi Sekine","We investigate the impact of politeness levels in prompts on the performance of large language models (LLMs). Polite language in human communications often garners more compliance and effectiveness, while rudeness can cause aversion, impacting response quality. We consider that LLMs mirror human communication traits, suggesting they align with human cultural norms. We assess the impact of politeness in prompts on LLMs across English, Chinese, and Japanese tasks. We observed that impolite prompts often result in poor performance, but overly polite language does not guarantee better outcomes. The best politeness level is different according to the language. This phenomenon suggests that LLMs not only reflect human behavior but are also influenced by language, particularly in different cultural contexts. Our findings highlight the need to factor in politeness for cross-cultural natural language processing and LLM usage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14531v2,2024-02
Balanced Data Sampling for Language Model Training with Clustering,"Yunfan Shao, Linyang Li, Zhaoye Fei, Hang Yan, Dahua Lin, Xipeng Qiu","Data plays a fundamental role in the training of Large Language Models (LLMs). While attention has been paid to the collection and composition of datasets, determining the data sampling strategy in training remains an open question. Most LLMs are trained with a simple strategy, random sampling. However, this sampling strategy ignores the unbalanced nature of training data distribution, which can be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose ClusterClip Sampling to balance the text distribution of training data for better model training. Specifically, ClusterClip Sampling utilizes data clustering to reflect the data distribution of the training set and balances the common samples and rare samples during training based on the cluster results. A repetition clip operation is introduced to mitigate the overfitting issue led by samples from certain clusters. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of ClusterClip Sampling, which outperforms random sampling and other cluster-based sampling variants under various training datasets and large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14526v2,2024-02
Daisy-TTS: Simulating Wider Spectrum of Emotions via Prosody Embedding Decomposition,"Rendi Chevi, Alham Fikri Aji","We often verbally express emotions in a multifaceted manner, they may vary in their intensities and may be expressed not just as a single but as a mixture of emotions. This wide spectrum of emotions is well-studied in the structural model of emotions, which represents variety of emotions as derivative products of primary emotions with varying degrees of intensity. In this paper, we propose an emotional text-to-speech design to simulate a wider spectrum of emotions grounded on the structural model. Our proposed design, Daisy-TTS, incorporates a prosody encoder to learn emotionally-separable prosody embedding as a proxy for emotion. This emotion representation allows the model to simulate: (1) Primary emotions, as learned from the training samples, (2) Secondary emotions, as a mixture of primary emotions, (3) Intensity-level, by scaling the emotion embedding, and (4) Emotions polarity, by negating the emotion embedding. Through a series of perceptual evaluations, Daisy-TTS demonstrated overall higher emotional speech naturalness and emotion perceiveability compared to the baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14523v2,2024-02
Towards Unified Task Embeddings Across Multiple Models: Bridging the Gap for Prompt-Based Large Language Models and Beyond,"Xinyu Wang, Hainiu Xu, Lin Gui, Yulan He","Task embedding, a meta-learning technique that captures task-specific information, has gained popularity, especially in areas such as multi-task learning, model editing, and interpretability. However, it faces challenges with the emergence of prompt-guided Large Language Models (LLMs) operating in a gradient-free manner. Existing task embedding methods rely on fine-tuned, task-specific language models, which hinders the adaptability of task embeddings across diverse models, especially prompt-based LLMs. To hardness the potential of task embeddings in the era of LLMs, we propose a framework for unified task embeddings (FUTE), harmonizing task embeddings from various models, including smaller language models and LLMs with varied prompts, within a single vector space. Such uniformity enables comparison and analysis of similarities amongst different models, broadening the scope and utility of existing task embedding methods in multi-model scenarios, while maintaining their performance comparable to architecture-specific methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14522v2,2024-02
Malaysian English News Decoded: A Linguistic Resource for Named Entity and Relation Extraction,"Mohan Raj Chanthran, Lay-Ki Soon, Huey Fang Ong, Bhawani Selvaretnam","Standard English and Malaysian English exhibit notable differences, posing challenges for natural language processing (NLP) tasks on Malaysian English. Unfortunately, most of the existing datasets are mainly based on standard English and therefore inadequate for improving NLP tasks in Malaysian English. An experiment using state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) solutions on Malaysian English news articles highlights that they cannot handle morphosyntactic variations in Malaysian English. To the best of our knowledge, there is no annotated dataset available to improvise the model. To address these issues, we constructed a Malaysian English News (MEN) dataset, which contains 200 news articles that are manually annotated with entities and relations. We then fine-tuned the spaCy NER tool and validated that having a dataset tailor-made for Malaysian English could improve the performance of NER in Malaysian English significantly. This paper presents our effort in the data acquisition, annotation methodology, and thorough analysis of the annotated dataset. To validate the quality of the annotation, inter-annotator agreement was used, followed by adjudication of disagreements by a subject matter expert. Upon completion of these tasks, we managed to develop a dataset with 6,061 entities and 3,268 relation instances. Finally, we discuss on spaCy fine-tuning setup and analysis on the NER performance. This unique dataset will contribute significantly to the advancement of NLP research in Malaysian English, allowing researchers to accelerate their progress, particularly in NER and relation extraction.

"""My Answer is C"": First-Token Probabilities Do Not Match Text Answers in Instruction-Tuned Language Models","Xinpeng Wang, Bolei Ma, Chengzhi Hu, Leon Weber-Genzel, Paul Röttger, Frauke Kreuter, Dirk Hovy, Barbara Plank","The open-ended nature of language generation makes the evaluation of autoregressive large language models (LLMs) challenging. One common evaluation approach uses multiple-choice questions (MCQ) to limit the response space. The model is then evaluated by ranking the candidate answers by the log probability of the first token prediction. However, first-tokens may not consistently reflect the final response output, due to model's diverse response styles such as starting with ""Sure"" or refusing to answer. Consequently, MCQ evaluation is not indicative of model behaviour when interacting with users. But by how much? We evaluate how aligned first-token evaluation is with the text output along several dimensions, namely final option choice, refusal rate, choice distribution and robustness under prompt perturbation. Our results show that the two approaches are severely misaligned on all dimensions, reaching mismatch rates over 60%. Models heavily fine-tuned on conversational or safety data are especially impacted. Crucially, models remain misaligned even when we increasingly constrain prompts, i.e., force them to start with an option letter or example template. Our findings i) underscore the importance of inspecting the text output as well and ii) caution against relying solely on first-token evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14499v2,2024-02
Noise-BERT: A Unified Perturbation-Robust Framework with Noise Alignment Pre-training for Noisy Slot Filling Task,"Jinxu Zhao, Guanting Dong, Yueyan Qiu, Tingfeng Hui, Xiaoshuai Song, Daichi Guo, Weiran Xu","In a realistic dialogue system, the input information from users is often subject to various types of input perturbations, which affects the slot-filling task. Although rule-based data augmentation methods have achieved satisfactory results, they fail to exhibit the desired generalization when faced with unknown noise disturbances. In this study, we address the challenges posed by input perturbations in slot filling by proposing Noise-BERT, a unified Perturbation-Robust Framework with Noise Alignment Pre-training. Our framework incorporates two Noise Alignment Pre-training tasks: Slot Masked Prediction and Sentence Noisiness Discrimination, aiming to guide the pre-trained language model in capturing accurate slot information and noise distribution. During fine-tuning, we employ a contrastive learning loss to enhance the semantic representation of entities and labels. Additionally, we introduce an adversarial attack training strategy to improve the model's robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art models, and further analysis confirms its effectiveness and generalization ability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14494v3,2024-02
LLMBind: A Unified Modality-Task Integration Framework,"Bin Zhu, Munan Ning, Peng Jin, Bin Lin, Jinfa Huang, Qi Song, Junwu Zhang, Zhenyu Tang, Mingjun Pan, Xing Zhou, Li Yuan","In the multi-modal domain, the dependence of various models on specific input formats leads to user confusion and hinders progress. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{LLMBind}, a novel framework designed to unify a diverse array of multi-modal tasks. By harnessing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Model (LLM), LLMBind processes multi-modal inputs and generates task-specific tokens, enabling the invocation of corresponding models to accomplish tasks. This unique approach empowers LLMBind to interpret inputs and generate outputs across various modalities, including image, text, video, and audio. Furthermore, we have constructed an interaction dataset comprising 400k instructions, which unlocks the ability of LLMBind for interactive visual generation and editing tasks. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that LLMBind achieves very superior performance across diverse tasks and outperforms existing models in user evaluations conducted in real-world scenarios.

Recent works about high-quality instruction-following data generation and selection require amounts of human labor to conceive model-understandable instructions for the given tasks and carefully filter the LLM-generated data. In this work, we introduce an automatic instruction augmentation method named INSTRAUG in multimodal tasks. It starts from a handful of basic and straightforward meta instructions but can expand an instruction-following dataset by 30 times. Results on two popular multimodal instructionfollowing benchmarks MULTIINSTRUCT and InstructBLIP show that INSTRAUG can significantly improve the alignment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across 12 multimodal tasks, which is even equivalent to the benefits of scaling up training data multiple times.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14492v2,2024-02
Does the Generator Mind its Contexts? An Analysis of Generative Model Faithfulness under Context Transfer,"Xinshuo Hu, Baotian Hu, Dongfang Li, Xiaoguang Li, Lifeng Shang","The present study introduces the knowledge-augmented generator, which is specifically designed to produce information that remains grounded in contextual knowledge, regardless of alterations in the context. Previous research has predominantly focused on examining hallucinations stemming from static input, such as in the domains of summarization or machine translation. However, our investigation delves into the faithfulness of generative question answering in the presence of dynamic knowledge. Our objective is to explore the existence of hallucinations arising from parametric memory when contextual knowledge undergoes changes, while also analyzing the underlying causes for their occurrence. In order to efficiently address this issue, we propose a straightforward yet effective measure for detecting such hallucinations. Intriguingly, our investigation uncovers that all models exhibit a tendency to generate previous answers as hallucinations. To gain deeper insights into the underlying causes of this phenomenon, we conduct a series of experiments that verify the critical role played by context in hallucination, both during training and testing, from various perspectives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14488v1,2024-02
Is ChatGPT the Future of Causal Text Mining? A Comprehensive Evaluation and Analysis,"Takehiro Takayanagi, Masahiro Suzuki, Ryotaro Kobayashi, Hiroki Sakaji, Kiyoshi Izumi","Causality is fundamental in human cognition and has drawn attention in diverse research fields. With growing volumes of textual data, discerning causalities within text data is crucial, and causal text mining plays a pivotal role in extracting meaningful patterns. This study conducts comprehensive evaluations of ChatGPT's causal text mining capabilities. Firstly, we introduce a benchmark that extends beyond general English datasets, including domain-specific and non-English datasets. We also provide an evaluation framework to ensure fair comparisons between ChatGPT and previous approaches. Finally, our analysis outlines the limitations and future challenges in employing ChatGPT for causal text mining. Specifically, our analysis reveals that ChatGPT serves as a good starting point for various datasets. However, when equipped with a sufficient amount of training data, previous models still surpass ChatGPT's performance. Additionally, ChatGPT suffers from the tendency to falsely recognize non-causal sequences as causal sequences. These issues become even more pronounced with advanced versions of the model, such as GPT-4. In addition, we highlight the constraints of ChatGPT in handling complex causality types, including both intra/inter-sentential and implicit causality. The model also faces challenges with effectively leveraging in-context learning and domain adaptation. We release our code to support further research and development in this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14484v2,2024-02
Data Science with LLMs and Interpretable Models,"Sebastian Bordt, Ben Lengerich, Harsha Nori, Rich Caruana","Recent years have seen important advances in the building of interpretable models, machine learning models that are designed to be easily understood by humans. In this work, we show that large language models (LLMs) are remarkably good at working with interpretable models, too. In particular, we show that LLMs can describe, interpret, and debug Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Combining the flexibility of LLMs with the breadth of statistical patterns accurately described by GAMs enables dataset summarization, question answering, and model critique. LLMs can also improve the interaction between domain experts and interpretable models, and generate hypotheses about the underlying phenomenon.

Vygotsky Distance: Measure for Benchmark Task Similarity,"Maxim K. Surkov, Ivan P. Yamshchikov","Evaluation plays a significant role in modern natural language processing. Most modern NLP benchmarks consist of arbitrary sets of tasks that neither guarantee any generalization potential for the model once applied outside the test set nor try to minimize the resource consumption needed for model evaluation. This paper presents a theoretical instrument and a practical algorithm to calculate similarity between benchmark tasks, we call this similarity measure ""Vygotsky distance"". The core idea of this similarity measure is that it is based on relative performance of the ""students"" on a given task, rather that on the properties of the task itself. If two tasks are close to each other in terms of Vygotsky distance the models tend to have similar relative performance on them. Thus knowing Vygotsky distance between tasks one can significantly reduce the number of evaluation tasks while maintaining a high validation quality. Experiments on various benchmarks, including GLUE, SuperGLUE, CLUE, and RussianSuperGLUE, demonstrate that a vast majority of NLP benchmarks could be at least 40% smaller in terms of the tasks included. Most importantly, Vygotsky distance could also be used for the validation of new tasks thus increasing the generalization potential of the future NLP models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14890v2,2024-02
NLAS-multi: A Multilingual Corpus of Automatically Generated Natural Language Argumentation Schemes,"Ramon Ruiz-Dolz, Joaquin Taverner, John Lawrence, Chris Reed","Some of the major limitations identified in the areas of argument mining, argument generation, and natural language argument analysis are related to the complexity of annotating argumentatively rich data, the limited size of these corpora, and the constraints that represent the different languages and domains in which these data is annotated. To address these limitations, in this paper we present the following contributions: (i) an effective methodology for the automatic generation of natural language arguments in different topics and languages, (ii) the largest publicly available corpus of natural language argumentation schemes, and (iii) a set of solid baselines and fine-tuned models for the automatic identification of argumentation schemes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14458v1,2024-02
Annotation and Classification of Relevant Clauses in Terms-and-Conditions Contracts,"Pietro Giovanni Bizzaro, Elena Della Valentina, Maurizio Napolitano, Nadia Mana, Massimo Zancanaro","In this paper, we propose a new annotation scheme to classify different types of clauses in Terms-and-Conditions contracts with the ultimate goal of supporting legal experts to quickly identify and assess problematic issues in this type of legal documents. To this end, we built a small corpus of Terms-and-Conditions contracts and finalized an annotation scheme of 14 categories, eventually reaching an inter-annotator agreement of 0.92. Then, for 11 of them, we experimented with binary classification tasks using few-shot prompting with a multilingual T5 and two fine-tuned versions of two BERT-based LLMs for Italian. Our experiments showed the feasibility of automatic classification of our categories by reaching accuracies ranging from .79 to .95 on validation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14457v2,2024-02
Do LLMs Implicitly Determine the Suitable Text Difficulty for Users?,"Seiji Gobara, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe","Education that suits the individual learning level is necessary to improve students' understanding. The first step in achieving this purpose by using large language models (LLMs) is to adjust the textual difficulty of the response to students. This work analyzes how LLMs can implicitly adjust text difficulty between user input and its generated text. To conduct the experiments, we created a new dataset from Stack-Overflow to explore the performance of question-answering-based conversation. Experimental results on the Stack-Overflow dataset and the TSCC dataset, including multi-turn conversation show that LLMs can implicitly handle text difficulty between user input and its generated response. We also observed that some LLMs can surpass humans in handling text difficulty and the importance of instruction-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14453v1,2024-02
COBIAS: Contextual Reliability in Bias Assessment,"Priyanshul Govil, Hemang Jain, Vamshi Krishna Bonagiri, Aman Chadha, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Manas Gaur, Sanorita Dey","Large Language Models (LLMs) often inherit biases from the web data they are trained on, which contains stereotypes and prejudices. Current methods for evaluating and mitigating these biases rely on bias-benchmark datasets. These benchmarks measure bias by observing an LLM's behavior on biased statements. However, these statements lack contextual considerations of the situations they try to present. To address this, we introduce a contextual reliability framework, which evaluates model robustness to biased statements by considering the various contexts in which they may appear. We develop the Context-Oriented Bias Indicator and Assessment Score (COBIAS) to measure a biased statement's reliability in detecting bias based on the variance in model behavior across different contexts. To evaluate the metric, we augment 2,291 stereotyped statements from two existing benchmark datasets by adding contextual information. We show that COBIAS aligns with human judgment on the contextual reliability of biased statements (Spearman's $\rho = 0.65$, $p = 3.4 * 10^{-60}$) and can be used to create reliable datasets, which would assist bias mitigation works.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14889v3,2024-02
A Language Model's Guide Through Latent Space,"Dimitri von Rütte, Sotiris Anagnostidis, Gregor Bachmann, Thomas Hofmann","Concept guidance has emerged as a cheap and simple way to control the behavior of language models by probing their hidden representations for concept vectors and using them to perturb activations at inference time. While the focus of previous work has largely been on truthfulness, in this paper we extend this framework to a richer set of concepts such as appropriateness, humor, creativity and quality, and explore to what degree current detection and guidance strategies work in these challenging settings. To facilitate evaluation, we develop a novel metric for concept guidance that takes into account both the success of concept elicitation as well as the potential degradation in fluency of the guided model. Our extensive experiments reveal that while some concepts such as truthfulness more easily allow for guidance with current techniques, novel concepts such as appropriateness or humor either remain difficult to elicit, need extensive tuning to work, or even experience confusion. Moreover, we find that probes with optimal detection accuracies do not necessarily make for the optimal guides, contradicting previous observations for truthfulness. Our work warrants a deeper investigation into the interplay between detectability, guidability, and the nature of the concept, and we hope that our rich experimental test-bed for guidance research inspires stronger follow-up approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14433v1,2024-02
KoCoSa: Korean Context-aware Sarcasm Detection Dataset,"Yumin Kim, Heejae Suh, Mingi Kim, Dongyeon Won, Hwanhee Lee","Sarcasm is a way of verbal irony where someone says the opposite of what they mean, often to ridicule a person, situation, or idea. It is often difficult to detect sarcasm in the dialogue since detecting sarcasm should reflect the context (i.e., dialogue history). In this paper, we introduce a new dataset for the Korean dialogue sarcasm detection task, KoCoSa (Korean Context-aware Sarcasm Detection Dataset), which consists of 12.8K daily Korean dialogues and the labels for this task on the last response. To build the dataset, we propose an efficient sarcasm detection dataset generation pipeline: 1) generating new sarcastic dialogues from source dialogues with large language models, 2) automatic and manual filtering of abnormal and toxic dialogues, and 3) human annotation for the sarcasm detection task. We also provide a simple but effective baseline for the Korean sarcasm detection task trained on our dataset. Experimental results on the dataset show that our baseline system outperforms strong baselines like large language models, such as GPT-3.5, in the Korean sarcasm detection task. We show that the sarcasm detection task relies deeply on the existence of sufficient context. We will release the dataset at https://github.com/Yu-billie/KoCoSa_sarcasm_detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14428v2,2024-02
Text me the data: Generating Ground Pressure Sequence from Textual Descriptions for HAR,"Lala Shakti Swarup Ray, Bo Zhou, Sungho Suh, Lars Krupp, Vitor Fortes Rey, Paul Lukowicz","In human activity recognition (HAR), the availability of substantial ground truth is necessary for training efficient models. However, acquiring ground pressure data through physical sensors itself can be cost-prohibitive, time-consuming. To address this critical need, we introduce Text-to-Pressure (T2P), a framework designed to generate extensive ground pressure sequences from textual descriptions of human activities using deep learning techniques. We show that the combination of vector quantization of sensor data along with simple text conditioned auto regressive strategy allows us to obtain high-quality generated pressure sequences from textual descriptions with the help of discrete latent correlation between text and pressure maps. We achieved comparable performance on the consistency between text and generated motion with an R squared value of 0.722, Masked R squared value of 0.892, and FID score of 1.83. Additionally, we trained a HAR model with the the synthesized data and evaluated it on pressure dynamics collected by a real pressure sensor which is on par with a model trained on only real data. Combining both real and synthesized training data increases the overall macro F1 score by 5.9 percent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14427v1,2024-02
J-UniMorph: Japanese Morphological Annotation through the Universal Feature Schema,"Kosuke Matsuzaki, Masaya Taniguchi, Kentaro Inui, Keisuke Sakaguchi","We introduce a Japanese Morphology dataset, J-UniMorph, developed based on the UniMorph feature schema. This dataset addresses the unique and rich verb forms characteristic of the language's agglutinative nature. J-UniMorph distinguishes itself from the existing Japanese subset of UniMorph, which is automatically extracted from Wiktionary. On average, the Wiktionary Edition features around 12 inflected forms for each word and is primarily dominated by denominal verbs (i.e., [noun] +suru (do-PRS)). Morphologically, this form is equivalent to the verb suru (do). In contrast, J-UniMorph explores a much broader and more frequently used range of verb forms, offering 118 inflected forms for each word on average. It includes honorifics, a range of politeness levels, and other linguistic nuances, emphasizing the distinctive characteristics of the Japanese language. This paper presents detailed statistics and characteristics of J-UniMorph, comparing it with the Wiktionary Edition. We release J-UniMorph and its interactive visualizer publicly available, aiming to support cross-linguistic research and various applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14411v1,2024-02
Is ChatGPT More Empathetic than Humans?,"Anuradha Welivita, Pearl Pu","This paper investigates the empathetic responding capabilities of ChatGPT, particularly its latest iteration, GPT-4, in comparison to human-generated responses to a wide range of emotional scenarios, both positive and negative. We employ a rigorous evaluation methodology, involving a between-groups study with 600 participants, to evaluate the level of empathy in responses generated by humans and ChatGPT. ChatGPT is prompted in two distinct ways: a standard approach and one explicitly detailing empathy's cognitive, affective, and compassionate counterparts. Our findings indicate that the average empathy rating of responses generated by ChatGPT exceeds those crafted by humans by approximately 10%. Additionally, instructing ChatGPT to incorporate a clear understanding of empathy in its responses makes the responses align approximately 5 times more closely with the expectations of individuals possessing a high degree of empathy, compared to human responses. The proposed evaluation framework serves as a scalable and adaptable framework to assess the empathetic capabilities of newer and updated versions of large language models, eliminating the need to replicate the current study's results in future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05572v1,2024-02
Tug-of-War Between Knowledge: Exploring and Resolving Knowledge Conflicts in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models,"Zhuoran Jin, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Xiaojian Jiang, Jiexin Xu, Qiuxia Li, Jun Zhao","Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have demonstrated significant potential in refining and expanding their internal memory by retrieving evidence from external sources. However, RALMs will inevitably encounter knowledge conflicts when integrating their internal memory with external sources. Knowledge conflicts can ensnare RALMs in a tug-of-war between knowledge, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we focus on exploring and resolving knowledge conflicts in RALMs. First, we present an evaluation framework for assessing knowledge conflicts across various dimensions. Then, we investigate the behavior and preference of RALMs from the following two perspectives: (1) Conflicts between internal memory and external sources: We find that stronger RALMs emerge with the Dunning-Kruger effect, persistently favoring their faulty internal memory even when correct evidence is provided. Besides, RALMs exhibit an availability bias towards common knowledge; (2) Conflicts between truthful, irrelevant and misleading evidence: We reveal that RALMs follow the principle of majority rule, leaning towards placing trust in evidence that appears more frequently. Moreover, we find that RALMs exhibit confirmation bias, and are more willing to choose evidence that is consistent with their internal memory. To solve the challenge of knowledge conflicts, we propose a method called Conflict-Disentangle Contrastive Decoding (CD2) to better calibrate the model's confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that our CD2 can effectively resolve knowledge conflicts in RALMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14409v1,2024-02
Transferring BERT Capabilities from High-Resource to Low-Resource Languages Using Vocabulary Matching,Piotr Rybak,"Pre-trained language models have revolutionized the natural language understanding landscape, most notably BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). However, a significant challenge remains for low-resource languages, where limited data hinders the effective training of such models. This work presents a novel approach to bridge this gap by transferring BERT capabilities from high-resource to low-resource languages using vocabulary matching. We conduct experiments on the Silesian and Kashubian languages and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to improve the performance of BERT models even when the target language has minimal training data. Our results highlight the potential of the proposed technique to effectively train BERT models for low-resource languages, thus democratizing access to advanced language understanding models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14408v1,2024-02
On the Tip of the Tongue: Analyzing Conceptual Representation in Large Language Models with Reverse-Dictionary Probe,"Ningyu Xu, Qi Zhang, Menghan Zhang, Peng Qian, Xuanjing Huang","Probing and enhancing large language models' reasoning capacity remains a crucial open question. Here we re-purpose the reverse dictionary task as a case study to probe LLMs' capacity for conceptual inference. We use in-context learning to guide the models to generate the term for an object concept implied in a linguistic description. Models robustly achieve high accuracy in this task, and their representation space encodes information about object categories and fine-grained features. Further experiments suggest that the conceptual inference ability as probed by the reverse-dictionary task predicts model's general reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks, despite similar syntactic generalization behaviors across models. Explorative analyses suggest that prompting LLMs with description$\Rightarrow$word examples may induce generalization beyond surface-level differences in task construals and facilitate models on broader commonsense reasoning problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14404v2,2024-02
Efficient data selection employing Semantic Similarity-based Graph Structures for model training,"Roxana Petcu, Subhadeep Maji","Recent developments in natural language processing (NLP) have highlighted the need for substantial amounts of data for models to capture textual information accurately. This raises concerns regarding the computational resources and time required for training such models. This paper introduces Semantics for data SAliency in Model performance Estimation (SeSaME). It is an efficient data sampling mechanism solely based on textual information without passing the data through a compute-heavy model or other intensive pre-processing transformations. The application of this approach is demonstrated in the use case of low-resource automated speech recognition (ASR) models, which excessively rely on text-to-speech (TTS) calls when using augmented data. SeSaME learns to categorize new incoming data points into speech recognition difficulty buckets by employing semantic similarity-based graph structures and discrete ASR information from homophilous neighbourhoods through message passing. The results indicate reliable projections of ASR performance, with a 93% accuracy increase when using the proposed method compared to random predictions, bringing non-trivial information on the impact of textual representations in speech models. Furthermore, a series of experiments show both the benefits and challenges of using the ASR information on incoming data to fine-tune the model. We report a 7% drop in validation loss compared to random sampling, 7% WER drop with non-local aggregation when evaluating against a highly difficult dataset, and 1.8% WER drop with local aggregation and high semantic similarity between datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14888v1,2024-02
Chain-of-History Reasoning for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting,"Yuwei Xia, Ding Wang, Qiang Liu, Liang Wang, Shu Wu, Xiaoyu Zhang","Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) forecasting aims to predict future facts based on given histories. Most recent graph-based models excel at capturing structural information within TKGs but lack semantic comprehension abilities. Nowadays, with the surge of LLMs, the LLM-based TKG prediction model has emerged. However, the existing LLM-based model exhibits three shortcomings: (1) It only focuses on the first-order history for prediction while ignoring high-order historical information, resulting in the provided information for LLMs being extremely limited. (2) LLMs struggle with optimal reasoning performance under heavy historical information loads. (3) For TKG prediction, the temporal reasoning capability of LLM alone is limited. To address the first two challenges, we propose Chain-of-History (CoH) reasoning which explores high-order histories step-by-step, achieving effective utilization of high-order historical information for LLMs on TKG prediction. To address the third issue, we design CoH as a plug-and-play module to enhance the performance of graph-based models for TKG prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets and backbones demonstrate the effectiveness of CoH.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14382v2,2024-02

Small Language Models as Effective Guides for Large Language Models in Chinese Relation Extraction,"Xuemei Tang, Jun Wang","Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been successful in relational extraction (RE) tasks, especially in the few-shot learning. An important problem in the field of RE is long-tailed data, while not much attention is paid to this problem using LLM approaches. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SLCoLM, a model collaboration framework, to mitigate the data long-tail problem. In our framework, we use the ``\textit{Training-Guide-Predict}'' strategy to combine the strengths of small pre-trained language models (SLMs) and LLMs, where a task-specific SLM framework acts as a guider, transfers task knowledge to the LLM and guides the LLM in performing RE tasks. Our experiments on an ancient Chinese RE dataset rich in relation types show that the approach facilitates RE of long-tail relation types.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14373v2,2024-02
Rethinking Scientific Summarization Evaluation: Grounding Explainable Metrics on Facet-aware Benchmark,"Xiuying Chen, Tairan Wang, Qingqing Zhu, Taicheng Guo, Shen Gao, Zhiyong Lu, Xin Gao, Xiangliang Zhang","The summarization capabilities of pretrained and large language models (LLMs) have been widely validated in general areas, but their use in scientific corpus, which involves complex sentences and specialized knowledge, has been less assessed. This paper presents conceptual and experimental analyses of scientific summarization, highlighting the inadequacies of traditional evaluation methods, such as $n$-gram, embedding comparison, and QA, particularly in providing explanations, grasping scientific concepts, or identifying key content. Subsequently, we introduce the Facet-aware Metric (FM), employing LLMs for advanced semantic matching to evaluate summaries based on different aspects. This facet-aware approach offers a thorough evaluation of abstracts by decomposing the evaluation task into simpler subtasks.Recognizing the absence of an evaluation benchmark in this domain, we curate a Facet-based scientific summarization Dataset (FD) with facet-level annotations. Our findings confirm that FM offers a more logical approach to evaluating scientific summaries. In addition, fine-tuned smaller models can compete with LLMs in scientific contexts, while LLMs have limitations in learning from in-context information in scientific domains. This suggests an area for future enhancement of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14359v1,2024-02
"Rule or Story, Which is a Better Commonsense Expression for Talking with Large Language Models?","Ning Bian, Xianpei Han, Hongyu Lin, Yaojie Lu, Ben He, Le Sun","Building machines with commonsense has been a longstanding challenge in NLP due to the reporting bias of commonsense rules and the exposure bias of rule-based commonsense reasoning. In contrast, humans convey and pass down commonsense implicitly through stories. This paper investigates the inherent commonsense ability of large language models (LLMs) expressed through storytelling. We systematically investigate and compare stories and rules for retrieving and leveraging commonsense in LLMs. Experimental results on 28 commonsense QA datasets show that stories outperform rules as the expression for retrieving commonsense from LLMs, exhibiting higher generation confidence and commonsense accuracy. Moreover, stories are the more effective commonsense expression for answering questions regarding daily events, while rules are more effective for scientific questions. This aligns with the reporting bias of commonsense in text corpora. We further show that the correctness and relevance of commonsense stories can be further improved via iterative self-supervised fine-tuning. These findings emphasize the importance of using appropriate language to express, retrieve, and leverage commonsense for LLMs, highlighting a promising direction for better exploiting their commonsense abilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14355v2,2024-02
How Ambiguous are the Rationales for Natural Language Reasoning? A Simple Approach to Handling Rationale Uncertainty,Hazel Kim,"Rationales behind answers not only explain model decisions but boost language models to reason well on complex reasoning tasks. However, obtaining impeccable rationales is often impossible. Besides, it is non-trivial to estimate the degree to which the rationales are faithful enough to encourage model performance. Thus, such reasoning tasks often compel models to output correct answers under undesirable rationales and are sub-optimal compared to what the models are fully capable of. In this work, we propose how to deal with imperfect rationales causing aleatoric uncertainty. We first define the ambiguous rationales with entropy scores of given rationales, using model prior beliefs as informativeness. We then guide models to select one of two different reasoning models according to the ambiguity of rationales. We empirically argue that our proposed method produces robust performance superiority against the adversarial quality of rationales and low-resource settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14337v2,2024-02
INSTRUCTIR: A Benchmark for Instruction Following of Information Retrieval Models,"Hanseok Oh, Hyunji Lee, Seonghyeon Ye, Haebin Shin, Hansol Jang, Changwook Jun, Minjoon Seo","Despite the critical need to align search targets with users' intention, retrievers often only prioritize query information without delving into the users' intended search context. Enhancing the capability of retrievers to understand intentions and preferences of users, akin to language model instructions, has the potential to yield more aligned search targets. Prior studies restrict the application of instructions in information retrieval to a task description format, neglecting the broader context of diverse and evolving search scenarios. Furthermore, the prevailing benchmarks utilized for evaluation lack explicit tailoring to assess instruction-following ability, thereby hindering progress in this field. In response to these limitations, we propose a novel benchmark,INSTRUCTIR, specifically designed to evaluate instruction-following ability in information retrieval tasks. Our approach focuses on user-aligned instructions tailored to each query instance, reflecting the diverse characteristics inherent in real-world search scenarios. Through experimental analysis, we observe that retrievers fine-tuned to follow task-style instructions, such as INSTRUCTOR, can underperform compared to their non-instruction-tuned counterparts. This underscores potential overfitting issues inherent in constructing retrievers trained on existing instruction-aware retrieval datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14334v1,2024-02
Understanding and Patching Compositional Reasoning in LLMs,"Zhaoyi Li, Gangwei Jiang, Hong Xie, Linqi Song, Defu Lian, Ying Wei","LLMs have marked a revolutonary shift, yet they falter when faced with compositional reasoning tasks. Our research embarks on a quest to uncover the root causes of compositional reasoning failures of LLMs, uncovering that most of them stem from the improperly generated or leveraged implicit reasoning results. Inspired by our empirical findings, we resort to Logit Lens and an intervention experiment to dissect the inner hidden states of LLMs. This deep dive reveals that implicit reasoning results indeed surface within middle layers and play a causative role in shaping the final explicit reasoning results. Our exploration further locates multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules within these layers, which emerge as the linchpins in accurate generation and leveraing of implicit reasoning results. Grounded on the above findings, we develop CREME, a lightweight method to patch errors in compositional reasoning via editing the located MHSA modules. Our empirical evidence stands testament to CREME's effectiveness, paving the way for autonomously and continuously enhancing compositional reasoning capabilities in language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14328v2,2024-02
Subobject-level Image Tokenization,"Delong Chen, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Jianfeng Liu, Baoyuan Wang, Pascale Fung","Transformer-based vision models typically tokenize images into fixed-size square patches as input units, which lacks the adaptability to image content and overlooks the inherent pixel grouping structure. Inspired by the subword tokenization widely adopted in language models, we propose an image tokenizer at a subobject level, where the subobjects are represented by semantically meaningful image segments obtained by segmentation models (e.g., segment anything models). To implement a learning system based on subobject tokenization, we first introduced a Direct Segment Anything Model (DirectSAM) that efficiently produces comprehensive segmentation of subobjects, then embed subobjects into compact latent vectors and fed them into a large language model for vision language learning. Empirical results demonstrated that our subobject-level tokenization significantly facilitates efficient learning of translating images into object and attribute descriptions compared to the traditional patch-level tokenization.

Triad: A Framework Leveraging a Multi-Role LLM-based Agent to Solve Knowledge Base Question Answering,"Chang Zong, Yuchen Yan, Weiming Lu, Jian Shao, Eliot Huang, Heng Chang, Yueting Zhuang","Recent progress with LLM-based agents has shown promising results across various tasks. However, their use in answering questions from knowledge bases remains largely unexplored. Implementing a KBQA system using traditional methods is challenging due to the shortage of task-specific training data and the complexity of creating task-focused model structures. In this paper, we present Triad, a unified framework that utilizes an LLM-based agent with three roles for KBQA tasks. The agent is assigned three roles to tackle different KBQA subtasks: agent as a generalist for mastering various subtasks, as a decision maker for the selection of candidates, and as an advisor for answering questions with knowledge. Our KBQA framework is executed in four phases, involving the collaboration of the agent's multiple roles. We evaluated the performance of our framework using three benchmark datasets, and the results show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art systems on the LC-QuAD and YAGO-QA benchmarks, yielding F1 scores of 11.8% and 20.7%, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14320v6,2024-02
Assessing generalization capability of text ranking models in Polish,"Sławomir Dadas, Małgorzata Grębowiec","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is becoming an increasingly popular technique for integrating internal knowledge bases with large language models. In a typical RAG pipeline, three models are used, responsible for the retrieval, reranking, and generation stages. In this article, we focus on the reranking problem for the Polish language, examining the performance of rerankers and comparing their results with available retrieval models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing models and those trained by us, utilizing a benchmark of 41 diverse information retrieval tasks for the Polish language. The results of our experiments show that most models struggle with out-of-domain generalization. However, a combination of effective optimization method and a large training dataset allows for building rerankers that are both compact in size and capable of generalization. The best of our models establishes a new state-of-the-art for reranking in the Polish language, outperforming existing models with up to 30 times more parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14318v1,2024-02
Hint-before-Solving Prompting: Guiding LLMs to Effectively Utilize Encoded Knowledge,"Jinlan Fu, Shenzhen Huangfu, Hang Yan, See-Kiong Ng, Xipeng Qiu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable generalizability in various domains. Despite their extensive knowledge, LLMs still face challenges in efficiently utilizing encoded knowledge to develop accurate and logical reasoning processes. To mitigate this problem, we introduced Hint-before-Solving Prompting (HSP), which guides the model to generate hints (e.g., specific knowledge or key ideas) for solving the problem and then generate solutions containing intermediate reasoning steps. Since HSP is orthogonal to prompting methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought (CoT)), we applied HSP to CoT, Least-to-Most, Plan-and-Solve, and Standard promptings. The results of extensive experiments on 6 reasoning benchmarks and 4 open-source LLMs demonstrate that HSP can effectively improve the accuracy of reasoning tasks: (1) By applying high-quality hint-enhanced HSP to CoT prompting, Llama2-70B-Chat shows an improvement of 9.7. (2) Beyond exploring training-free LLM capabilities, we built the HSPMATH dataset based on HSP and fine-tuned Llemma-7B, reaching 64.3 accuracy, surpassing GPT-3.5 and WizardMath-13B. We make our code and dataset publicly available at \url{https://github.com/jinlanfu/HSP}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14310v1,2024-02
Unleashing the Power of Imbalanced Modality Information for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion,"Yichi Zhang, Zhuo Chen, Lei Liang, Huajun Chen, Wen Zhang","Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to predict the missing triples in the multi-modal knowledge graphs by incorporating structural, visual, and textual information of entities into the discriminant models. The information from different modalities will work together to measure the triple plausibility. Existing MMKGC methods overlook the imbalance problem of modality information among entities, resulting in inadequate modal fusion and inefficient utilization of the raw modality information. To address the mentioned problems, we propose Adaptive Multi-modal Fusion and Modality Adversarial Training (AdaMF-MAT) to unleash the power of imbalanced modality information for MMKGC. AdaMF-MAT achieves multi-modal fusion with adaptive modality weights and further generates adversarial samples by modality-adversarial training to enhance the imbalanced modality information. Our approach is a co-design of the MMKGC model and training strategy which can outperform 19 recent MMKGC methods and achieve new state-of-the-art results on three public MMKGC benchmarks. Our code and data have been released at https://github.com/zjukg/AdaMF-MAT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15444v1,2024-02
Multi-modal Stance Detection: New Datasets and Model,"Bin Liang, Ang Li, Jingqian Zhao, Lin Gui, Min Yang, Yue Yu, Kam-Fai Wong, Ruifeng Xu","Stance detection is a challenging task that aims to identify public opinion from social media platforms with respect to specific targets. Previous work on stance detection largely focused on pure texts. In this paper, we study multi-modal stance detection for tweets consisting of texts and images, which are prevalent in today's fast-growing social media platforms where people often post multi-modal messages. To this end, we create five new multi-modal stance detection datasets of different domains based on Twitter, in which each example consists of a text and an image. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective Targeted Multi-modal Prompt Tuning framework (TMPT), where target information is leveraged to learn multi-modal stance features from textual and visual modalities. Experimental results on our five benchmark datasets show that the proposed TMPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal stance detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14298v3,2024-02
Mitigating Biases of Large Language Models in Stance Detection with Counterfactual Augmented Calibration,"Ang Li, Jingqian Zhao, Bin Liang, Lin Gui, Hui Wang, Xi Zeng, Xingwei Liang, Kam-Fai Wong, Ruifeng Xu","Stance detection is critical for understanding the underlying position or attitude expressed toward a topic. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements across various natural language processing tasks including stance detection, however, their performance in stance detection is limited by biases and spurious correlations inherent due to their data-driven nature. Our statistical experiment reveals that LLMs are prone to generate biased stances due to sentiment-stance spurious correlations and preference towards certain individuals and topics. Furthermore, the results demonstrate a strong negative correlation between stance bias and stance detection performance, underscoring the importance of mitigating bias to enhance the utility of LLMs in stance detection. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Counterfactual Augmented Calibration Network (FACTUAL), which a novel calibration network is devised to calibrate potential bias in the stance prediction of LLMs. Further, to address the challenge of effectively learning bias representations and the difficulty in the generalizability of debiasing, we construct counterfactual augmented data. This approach enhances the calibration network, facilitating the debiasing and out-of-domain generalization. Experimental results on in-target and zero-shot stance detection tasks show that the proposed FACTUAL can effectively mitigate biases of LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14296v3,2024-02
Leveraging Large Language Models for Concept Graph Recovery and Question Answering in NLP Education,"Rui Yang, Boming Yang, Sixun Ouyang, Tianwei She, Aosong Feng, Yuang Jiang, Freddy Lecue, Jinghui Lu, Irene Li","In the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in text-generation tasks. However, their educational applications, particularly for domain-specific queries, remain underexplored. This study investigates LLMs' capabilities in educational scenarios, focusing on concept graph recovery and question-answering (QA). We assess LLMs' zero-shot performance in creating domain-specific concept graphs and introduce TutorQA, a new expert-verified NLP-focused benchmark for scientific graph reasoning and QA. TutorQA consists of five tasks with 500 QA pairs. To tackle TutorQA queries, we present CGLLM, a pipeline integrating concept graphs with LLMs for answering diverse questions. Our results indicate that LLMs' zero-shot concept graph recovery is competitive with supervised methods, showing an average 3% F1 score improvement. In TutorQA tasks, LLMs achieve up to 26% F1 score enhancement. Moreover, human evaluation and analysis show that CGLLM generates answers with more fine-grained concepts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14293v1,2024-02
CEV-LM: Controlled Edit Vector Language Model for Shaping Natural Language Generations,"Samraj Moorjani, Adit Krishnan, Hari Sundaram","As large-scale language models become the standard for text generation, there is a greater need to tailor the generations to be more or less concise, targeted, and informative, depending on the audience/application. Existing control approaches primarily adjust the semantic (e.g., emotion, topics), structural (e.g., syntax tree, parts-of-speech), and lexical (e.g., keyword/phrase inclusion) properties of text, but are insufficient to accomplish complex objectives such as pacing which control the complexity and readability of the text. In this paper, we introduce CEV-LM - a lightweight, semi-autoregressive language model that utilizes constrained edit vectors to control three complementary metrics (speed, volume, and circuitousness) that quantify the shape of text (e.g., pacing of content). We study an extensive set of state-of-the-art CTG models and find that CEV-LM provides significantly more targeted and precise control of these three metrics while preserving semantic content, using less training data, and containing fewer parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14290v1,2024-02
TinyLLaVA: A Framework of Small-scale Large Multimodal Models,"Baichuan Zhou, Ying Hu, Xi Weng, Junlong Jia, Jie Luo, Xien Liu, Ji Wu, Lei Huang","We present the TinyLLaVA framework that provides a unified perspective in designing and analyzing the small-scale Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We empirically study the effects of different vision encoders, connection modules, language models, training data and training recipes. Our extensive experiments showed that better quality of data combined with better training recipes, smaller LMMs can consistently achieve on-par performances compared to bigger LMMs. Under our framework, we train a family of small-scale LMMs. Our best model, TinyLLaVA-3.1B, achieves better overall performance against existing 7B models such as LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-VL. We hope our findings can serve as baselines for future research in terms of data scaling, training setups and model selections.

Mitigating the Linguistic Gap with Phonemic Representations for Robust Cross-lingual Transfer,"Haeji Jung, Changdae Oh, Jooeon Kang, Jimin Sohn, Kyungwoo Song, Jinkyu Kim, David R. Mortensen","Approaches to improving multilingual language understanding often struggle with significant performance gaps between high-resource and low-resource languages. While there are efforts to align the languages in a single latent space to mitigate such gaps, how different input-level representations influence such gaps has not been investigated, particularly with phonemic inputs. We hypothesize that the performance gaps are affected by representation discrepancies between these languages, and revisit the use of phonemic representations as a means to mitigate these discrepancies. To demonstrate the effectiveness of phonemic representations, we present experiments on three representative cross-lingual tasks on 12 languages in total. The results show that phonemic representations exhibit higher similarities between languages compared to orthographic representations, and it consistently outperforms grapheme-based baseline model on languages that are relatively low-resourced. We present quantitative evidence from three cross-lingual tasks that demonstrate the effectiveness of phonemic representations, and it is further justified by a theoretical analysis of the cross-lingual performance gap.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14279v3,2024-02
GATE X-E : A Challenge Set for Gender-Fair Translations from Weakly-Gendered Languages,"Spencer Rarrick, Ranjita Naik, Sundar Poudel, Vishal Chowdhary","Neural Machine Translation (NMT) continues to improve in quality and adoption, yet the inadvertent perpetuation of gender bias remains a significant concern. Despite numerous studies on gender bias in translations into English from weakly gendered-languages, there are no benchmarks for evaluating this phenomenon or for assessing mitigation strategies. To address this gap, we introduce GATE X-E, an extension to the GATE (Rarrick et al., 2023) corpus, that consists of human translations from Turkish, Hungarian, Finnish, and Persian into English. Each translation is accompanied by feminine, masculine, and neutral variants. The dataset, which contains between 1250 and 1850 instances for each of the four language pairs, features natural sentences with a wide range of sentence lengths and domains, challenging translation rewriters on various linguistic phenomena. Additionally, we present a translation gender rewriting solution built with GPT-4 and use GATE X-E to evaluate it. We open source our contributions to encourage further research on gender debiasing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14277v1,2024-02
Can Language Models Act as Knowledge Bases at Scale?,"Qiyuan He, Yizhong Wang, Wenya Wang","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating responses to complex queries through large-scale pre-training. However, the efficacy of these models in memorizing and reasoning among large-scale structured knowledge, especially world knowledge that explicitly covers abundant factual information remains questionable. Addressing this gap, our research investigates whether LLMs can effectively store, recall, and reason with knowledge on a large scale comparable to latest knowledge bases (KBs) such as Wikidata. Specifically, we focus on three crucial aspects to study the viability: (1) the efficiency of LLMs with different sizes in memorizing the exact knowledge in the large-scale KB; (2) the flexibility of recalling the memorized knowledge in response to natural language queries; (3) the capability to infer new knowledge through reasoning. Our findings indicate that while LLMs hold promise as large-scale KBs capable of retrieving and responding with flexibility, enhancements in their reasoning capabilities are necessary to fully realize their potential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14273v1,2024-02
Qsnail: A Questionnaire Dataset for Sequential Question Generation,"Yan Lei, Liang Pang, Yuanzhuo Wang, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng","The questionnaire is a professional research methodology used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of human opinions, preferences, attitudes, and behaviors. However, designing and evaluating questionnaires demands significant effort due to their intricate and complex structure. Questionnaires entail a series of questions that must conform to intricate constraints involving the questions, options, and overall structure. Specifically, the questions should be relevant and specific to the given research topic and intent. The options should be tailored to the questions, ensuring they are mutually exclusive, completed, and ordered sensibly. Moreover, the sequence of questions should follow a logical order, grouping similar topics together. As a result, automatically generating questionnaires presents a significant challenge and this area has received limited attention primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To address these issues, we present Qsnail, the first dataset specifically constructed for the questionnaire generation task, which comprises 13,168 human-written questionnaires gathered from online platforms. We further conduct experiments on Qsnail, and the results reveal that retrieval models and traditional generative models do not fully align with the given research topic and intents. Large language models, while more closely related to the research topic and intents, exhibit significant limitations in terms of diversity and specificity. Despite enhancements through the chain-of-thought prompt and finetuning, questionnaires generated by language models still fall short of human-written questionnaires. Therefore, questionnaire generation is challenging and needs to be further explored. The dataset is available at: https://github.com/LeiyanGithub/qsnail.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14272v1,2024-02
Can Large Language Models Detect Misinformation in Scientific News Reporting?,"Yupeng Cao, Aishwarya Muralidharan Nair, Elyon Eyimife, Nastaran Jamalipour Soofi, K. P. Subbalakshmi, John R. Wullert II, Chumki Basu, David Shallcross","Scientific facts are often spun in the popular press with the intent to influence public opinion and action, as was evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Automatic detection of misinformation in the scientific domain is challenging because of the distinct styles of writing in these two media types and is still in its nascence. Most research on the validity of scientific reporting treats this problem as a claim verification challenge. In doing so, significant expert human effort is required to generate appropriate claims. Our solution bypasses this step and addresses a more real-world scenario where such explicit, labeled claims may not be available. The central research question of this paper is whether it is possible to use large language models (LLMs) to detect misinformation in scientific reporting. To this end, we first present a new labeled dataset SciNews, containing 2.4k scientific news stories drawn from trusted and untrustworthy sources, paired with related abstracts from the CORD-19 database. Our dataset includes both human-written and LLM-generated news articles, making it more comprehensive in terms of capturing the growing trend of using LLMs to generate popular press articles. Then, we identify dimensions of scientific validity in science news articles and explore how this can be integrated into the automated detection of scientific misinformation. We propose several baseline architectures using LLMs to automatically detect false representations of scientific findings in the popular press. For each of these architectures, we use several prompt engineering strategies including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting. We also test these architectures and prompting strategies on GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14268v1,2024-02
Word-Sequence Entropy: Towards Uncertainty Estimation in Free-Form Medical Question Answering Applications and Beyond,"Zhiyuan Wang, Jinhao Duan, Chenxi Yuan, Qingyu Chen, Tianlong Chen, Yue Zhang, Ren Wang, Xiaoshuang Shi, Kaidi Xu","Uncertainty estimation is crucial for the reliability of safety-critical human and artificial intelligence (AI) interaction systems, particularly in the domain of healthcare engineering. However, a robust and general uncertainty measure for free-form answers has not been well-established in open-ended medical question-answering (QA) tasks, where generative inequality introduces a large number of irrelevant words and sequences within the generated set for uncertainty quantification (UQ), which can lead to biases. This paper introduces Word-Sequence Entropy (WSE), a method that calibrates uncertainty at both the word and sequence levels, considering semantic relevance. WSE quantifies uncertainty in a way that is more closely aligned with the reliability of LLMs during uncertainty quantification (UQ). We compare WSE with six baseline methods on five free-form medical QA datasets, utilizing seven popular large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that WSE exhibits superior performance in UQ under two standard criteria for correctness evaluation. Additionally, in terms of real-world medical QA applications, the performance of LLMs is significantly enhanced (e.g., a 6.36% improvement in model accuracy on the COVID-QA dataset) by employing responses with lower uncertainty that are identified by WSE as final answers, without any additional task-specific fine-tuning or architectural modifications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14259v2,2024-02
Eagle: Ethical Dataset Given from Real Interactions,"Masahiro Kaneko, Danushka Bollegala, Timothy Baldwin","Recent studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) have ethical-related problems such as social biases, lack of moral reasoning, and generation of offensive content. The existing evaluation metrics and methods to address these ethical challenges use datasets intentionally created by instructing humans to create instances including ethical problems. Therefore, the data does not reflect prompts that users actually provide when utilizing LLM services in everyday contexts. This may not lead to the development of safe LLMs that can address ethical challenges arising in real-world applications. In this paper, we create Eagle datasets extracted from real interactions between ChatGPT and users that exhibit social biases, toxicity, and immoral problems. Our experiments show that Eagle captures complementary aspects, not covered by existing datasets proposed for evaluation and mitigation of such ethical challenges.

Framing in the Presence of Supporting Data: A Case Study in U.S. Economic News,"Alexandria Leto, Elliot Pickens, Coen D. Needell, David Rothschild, Maria Leonor Pacheco","The mainstream media has much leeway in what it chooses to cover and how it covers it. These choices have real-world consequences on what people know and their subsequent behaviors. However, the lack of objective measures to evaluate editorial choices makes research in this area particularly difficult. In this paper, we argue that there are newsworthy topics where objective measures exist in the form of supporting data and propose a computational framework to analyze editorial choices in this setup. We focus on the economy because the reporting of economic indicators presents us with a relatively easy way to determine both the selection and framing of various publications. Their values provide a ground truth of how the economy is doing relative to how the publications choose to cover it. To do this, we define frame prediction as a set of interdependent tasks. At the article level, we learn to identify the reported stance towards the general state of the economy. Then, for every numerical quantity reported in the article, we learn to identify whether it corresponds to an economic indicator and whether it is being reported in a positive or negative way. To perform our analysis, we track six American publishers and each article that appeared in the top 10 slots of their landing page between 2015 and 2023.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14224v3,2024-02
LLM-Assisted Content Conditional Debiasing for Fair Text Embedding,"Wenlong Deng, Blair Chen, Beidi Zhao, Chiyu Zhang, Xiaoxiao Li, Christos Thrampoulidis","Mitigating biases in machine learning models has become an increasing concern in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in developing fair text embeddings, which are crucial yet challenging for real-world applications like search engines. In response, this paper proposes a novel method for learning fair text embeddings. First, we define a novel content-conditional equal distance (CCED) fairness for text embeddings, ensuring content-conditional independence between sensitive attributes and text embeddings. Building on CCED, we introduce a content-conditional debiasing (CCD) loss to ensure that embeddings of texts with different sensitive attributes but identical content maintain the same distance from the embedding of their corresponding neutral text. Additionally, we tackle the issue of insufficient training data by using Large Language Models (LLMs) with instructions to fairly augment texts into different sensitive groups. Our extensive evaluations show that our approach effectively enhances fairness while maintaining the utility of embeddings. Furthermore, our augmented dataset, combined with the CCED metric, serves as an new benchmark for evaluating fairness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14208v3,2024-02
Assisting in Writing Wikipedia-like Articles From Scratch with Large Language Models,"Yijia Shao, Yucheng Jiang, Theodore A. Kanell, Peter Xu, Omar Khattab, Monica S. Lam","We study how to apply large language models to write grounded and organized long-form articles from scratch, with comparable breadth and depth to Wikipedia pages. This underexplored problem poses new challenges at the pre-writing stage, including how to research the topic and prepare an outline prior to writing. We propose STORM, a writing system for the Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking. STORM models the pre-writing stage by (1) discovering diverse perspectives in researching the given topic, (2) simulating conversations where writers carrying different perspectives pose questions to a topic expert grounded on trusted Internet sources, (3) curating the collected information to create an outline.   For evaluation, we curate FreshWiki, a dataset of recent high-quality Wikipedia articles, and formulate outline assessments to evaluate the pre-writing stage. We further gather feedback from experienced Wikipedia editors. Compared to articles generated by an outline-driven retrieval-augmented baseline, more of STORM's articles are deemed to be organized (by a 25% absolute increase) and broad in coverage (by 10%). The expert feedback also helps identify new challenges for generating grounded long articles, such as source bias transfer and over-association of unrelated facts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14207v2,2024-02
Towards Understanding Counseling Conversations: Domain Knowledge and Large Language Models,"Younghun Lee, Dan Goldwasser, Laura Schwab Reese","Understanding the dynamics of counseling conversations is an important task, yet it is a challenging NLP problem regardless of the recent advance of Transformer-based pre-trained language models. This paper proposes a systematic approach to examine the efficacy of domain knowledge and large language models (LLMs) in better representing conversations between a crisis counselor and a help seeker. We empirically show that state-of-the-art language models such as Transformer-based models and GPT models fail to predict the conversation outcome. To provide richer context to conversations, we incorporate human-annotated domain knowledge and LLM-generated features; simple integration of domain knowledge and LLM features improves the model performance by approximately 15%. We argue that both domain knowledge and LLM-generated features can be exploited to better characterize counseling conversations when they are used as an additional context to conversations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14200v1,2024-02
Learning to Reduce: Optimal Representations of Structured Data in Prompting Large Language Models,"Younghun Lee, Sungchul Kim, Tong Yu, Ryan A. Rossi, Xiang Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used as general-purpose AI agents showing comparable performance on many downstream tasks. However, existing work shows that it is challenging for LLMs to integrate structured data (e.g. KG, tables, DBs) into their prompts; LLMs need to either understand long text data or select the most relevant evidence prior to inference, and both approaches are not trivial.   In this paper, we propose a framework, Learning to Reduce, that fine-tunes a language model to generate a reduced version of an input context, given a task description and context input. The model learns to reduce the input context using On-Policy Reinforcement Learning and aims to improve the reasoning performance of a fixed LLM. Experimental results illustrate that our model not only achieves comparable accuracies in selecting the relevant evidence from an input context, but also shows generalizability on different datasets. We further show that our model helps improve the LLM's performance on downstream tasks especially when the context is long.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14195v1,2024-02
From Adoption to Adaption: Tracing the Diffusion of New Emojis on Twitter,"Yuhang Zhou, Xuan Lu, Wei Ai","In the rapidly evolving landscape of social media, the introduction of new emojis in Unicode release versions presents a structured opportunity to explore digital language evolution. Analyzing a large dataset of sampled English tweets, we examine how newly released emojis gain traction and evolve in meaning. We find that community size of early adopters and emoji semantics are crucial in determining their popularity. Certain emojis experienced notable shifts in the meanings and sentiment associations during the diffusion process. Additionally, we propose a novel framework utilizing language models to extract words and pre-existing emojis with semantically similar contexts, which enhances interpretation of new emojis. The framework demonstrates its effectiveness in improving sentiment classification performance by substituting unknown new emojis with familiar ones. This study offers a new perspective in understanding how new language units are adopted, adapted, and integrated into the fabric of online communication.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14187v1,2024-02
Diversity-Aware Ensembling of Language Models Based on Topological Data Analysis,"Polina Proskura, Alexey Zaytsev","Ensembles are important tools for improving the performance of machine learning models. In cases related to natural language processing, ensembles boost the performance of a method due to multiple large models available in open source. However, existing approaches mostly rely on simple averaging of predictions by ensembles with equal weights for each model, ignoring differences in the quality and conformity of models. We propose to estimate weights for ensembles of NLP models using not only knowledge of their individual performance but also their similarity to each other. By adopting distance measures based on Topological Data Analysis (TDA), we improve our ensemble. The quality improves for both text classification accuracy and relevant uncertainty estimation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14184v1,2024-02
A Study on the Vulnerability of Test Questions against ChatGPT-based Cheating,"Shanker Ram, Chen Qian","ChatGPT is a chatbot that can answer text prompts fairly accurately, even performing very well on postgraduate-level questions. Many educators have found that their take-home or remote tests and exams are vulnerable to ChatGPT-based cheating because students may directly use answers provided by tools like ChatGPT. In this paper, we try to provide an answer to an important question: how well ChatGPT can answer test questions and how we can detect whether the questions of a test can be answered correctly by ChatGPT. We generated ChatGPT's responses to the MedMCQA dataset, which contains over 10,000 medical school entrance exam questions. We analyzed the responses and uncovered certain types of questions ChatGPT answers more inaccurately than others. In addition, we have created a basic natural language processing model to single out the most vulnerable questions to ChatGPT in a collection of questions or a sample exam. Our tool can be used by test-makers to avoid ChatGPT-vulnerable test questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14881v1,2024-02
Understanding the Dataset Practitioners Behind Large Language Model Development,"Crystal Qian, Emily Reif, Minsuk Kahng","As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced and impactful, it is increasingly important to scrutinize the data that they rely upon and produce. What is it to be a dataset practitioner doing this work? We approach this in two parts: first, we define the role of ""dataset practitioners"" by performing a retrospective analysis on the responsibilities of teams contributing to LLM development at a technology company, Google. Then, we conduct semi-structured interviews with a cross-section of these practitioners (N=10). We find that although data quality is a top priority, there is little consensus around what data quality is and how to evaluate it. Consequently, practitioners either rely on their own intuition or write custom code to evaluate their data. We discuss potential reasons for this phenomenon and opportunities for alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16611v2,2024-02
Bangla AI: A Framework for Machine Translation Utilizing Large Language Models for Ethnic Media,"MD Ashraful Goni, Fahad Mostafa, Kerk F.

Rather than utilizing the language of the host nation, ethnic media delivers news in the language of the immigrant community. For instance, in the USA, Bangla ethnic media presents news in Bangla rather than English. This research delves into the prospective integration of large language models (LLM) and multi-lingual machine translations (MMT) within the ethnic media industry. It centers on the transformative potential of using LLM in MMT in various facets of news translation, searching, and categorization. The paper outlines a theoretical framework elucidating the integration of LLM and MMT into the news searching and translation processes for ethnic media.

TOOLVERIFIER: Generalization to New Tools via Self-Verification,"Dheeraj Mekala, Jason Weston, Jack Lanchantin, Roberta Raileanu, Maria Lomeli, Jingbo Shang, Jane Dwivedi-Yu","Teaching language models to use tools is an important milestone towards building general assistants, but remains an open problem. While there has been significant progress on learning to use specific tools via fine-tuning, language models still struggle with learning how to robustly use new tools from only a few demonstrations. In this work we introduce a self-verification method which distinguishes between close candidates by self-asking contrastive questions during (1) tool selection; and (2) parameter generation. We construct synthetic, high-quality, self-generated data for this goal using Llama-2 70B, which we intend to release publicly. Extensive experiments on 4 tasks from the ToolBench benchmark, consisting of 17 unseen tools, demonstrate an average improvement of 22% over few-shot baselines, even in scenarios where the distinctions between candidate tools are finely nuanced.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14158v2,2024-02
Can Similarity-Based Domain-Ordering Reduce Catastrophic Forgetting for Intent Recognition?,"Amogh Mannekote, Xiaoyi Tian, Kristy Elizabeth Boyer, Bonnie J. Dorr","Task-oriented dialogue systems are expected to handle a constantly expanding set of intents and domains even after they have been deployed to support more and more functionalities. To live up to this expectation, it becomes critical to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem (CF) that occurs in continual learning (CL) settings for a task such as intent recognition. While existing dialogue systems research has explored replay-based and regularization-based methods to this end, the effect of domain ordering on the CL performance of intent recognition models remains unexplored. If understood well, domain ordering has the potential to be an orthogonal technique that can be leveraged alongside existing techniques such as experience replay. Our work fills this gap by comparing the impact of three domain-ordering strategies (min-sum path, max-sum path, random) on the CL performance of a generative intent recognition model. Our findings reveal that the min-sum path strategy outperforms the others in reducing catastrophic forgetting when training on the 220M T5-Base model. However, this advantage diminishes with the larger 770M T5-Large model. These results underscores the potential of domain ordering as a complementary strategy for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continually learning intent recognition models, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14155v1,2024-02
Automatic Histograms: Leveraging Language Models for Text Dataset Exploration,"Emily Reif, Crystal Qian, James Wexler, Minsuk Kahng","Making sense of unstructured text datasets is perennially difficult, yet increasingly relevant with Large Language Models. Data workers often rely on dataset summaries, especially distributions of various derived features. Some features, like toxicity or topics, are relevant to many datasets, but many interesting features are domain specific: instruments and genres for a music dataset, or diseases and symptoms for a medical dataset. Accordingly, data workers often run custom analyses for each dataset, which is cumbersome and difficult. We present AutoHistograms, a visualization tool leveragingLLMs. AutoHistograms automatically identifies relevant features, visualizes them with histograms, and allows the user to interactively query the dataset for categories of entities and create new histograms. In a user study with 10 data workers (n=10), we observe that participants can quickly identify insights and explore the data using AutoHistograms, and conceptualize a broad range of applicable use cases. Together, this tool and user study contributeto the growing field of LLM-assisted sensemaking tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14880v1,2024-02
MM-Soc: Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models in Social Media Platforms,"Yiqiao Jin, Minje Choi, Gaurav Verma, Jindong Wang, Srijan Kumar","Social media platforms are hubs for multimodal information exchange, encompassing text, images, and videos, making it challenging for machines to comprehend the information or emotions associated with interactions in online spaces. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges, yet they struggle to accurately interpret human emotions and complex content such as misinformation. This paper introduces MM-Soc, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of multimodal social media content. MM-Soc compiles prominent multimodal datasets and incorporates a novel large-scale YouTube tagging dataset, targeting a range of tasks from misinformation detection, hate speech detection, and social context generation. Through our exhaustive evaluation on ten size-variants of four open-source MLLMs, we have identified significant performance disparities, highlighting the need for advancements in models' social understanding capabilities. Our analysis reveals that, in a zero-shot setting, various types of MLLMs generally exhibit difficulties in handling social media tasks. However, MLLMs demonstrate performance improvements post fine-tuning, suggesting potential pathways for improvement. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/claws-lab/MMSoc.git.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14154v3,2024-02
BIRCO: A Benchmark of Information Retrieval Tasks with Complex Objectives,"Xiaoyue Wang, Jianyou Wang, Weili Cao, Kaicheng Wang, Ramamohan Paturi, Leon Bergen","We present the Benchmark of Information Retrieval (IR) tasks with Complex Objectives (BIRCO). BIRCO evaluates the ability of IR systems to retrieve documents given multi-faceted user objectives. The benchmark's complexity and compact size make it suitable for evaluating large language model (LLM)-based information retrieval systems. We present a modular framework for investigating factors that may influence LLM performance on retrieval tasks, and identify a simple baseline model which matches or outperforms existing approaches and more complex alternatives. No approach achieves satisfactory performance on all benchmark tasks, suggesting that stronger models and new retrieval protocols are necessary to address complex user needs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14151v2,2024-02
Dynamic Multi-Reward Weighting for Multi-Style Controllable Generation,"Karin de Langis, Ryan Koo, Dongyeop Kang","Textual style expresses a diverse set of information, including interpersonal dynamics (e.g., formality) and the author's emotions or attitudes (e.g., disgust). An open question is how language models can be explicitly controlled so that they weave together target styles when generating text: for example, to produce text that is both negative and non-toxic. One approach to such controlled generation is multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL), but how best to combine multiple objectives in a reward function is an open question. In this paper, we investigate various formulations of multi-style rewards, including calibrated outputs from discriminators and dynamic weighting by discriminator gradient magnitudes. We find that our proposed dynamic weighting outperforms static weighting approaches with respect to style control while maintaining linguistic quality, and we explore its effectiveness in 2- and 3-style control.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14146v3,2024-02
Driving Generative Agents With Their Personality,"Lawrence J. Klinkert, Stephanie Buongiorno, Corey Clark","This research explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to utilize psychometric values, specifically personality information, within the context of video game character development. Affective Computing (AC) systems quantify a Non-Player character's (NPC) psyche, and an LLM can take advantage of the system's information by using the values for prompt generation. The research shows an LLM can consistently represent a given personality profile, thereby enhancing the human-like characteristics of game characters. Repurposing a human examination, the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) questionnaire, to evaluate an LLM shows that the model can accurately generate content concerning the personality provided. Results show that the improvement of LLM, such as the latest GPT-4 model, can consistently utilize and interpret a personality to represent behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14879v1,2024-02
Combining Language and Graph Models for Semi-structured Information Extraction on the Web,"Zhi Hong, Kyle Chard, Ian Foster","Relation extraction is an efficient way of mining the extraordinary wealth of human knowledge on the Web. Existing methods rely on domain-specific training data or produce noisy outputs. We focus here on extracting targeted relations from semi-structured web pages given only a short description of the relation. We present GraphScholarBERT, an open-domain information extraction method based on a joint graph and language model structure. GraphScholarBERT can generalize to previously unseen domains without additional data or training and produces only clean extraction results matched to the search keyword. Experiments show that GraphScholarBERT can improve extraction F1 scores by as much as 34.8\% compared to previous work in a zero-shot domain and zero-shot website setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14129v1,2024-02
"FanOutQA: A Multi-Hop, Multi-Document Question Answering Benchmark for Large Language Models","Andrew Zhu, Alyssa Hwang, Liam Dugan, Chris Callison-Burch","One type of question that is commonly found in day-to-day scenarios is ``fan-out'' questions, complex multi-hop, multi-document reasoning questions that require finding information about a large number of entities. However, there exist few resources to evaluate this type of question-answering capability among large language models. To evaluate complex reasoning in LLMs more fully, we present FanOutQA, a high-quality dataset of fan-out question-answer pairs and human-annotated decompositions with English Wikipedia as the knowledge base. We formulate three benchmark settings across our dataset and benchmark 7 LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 2, Claude-2.1, and Mixtral-8x7B, finding that contemporary models still have room to improve reasoning over inter-document dependencies in a long context. We provide our dataset and open-source tools to run models to encourage evaluation at https://fanoutqa.com",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14116v2,2024-02
Cost-Efficient Subjective Task Annotation and Modeling through Few-Shot Annotator Adaptation,"Preni Golazizian, Alireza S. Ziabari, Ali Omrani, Morteza Dehghani","In subjective NLP tasks, where a single ground truth does not exist, the inclusion of diverse annotators becomes crucial as their unique perspectives significantly influence the annotations. In realistic scenarios, the annotation budget often becomes the main determinant of the number of perspectives (i.e., annotators) included in the data and subsequent modeling. We introduce a novel framework for annotation collection and modeling in subjective tasks that aims to minimize the annotation budget while maximizing the predictive performance for each annotator. Our framework has a two-stage design: first, we rely on a small set of annotators to build a multitask model, and second, we augment the model for a new perspective by strategically annotating a few samples per annotator. To test our framework at scale, we introduce and release a unique dataset, Moral Foundations Subjective Corpus, of 2000 Reddit posts annotated by 24 annotators for moral sentiment. We demonstrate that our framework surpasses the previous SOTA in capturing the annotators' individual perspectives with as little as 25% of the original annotation budget on two datasets. Furthermore, our framework results in more equitable models, reducing the performance disparity among annotators.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14101v2,2024-02
LexC-Gen: Generating Data for Extremely Low-Resource Languages with Large Language Models and Bilingual Lexicons,"Zheng-Xin Yong, Cristina Menghini, Stephen H. Bach","Data scarcity in low-resource languages can be addressed with word-to-word translations from labeled task data in high-resource languages using bilingual lexicons. However, bilingual lexicons often have limited lexical overlap with task data, which results in poor translation coverage and lexicon utilization. We propose lexicon-conditioned data generation LexC-Gen, a method that generates low-resource-language classification task data at scale. Specifically, LexC-Gen first uses high-resource-language words from bilingual lexicons to generate lexicon-compatible task data, and then it translates them into low-resource languages with bilingual lexicons via word translation. Across 17 extremely low-resource languages, LexC-Gen generated data is competitive with expert-translated gold data, and yields on average 5.6 and 8.9 points improvement over existing lexicon-based word translation methods on sentiment analysis and topic classification tasks respectively. Through ablation study, we show that conditioning on bilingual lexicons is the key component of LexC-Gen. LexC-Gen serves as a potential solution to close the performance gap between open-source multilingual models, such as BLOOMZ and Aya-101, and state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o on low-resource-language tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14086v3,2024-02
Improving Language Understanding from Screenshots,"Tianyu Gao, Zirui Wang, Adithya Bhaskar, Danqi Chen","An emerging family of language models (LMs), capable of processing both text and images within a single visual view, has the promise to unlock complex tasks such as chart understanding and UI navigation. We refer to these models as screenshot language models. Despite their appeal, existing screenshot LMs substantially lag behind text-only models on language understanding tasks. To close this gap, we adopt a simplified setting where the model inputs are plain-text-rendered screenshots, and we focus on improving the text ability of screenshot LMs. We propose a novel Patch-and-Text Prediction (PTP) objective, which masks and recovers both image patches of screenshots and text within screenshots. We also conduct extensive ablation studies on masking rates and patch sizes, as well as designs for improving training stability. Our pre-trained model, while solely taking visual inputs, achieves comparable performance with BERT on 6 out of 8 GLUE tasks (within 2%) and improves up to 8% over prior work. Additionally, we extend PTP to train autoregressive screenshot LMs and demonstrate its effectiveness--our models can significantly reduce perplexity by utilizing the screenshot context. Together, we hope our findings can inspire future research on developing powerful screenshot LMs and extending their reach to broader applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14073v1,2024-02
Coercing LLMs to do and reveal (almost) anything,"Jonas Geiping, Alex Stein, Manli Shu, Khalid Saifullah, Yuxin Wen, Tom Goldstein","It has recently been shown that adversarial attacks on large language models (LLMs) can ""jailbreak"" the model into making harmful statements. In this work, we argue that the spectrum of adversarial attacks on LLMs is much larger than merely jailbreaking. We provide a broad overview of possible attack surfaces and attack goals. Based on a series of concrete examples, we discuss, categorize and systematize attacks that coerce varied unintended behaviors, such as misdirection, model control, denial-of-service, or data extraction.   We analyze these attacks in controlled experiments, and find that many of them stem from the practice of pre-training LLMs with coding capabilities, as well as the continued existence of strange ""glitch"" tokens in common LLM vocabularies that should be removed for security reasons.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14020v1,2024-02
On Leveraging Encoder-only Pre-trained Language Models for Effective Keyphrase Generation,"Di Wu, Wasi Uddin Ahmad, Kai-Wei Chang","This study addresses the application of encoder-only Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in keyphrase generation (KPG) amidst the broader availability of domain-tailored encoder-only models compared to encoder-decoder models. We investigate three core inquiries: (1) the efficacy of encoder-only PLMs in KPG, (2) optimal architectural decisions for employing encoder-only PLMs in KPG, and (3) a performance comparison between in-domain encoder-only and encoder-decoder PLMs across varied resource settings. Our findings, derived from extensive experimentation in two domains reveal that with encoder-only PLMs, although KPE with Conditional Random Fields slightly excels in identifying present keyphrases, the KPG formulation renders a broader spectrum of keyphrase predictions. Additionally, prefix-LM fine-tuning of encoder-only PLMs emerges as a strong and data-efficient strategy for KPG, outperforming general-domain seq2seq PLMs. We also identify a favorable parameter allocation towards model depth rather than width when employing encoder-decoder architectures initialized with encoder-only PLMs. The study sheds light on the potential of utilizing encoder-only PLMs for advancing KPG systems and provides a groundwork for future KPG methods. Our code and pre-trained checkpoints are released at https://github.com/uclanlp/DeepKPG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14052v1,2024-02
Is LLM-as-a-Judge Robust? Investigating Universal Adversarial Attacks on Zero-shot LLM Assessment,"Vyas Raina, Adian Liusie, Mark Gales","Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful zero-shot assessors used in real-world situations such as assessing written exams and benchmarking systems. Despite these critical applications, no existing work has analyzed the vulnerability of judge-LLMs to adversarial manipulation. This work presents the first study on the adversarial robustness of assessment LLMs, where we demonstrate that short universal adversarial phrases can be concatenated to deceive judge LLMs to predict inflated scores. Since adversaries may not know or have access to the judge-LLMs, we propose a simple surrogate attack where a surrogate model is first attacked, and the learned attack phrase then transferred to unknown judge-LLMs. We propose a practical algorithm to determine the short universal attack phrases and demonstrate that when transferred to unseen models, scores can be drastically inflated such that irrespective of the assessed text, maximum scores are predicted. It is found that judge-LLMs are significantly more susceptible to these adversarial attacks when used for absolute scoring, as opposed to comparative assessment. Our findings raise concerns on the reliability of LLM-as-a-judge methods, and emphasize the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in LLM assessment methods before deployment in high-stakes real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14016v2,2024-02

With traditional benchmarks becoming less challenging for these models, new rigorous challenges are essential to gauge their advanced abilities. In this work, we present OlympiadBench, an Olympiad-level bilingual multimodal scientific benchmark, featuring 8,476 problems from Olympiad-level mathematics and physics competitions, including the Chinese college entrance exam. Each problem is detailed with expert-level annotations for step-by-step reasoning. Evaluating top-tier models on OlympiadBench, we implement a comprehensive assessment methodology to accurately evaluate model responses. Notably, the best-performing model, GPT-4V, attains an average score of 17.97% on OlympiadBench, with a mere 10.74% in physics, highlighting the benchmark rigor and the intricacy of physical reasoning. Our analysis orienting GPT-4V points out prevalent issues with hallucinations, knowledge omissions, and logical fallacies.

Can Watermarks Survive Translation? On the Cross-lingual Consistency of Text Watermark for Large Language Models,"Zhiwei He, Binglin Zhou, Hongkun Hao, Aiwei Liu, Xing Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang","Text watermarking technology aims to tag and identify content produced by large language models (LLMs) to prevent misuse. In this study, we introduce the concept of cross-lingual consistency in text watermarking, which assesses the ability of text watermarks to maintain their effectiveness after being translated into other languages. Preliminary empirical results from two LLMs and three watermarking methods reveal that current text watermarking technologies lack consistency when texts are translated into various languages. Based on this observation, we propose a Cross-lingual Watermark Removal Attack (CWRA) to bypass watermarking by first obtaining a response from an LLM in a pivot language, which is then translated into the target language. CWRA can effectively remove watermarks, decreasing the AUCs to a random-guessing level without performance loss. Furthermore, we analyze two key factors that contribute to the cross-lingual consistency in text watermarking and propose X-SIR as a defense method against CWRA.

Hallucinations or Attention Misdirection? The Path to Strategic Value Extraction in Business Using Large Language Models,Aline Ioste,"Large Language Models with transformer architecture have revolutionized the domain of text generation, setting unprecedented benchmarks. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been criticized for generating outcomes that deviate from factual accuracy or display logical inconsistencies, phenomena commonly referred to as hallucinations. This term, however, has often been misapplied to any results deviating from the instructor's expectations, which this paper defines as attention misdirection rather than true hallucinations. Understanding the distinction between hallucinations and attention misdirection becomes increasingly relevant in business contexts, where the ramifications of such errors can significantly impact the value extraction from these inherently pre-trained models. This paper highlights the best practices of the PGI, Persona, Grouping, and Intelligence, method, a strategic framework that achieved a remarkable error rate of only 3,15 percent across 4,000 responses generated by GPT in response to a real business challenge. It emphasizes that by equipping experimentation with knowledge, businesses can unlock opportunities for innovation through the use of these natively pre-trained models. This reinforces the notion that strategic application grounded in a skilled team can maximize the benefits of emergent technologies such as the LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14002v1,2024-02
What's in a Name? Auditing Large Language Models for Race and Gender Bias,"Amit Haim, Alejandro Salinas, Julian Nyarko","We employ an audit design to investigate biases in state-of-the-art large language models, including GPT-4. In our study, we prompt the models for advice involving a named individual across a variety of scenarios, such as during car purchase negotiations or election outcome predictions. We find that the advice systematically disadvantages names that are commonly associated with racial minorities and women. Names associated with Black women receive the least advantageous outcomes. The biases are consistent across 42 prompt templates and several models, indicating a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents. While providing numerical, decision-relevant anchors in the prompt can successfully counteract the biases, qualitative details have inconsistent effects and may even increase disparities. Our findings underscore the importance of conducting audits at the point of LLM deployment and implementation to mitigate their potential for harm against marginalized communities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14875v2,2024-02
Analysing The Impact of Sequence Composition on Language Model Pre-Training,"Yu Zhao, Yuanbin Qu, Konrad Staniszewski, Szymon Tworkowski, Wei Liu, Piotr Miłoś, Yuxiang Wu, Pasquale Minervini","Most language model pre-training frameworks concatenate multiple documents into fixed-length sequences and use causal masking to compute the likelihood of each token given its context; this strategy is widely adopted due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, to this day, the influence of the pre-training sequence composition strategy on the generalisation properties of the model remains under-explored. In this work, we find that applying causal masking can lead to the inclusion of distracting information from previous documents during pre-training, which negatively impacts the performance of the models on language modelling and downstream tasks. In intra-document causal masking, the likelihood of each token is only conditioned on the previous tokens in the same document, eliminating potential distracting information from previous documents and significantly improving performance. Furthermore, we find that concatenating related documents can reduce some potential distractions during pre-training, and our proposed efficient retrieval-based sequence construction method, BM25Chunk, can improve in-context learning (+11.6\%), knowledge memorisation (+9.8\%), and context utilisation (+7.2\%) abilities of language models without sacrificing efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13991v1,2024-02
Towards Building Multilingual Language Model for Medicine,"Pengcheng Qiu, Chaoyi Wu, Xiaoman Zhang, Weixiong Lin, Haicheng Wang, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Weidi Xie","The development of open-source, multilingual medical language models can benefit a wide, linguistically diverse audience from different regions. To promote this domain, we present contributions from the following: First, we construct a multilingual medical corpus, containing approximately 25.5B tokens encompassing 6 main languages, termed as MMedC, enabling auto-regressive domain adaptation for general LLMs; Second, to monitor the development of multilingual medical LLMs, we propose a multilingual medical multi-choice question-answering benchmark with rationale, termed as MMedBench; Third, we have assessed a number of open-source large language models (LLMs) on our benchmark, along with those further auto-regressive trained on MMedC. Our final model, MMed-Llama 3, with only 8B parameters, achieves superior performance compared to all other open-source models on both MMedBench and English benchmarks, even rivaling GPT-4.

Can You Learn Semantics Through Next-Word Prediction? The Case of Entailment,"William Merrill, Zhaofeng Wu, Norihito Naka, Yoon Kim, Tal Linzen","Do LMs infer the semantics of text from co-occurrence patterns in their training data? Merrill et al. (2022) argue that, in theory, sentence co-occurrence probabilities predicted by an optimal LM should reflect the entailment relationship of the constituent sentences, but it is unclear whether probabilities predicted by neural LMs encode entailment in this way because of strong assumptions made by Merrill et al. (namely, that humans always avoid redundancy). In this work, we investigate whether their theory can be used to decode entailment relations from neural LMs. We find that a test similar to theirs can decode entailment relations between natural sentences, well above random chance, though not perfectly, across many datasets and LMs. This suggests LMs implicitly model aspects of semantics to predict semantic effects on sentence co-occurrence patterns. However, we find the test that predicts entailment in practice works in the opposite direction to the theoretical test. We thus revisit the assumptions underlying the original test, finding its derivation did not adequately account for redundancy in human-written text. We argue that better accounting for redundancy related to explanations might derive the observed flipped test and, more generally, improve computational models of speakers in linguistics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13956v3,2024-02
Measuring Social Biases in Masked Language Models by Proxy of Prediction Quality,"Rahul Zalkikar, Kanchan Chandra","Innovative transformer-based language models produce contextually-aware token embeddings and have achieved state-of-the-art performance for a variety of natural language tasks, but have been shown to encode unwanted biases for downstream applications. In this paper, we evaluate the social biases encoded by transformers trained with the masked language modeling objective using proposed proxy functions within an iterative masking experiment to measure the quality of transformer models' predictions, and assess the preference of MLMs towards disadvantaged and advantaged groups. We compare bias estimations with those produced by other evaluation methods using benchmark datasets and assess their alignment with human annotated biases. We find relatively high religious and disability biases across considered MLMs and low gender bias in one dataset relative to another. We extend on previous work by evaluating social biases introduced after retraining an MLM under the masked language modeling objective, and find that proposed measures produce more accurate estimations of biases introduced by retraining MLMs than others based on relative preference for biased sentences between models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13954v2,2024-02
Making Reasoning Matter: Measuring and Improving Faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,"Debjit Paul, Robert West, Antoine Bosselut, Boi Faltings","Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when asked to reason step-by-step before answering a question. However, it is unclear to what degree the model's final answer is faithful to the stated reasoning steps. In this paper, we perform a causal mediation analysis on twelve LLMs to examine how intermediate reasoning steps generated by the LLM influence the final outcome and find that LLMs do not reliably use their intermediate reasoning steps when generating an answer. To address this issue, we introduce FRODO, a framework to tailor small-sized LMs to generate correct reasoning steps and robustly reason over these steps. FRODO consists of an inference module that learns to generate correct reasoning steps using an implicit causal reward function and a reasoning module that learns to faithfully reason over these intermediate inferences using a counterfactual and causal preference objective. Our experiments show that FRODO significantly outperforms four competitive baselines. Furthermore, FRODO improves the robustness and generalization ability of the reasoning LM, yielding higher performance on out-of-distribution test sets. Finally, we find that FRODO's rationales are more faithful to its final answer predictions than standard supervised fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13950v4,2024-02
Distillation Contrastive Decoding: Improving LLMs Reasoning with Contrastive Decoding and Distillation,"Phuc Phan, Hieu Tran, Long Phan","We propose a straightforward approach called Distillation Contrastive Decoding (DCD) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference. In contrast to previous approaches that relied on smaller amateur models or analysis of hidden state differences, DCD employs Contrastive Chain-of-thought Prompting and advanced distillation techniques, including Dropout and Quantization. This approach effectively addresses the limitations of Contrastive Decoding (CD), which typically requires both an expert and an amateur model, thus increasing computational resource demands. By integrating contrastive prompts with distillation, DCD obviates the need for an amateur model and reduces memory usage. Our evaluations demonstrate that DCD significantly enhances LLM performance across a range of reasoning benchmarks, surpassing both CD and existing methods in the GSM8K and StrategyQA datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14874v2,2024-02
Technical Report on the Pangram AI-Generated Text Classifier,"Bradley Emi, Max Spero","We present Pangram Text, a transformer-based neural network trained to distinguish text written by large language models from text written by humans. Pangram Text outperforms zero-shot methods such as DetectGPT as well as leading commercial AI detection tools with over 38 times lower error rates on a comprehensive benchmark comprised of 10 text domains (student writing, creative writing, scientific writing, books, encyclopedias, news, email, scientific papers, short-form Q&A) and 8 open- and closed-source large language models. We propose a training algorithm, hard negative mining with synthetic mirrors, that enables our classifier to achieve orders of magnitude lower false positive rates on high-data domains such as reviews.

Distinctive Image Captioning: Leveraging Ground Truth Captions in CLIP Guided Reinforcement Learning,"Antoine Chaffin, Ewa Kijak, Vincent Claveau","Training image captioning models using teacher forcing results in very generic samples, whereas more distinctive captions can be very useful in retrieval applications or to produce alternative texts describing images for accessibility. Reinforcement Learning (RL) allows to use cross-modal retrieval similarity score between the generated caption and the input image as reward to guide the training, leading to more distinctive captions. Recent studies show that pre-trained cross-modal retrieval models can be used to provide this reward, completely eliminating the need for reference captions. However, we argue in this paper that Ground Truth (GT) captions can still be useful in this RL framework. We propose a new image captioning model training strategy that makes use of GT captions in different ways. Firstly, they can be used to train a simple MLP discriminator that serves as a regularization to prevent reward hacking and ensures the fluency of generated captions, resulting in a textual GAN setup extended for multimodal inputs. Secondly, they can serve as additional trajectories in the RL strategy, resulting in a teacher forcing loss weighted by the similarity of the GT to the image. This objective acts as an additional learning signal grounded to the distribution of the GT captions. Thirdly, they can serve as strong baselines when added to the pool of captions used to compute the proposed contrastive reward to reduce the variance of gradient estimate. Experiments on MS-COCO demonstrate the interest of the proposed training strategy to produce highly distinctive captions while maintaining high writing quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13936v1,2024-02
Do Efficient Transformers Really Save Computation?,"Kai Yang, Jan Ackermann, Zhenyu He, Guhao Feng, Bohang Zhang, Yunzhen Feng, Qiwei Ye, Di He, Liwei Wang","As transformer-based language models are trained on increasingly large datasets and with vast numbers of parameters, finding more efficient alternatives to the standard Transformer has become very valuable. While many efficient Transformers and Transformer alternatives have been proposed, none provide theoretical guarantees that they are a suitable replacement for the standard Transformer. This makes it challenging to identify when to use a specific model and what directions to prioritize for further investigation. In this paper, we aim to understand the capabilities and limitations of efficient Transformers, specifically the Sparse Transformer and the Linear Transformer. We focus on their reasoning capability as exhibited by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts and follow previous works to model them as Dynamic Programming (DP) problems. Our results show that while these models are expressive enough to solve general DP tasks, contrary to expectations, they require a model size that scales with the problem size. Nonetheless, we identify a class of DP problems for which these models can be more efficient than the standard Transformer. We confirm our theoretical results through experiments on representative DP tasks, adding to the understanding of efficient Transformers' practical strengths and weaknesses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13934v2,2024-02
Large Language Models are Vulnerable to Bait-and-Switch Attacks for Generating Harmful Content,"Federico Bianchi, James Zou","The risks derived from large language models (LLMs) generating deceptive and damaging content have been the subject of considerable research, but even safe generations can lead to problematic downstream impacts. In our study, we shift the focus to how even safe text coming from LLMs can be easily turned into potentially dangerous content through Bait-and-Switch attacks. In such attacks, the user first prompts LLMs with safe questions and then employs a simple find-and-replace post-hoc technique to manipulate the outputs into harmful narratives. The alarming efficacy of this approach in generating toxic content highlights a significant challenge in developing reliable safety guardrails for LLMs. In particular, we stress that focusing on the safety of the verbatim LLM outputs is insufficient and that we also need to consider post-hoc transformations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13926v1,2024-02

SYNFAC-EDIT: Synthetic Imitation Edit Feedback for Factual Alignment in Clinical Summarization,"Prakamya Mishra, Zonghai Yao, Parth Vashisht, Feiyun Ouyang, Beining Wang, Vidhi Dhaval Mody, Hong Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT & Llama have demonstrated significant achievements in summarization tasks but struggle with factual inaccuracies, a critical issue in clinical NLP applications where errors could lead to serious consequences. To counter the high costs and limited availability of expert-annotated data for factual alignment, this study introduces an innovative pipeline that utilizes >100B parameter GPT variants like GPT-3.5 & GPT-4 to act as synthetic experts to generate high-quality synthetics feedback aimed at enhancing factual consistency in clinical note summarization. Our research primarily focuses on edit feedback generated by these synthetic feedback experts without additional human annotations, mirroring and optimizing the practical scenario in which medical professionals refine AI system outputs. Although such 100B+ parameter GPT variants have proven to demonstrate expertise in various clinical NLP tasks, such as the Medical Licensing Examination, there is scant research on their capacity to act as synthetic feedback experts and deliver expert-level edit feedback for improving the generation quality of weaker (<10B parameter) LLMs like GPT-2 (1.5B) & Llama 2 (7B) in clinical domain. So in this work, we leverage 100B+ GPT variants to act as synthetic feedback experts offering expert-level edit feedback, that is used to reduce hallucinations and align weaker (<10B parameter) LLMs with medical facts using two distinct alignment algorithms (DPO & SALT), endeavoring to narrow the divide between AI-generated content and factual accuracy.

By modeling a linear relationship between linguistic feature distances and machine translation scores, we ask ourselves if there are potentially better central languages for LLMs other than English. Our experiments show that the 7B Llama2 model yields above 10 BLEU when translating into all languages it has seen, which rarely happens for languages it has not seen. Most translation improvements into unseen languages come from scaling up the model size rather than instruction tuning or increasing shot count. Furthermore, our correlation analysis reveals that syntactic similarity is not the only linguistic factor that strongly correlates with machine translation scores. Interestingly, we discovered that under specific circumstances, some languages (e.g. Swedish, Catalan), despite having significantly less training data, exhibit comparable correlation levels to English. These insights challenge the prevailing landscape of LLMs, suggesting that models centered around languages other than English could provide a more efficient foundation for multilingual applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13917v2,2024-02
Leveraging Collection-Wide Similarities for Unsupervised Document Structure Extraction,"Gili Lior, Yoav Goldberg, Gabriel Stanovsky","Document collections of various domains, e.g., legal, medical, or financial, often share some underlying collection-wide structure, which captures information that can aid both human users and structure-aware models. We propose to identify the typical structure of document within a collection, which requires to capture recurring topics across the collection, while abstracting over arbitrary header paraphrases, and ground each topic to respective document locations. These requirements pose several challenges: headers that mark recurring topics frequently differ in phrasing, certain section headers are unique to individual documents and do not reflect the typical structure, and the order of topics can vary between documents. Subsequently, we develop an unsupervised graph-based method which leverages both inter- and intra-document similarities, to extract the underlying collection-wide structure. Our evaluations on three diverse domains in both English and Hebrew indicate that our method extracts meaningful collection-wide structure, and we hope that future work will leverage our method for multi-document applications and structure-aware models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13906v2,2024-02
Calibrating Large Language Models with Sample Consistency,"Qing Lyu, Kumar Shridhar, Chaitanya Malaviya, Li Zhang, Yanai Elazar, Niket Tandon, Marianna Apidianaki, Mrinmaya Sachan, Chris Callison-Burch","Accurately gauging the confidence level of Large Language Models' (LLMs) predictions is pivotal for their reliable application. However, LLMs are often uncalibrated inherently and elude conventional calibration techniques due to their proprietary nature and massive scale. In this work, we explore the potential of deriving confidence from the distribution of multiple randomly sampled model generations, via three measures of consistency. We perform an extensive evaluation across various open and closed-source models on nine reasoning datasets. Results show that consistency-based calibration methods outperform existing post-hoc approaches. Meanwhile, we find that factors such as intermediate explanations, model scaling, and larger sample sizes enhance calibration, while instruction-tuning makes calibration more difficult. Moreover, confidence scores obtained from consistency have the potential to enhance model performance. Finally, we offer practical guidance on choosing suitable consistency metrics for calibration, tailored to the characteristics of various LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13904v1,2024-02
Science Checker Reloaded: A Bidirectional Paradigm for Transparency and Logical Reasoning,"Loïc Rakotoson, Sylvain Massip, Fréjus A. A. Laleye","Information retrieval is a rapidly evolving field. However it still faces significant limitations in the scientific and industrial vast amounts of information, such as semantic divergence and vocabulary gaps in sparse retrieval, low precision and lack of interpretability in semantic search, or hallucination and outdated information in generative models. In this paper, we introduce a two-block approach to tackle these hurdles for long documents. The first block enhances language understanding in sparse retrieval by query expansion to retrieve relevant documents. The second block deepens the result by providing comprehensive and informative answers to the complex question using only the information spread in the long document, enabling bidirectional engagement. At various stages of the pipeline, intermediate results are presented to users to facilitate understanding of the system's reasoning. We believe this bidirectional approach brings significant advancements in terms of transparency, logical thinking, and comprehensive understanding in the field of scientific information retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13897v2,2024-02
Beyond Probabilities: Unveiling the Misalignment in Evaluating Large Language Models,"Chenyang Lyu, Minghao Wu, Alham Fikri Aji","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various applications, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) research. However, recent evaluation frameworks often rely on the output probabilities of LLMs for predictions, primarily due to computational constraints, diverging from real-world LLM usage scenarios. While widely employed, the efficacy of these probability-based evaluation strategies remains an open research question. This study aims to scrutinize the validity of such probability-based evaluation methods within the context of using LLMs for Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), highlighting their inherent limitations. Our empirical investigation reveals that the prevalent probability-based evaluation method inadequately aligns with generation-based prediction. Furthermore, current evaluation frameworks typically assess LLMs through predictive tasks based on output probabilities rather than directly generating responses, owing to computational limitations. We illustrate that these probability-based approaches do not effectively correspond with generative predictions. The outcomes of our study can enhance the understanding of LLM evaluation methodologies and provide insights for future research in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13887v2,2024-02
$Se^2$: Sequential Example Selection for In-Context Learning,"Haoyu Liu, Jianfeng Liu, Shaohan Huang, Yuefeng Zhan, Hao Sun, Weiwei Deng, Furu Wei, Qi Zhang","The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) for in-context learning (ICL) needs to be activated by demonstration examples. Prior work has extensively explored the selection of examples for ICL, predominantly following the ""select then organize"" paradigm, such approaches often neglect the internal relationships between examples and exist an inconsistency between the training and inference. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a $Se$quential $Se$lection problem and introduce $Se^2$, a sequential-aware method that leverages the LLM's feedback on varying context, aiding in capturing inter-relationships and sequential information among examples, significantly enriching the contextuality and relevance of ICL prompts. Meanwhile, we utilize beam search to seek and construct example sequences, enhancing both quality and diversity. Extensive experiments across 23 NLP tasks from 8 distinct categories illustrate that $Se^2$ markedly surpasses competitive baselines and achieves 42\% relative improvement over random selection. Further in-depth analysis shows the effectiveness of proposed strategies, highlighting $Se^2$'s exceptional stability and adaptability across various scenarios.

Kuaiji: the First Chinese Accounting Large Language Model,"Jiayuan Luo, Songhua Yang, Xiaoling Qiu, Panyu Chen, Yufei Nai, Wenxuan Zeng, Wentao Zhang, Xinke Jiang","Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have demonstrated impressive proficiency in comprehending and generating natural language. However, they encounter difficulties when tasked with adapting to specialized domains such as accounting. To address this challenge, we introduce Kuaiji, a tailored Accounting Large Language Model. Kuaiji is meticulously fine-tuned using the Baichuan framework, which encompasses continuous pre-training and supervised fine-tuning processes. Supported by CAtAcctQA, a dataset containing large genuine accountant-client dialogues, Kuaiji exhibits exceptional accuracy and response speed. Our contributions encompass the creation of the first Chinese accounting dataset, the establishment of Kuaiji as a leading open-source Chinese accounting LLM, and the validation of its efficacy through real-world accounting scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13866v2,2024-02
Semantic Mirror Jailbreak: Genetic Algorithm Based Jailbreak Prompts Against Open-source LLMs,"Xiaoxia Li, Siyuan Liang, Jiyi Zhang, Han Fang, Aishan Liu, Ee-Chien Chang","Large Language Models (LLMs), used in creative writing, code generation, and translation, generate text based on input sequences but are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where crafted prompts induce harmful outputs. Most jailbreak prompt methods use a combination of jailbreak templates followed by questions to ask to create jailbreak prompts. However, existing jailbreak prompt designs generally suffer from excessive semantic differences, resulting in an inability to resist defenses that use simple semantic metrics as thresholds. Jailbreak prompts are semantically more varied than the original questions used for queries. In this paper, we introduce a Semantic Mirror Jailbreak (SMJ) approach that bypasses LLMs by generating jailbreak prompts that are semantically similar to the original question. We model the search for jailbreak prompts that satisfy both semantic similarity and jailbreak validity as a multi-objective optimization problem and employ a standardized set of genetic algorithms for generating eligible prompts. Compared to the baseline AutoDAN-GA, SMJ achieves attack success rates (ASR) that are at most 35.4% higher without ONION defense and 85.2% higher with ONION defense. SMJ's better performance in all three semantic meaningfulness metrics of Jailbreak Prompt, Similarity, and Outlier, also means that SMJ is resistant to defenses that use those metrics as thresholds.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14872v2,2024-02
Large Language Models are Advanced Anonymizers,"Robin Staab, Mark Vero, Mislav Balunović, Martin Vechev","Recent work in privacy research on large language models has shown that they achieve near human-level performance at inferring personal data from real-world online texts. With consistently increasing model capabilities, existing text anonymization methods are currently lacking behind regulatory requirements and adversarial threats. This raises the question of how individuals can effectively protect their personal data in sharing online texts. In this work, we take two steps to answer this question: We first present a new setting for evaluating anonymizations in the face of adversarial LLMs inferences, allowing for a natural measurement of anonymization performance while remedying some of the shortcomings of previous metrics. We then present our LLM-based adversarial anonymization framework leveraging the strong inferential capabilities of LLMs to inform our anonymization procedure. In our experimental evaluation, we show on real-world and synthetic online texts how adversarial anonymization outperforms current industry-grade anonymizers both in terms of the resulting utility and privacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13846v1,2024-02
Beyond Hate Speech: NLP's Challenges and Opportunities in Uncovering Dehumanizing Language,"Hezhao Zhang, Lasana Harris, Nafise Sadat Moosavi","Dehumanization, characterized as a subtle yet harmful manifestation of hate speech, involves denying individuals of their human qualities and often results in violence against marginalized groups. Despite significant progress in Natural Language Processing across various domains, its application in detecting dehumanizing language is limited, largely due to the scarcity of publicly available annotated data for this domain. This paper evaluates the performance of cutting-edge NLP models, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and LLAMA-2, in identifying dehumanizing language. Our findings reveal that while these models demonstrate potential, achieving a 70\% accuracy rate in distinguishing dehumanizing language from broader hate speech, they also display biases. They are over-sensitive in classifying other forms of hate speech as dehumanization for a specific subset of target groups, while more frequently failing to identify clear cases of dehumanization for other target groups. Moreover, leveraging one of the best-performing models, we automatically annotated a larger dataset for training more accessible models. However, our findings indicate that these models currently do not meet the high-quality data generation threshold necessary for this task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13818v1,2024-02
LLM Based Multi-Agent Generation of Semi-structured Documents from Semantic Templates in the Public Administration Domain,"Emanuele Musumeci, Michele Brienza, Vincenzo Suriani, Daniele Nardi, Domenico Daniele Bloisi","In the last years' digitalization process, the creation and management of documents in various domains, particularly in Public Administration (PA), have become increasingly complex and diverse. This complexity arises from the need to handle a wide range of document types, often characterized by semi-structured forms. Semi-structured documents present a fixed set of data without a fixed format. As a consequence, a template-based solution cannot be used, as understanding a document requires the extraction of the data structure. The recent introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the creation of customized text output satisfying user requests. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines the LLMs with prompt engineering and multi-agent systems for generating new documents compliant with a desired structure. The main contribution of this work concerns replacing the commonly used manual prompting with a task description generated by semantic retrieval from an LLM. The potential of this approach is demonstrated through a series of experiments and case studies, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world PA scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14871v1,2024-02
The Geography of Information Diffusion in Online Discourse on Europe and Migration,"Elisa Leonardelli, Sara Tonelli","The online diffusion of information related to Europe and migration has been little investigated from an external point of view. However, this is a very relevant topic, especially if users have had no direct contact with Europe and its perception depends solely on information retrieved online. In this work we analyse the information circulating online about Europe and migration after retrieving a large amount of data from social media (Twitter), to gain new insights into topics, magnitude, and dynamics of their diffusion. We combine retweets and hashtags network analysis with geolocation of users, linking thus data to geography and allowing analysis from an ""outside Europe"" perspective, with a special focus on Africa. We also introduce a novel approach based on cross-lingual quotes, i.e. when content in a language is commented and retweeted in another language, assuming these interactions are a proxy for connections between very distant communities. Results show how the majority of online discussions occurs at a national level, especially when discussing migration. Language (English) is pivotal for information to become transnational and reach far. Transnational information flow is strongly unbalanced, with content mainly produced in Europe and amplified outside. Conversely Europe-based accounts tend to be self-referential when they discuss migration-related topics. Football is the most exported topic from Europe worldwide. Moreover, important nodes in the communities discussing migration-related topics include accounts of official institutions and international agencies, together with journalists, news, commentators and activists.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13800v1,2024-02
CriticEval: Evaluating Large Language Model as Critic,"Tian Lan, Wenwei Zhang, Chen Xu, Heyan Huang, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen, Xian-ling Mao","Critique ability, i.e., the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and rectify flaws in responses, is crucial for their applications in self-improvement and scalable oversight. While numerous studies have been proposed to evaluate critique ability of LLMs, their comprehensiveness and reliability are still limited. To overcome this problem, we introduce CriticEval, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively and reliably evaluate critique ability of LLMs. Specifically, to ensure the comprehensiveness, CriticEval evaluates critique ability from four dimensions across nine diverse task scenarios. It evaluates both scalar-valued and textual critiques, targeting responses of varying quality. To ensure the reliability, a large number of critiques are annotated to serve as references, enabling GPT-4 to evaluate textual critiques reliably. Extensive evaluations of open-source and closed-source LLMs first validate the reliability of evaluation in CriticEval. Then, experimental results demonstrate the promising potential of open-source LLMs, the effectiveness of critique datasets and several intriguing relationships between the critique ability and some critical factors, including task types, response qualities and critique dimensions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13764v5,2024-02
Factual Consistency Evaluation of Summarisation in the Era of Large Language Models,"Zheheng Luo, Qianqian Xie, Sophia Ananiadou","Factual inconsistency with source documents in automatically generated summaries can lead to misinformation or pose risks. Existing factual consistency(FC) metrics are constrained by their performance, efficiency, and explainability. Recent advances in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in text evaluation but their effectiveness in assessing FC in summarisation remains underexplored. Prior research has mostly focused on proprietary LLMs, leaving essential factors that affect their assessment capabilities unexplored. Additionally, current FC evaluation benchmarks are restricted to news articles, casting doubt on the generality of the FC methods tested on them. In this paper, we first address the gap by introducing TreatFact a dataset of LLM-generated summaries of clinical texts, annotated for FC by domain experts. Moreover, we benchmark 11 LLMs for FC evaluation across news and clinical domains and analyse the impact of model size, prompts, pre-training and fine-tuning data. Our findings reveal that despite proprietary models prevailing on the task, open-source LLMs lag behind. Nevertheless, there is potential for enhancing the performance of open-source LLMs through increasing model size, expanding pre-training data, and developing well-curated fine-tuning data. Experiments on TreatFact suggest that both previous methods and LLM-based evaluators are unable to capture factual inconsistencies in clinical summaries, posing a new challenge for FC evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13758v1,2024-02
LongRoPE: Extending LLM Context Window Beyond 2 Million Tokens,"Yiran Ding, Li Lyna Zhang, Chengruidong Zhang, Yuanyuan Xu, Ning Shang, Jiahang Xu, Fan Yang, Mao Yang","Large context window is a desirable feature in large language models (LLMs). However, due to high fine-tuning costs, scarcity of long texts, and catastrophic values introduced by new token positions, current extended context windows are limited to around 128k tokens. This paper introduces LongRoPE that, for the first time, extends the context window of pre-trained LLMs to an impressive 2048k tokens, with up to only 1k fine-tuning steps at within 256k training lengths, while maintaining performance at the original short context window. This is achieved by three key innovations: (i) we identify and exploit two forms of non-uniformities in positional interpolation through an efficient search, providing a better initialization for fine-tuning and enabling an 8x extension in non-fine-tuning scenarios; (ii) we introduce a progressive extension strategy that first fine-tunes a 256k length LLM and then conducts a second positional interpolation on the fine-tuned extended LLM to achieve a 2048k context window; (iii) we readjust LongRoPE on 8k length to recover the short context window performance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2 and Mistral across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Models extended via LongRoPE retain the original architecture with minor modifications to the positional embedding, and can reuse most pre-existing optimizations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13753v1,2024-02
Breaking the Barrier: Utilizing Large Language Models for Industrial Recommendation Systems through an Inferential Knowledge Graph,"Qian Zhao, Hao Qian, Ziqi Liu, Gong-Duo Zhang, Lihong Gu","Recommendation systems are widely used in e-commerce websites and online platforms to address information overload. However, existing systems primarily rely on historical data and user feedback, making it difficult to capture user intent transitions. Recently, Knowledge Base (KB)-based models are proposed to incorporate expert knowledge, but it struggle to adapt to new items and the evolving e-commerce environment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Large Language Model based Complementary Knowledge Enhanced Recommendation System (LLM-KERec). It introduces an entity extractor that extracts unified concept terms from item and user information. To provide cost-effective and reliable prior knowledge, entity pairs are generated based on entity popularity and specific strategies. The large language model determines complementary relationships in each entity pair, constructing a complementary knowledge graph. Furthermore, a new complementary recall module and an Entity-Entity-Item (E-E-I) weight decision model refine the scoring of the ranking model using real complementary exposure-click samples. Extensive experiments conducted on three industry datasets demonstrate the significant performance improvement of our model compared to existing approaches. Additionally, detailed analysis shows that LLM-KERec enhances users' enthusiasm for consumption by recommending complementary items. In summary, LLM-KERec addresses the limitations of traditional recommendation systems by incorporating complementary knowledge and utilizing a large language model to capture user intent transitions, adapt to new items, and enhance recommendation efficiency in the evolving e-commerce landscape.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13750v1,2024-02
Unlocking Instructive In-Context Learning with Tabular Prompting for Relational Triple Extraction,"Guozheng Li, Wenjun Ke, Peng Wang, Zijie Xu, Ke Ji, Jiajun Liu, Ziyu Shang, Qiqing Luo","The in-context learning (ICL) for relational triple extraction (RTE) has achieved promising performance, but still encounters two key challenges: (1) how to design effective prompts and (2) how to select proper demonstrations. Existing methods, however, fail to address these challenges appropriately. On the one hand, they usually recast RTE task to text-to-text prompting formats, which is unnatural and results in a mismatch between the output format at the pre-training time and the inference time for large language models (LLMs). On the other hand, they only utilize surface natural language features and lack consideration of triple semantics in sample selection. These issues are blocking improved performance in ICL for RTE, thus we aim to tackle prompt designing and sample selection challenges simultaneously. To this end, we devise a tabular prompting for RTE (\textsc{TableIE}) which frames RTE task into a table generation task to incorporate explicit structured information into ICL, facilitating conversion of outputs to RTE structures. Then we propose instructive in-context learning (I$^2$CL) which only selects and annotates a few samples considering internal triple semantics in massive unlabeled samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13741v1,2024-02
From Text to CQL: Bridging Natural Language and Corpus Search Engine,"Luming Lu, Jiyuan An, Yujie Wang, Liner yang, Cunliang Kong, Zhenghao Liu, Shuo Wang, Haozhe Lin, Mingwei Fang, Yaping Huang, Erhong Yang","Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies have revolutionized the way we interact with information systems, with a significant focus on converting natural language queries into formal query languages such as SQL. However, less emphasis has been placed on the Corpus Query Language (CQL), a critical tool for linguistic research and detailed analysis within text corpora. The manual construction of CQL queries is a complex and time-intensive task that requires a great deal of expertise, which presents a notable challenge for both researchers and practitioners. This paper presents the first text-to-CQL task that aims to automate the translation of natural language into CQL. We present a comprehensive framework for this task, including a specifically curated large-scale dataset and methodologies leveraging large language models (LLMs) for effective text-to-CQL task. In addition, we established advanced evaluation metrics to assess the syntactic and semantic accuracy of the generated queries. We created innovative LLM-based conversion approaches and detailed experiments.

Cracking Factual Knowledge: A Comprehensive Analysis of Degenerate Knowledge Neurons in Large Language Models,"Yuheng Chen, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Yining Wang, Shengping Liu, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","Large language models (LLMs) store extensive factual knowledge, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Previous research suggests that factual knowledge is stored within multi-layer perceptron weights, and some storage units exhibit degeneracy, referred to as Degenerate Knowledge Neurons (DKNs). Despite the novelty and unique properties of this concept, it has not been rigorously defined or systematically studied. We first consider the connection weight patterns of MLP neurons and define DKNs from both structural and functional aspects. Based on this, we introduce the Neurological Topology Clustering method, which allows the formation of DKNs in any numbers and structures, leading to a more accurate DKN acquisition. Furthermore, inspired by cognitive science, we explore the relationship between DKNs and the robustness, evolvability, and complexity of LLMs. Our execution of 34 experiments under 6 settings demonstrates the connection between DKNs and these three properties.

Exploiting Adaptive Contextual Masking for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis,"S M Rafiuddin, Mohammed Rakib, Sadia Kamal, Arunkumar Bagavathi","Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained linguistics problem that entails the extraction of multifaceted aspects, opinions, and sentiments from the given text. Both standalone and compound ABSA tasks have been extensively used in the literature to examine the nuanced information present in online reviews and social media posts. Current ABSA methods often rely on static hyperparameters for attention-masking mechanisms, which can struggle with context adaptation and may overlook the unique relevance of words in varied situations. This leads to challenges in accurately analyzing complex sentences containing multiple aspects with differing sentiments. In this work, we present adaptive masking methods that remove irrelevant tokens based on context to assist in Aspect Term Extraction and Aspect Sentiment Classification subtasks of ABSA. We show with our experiments that the proposed methods outperform the baseline methods in terms of accuracy and F1 scores on four benchmark online review datasets. Further, we show that the proposed methods can be extended with multiple adaptations and demonstrate a qualitative analysis of the proposed approach using sample text for aspect term extraction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13722v1,2024-02
Ouroboros: Generating Longer Drafts Phrase by Phrase for Faster Speculative Decoding,"Weilin Zhao, Yuxiang Huang, Xu Han, Wang Xu, Chaojun Xiao, Xinrong Zhang, Yewei Fang, Kaihuo Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Speculative decoding is a widely used method that accelerates the generation process of large language models (LLMs) with no compromise in model performance. It achieves this goal by using an existing smaller model for drafting and then employing the target LLM to verify the draft in a low-cost parallel manner. Under such a drafting-verification framework, drafting efficiency has become a bottleneck in the final speedup of speculative decoding. Therefore, generating longer drafts at less cost can lead to better decoding speedup. To achieve this, we introduce Ouroboros, which can generate draft phrases to parallelize the drafting process and meanwhile lengthen drafts in a training-free manner. The experimental results on various typical text generation tasks show that Ouroboros can achieve speedups of up to $2.8\times$ over speculative decoding and $3.9\times$ over vanilla decoding, without fine-tuning draft and target models.

Effects of term weighting approach with and without stop words removing on Arabic text classification,"Esra'a Alhenawi, Ruba Abu Khurma, Pedro A. Castillo, Maribel G. Arenas","Classifying text is a method for categorizing documents into pre-established groups. Text documents must be prepared and represented in a way that is appropriate for the algorithms used for data mining prior to classification. As a result, a number of term weighting strategies have been created in the literature to enhance text categorization algorithms' functionality. This study compares the effects of Binary and Term frequency weighting feature methodologies on the text's classification method when stop words are eliminated once and when they are not. In recognition of assessing the effects of prior weighting of features approaches on classification results in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure values, we used an Arabic data set made up of 322 documents divided into six main topics (agriculture, economy, health, politics, science, and sport), each of which contains 50 documents, with the exception of the health category, which contains 61 documents. The results demonstrate that for all metrics, the term frequency feature weighting approach with stop word removal outperforms the binary approach, while for accuracy, recall, and F-Measure, the binary approach outperforms the TF approach without stop word removal. However, for precision, the two approaches produce results that are very similar. Additionally, it is clear from the data that, using the same phrase weighting approach, stop word removing increases classification accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14867v1,2024-02
$\infty$Bench: Extending Long Context Evaluation Beyond 100K Tokens,"Xinrong Zhang, Yingfa Chen, Shengding Hu, Zihang Xu, Junhao Chen, Moo Khai Hao, Xu Han, Zhen Leng Thai, Shuo Wang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Processing and reasoning over long contexts is crucial for many practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as document comprehension and agent construction. Despite recent strides in making LLMs process contexts with more than 100K tokens, there is currently a lack of a standardized benchmark to evaluate this long-context capability. Existing public benchmarks typically focus on contexts around 10K tokens, limiting the assessment and comparison of LLMs in processing longer contexts. In this paper, we propose $\infty$Bench, the first LLM benchmark featuring an average data length surpassing 100K tokens. $\infty$Bench comprises synthetic and realistic tasks spanning diverse domains, presented in both English and Chinese. The tasks in $\infty$Bench are designed to require well understanding of long dependencies in contexts, and make simply retrieving a limited number of passages from contexts not sufficient for these tasks. In our experiments, based on $\infty$Bench, we evaluate the state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs tailored for processing long contexts. The results indicate that existing long context LLMs still require significant advancements to effectively process 100K+ context. We further present three intriguing analyses regarding the behavior of LLMs processing long context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13718v3,2024-02
Neeko: Leveraging Dynamic LoRA for Efficient Multi-Character Role-Playing Agent,"Xiaoyan Yu, Tongxu Luo, Yifan Wei, Fangyu Lei, Yiming Huang, Hao Peng, Liehuang Zhu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized open-domain dialogue agents but encounter challenges in multi-character role-playing (MCRP) scenarios. To address the issue, we present Neeko, an innovative framework designed for efficient multiple characters imitation. Unlike existing methods, Neeko employs a dynamic low-rank adapter (LoRA) strategy, enabling it to adapt seamlessly to diverse characters. Our framework breaks down the role-playing process into agent pre-training, multiple characters playing, and character incremental learning, effectively handling both seen and unseen roles. This dynamic approach, coupled with distinct LoRA blocks for each character, enhances Neeko's adaptability to unique attributes, personalities, and speaking patterns. As a result, Neeko demonstrates superior performance in MCRP over most existing methods, offering more engaging and versatile user interaction experiences.

SaGE: Evaluating Moral Consistency in Large Language Models,"Vamshi Krishna Bonagiri, Sreeram Vennam, Priyanshul Govil, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Manas Gaur","Despite recent advancements showcasing the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in conversational systems, we show that even state-of-the-art LLMs are morally inconsistent in their generations, questioning their reliability (and trustworthiness in general). Prior works in LLM evaluation focus on developing ground-truth data to measure accuracy on specific tasks. However, for moral scenarios that often lack universally agreed-upon answers, consistency in model responses becomes crucial for their reliability. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic measure called Semantic Graph Entropy (SaGE), grounded in the concept of ""Rules of Thumb"" (RoTs) to measure a model's moral consistency. RoTs are abstract principles learned by a model and can help explain their decision-making strategies effectively. To this extent, we construct the Moral Consistency Corpus (MCC), containing 50K moral questions, responses to them by LLMs, and the RoTs that these models followed. Furthermore, to illustrate the generalizability of SaGE, we use it to investigate LLM consistency on two popular datasets -- TruthfulQA and HellaSwag. Our results reveal that task-accuracy and consistency are independent problems, and there is a dire need to investigate these issues further.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13709v2,2024-02
Investigating Multilingual Instruction-Tuning: Do Polyglot Models Demand for Multilingual Instructions?,"Alexander Arno Weber, Klaudia Thellmann, Jan Ebert, Nicolas Flores-Herr, Jens Lehmann, Michael Fromm, Mehdi Ali","The adaption of multilingual pre-trained LLMs into eloquent and helpful assistants is essential to facilitate their use across different language regions. In that spirit, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the performance of multilingual models instruction-tuned on different language compositions on parallel instruction-tuning benchmarks across a selection of the most spoken Indo-European languages. We systematically examine the effects of language and instruction dataset size on a mid-sized and a large, multilingual LLMs by instruction-tuning them on parallel instruction-tuning datasets. Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning on parallel instead of monolingual corpora benefits cross-lingual instruction following capabilities by up to 9.9%. Furthermore, we show that the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis does not hold in general, as the investigated multilingual 7B parameter model presents a counter-example requiring large-scale instruction-tuning datasets. Finally, we conduct a human annotation study to understand the alignment between human-based and GPT-4-based evaluation within multilingual chat scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13703v3,2024-02
CMNER: A Chinese Multimodal NER Dataset based on Social Media,"Yuanze Ji, Bobo Li, Jun Zhou, Fei Li, Chong Teng, Donghong Ji","Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) is a pivotal task designed to extract named entities from text with the support of pertinent images. Nonetheless, a notable paucity of data for Chinese MNER has considerably impeded the progress of this natural language processing task within the Chinese domain. Consequently, in this study, we compile a Chinese Multimodal NER dataset (CMNER) utilizing data sourced from Weibo, China's largest social media platform. Our dataset encompasses 5,000 Weibo posts paired with 18,326 corresponding images. The entities are classified into four distinct categories: person, location, organization, and miscellaneous. We perform baseline experiments on CMNER, and the outcomes underscore the effectiveness of incorporating images for NER. Furthermore, we conduct cross-lingual experiments on the publicly available English MNER dataset (Twitter2015), and the results substantiate our hypothesis that Chinese and English multimodal NER data can mutually enhance the performance of the NER model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13693v2,2024-02
KInIT at SemEval-2024 Task 8: Fine-tuned LLMs for Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detection,"Michal Spiegel, Dominik Macko","SemEval-2024 Task 8 is focused on multigenerator, multidomain, and multilingual black-box machine-generated text detection. Such a detection is important for preventing a potential misuse of large language models (LLMs), the newest of which are very capable in generating multilingual human-like texts. We have coped with this task in multiple ways, utilizing language identification and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of smaller LLMs for text classification. We have further used the per-language classification-threshold calibration to uniquely combine fine-tuned models predictions with statistical detection metrics to improve generalization of the system detection performance. Our submitted method achieved competitive results, ranking at the fourth place, just under 1 percentage point behind the winner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13671v2,2024-02
Self-Distillation Bridges Distribution Gap in Language Model Fine-Tuning,"Zhaorui Yang, Tianyu Pang, Haozhe Feng, Han Wang, Wei Chen, Minfeng Zhu, Qian Liu","The surge in Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, but fine-tuning them for specific tasks often encounters challenges in balancing performance and preserving general instruction-following abilities. In this paper, we posit that the distribution gap between task datasets and the LLMs serves as the primary underlying cause. To address the problem, we introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a novel approach that bridges the distribution gap by guiding fine-tuning with a distilled dataset generated by the model itself to match its original distribution. Experimental results on the Llama-2-chat model across various benchmarks demonstrate that SDFT effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while achieving comparable or superior performance on downstream tasks compared to the vanilla fine-tuning. Moreover, SDFT demonstrates the potential to maintain the helpfulness and safety alignment of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/sdft.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13669v2,2024-02
GCOF: Self-iterative Text Generation for Copywriting Using Large Language Model,"Jianghui Zhou, Ya Gao, Jie Liu, Xuemin Zhao, Zhaohua Yang, Yue Wu, Lirong Shi","Large language models(LLM) such as ChatGPT have substantially simplified the generation of marketing copy, yet producing content satisfying domain specific requirements, such as effectively engaging customers, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce the Genetic Copy Optimization Framework (GCOF) designed to enhance both efficiency and engagememnt of marketing copy creation. We conduct explicit feature engineering within the prompts of LLM. Additionally, we modify the crossover operator in Genetic Algorithm (GA), integrating it into the GCOF to enable automatic feature engineering. This integration facilitates a self-iterative refinement of the marketing copy. Compared to human curated copy, Online results indicate that copy produced by our framework achieves an average increase in click-through rate (CTR) of over $50\%$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13667v1,2024-02
Privacy-Preserving Instructions for Aligning Large Language Models,"Da Yu, Peter Kairouz, Sewoong Oh, Zheng Xu","Service providers of large language model (LLM) applications collect user instructions in the wild and use them in further aligning LLMs with users' intentions. These instructions, which potentially contain sensitive information, are annotated by human workers in the process. This poses a new privacy risk not addressed by the typical private optimization. To this end, we propose using synthetic instructions to replace real instructions in data annotation and model fine-tuning. Formal differential privacy is guaranteed by generating those synthetic instructions using privately fine-tuned generators. Crucial in achieving the desired utility is our novel filtering algorithm that matches the distribution of the synthetic instructions to that of the real ones. In both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, our extensive experiments demonstrate the high utility of the final set of synthetic instructions by showing comparable results to real instructions. In supervised fine-tuning, models trained with private synthetic instructions outperform leading open-source models such as Vicuna.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13659v2,2024-02
Unsupervised Text Style Transfer via LLMs and Attention Masking with Multi-way Interactions,"Lei Pan, Yunshi Lan, Yang Li, Weining Qian","Unsupervised Text Style Transfer (UTST) has emerged as a critical task within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), aiming to transfer one stylistic aspect of a sentence into another style without changing its semantics, syntax, or other attributes. This task is especially challenging given the intrinsic lack of parallel text pairings. Among existing methods for UTST tasks, attention masking approach and Large Language Models (LLMs) are deemed as two pioneering methods. However, they have shortcomings in generating unsmooth sentences and changing the original contents, respectively. In this paper, we investigate if we can combine these two methods effectively. We propose four ways of interactions, that are pipeline framework with tuned orders; knowledge distillation from LLMs to attention masking model; in-context learning with constructed parallel examples. We empirically show these multi-way interactions can improve the baselines in certain perspective of style strength, content preservation and text fluency. Experiments also demonstrate that simply conducting prompting followed by attention masking-based revision can consistently surpass the other systems, including supervised text style transfer systems. On Yelp-clean and Amazon-clean datasets, it improves the previously best mean metric by 0.5 and 3.0 absolute percentages respectively, and achieves new SOTA results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13647v1,2024-02
A Unified Framework and Dataset for Assessing Societal Bias in Vision-Language Models,"Ashutosh Sathe, Prachi Jain, Sunayana Sitaram","Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained widespread adoption in both industry and academia. In this study, we propose a unified framework for systematically evaluating gender, race, and age biases in VLMs with respect to professions. Our evaluation encompasses all supported inference modes of the recent VLMs, including image-to-text, text-to-text, text-to-image, and image-to-image. Additionally, we propose an automated pipeline to generate high-quality synthetic datasets that intentionally conceal gender, race, and age information across different professional domains, both in generated text and images. The dataset includes action-based descriptions of each profession and serves as a benchmark for evaluating societal biases in vision-language models (VLMs). In our comparative analysis of widely used VLMs, we have identified that varying input-output modalities lead to discernible differences in bias magnitudes and directions. Additionally, we find that VLM models exhibit distinct biases across different bias attributes we investigated. We hope our work will help guide future progress in improving VLMs to learn socially unbiased representations. We will release our data and code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13636v2,2024-02
DREsS: Dataset for Rubric-based Essay Scoring on EFL Writing,"Haneul Yoo, Jieun Han, So-Yeon Ahn, Alice Oh","Automated essay scoring (AES) is a useful tool in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing education, offering real-time essay scores for students and instructors. However, previous AES models were trained on essays and scores irrelevant to the practical scenarios of EFL writing education and usually provided a single holistic score due to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we release DREsS, a large-scale, standard dataset for rubric-based automated essay scoring. DREsS comprises three sub-datasets: DREsS_New, DREsS_Std., and DREsS_CASE. We collect DREsS_New, a real-classroom dataset with 2.3K essays authored by EFL undergraduate students and scored by English education experts. We also standardize existing rubric-based essay scoring datasets as DREsS_Std. We suggest CASE, a corruption-based augmentation strategy for essays, which generates 40.1K synthetic samples of DREsS_CASE and improves the baseline results by 45.44%.

MORE: Multi-mOdal REtrieval Augmented Generative Commonsense Reasoning,"Wanqing Cui, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng","Since commonsense information has been recorded significantly less frequently than its existence, language models pre-trained by text generation have difficulty to learn sufficient commonsense knowledge. Several studies have leveraged text retrieval to augment the models' commonsense ability. Unlike text, images capture commonsense information inherently but little effort has been paid to effectively utilize them. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-mOdal REtrieval (MORE) augmentation framework, to leverage both text and images to enhance the commonsense ability of language models. Extensive experiments on the Common-Gen task have demonstrated the efficacy of MORE based on the pre-trained models of both single and multiple modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13625v2,2024-02
FLAME: Self-Supervised Low-Resource Taxonomy Expansion using Large Language Models,"Sahil Mishra, Ujjwal Sudev, Tanmoy Chakraborty","Taxonomies represent an arborescence hierarchical structure that establishes relationships among entities to convey knowledge within a specific domain. Each edge in the taxonomy signifies a hypernym-hyponym relationship. Taxonomies find utility in various real-world applications, such as e-commerce search engines and recommendation systems. Consequently, there arises a necessity to enhance these taxonomies over time. However, manually curating taxonomies with neoteric data presents challenges due to limitations in available human resources and the exponential growth of data. Therefore, it becomes imperative to develop automatic taxonomy expansion methods. Traditional supervised taxonomy expansion approaches encounter difficulties stemming from limited resources, primarily due to the small size of existing taxonomies. This scarcity of training data often leads to overfitting. In this paper, we propose FLAME, a novel approach for taxonomy expansion in low-resource environments by harnessing the capabilities of large language models that are trained on extensive real-world knowledge. LLMs help compensate for the scarcity of domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, FLAME leverages prompting in few-shot settings to extract the inherent knowledge within the LLMs, ascertaining the hypernym entities within the taxonomy. Furthermore, it employs reinforcement learning to fine-tune the large language models, resulting in more accurate predictions. Experiments on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAME in real-world scenarios, achieving a remarkable improvement of 18.5% in accuracy and 12.3% in Wu & Palmer metric over eight baselines. Furthermore, we elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of FLAME through an extensive case study, error analysis and ablation studies on the benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13623v1,2024-02

Data-driven Discovery with Large Generative Models,"Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, Harshit Surana, Dhruv Agarwal, Sanchaita Hazra, Ashish Sabharwal, Peter Clark","With the accumulation of data at an unprecedented rate, its potential to fuel scientific discovery is growing exponentially. This position paper urges the Machine Learning (ML) community to exploit the capabilities of large generative models (LGMs) to develop automated systems for end-to-end data-driven discovery -- a paradigm encompassing the search and verification of hypotheses purely from a set of provided datasets, without the need for additional data collection or physical experiments. We first outline several desiderata for an ideal data-driven discovery system. Then, through DATAVOYAGER, a proof-of-concept utilizing GPT-4, we demonstrate how LGMs fulfill several of these desiderata -- a feat previously unattainable -- while also highlighting important limitations in the current system that open up opportunities for novel ML research. We contend that achieving accurate, reliable, and robust end-to-end discovery systems solely through the current capabilities of LGMs is challenging. We instead advocate for fail-proof tool integration, along with active user moderation through feedback mechanisms, to foster data-driven scientific discoveries with efficiency and reproducibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13610v1,2024-02
CODIS: Benchmarking Context-Dependent Visual Comprehension for Multimodal Large Language Models,"Fuwen Luo, Chi Chen, Zihao Wan, Zhaolu Kang, Qidong Yan, Yingjie Li, Xiaolong Wang, Siyu Wang, Ziyue Wang, Xiaoyue Mi, Peng Li, Ning Ma, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising results in a variety of tasks that combine vision and language. As these models become more integral to research and applications, conducting comprehensive evaluations of their capabilities has grown increasingly important. However, most existing benchmarks fail to consider that, in certain situations, images need to be interpreted within a broader context. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark, named as CODIS, designed to assess the ability of models to use context provided in free-form text to enhance visual comprehension. Our findings indicate that MLLMs consistently fall short of human performance on this benchmark. Further analysis confirms that these models struggle to effectively extract and utilize contextual information to improve their understanding of images. This underscores the pressing need to enhance the ability of MLLMs to comprehend visuals in a context-dependent manner.

A Comprehensive Study of Multilingual Confidence Estimation on Large Language Models,"Boyang Xue, Hongru Wang, Rui Wang, Sheng Wang, Zezhong Wang, Yiming Du, Bin Liang, Kam-Fai Wong","The tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate hallucinations raises concerns regarding their reliability. Therefore, confidence estimations indicating the extent of trustworthiness of the generations become essential. However, current LLM confidence estimations in languages other than English remain underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive investigation of Multilingual Confidence estimation (MlingConf) on LLMs, focusing on both language-agnostic (LA) and language-specific (LS) tasks to explore the performance and language dominance effects of multilingual confidence estimations on different tasks. The benchmark comprises four meticulously checked and human-evaluate high-quality multilingual datasets for LA tasks and one for the LS task tailored to specific social, cultural, and geographical contexts of a language. Our experiments reveal that on LA tasks English exhibits notable linguistic dominance in confidence estimations than other languages, while on LS tasks, using question-related language to prompt LLMs demonstrates better linguistic dominance in multilingual confidence estimations. The phenomena inspire a simple yet effective native-tone prompting strategy by employing language-specific prompts for LS tasks, effectively improving LLMs' reliability and accuracy on LS tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13606v3,2024-02
KorNAT: LLM Alignment Benchmark for Korean Social Values and Common Knowledge,"Jiyoung Lee, Minwoo Kim, Seungho Kim, Junghwan Kim, Seunghyun Won, Hwaran Lee, Edward Choi","For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be effectively deployed in a specific country, they must possess an understanding of the nation's culture and basic knowledge. To this end, we introduce National Alignment, which measures an alignment between an LLM and a targeted country from two aspects: social value alignment and common knowledge alignment. Social value alignment evaluates how well the model understands nation-specific social values, while common knowledge alignment examines how well the model captures basic knowledge related to the nation. We constructed KorNAT, the first benchmark that measures national alignment with South Korea. For the social value dataset, we obtained ground truth labels from a large-scale survey involving 6,174 unique Korean participants. For the common knowledge dataset, we constructed samples based on Korean textbooks and GED reference materials. KorNAT contains 4K and 6K multiple-choice questions for social value and common knowledge, respectively. Our dataset creation process is meticulously designed and based on statistical sampling theory and was refined through multiple rounds of human review. The experiment results of seven LLMs reveal that only a few models met our reference score, indicating a potential for further enhancement. KorNAT has received government approval after passing an assessment conducted by a government-affiliated organization dedicated to evaluating dataset quality. Samples and detailed evaluation protocols of our dataset can be found in https://huggingface.co/datasets/jiyounglee0523/KorNAT .",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13605v6,2024-02

The manual work involved in processing and classifying occupational descriptions is error-prone, tedious, and time-consuming. We finetune a preexisting language model (CANINE) to do this automatically, thereby performing in seconds and minutes what previously took days and weeks. The model is trained on 14 million pairs of occupational descriptions and HISCO codes in 13 different languages contributed by 22 different sources. Our approach is shown to have accuracy, recall, and precision above 90 percent.

User-LLM: Efficient LLM Contextualization with User Embeddings,"Lin Ning, Luyang Liu, Jiaxing Wu, Neo Wu, Devora Berlowitz, Sushant Prakash, Bradley Green, Shawn O'Banion, Jun Xie","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains, but effectively incorporating complex and potentially noisy user timeline data into LLMs remains a challenge. Current approaches often involve translating user timelines into text descriptions before feeding them to LLMs, which can be inefficient and may not fully capture the nuances of user behavior. Inspired by how LLMs are effectively integrated with images through direct embeddings, we propose User-LLM, a novel framework that leverages user embeddings to directly contextualize LLMs with user history interactions. These embeddings, generated by a user encoder pretrained using self-supervised learning on diverse user interactions, capture latent user behaviors and interests as well as their evolution over time. We integrate these user embeddings with LLMs through cross-attention, enabling LLMs to dynamically adapt their responses based on the context of a user's past actions and preferences.   Our approach achieves significant efficiency gains by representing user timelines directly as embeddings, leading to substantial inference speedups of up to 78.1X. Comprehensive experiments on MovieLens, Amazon Review, and Google Local Review datasets demonstrate that User-LLM outperforms text-prompt-based contextualization on tasks requiring deep user understanding, with improvements of up to 16.33%, particularly excelling on long sequences that capture subtle shifts in user behavior. Furthermore, the incorporation of Perceiver layers streamlines the integration between user encoders and LLMs, yielding additional computational savings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13598v2,2024-02
Knowledge Graph Enhanced Large Language Model Editing,"Mengqi Zhang, Xiaotian Ye, Qiang Liu, Pengjie Ren, Shu Wu, Zhumin Chen","Large language models (LLMs) are pivotal in advancing natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their efficacy is hampered by inaccuracies and outdated knowledge. Model editing emerges as a promising solution to address these challenges. However, existing editing methods struggle to track and incorporate changes in knowledge associated with edits, which limits the generalization ability of postedit LLMs in processing edited knowledge. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel model editing method that leverages knowledge graphs for enhancing LLM editing, namely GLAME. Specifically, we first utilize a knowledge graph augmentation module to uncover associated knowledge that has changed due to editing, obtaining its internal representations within LLMs. This approach allows knowledge alterations within LLMs to be reflected through an external graph structure. Subsequently, we design a graph-based knowledge edit module to integrate structured knowledge into the model editing. This ensures that the updated parameters reflect not only the modifications of the edited knowledge but also the changes in other associated knowledge resulting from the editing process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on GPT-J and GPT-2 XL demonstrate that GLAME significantly improves the generalization capabilities of post-edit LLMs in employing edited knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13593v1,2024-02
APTQ: Attention-aware Post-Training Mixed-Precision Quantization for Large Language Models,"Ziyi Guan, Hantao Huang, Yupeng Su, Hong Huang, Ngai Wong, Hao Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly advanced the natural language processing paradigm. However, the high computational load and huge model sizes pose a grand challenge for deployment on edge devices. To this end, we propose APTQ (Attention-aware Post-Training Mixed-Precision Quantization) for LLMs, which considers not only the second-order information of each layer's weights, but also, for the first time, the nonlinear effect of attention outputs on the entire model. We leverage the Hessian trace as a sensitivity metric for mixed-precision quantization, ensuring an informed precision reduction that retains model performance. Experiments show APTQ surpasses previous quantization methods, achieving an average of 4 bit width a 5.22 perplexity nearly equivalent to full precision in the C4 dataset. In addition, APTQ attains state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy of 68.24\% and 70.48\% at an average bitwidth of 3.8 in LLaMa-7B and LLaMa-13B, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness to produce high-quality quantized LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14866v2,2024-02
A Multimodal In-Context Tuning Approach for E-Commerce Product Description Generation,"Yunxin Li, Baotian Hu, Wenhan Luo, Lin Ma, Yuxin Ding, Min Zhang","In this paper, we propose a new setting for generating product descriptions from images, augmented by marketing keywords. It leverages the combined power of visual and textual information to create descriptions that are more tailored to the unique features of products. For this setting, previous methods utilize visual and textual encoders to encode the image and keywords and employ a language model-based decoder to generate the product description. However, the generated description is often inaccurate and generic since same-category products have similar copy-writings, and optimizing the overall framework on large-scale samples makes models concentrate on common words yet ignore the product features. To alleviate the issue, we present a simple and effective Multimodal In-Context Tuning approach, named ModICT, which introduces a similar product sample as the reference and utilizes the in-context learning capability of language models to produce the description. During training, we keep the visual encoder and language model frozen, focusing on optimizing the modules responsible for creating multimodal in-context references and dynamic prompts. This approach preserves the language generation prowess of large language models (LLMs), facilitating a substantial increase in description diversity. To assess the effectiveness of ModICT across various language model scales and types, we collect data from three distinct product categories within the E-commerce domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ModICT significantly improves the accuracy (by up to 3.3% on Rouge-L) and diversity (by up to 9.4% on D-5) of generated results compared to conventional methods. Our findings underscore the potential of ModICT as a valuable tool for enhancing automatic generation of product descriptions in a wide range of applications.

WinoViz: Probing Visual Properties of Objects Under Different States,"Woojeong Jin, Tejas Srinivasan, Jesse Thomason, Xiang Ren","Humans perceive and comprehend different visual properties of an object based on specific contexts. For instance, we know that a banana turns brown ``when it becomes rotten,'' whereas it appears green ``when it is unripe.'' Previous studies on probing visual commonsense knowledge have primarily focused on examining language models' understanding of typical properties (e.g., colors and shapes) of objects. We present WinoViz, a text-only evaluation dataset, consisting of 1,380 examples that probe the reasoning abilities of language models regarding variant visual properties of objects under different contexts or states. Our task is challenging since it requires pragmatic reasoning (finding intended meanings) and visual knowledge reasoning. We also present multi-hop data, a more challenging version of our data, which requires multi-step reasoning chains to solve our task. In our experimental analysis, our findings are: a) Large language models such as GPT-4 demonstrate effective performance, but when it comes to multi-hop data, their performance is significantly degraded. b) Large models perform well on pragmatic reasoning, but visual knowledge reasoning is a bottleneck in our task. c) Vision-language models outperform their language-model counterparts. d) A model with machine-generated images performs poorly in our task.

LongWanjuan: Towards Systematic Measurement for Long Text Quality,"Kai Lv, Xiaoran Liu, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Conghui He, Xipeng Qiu, Dahua Lin","The quality of training data are crucial for enhancing the long-text capabilities of foundation models. Despite existing efforts to refine data quality through heuristic rules and evaluations based on data diversity and difficulty, there's a lack of systematic approaches specifically tailored for assessing long texts. Addressing this gap, our work systematically measures the quality of long texts by evaluating three fundamental linguistic dimensions: coherence, cohesion, and complexity. Drawing inspiration from the aforementioned three dimensions, we introduce a suite of metrics designed to evaluate the quality of long texts, encompassing both statistical and pre-trained language model-based ones. Leveraging these metrics, we present LongWanjuan, a bilingual dataset specifically tailored to enhance the training of language models for long-text tasks with over 160B tokens. In LongWanjuan, we categorize long texts into holistic, aggregated, and chaotic types, enabling a detailed analysis of long-text quality. Furthermore, we devise a data mixture recipe that strategically balances different types of long texts within LongWanjuan, leading to significant improvements in model performance on long-text tasks.

BBA: Bi-Modal Behavioral Alignment for Reasoning with Large Vision-Language Models,"Xueliang Zhao, Xinting Huang, Tingchen Fu, Qintong Li, Shansan Gong, Lemao Liu, Wei Bi, Lingpeng Kong","Multimodal reasoning stands as a pivotal capability for large vision-language models (LVLMs). The integration with Domain-Specific Languages (DSL), offering precise visual representations, equips these models with the opportunity to execute more accurate reasoning in complex and professional domains. However, the vanilla Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting method faces challenges in effectively leveraging the unique strengths of visual and DSL representations, primarily due to their differing reasoning mechanisms. Additionally, it often falls short in addressing critical steps in multi-step reasoning tasks. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce the \underline{B}i-Modal \underline{B}ehavioral \underline{A}lignment (BBA) prompting method, designed to maximize the potential of DSL in augmenting complex multi-modal reasoning tasks. This method initiates by guiding LVLMs to create separate reasoning chains for visual and DSL representations. Subsequently, it aligns these chains by addressing any inconsistencies, thus achieving a cohesive integration of behaviors from different modalities. Our experiments demonstrate that BBA substantially improves the performance of GPT-4V(ision) on geometry problem solving ($28.34\% \to 34.22\%$), chess positional advantage prediction ($42.08\% \to 46.99\%$) and molecular property prediction ($77.47\% \to 83.52\%$).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13577v1,2024-02
PCA-Bench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models in Perception-Cognition-Action Chain,"Liang Chen, Yichi Zhang, Shuhuai Ren, Haozhe Zhao, Zefan Cai, Yuchi Wang, Peiyi Wang, Xiangdi Meng, Tianyu Liu, Baobao Chang","We present PCA-Bench, a multimodal decision-making benchmark for evaluating the integrated capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Departing from previous benchmarks focusing on simplistic tasks and individual model capability, PCA-Bench introduces three complex scenarios: autonomous driving, domestic robotics, and open-world games. Given task instructions and diverse contexts, the model is required to seamlessly integrate multiple capabilities of Perception, Cognition, and Action in a reasoning chain to make accurate decisions. Moreover, PCA-Bench features error localization capabilities, scrutinizing model inaccuracies in areas such as perception, knowledge, or reasoning. This enhances the reliability of deploying MLLMs. To balance accuracy and efficiency in evaluation, we propose PCA-Eval, an automatic evaluation protocol, and assess 10 prevalent MLLMs. The results reveal significant performance disparities between open-source models and powerful proprietary models like GPT-4 Vision. To address this, we introduce Embodied-Instruction-Evolution (EIE), an automatic framework for synthesizing instruction tuning examples in multimodal embodied environments. EIE generates 7,510 training examples in PCA-Bench and enhances the performance of open-source MLLMs, occasionally surpassing GPT-4 Vision (+3\% in decision accuracy), thereby validating the effectiveness of EIE. Our findings suggest that robust MLLMs like GPT4-Vision show promise for decision-making in embodied agents, opening new avenues for MLLM research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15527v1,2024-02
Multilingual Coreference Resolution in Low-resource South Asian Languages,"Ritwik Mishra, Pooja Desur, Rajiv Ratn Shah, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","Coreference resolution involves the task of identifying text spans within a discourse that pertain to the same real-world entity. While this task has been extensively explored in the English language, there has been a notable scarcity of publicly accessible resources and models for coreference resolution in South Asian languages. We introduce a Translated dataset for Multilingual Coreference Resolution (TransMuCoRes) in 31 South Asian languages using off-the-shelf tools for translation and word-alignment. Nearly all of the predicted translations successfully pass a sanity check, and 75% of English references align with their predicted translations. Using multilingual encoders, two off-the-shelf coreference resolution models were trained on a concatenation of TransMuCoRes and a Hindi coreference resolution dataset with manual annotations. The best performing model achieved a score of 64 and 68 for LEA F1 and CoNLL F1, respectively, on our test-split of Hindi golden set. This study is the first to evaluate an end-to-end coreference resolution model on a Hindi golden set. Furthermore, this work underscores the limitations of current coreference evaluation metrics when applied to datasets with split antecedents, advocating for the development of more suitable evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13571v2,2024-02
Dynamic Evaluation of Large Language Models by Meta Probing Agents,"Kaijie Zhu, Jindong Wang, Qinlin Zhao, Ruochen Xu, Xing Xie","Evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has raised great concerns in the community due to the issue of data contamination. Existing work designed evaluation protocols using well-defined algorithms for specific tasks, which cannot be easily extended to diverse scenarios. Moreover, current evaluation benchmarks can only provide the overall benchmark results and cannot support a fine-grained and multifaceted analysis of LLMs' abilities. In this paper, we propose meta probing agents (MPA), a general dynamic evaluation protocol inspired by psychometrics to evaluate LLMs. MPA is the key component of DyVal 2, which naturally extends the previous DyVal~\citep{zhu2023dyval}. MPA designs the probing and judging agents to automatically transform an original evaluation problem into a new one following psychometric theory on three basic cognitive abilities: language understanding, problem solving, and domain knowledge. These basic abilities are also dynamically configurable, allowing multifaceted analysis. We conducted extensive evaluations using MPA and found that most LLMs achieve poorer performance, indicating room for improvement. Our multifaceted analysis demonstrated the strong correlation between the basic abilities and an implicit Matthew effect on model size, i.e., larger models possess stronger correlations of the abilities. MPA can also be used as a data augmentation approach to enhance LLMs. Code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14865v2,2024-02
Analysis of Multi-Source Language Training in Cross-Lingual Transfer,"Seong Hoon Lim, Taejun Yun, Jinhyeon Kim, Jihun Choi, Taeuk Kim","The successful adaptation of multilingual language models (LMs) to a specific language-task pair critically depends on the availability of data tailored for that condition. While cross-lingual transfer (XLT) methods have contributed to addressing this data scarcity problem, there still exists ongoing debate about the mechanisms behind their effectiveness. In this work, we focus on one of promising assumptions about inner workings of XLT, that it encourages multilingual LMs to place greater emphasis on language-agnostic or task-specific features. We test this hypothesis by examining how the patterns of XLT change with a varying number of source languages involved in the process. Our experimental findings show that the use of multiple source languages in XLT-a technique we term Multi-Source Language Training (MSLT)-leads to increased mingling of embedding spaces for different languages, supporting the claim that XLT benefits from making use of language-independent information. On the other hand, we discover that using an arbitrary combination of source languages does not always guarantee better performance. We suggest simple heuristics for identifying effective language combinations for MSLT and empirically prove its effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13562v2,2024-02
Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper: Advancing Multimodal Comprehension with Enhanced Visual Knowledge Alignment,"Yunxin Li, Xinyu Chen, Baotian Hu, Haoyuan Shi, Min Zhang","Evaluating and Rethinking the current landscape of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), we observe that widely-used visual-language projection approaches (e.g., Q-former or MLP) focus on the alignment of image-text descriptions yet ignore the visual knowledge-dimension alignment, i.e., connecting visuals to their relevant knowledge. Visual knowledge plays a significant role in analyzing, inferring, and interpreting information from visuals, helping improve the accuracy of answers to knowledge-based visual questions. In this paper, we mainly explore improving LMMs with visual-language knowledge alignment, especially aimed at challenging knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA). To this end, we present a Cognitive Visual-Language Mapper (CVLM), which contains a pretrained Visual Knowledge Aligner (VKA) and a Fine-grained Knowledge Adapter (FKA) used in the multimodal instruction tuning stage. Specifically, we design the VKA based on the interaction between a small language model and a visual encoder, training it on collected image-knowledge pairs to achieve visual knowledge acquisition and projection. FKA is employed to distill the fine-grained visual knowledge of an image and inject it into Large Language Models (LLMs). We conduct extensive experiments on knowledge-based VQA benchmarks and experimental results show that CVLM significantly improves the performance of LMMs on knowledge-based VQA (average gain by 5.0%). Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of VKA and FKA, respectively.

Fine-Grained Modeling of Narrative Context: A Coherence Perspective via Retrospective Questions,"Liyan Xu, Jiangnan Li, Mo Yu, Jie Zhou","This work introduces an original and practical paradigm for narrative comprehension, stemming from the characteristics that individual passages within narratives tend to be more cohesively related than isolated. Complementary to the common end-to-end paradigm, we propose a fine-grained modeling of narrative context, by formulating a graph dubbed NarCo, which explicitly depicts task-agnostic coherence dependencies that are ready to be consumed by various downstream tasks. In particular, edges in NarCo encompass free-form retrospective questions between context snippets, inspired by human cognitive perception that constantly reinstates relevant events from prior context. Importantly, our graph formalism is practically instantiated by LLMs without human annotations, through our designed two-stage prompting scheme. To examine the graph properties and its utility, we conduct three studies in narratives, each from a unique angle: edge relation efficacy, local context enrichment, and broader application in QA. All tasks could benefit from the explicit coherence captured by NarCo.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13551v2,2024-02
Are LLMs Effective Negotiators? Systematic Evaluation of the Multifaceted Capabilities of LLMs in Negotiation Dialogues,"Deuksin Kwon, Emily Weiss, Tara Kulshrestha, Kushal Chawla, Gale M. Lucas, Jonathan Gratch","A successful negotiation requires a range of capabilities, including comprehension of the conversation context, Theory-of-Mind (ToM) skills to infer the partner's motives, strategic reasoning, and effective communication, making it challenging for automated systems. Despite the remarkable performance of LLMs in various NLP tasks, there is no systematic evaluation of their capabilities in negotiation. Such an evaluation is critical for advancing AI negotiation agents and negotiation research, ranging from designing dialogue systems to providing pedagogical feedback and scaling up data collection practices. This work aims to systematically analyze the multifaceted capabilities of LLMs across diverse dialogue scenarios throughout the stages of a typical negotiation interaction. Our analysis highlights GPT-4's superior performance in many tasks while identifying specific challenges, such as making subjective assessments and generating contextually appropriate, strategically advantageous responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13550v2,2024-02
ActiveRAG: Autonomously Knowledge Assimilation and Accommodation through Retrieval-Augmented Agents,"Zhipeng Xu, Zhenghao Liu, Yukun Yan, Shuo Wang, Shi Yu, Zheni Zeng, Chaojun Xiao, Zhiyuan Liu, Ge Yu, Chenyan Xiong","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage external knowledge, enhancing their performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG models often treat LLMs as passive recipients of information, which can lead to interference from noisy retrieved content. In this paper, we introduce ActiveRAG, a multi-agent framework that mimics human learning behavior to help LLMs actively engage with and learn from retrieved evidence. ActiveRAG designs a knowledge assimilation agent to form the knowledge understanding by associating external knowledge with the parametric memory of LLMs. Then our model employs the thought accommodation agent to calibrate the internal thought of LLMs for response refinement. Our experiments show that ActiveRAG achieves a 10\% improvement over vanilla RAG on various question-answering benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that ActiveRAG mitigates the impact of noisy retrievals, alleviates conflicts between external knowledge and parametric memory and improves the self-consistency of LLMs in answering the question.

LLMs Meet Long Video: Advancing Long Video Question Answering with An Interactive Visual Adapter in LLMs,"Yunxin Li, Xinyu Chen, Baotain Hu, Min Zhang","Long video understanding is a significant and ongoing challenge in the intersection of multimedia and artificial intelligence. Employing large language models (LLMs) for comprehending video becomes an emerging and promising method. However, this approach incurs high computational costs due to the extensive array of video tokens, experiences reduced visual clarity as a consequence of token aggregation, and confronts challenges arising from irrelevant visual tokens while answering video-related questions. To alleviate these issues, we present an Interactive Visual Adapter (IVA) within LLMs, designed to enhance interaction with fine-grained visual elements. Specifically, we first transform long videos into temporal video tokens via leveraging a visual encoder alongside a pretrained causal transformer, then feed them into LLMs with the video instructions. Subsequently, we integrated IVA, which contains a lightweight temporal frame selector and a spatial feature interactor, within the internal blocks of LLMs to capture instruction-aware and fine-grained visual signals. Consequently, the proposed video-LLM facilitates a comprehensive understanding of long video content through appropriate long video modeling and precise visual interactions. We conducted extensive experiments on nine video understanding benchmarks and experimental results show that our interactive visual adapter significantly improves the performance of video LLMs on long video QA tasks. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of IVA in understanding long and short video.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13546v2,2024-02
ARL2: Aligning Retrievers for Black-box Large Language Models via Self-guided Adaptive Relevance Labeling,"Lingxi Zhang, Yue Yu, Kuan Wang, Chao Zhang","Retrieval-augmented generation enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating relevant information from external knowledge sources. This enables LLMs to adapt to specific domains and mitigate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing retrievers are often misaligned with LLMs due to their separate training processes and the black-box nature of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose ARL2, a retriever learning technique that harnesses LLMs as labelers. ARL2 leverages LLMs to annotate and score relevant evidence, enabling learning the retriever from robust LLM supervision. Furthermore, ARL2 uses an adaptive self-training strategy for curating high-quality and diverse relevance data, which can effectively reduce the annotation cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ARL2, achieving accuracy improvements of 5.4% on NQ and 4.6% on MMLU compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ARL2 exhibits robust transfer learning capabilities and strong zero-shot generalization abilities.

An Effective Incorporating Heterogeneous Knowledge Curriculum Learning for Sequence Labeling,"Xuemei Tang, Qi Su","Sequence labeling models often benefit from incorporating external knowledge. However, this practice introduces data heterogeneity and complicates the model with additional modules, leading to increased expenses for training a high-performing model. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage curriculum learning (TCL) framework specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks. The TCL framework enhances training by gradually introducing data instances from easy to hard, aiming to improve both performance and training speed. Furthermore, we explore different metrics for assessing the difficulty levels of sequence labeling tasks. Through extensive experimentation on six Chinese word segmentation (CWS) and Part-of-speech tagging (POS) datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in enhancing the performance of sequence labeling models. Additionally, our analysis indicates that TCL accelerates training and alleviates the slow training problem associated with complex models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13534v1,2024-02
FinGPT-HPC: Efficient Pretraining and Finetuning Large Language Models for Financial Applications with High-Performance Computing,"Xiao-Yang Liu, Jie Zhang, Guoxuan Wang, Weiqing Tong, Anwar Walid","Large language models (LLMs) are computationally intensive. The computation workload and the memory footprint grow quadratically with the dimension (layer width). Most of LLMs' parameters come from the linear layers of the transformer structure and are highly redundant. These linear layers contribute more than 80% of the computation workload and 99% of the model size. To pretrain and finetune LLMs efficiently, there are three major challenges to address: 1) reducing redundancy of the linear layers; 2) reducing GPU memory footprint; 3) improving GPU utilization when using distributed training. Prior methods, such as LoRA and QLoRA, utilized low-rank matrices and quantization to reduce the number of trainable parameters and model size, respectively. However, the resulting model still consumes a large amount of GPU memory. In this paper, we present high-performance GPU-based methods that exploit low-rank structures to pretrain and finetune LLMs for financial applications. We replace one conventional linear layer of the transformer structure with two narrower linear layers, which allows us to reduce the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude. By quantizing the parameters into low precision (8-bit and 4-bit), the memory consumption of the resulting model is further reduced. Compared with existing LLMs, our methods achieve a speedup of 1.3X and a model compression ratio of 2.64X for pretaining without accuracy drop. For finetuning, our methods achieve an average accuracy increase of 6.3% and 24.0% in general tasks and financial tasks, respectively, and GPU memory consumption ratio of 6.3X. The sizes of our models are smaller than 0.59 GB, allowing inference on a smartphone.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13533v1,2024-02
Whispers in Grammars: Injecting Covert Backdoors to Compromise Dense Retrieval Systems,"Quanyu Long, Yue Deng, LeiLei Gan, Wenya Wang, Sinno Jialin Pan","Dense retrieval systems have been widely used in various NLP applications. However, their vulnerabilities to potential attacks have been underexplored. This paper investigates a novel attack scenario where the attackers aim to mislead the retrieval system into retrieving the attacker-specified contents. Those contents, injected into the retrieval corpus by attackers, can include harmful text like hate speech or spam. Unlike prior methods that rely on model weights and generate conspicuous, unnatural outputs, we propose a covert backdoor attack triggered by grammar errors. Our approach ensures that the attacked models can function normally for standard queries while covertly triggering the retrieval of the attacker's contents in response to minor linguistic mistakes. Specifically, dense retrievers are trained with contrastive loss and hard negative sampling. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that contrastive loss is notably sensitive to grammatical errors, and hard negative sampling can exacerbate susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Our proposed method achieves a high attack success rate with a minimal corpus poisoning rate of only 0.048%, while preserving normal retrieval performance. This indicates that the method has negligible impact on user experience for error-free queries. Furthermore, evaluations across three real-world defense strategies reveal that the malicious passages embedded within the corpus remain highly resistant to detection and filtering, underscoring the robustness and subtlety of the proposed attack.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13532v2,2024-02

However, detecting social web posts discussing concerns about anticipatory failures is under-explored. If such concerns are channeled to the appropriate authorities, it can aid in the prevention and mitigation of potential infrastructural failures. In this paper, we develop an infrastructure ombudsman -- that automatically detects specific infrastructure concerns. Our work considers several recent structural failures in the US.

OMGEval: An Open Multilingual Generative Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models,"Yang Liu, Meng Xu, Shuo Wang, Liner Yang, Haoyu Wang, Zhenghao Liu, Cunliang Kong, Yun Chen, Yang Liu, Maosong Sun, Erhong Yang","Modern large language models (LLMs) should generally benefit individuals from various cultural backgrounds around the world. However, most recent advanced generative evaluation benchmarks tailed for LLMs mainly focus on English. To this end, we introduce OMGEval, the first Open-source Multilingual Generative test set that can assess the capability of LLMs in different languages. For each language, OMGEval provides 804 open-ended questions, covering a wide range of important capabilities of LLMs, such as general knowledge, logical reasoning, and so on. Each question is rigorously verified by human annotators. Notably, to sufficiently reflect the compatibility of LLMs in different cultural backgrounds, we perform localization for each non-English language. Specifically, the current version of OMGEval includes 5 languages (i.e., Zh, Ru, Fr, Es, Ar). Following AlpacaEval, we employ GPT-4 as the adjudicator to automatically score different model outputs, which is shown closely related to human evaluation. We evaluate several representative multilingual LLMs on the proposed OMGEval, which we believe will provide a valuable reference for the community to further understand and improve the multilingual capability of LLMs. OMGEval is available at https://github.com/blcuicall/OMGEval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13524v1,2024-02
RecMind: Japanese Movie Recommendation Dialogue with Seeker's Internal State,"Takashi Kodama, Hirokazu Kiyomaru, Yin Jou Huang, Sadao Kurohashi","Humans pay careful attention to the interlocutor's internal state in dialogues. For example, in recommendation dialogues, we make recommendations while estimating the seeker's internal state, such as his/her level of knowledge and interest. Since there are no existing annotated resources for the analysis, we constructed RecMind, a Japanese movie recommendation dialogue dataset with annotations of the seeker's internal state at the entity level. Each entity has a subjective label annotated by the seeker and an objective label annotated by the recommender. RecMind also features engaging dialogues with long seeker's utterances, enabling a detailed analysis of the seeker's internal state. Our analysis based on RecMind reveals that entities that the seeker has no knowledge about but has an interest in contribute to recommendation success. We also propose a response generation framework that explicitly considers the seeker's internal state, utilizing the chain-of-thought prompting. The human evaluation results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline method in both consistency and the success of recommendations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13522v1,2024-02
RITFIS: Robust input testing framework for LLMs-based intelligent software,"Mingxuan Xiao, Yan Xiao, Hai Dong, Shunhui Ji, Pengcheng Zhang","The dependence of Natural Language Processing (NLP) intelligent software on Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly prominent, underscoring the necessity for robustness testing. Current testing methods focus solely on the robustness of LLM-based software to prompts. Given the complexity and diversity of real-world inputs, studying the robustness of LLMbased software in handling comprehensive inputs (including prompts and examples) is crucial for a thorough understanding of its performance.   To this end, this paper introduces RITFIS, a Robust Input Testing Framework for LLM-based Intelligent Software. To our knowledge, RITFIS is the first framework designed to assess the robustness of LLM-based intelligent software against natural language inputs. This framework, based on given threat models and prompts, primarily defines the testing process as a combinatorial optimization problem. Successful test cases are determined by a goal function, creating a transformation space for the original examples through perturbation means, and employing a series of search methods to filter cases that meet both the testing objectives and language constraints. RITFIS, with its modular design, offers a comprehensive method for evaluating the robustness of LLMbased intelligent software.   RITFIS adapts 17 automated testing methods, originally designed for Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based intelligent software, to the LLM-based software testing scenario. It demonstrates the effectiveness of RITFIS in evaluating LLM-based intelligent software through empirical validation. However, existing methods generally have limitations, especially when dealing with lengthy texts and structurally complex threat models. Therefore, we conducted a comprehensive analysis based on five metrics and provided insightful testing method optimization strategies, benefiting both researchers and everyday users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13518v1,2024-02
Round Trip Translation Defence against Large Language Model Jailbreaking Attacks,"Canaan Yung, Hadi Mohaghegh Dolatabadi, Sarah Erfani, Christopher Leckie","Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to social-engineered attacks that are human-interpretable but require a high level of comprehension for LLMs to counteract. Existing defensive measures can only mitigate less than half of these attacks at most. To address this issue, we propose the Round Trip Translation (RTT) method, the first algorithm specifically designed to defend against social-engineered attacks on LLMs. RTT paraphrases the adversarial prompt and generalizes the idea conveyed, making it easier for LLMs to detect induced harmful behavior. This method is versatile, lightweight, and transferrable to different LLMs. Our defense successfully mitigated over 70% of Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) attacks, which is currently the most effective defense to the best of our knowledge. We are also the first to attempt mitigating the MathsAttack and reduced its attack success rate by almost 40%.

ProSparse: Introducing and Enhancing Intrinsic Activation Sparsity within Large Language Models,"Chenyang Song, Xu Han, Zhengyan Zhang, Shengding Hu, Xiyu Shi, Kuai Li, Chen Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Guangli Li, Tao Yang, Maosong Sun","Activation sparsity refers to the existence of considerable weakly-contributed elements among activation outputs. As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named ""ProSparse"" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13516v7,2024-02
Self-DC: When to retrieve and When to generate? Self Divide-and-Conquer for Compositional Unknown Questions,"Hongru Wang, Boyang Xue, Baohang Zhou, Tianhua Zhang, Cunxiang Wang, Guanhua Chen, Huimin Wang, Kam-fai Wong","Retrieve-then-read and generate-then-read are two typical solutions to handle unknown and known questions in open-domain question-answering, while the former retrieves necessary external knowledge and the later prompt the large language models to generate internal known knowledge encoded in the parameters. However, few of previous works consider the compositional unknown questions, which consist of several known or unknown sub-questions. Thus, simple binary classification (known or unknown) becomes sub-optimal and inefficient since it will call external retrieval excessively for each compositional unknown question. To this end, we propose the first Compositional unknown Question-Answering dataset (CuQA), and introduce a Self Divide-and-Conquer (Self-DC) framework to empower LLMs to adaptively call different methods on-demand, resulting in better performance and efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets (CuQA and FreshQA) demonstrate that Self-DC can achieve comparable or even better performance with much more less retrieval times compared with several strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13514v1,2024-02
From Self-Attention to Markov Models: Unveiling the Dynamics of Generative Transformers,"M. Emrullah Ildiz, Yixiao Huang, Yingcong Li, Ankit Singh Rawat, Samet Oymak","Modern language models rely on the transformer architecture and attention mechanism to perform language understanding and text generation. In this work, we study learning a 1-layer self-attention model from a set of prompts and associated output data sampled from the model. We first establish a precise mapping between the self-attention mechanism and Markov models: Inputting a prompt to the model samples the output token according to a context-conditioned Markov chain (CCMC) which weights the transition matrix of a base Markov chain. Additionally, incorporating positional encoding results in position-dependent scaling of the transition probabilities. Building on this formalism, we develop identifiability/coverage conditions for the prompt distribution that guarantee consistent estimation and establish sample complexity guarantees under IID samples. Finally, we study the problem of learning from a single output trajectory generated from an initial prompt. We characterize an intriguing winner-takes-all phenomenon where the generative process implemented by self-attention collapses into sampling a limited subset of tokens due to its non-mixing nature. This provides a mathematical explanation to the tendency of modern LLMs to generate repetitive text. In summary, the equivalence to CCMC provides a simple but powerful framework to study self-attention and its properties.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13512v1,2024-02
Evaluation of a semi-autonomous attentive listening system with takeover prompting,"Haruki Kawai, Divesh Lala, Koji Inoue, Keiko Ochi, Tatsuya Kawahara","The handling of communication breakdowns and loss of engagement is an important aspect of spoken dialogue systems, particularly for chatting systems such as attentive listening, where the user is mostly speaking. We presume that a human is best equipped to handle this task and rescue the flow of conversation. To this end, we propose a semi-autonomous system, where a remote operator can take control of an autonomous attentive listening system in real-time. In order to make human intervention easy and consistent, we introduce automatic detection of low interest and engagement to provide explicit takeover prompts to the remote operator. We implement this semi-autonomous system which detects takeover points for the operator and compare it to fully tele-operated and fully autonomous attentive listening systems. We find that the semi-autonomous system is generally perceived more positively than the autonomous system. The results suggest that identifying points of conversation when the user starts to lose interest may help us improve a fully autonomous dialogue system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14863v1,2024-02
Leveraging Translation For Optimal Recall: Tailoring LLM Personalization With User Profiles,"Karthik Ravichandran, Sarmistha Sarna Gomasta","This paper explores a novel technique for improving recall in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) systems using iterative query refinement grounded in the user's lexical-semantic space. The proposed methodology combines multi-level translation, semantic embedding-based expansion, and user profile-centered augmentation to address the challenge of matching variance between user queries and relevant documents. Through an initial BM25 retrieval, translation into intermediate languages, embedding lookup of similar terms, and iterative re-ranking, the technique aims to expand the scope of potentially relevant results personalized to the individual user. Comparative experiments on news and Twitter datasets demonstrate superior performance over baseline BM25 ranking for the proposed approach across ROUGE metrics. The translation methodology also showed maintained semantic accuracy through the multi-step process. This personalized CLIR framework paves the path for improved context-aware retrieval attentive to the nuances of user language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13500v1,2024-02
The Lay Person's Guide to Biomedicine: Orchestrating Large Language Models,"Zheheng Luo, Qianqian Xie, Sophia Ananiadou","Automated lay summarisation (LS) aims to simplify complex technical documents into a more accessible format to non-experts. Existing approaches using pre-trained language models, possibly augmented with external background knowledge, tend to struggle with effective simplification and explanation. Moreover, automated methods that can effectively assess the `layness' of generated summaries are lacking. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity for text simplification, background information generation, and text evaluation. This has motivated our systematic exploration into using LLMs to generate and evaluate lay summaries of biomedical articles. We propose a novel \textit{Explain-then-Summarise} LS framework, which leverages LLMs to generate high-quality background knowledge to improve supervised LS. We also evaluate the performance of LLMs for zero-shot LS and propose two novel LLM-based LS evaluation metrics, which assess layness from multiple perspectives. Finally, we conduct a human assessment of generated lay summaries. Our experiments reveal that LLM-generated background information can support improved supervised LS. Furthermore, our novel zero-shot LS evaluation metric demonstrates a high degree of alignment with human preferences. We conclude that LLMs have an important part to play in improving both the performance and evaluation of LS methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13498v1,2024-02
GradSafe: Detecting Jailbreak Prompts for LLMs via Safety-Critical Gradient Analysis,"Yueqi Xie, Minghong Fang, Renjie Pi, Neil Gong","Large Language Models (LLMs) face threats from jailbreak prompts. Existing methods for detecting jailbreak prompts are primarily online moderation APIs or finetuned LLMs. These strategies, however, often require extensive and resource-intensive data collection and training processes. In this study, we propose GradSafe, which effectively detects jailbreak prompts by scrutinizing the gradients of safety-critical parameters in LLMs. Our method is grounded in a pivotal observation: the gradients of an LLM's loss for jailbreak prompts paired with compliance response exhibit similar patterns on certain safety-critical parameters. In contrast, safe prompts lead to different gradient patterns. Building on this observation, GradSafe analyzes the gradients from prompts (paired with compliance responses) to accurately detect jailbreak prompts. We show that GradSafe, applied to Llama-2 without further training, outperforms Llama Guard, despite its extensive finetuning with a large dataset, in detecting jailbreak prompts. This superior performance is consistent across both zero-shot and adaptation scenarios, as evidenced by our evaluations on ToxicChat and XSTest.

Retrieval Helps or Hurts? A Deeper Dive into the Efficacy of Retrieval Augmentation to Language Models,"Seiji Maekawa, Hayate Iso, Sairam Gurajada, Nikita Bhutani","While large language models (LMs) demonstrate remarkable performance, they encounter challenges in providing accurate responses when queried for information beyond their pre-trained memorization. Although augmenting them with relevant external information can mitigate these issues, failure to consider the necessity of retrieval may adversely affect overall performance. Previous research has primarily focused on examining how entities influence retrieval models and knowledge recall in LMs, leaving other aspects relatively unexplored. In this work, our goal is to offer a more detailed, fact-centric analysis by exploring the effects of combinations of entities and relations. To facilitate this, we construct a new question answering (QA) dataset called WiTQA (Wikipedia Triple Question Answers). This dataset includes questions about entities and relations of various popularity levels, each accompanied by a supporting passage. Our extensive experiments with diverse LMs and retrievers reveal when retrieval does not consistently enhance LMs from the viewpoints of fact-centric popularity. Confirming earlier findings, we observe that larger LMs excel in recalling popular facts. However, they notably encounter difficulty with infrequent entity-relation pairs compared to retrievers. Interestingly, they can effectively retain popular relations of less common entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our finer-grained metric and insights through an adaptive retrieval system that selectively employs retrieval and recall based on the frequencies of entities and relations in the question.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13492v3,2024-02
ProPD: Dynamic Token Tree Pruning and Generation for LLM Parallel Decoding,"Shuzhang Zhong, Zebin Yang, Meng Li, Ruihao Gong, Runsheng Wang, Ru Huang","Recent advancements in generative large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted the performance in natural language processing tasks. However, their efficiency is hampered by the inherent limitations in autoregressive token generation. While parallel decoding with token tree verification, e.g., Medusa, has been proposed to improve decoding parallelism and efficiency, it often struggles with maintaining contextual relationships due to its independent token prediction approach and incurs significant verification overhead, especially with large tree sizes and batch processing. In this paper, we propose ProPD, an efficient LLM parallel decoding framework based on dynamic token tree pruning and generation. ProPD features an advanced early pruning mechanism to efficiently eliminate unpromising token sequences to improve verification efficiency. Additionally, it introduces a dynamic token tree generation algorithm to balance the computation and parallelism of the verification phase in real-time and maximize the overall efficiency across different batch sizes, sequence lengths, and tasks, etc. We verify ProPD across a diverse set of datasets, LLMs, and batch sizes and demonstrate ProPD consistently outperforms existing decoding algorithms by 1.1-3.2x.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13485v1,2024-02
Retrieval-Augmented Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Domain Tasks,"Minju Seo, Jinheon Baek, James Thorne, Sung Ju Hwang","Despite large successes of recent language models on diverse tasks, they suffer from severe performance degeneration in low-resource settings with limited training data available. Many existing works tackle this problem by generating synthetic data from the training data and then training models on them, recently using Large Language Models (LLMs). However, in low-resource settings, the amount of seed data samples to use for data augmentation is very small, which makes generated samples suboptimal and less diverse. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel method that augments training data by incorporating a wealth of examples from other datasets, along with the given training data. Specifically, we first retrieve the relevant instances from other datasets, such as their input-output pairs or contexts, based on their similarities with the given seed data, and then prompt LLMs to generate new samples with the contextual information within and across the original and retrieved samples. This approach can ensure that the generated data is not only relevant but also more diverse than what could be achieved using the limited seed data alone. We validate our proposed Retrieval-Augmented Data Augmentation (RADA) framework on multiple datasets under low-resource settings of training and test-time data augmentation scenarios, on which it outperforms existing LLM-powered data augmentation baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13482v1,2024-02
How Important is Domain Specificity in Language Models and Instruction Finetuning for Biomedical Relation Extraction?,"Aviv Brokman, Ramakanth Kavuluru","Cutting edge techniques developed in the general NLP domain are often subsequently applied to the high-value, data-rich biomedical domain. The past few years have seen generative language models (LMs), instruction finetuning, and few-shot learning become foci of NLP research. As such, generative LMs pretrained on biomedical corpora have proliferated and biomedical instruction finetuning has been attempted as well, all with the hope that domain specificity improves performance on downstream tasks. Given the nontrivial effort in training such models, we investigate what, if any, benefits they have in the key biomedical NLP task of relation extraction. Specifically, we address two questions: (1) Do LMs trained on biomedical corpora outperform those trained on general domain corpora? (2) Do models instruction finetuned on biomedical datasets outperform those finetuned on assorted datasets or those simply pretrained? We tackle these questions using existing LMs, testing across four datasets. In a surprising result, general-domain models typically outperformed biomedical-domain models. However, biomedical instruction finetuning improved performance to a similar degree as general instruction finetuning, despite having orders of magnitude fewer instructions. Our findings suggest it may be more fruitful to focus research effort on larger-scale biomedical instruction finetuning of general LMs over building domain-specific biomedical LMs",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13470v1,2024-02
STENCIL: Submodular Mutual Information Based Weak Supervision for Cold-Start Active Learning,"Nathan Beck, Adithya Iyer, Rishabh Iyer","As supervised fine-tuning of pre-trained models within NLP applications increases in popularity, larger corpora of annotated data are required, especially with increasing parameter counts in large language models. Active learning, which attempts to mine and annotate unlabeled instances to improve model performance maximally fast, is a common choice for reducing the annotation cost; however, most methods typically ignore class imbalance and either assume access to initial annotated data or require multiple rounds of active learning selection before improving rare classes. We present STENCIL, which utilizes a set of text exemplars and the recently proposed submodular mutual information to select a set of weakly labeled rare-class instances that are then strongly labeled by an annotator. We show that STENCIL improves overall accuracy by $10\%-18\%$ and rare-class F-1 score by $17\%-40\%$ on multiple text classification datasets over common active learning methods within the class-imbalanced cold-start setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13468v2,2024-02
RefuteBench: Evaluating Refuting Instruction-Following for Large Language Models,"Jianhao Yan, Yun Luo, Yue Zhang","The application scope of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly expanding. In practical use, users might provide feedback based on the model's output, hoping for a responsive model that can complete responses according to their feedback. Whether the model can appropriately respond to users' refuting feedback and consistently follow through with execution has not been thoroughly analyzed. In light of this, this paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark, RefuteBench, covering tasks such as question answering, machine translation, and email writing. The evaluation aims to assess whether models can positively accept feedback in form of refuting instructions and whether they can consistently adhere to user demands throughout the conversation. We conduct evaluations on numerous LLMs and find that LLMs are stubborn, i.e. exhibit inclination to their internal knowledge, often failing to comply with user feedback. Additionally, as the length of the conversation increases, models gradually forget the user's stated feedback and roll back to their own responses. We further propose a recall-and-repeat prompts as a simple and effective way to enhance the model's responsiveness to feedback.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13463v4,2024-02
Potential and Challenges of Model Editing for Social Debiasing,"Jianhao Yan, Futing Wang, Yafu Li, Yue Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) trained on vast corpora suffer from inevitable stereotype biases. Mitigating these biases with fine-tuning could be both costly and data-hungry. Model editing methods, which focus on modifying LLMs in a post-hoc manner, are of great potential to address debiasing. However, it lacks a comprehensive study that facilitates both internal and external model editing methods, supports various bias types, as well as understands the pros and cons of applying editing methods to stereotypical debiasing. To mitigate this gap, we carefully formulate social debiasing into an editing problem and benchmark seven existing model editing algorithms on stereotypical debiasing, i.e., debias editing. Our findings in three scenarios reveal both the potential and challenges of debias editing: (1) Existing model editing methods can effectively preserve knowledge and mitigate biases, while the generalization of debias effect from edited sentences to semantically equivalent sentences is limited.(2) Sequential editing highlights the robustness of SERAC (Mitchell et al. 2022b), while internal editing methods degenerate with the number of edits. (3) Model editing algorithms achieve generalization towards unseen biases both within the same type and from different types. In light of these findings, we further propose two simple but effective methods to improve debias editing, and experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13462v1,2024-02
Learning to Poison Large Language Models During Instruction Tuning,"Yao Qiang, Xiangyu Zhou, Saleh Zare Zade, Mohammad Amin Roshani, Prashant Khanduri, Douglas Zytko, Dongxiao Zhu","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked significant achievements in language processing and reasoning capabilities. Despite their advancements, LLMs face vulnerabilities to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries insert backdoor triggers into training data to manipulate outputs for malicious purposes. This work further identifies additional security risks in LLMs by designing a new data poisoning attack tailored to exploit the instruction tuning process. We propose a novel gradient-guided backdoor trigger learning (GBTL) algorithm to identify adversarial triggers efficiently, ensuring an evasion of detection by conventional defenses while maintaining content integrity. Through experimental validation across various tasks, including sentiment analysis, domain generation, and question answering, our poisoning strategy demonstrates a high success rate in compromising various LLMs' outputs. We further propose two defense strategies against data poisoning attacks, including in-context learning (ICL) and continuous learning (CL), which effectively rectify the behavior of LLMs and significantly reduce the decline in performance. Our work highlights the significant security risks present during the instruction tuning of LLMs and emphasizes the necessity of safeguarding LLMs against data poisoning attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13459v2,2024-02
LocalTweets to LocalHealth: A Mental Health Surveillance Framework Based on Twitter Data,"Vijeta Deshpande, Minhwa Lee, Zonghai Yao, Zihao Zhang, Jason Brian Gibbons, Hong Yu","Prior research on Twitter (now X) data has provided positive evidence of its utility in developing supplementary health surveillance systems. In this study, we present a new framework to surveil public health, focusing on mental health (MH) outcomes. We hypothesize that locally posted tweets are indicative of local MH outcomes and collect tweets posted from 765 neighborhoods (census block groups) in the USA. We pair these tweets from each neighborhood with the corresponding MH outcome reported by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to create a benchmark dataset, LocalTweets. With LocalTweets, we present the first population-level evaluation task for Twitter-based MH surveillance systems. We then develop an efficient and effective method, LocalHealth, for predicting MH outcomes based on LocalTweets. When used with GPT3.5, LocalHealth achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.7429 and 79.78\%, respectively, a 59\% improvement in F1-score over the GPT3.5 in zero-shot setting. We also utilize LocalHealth to extrapolate CDC's estimates to proxy unreported neighborhoods, achieving an F1-score of 0.7291. Our work suggests that Twitter data can be effectively leveraged to simulate neighborhood-level MH outcomes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13452v2,2024-02
CAMELoT: Towards Large Language Models with Training-Free Consolidated Associative Memory,"Zexue He, Leonid Karlinsky, Donghyun Kim, Julian McAuley, Dmitry Krotov, Rogerio Feris","Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to handle long input sequences due to high memory and runtime costs. Memory-augmented models have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, but current methods are hindered by limited memory capacity and require costly re-training to integrate with a new LLM. In this work, we introduce an associative memory module which can be coupled to any pre-trained (frozen) attention-based LLM without re-training, enabling it to handle arbitrarily long input sequences. Unlike previous methods, our associative memory module consolidates representations of individual tokens into a non-parametric distribution model, dynamically managed by properly balancing the novelty and recency of the incoming data. By retrieving information from this consolidated associative memory, the base LLM can achieve significant (up to 29.7% on Arxiv) perplexity reduction in long-context modeling compared to other baselines evaluated on standard benchmarks. This architecture, which we call CAMELoT (Consolidated Associative Memory Enhanced Long Transformer), demonstrates superior performance even with a tiny context window of 128 tokens, and also enables improved in-context learning with a much larger set of demonstrations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13449v1,2024-02
Ranking Large Language Models without Ground Truth,"Amit Dhurandhar, Rahul Nair, Moninder Singh, Elizabeth Daly, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy","Evaluation and ranking of large language models (LLMs) has become an important problem with the proliferation of these models and their impact. Evaluation methods either require human responses which are expensive to acquire or use pairs of LLMs to evaluate each other which can be unreliable. In this paper, we provide a novel perspective where, given a dataset of prompts (viz. questions, instructions, etc.) and a set of LLMs, we rank them without access to any ground truth or reference responses. Inspired by real life where both an expert and a knowledgeable person can identify a novice our main idea is to consider triplets of models, where each one of them evaluates the other two, correctly identifying the worst model in the triplet with high probability. We also analyze our idea and provide sufficient conditions for it to succeed. Applying this idea repeatedly, we propose two methods to rank LLMs. In experiments on different generative tasks (summarization, multiple-choice, and dialog), our methods reliably recover close to true rankings without reference data. This points to a viable low-resource mechanism for practical use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14860v4,2024-02
ED-Copilot: Reduce Emergency Department Wait Time with Language Model Diagnostic Assistance,"Liwen Sun, Abhineet Agarwal, Aaron Kornblith, Bin Yu, Chenyan Xiong","In the emergency department (ED), patients undergo triage and multiple laboratory tests before diagnosis. This time-consuming process causes ED crowding which impacts patient mortality, medical errors, staff burnout, etc. This work proposes (time) cost-effective diagnostic assistance that leverages artificial intelligence systems to help ED clinicians make efficient and accurate diagnoses. In collaboration with ED clinicians, we use public patient data to curate MIMIC-ED-Assist, a benchmark for AI systems to suggest laboratory tests that minimize wait time while accurately predicting critical outcomes such as death. With MIMIC-ED-Assist, we develop ED-Copilot which sequentially suggests patient-specific laboratory tests and makes diagnostic predictions. ED-Copilot employs a pre-trained bio-medical language model to encode patient information and uses reinforcement learning to minimize ED wait time and maximize prediction accuracy. On MIMIC-ED-Assist, ED-Copilot improves prediction accuracy over baselines while halving average wait time from four hours to two hours. ED-Copilot can also effectively personalize treatment recommendations based on patient severity, further highlighting its potential as a diagnostic assistant. Since MIMIC-ED-Assist is a retrospective benchmark, ED-Copilot is restricted to recommend only observed tests. We show ED-Copilot achieves competitive performance without this restriction as the maximum allowed time increases. Our code is available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/ED-Copilot.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13448v2,2024-02
Large Language Models for Data Annotation and Synthesis: A Survey,"Zhen Tan, Dawei Li, Song Wang, Alimohammad Beigi, Bohan Jiang, Amrita Bhattacharjee, Mansooreh Karami, Jundong Li, Lu Cheng, Huan Liu","Data annotation and synthesis generally refers to the labeling or generating of raw data with relevant information, which could be used for improving the efficacy of machine learning models. The process, however, is labor-intensive and costly. The emergence of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by GPT-4, presents an unprecedented opportunity to automate the complicated process of data annotation and synthesis. While existing surveys have extensively covered LLM architecture, training, and general applications, we uniquely focus on their specific utility for data annotation. This survey contributes to three core aspects: LLM-Based Annotation Generation, LLM-Generated Annotations Assessment, and LLM-Generated Annotations Utilization. Furthermore, this survey includes an in-depth taxonomy of data types that LLMs can annotate, a comprehensive review of learning strategies for models utilizing LLM-generated annotations, and a detailed discussion of the primary challenges and limitations associated with using LLMs for data annotation and synthesis. Serving as a key guide, this survey aims to assist researchers and practitioners in exploring the potential of the latest LLMs for data annotation, thereby fostering future advancements in this critical field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13446v3,2024-02
Structured Tree Alignment for Evaluation of (Speech) Constituency Parsing,"Freda Shi, Kevin Gimpel, Karen Livescu","We present the structured average intersection-over-union ratio (STRUCT-IOU), a similarity metric between constituency parse trees motivated by the problem of evaluating speech parsers. STRUCT-IOU enables comparison between a constituency parse tree (over automatically recognized spoken word boundaries) with the ground-truth parse (over written words). To compute the metric, we project the ground-truth parse tree to the speech domain by forced alignment, align the projected ground-truth constituents with the predicted ones under certain structured constraints, and calculate the average IOU score across all aligned constituent pairs. STRUCT-IOU takes word boundaries into account and overcomes the challenge that the predicted words and ground truth may not have perfect one-to-one correspondence. Extending to the evaluation of text constituency parsing, we demonstrate that STRUCT-IOU can address token-mismatch issues, and shows higher tolerance to syntactically plausible parses than PARSEVAL (Black et al., 1991).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13433v2,2024-02
DrBenchmark: A Large Language Understanding Evaluation Benchmark for French Biomedical Domain,"Yanis Labrak, Adrien Bazoge, Oumaima El Khettari, Mickael Rouvier, Pacome Constant dit Beaufils, Natalia Grabar, Beatrice Daille, Solen Quiniou, Emmanuel Morin, Pierre-Antoine Gourraud, Richard Dufour","The biomedical domain has sparked a significant interest in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has seen substantial advancements with pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, comparing these models has proven challenging due to variations in evaluation protocols across different models. A fair solution is to aggregate diverse downstream tasks into a benchmark, allowing for the assessment of intrinsic PLMs qualities from various perspectives. Although still limited to few languages, this initiative has been undertaken in the biomedical field, notably English and Chinese. This limitation hampers the evaluation of the latest French biomedical models, as they are either assessed on a minimal number of tasks with non-standardized protocols or evaluated using general downstream tasks. To bridge this research gap and account for the unique sensitivities of French, we present the first-ever publicly available French biomedical language understanding benchmark called DrBenchmark. It encompasses 20 diversified tasks, including named-entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, question-answering, semantic textual similarity, and classification. We evaluate 8 state-of-the-art pre-trained masked language models (MLMs) on general and biomedical-specific data, as well as English specific MLMs to assess their cross-lingual capabilities.

Explaining Relationships Among Research Papers,"Xiangci Li, Jessica Ouyang","Due to the rapid pace of research publications, keeping up to date with all the latest related papers is very time-consuming, even with daily feed tools. There is a need for automatically generated, short, customized literature reviews of sets of papers to help researchers decide what to read. While several works in the last decade have addressed the task of explaining a single research paper, usually in the context of another paper citing it, the relationship among multiple papers has been ignored; prior works have focused on generating a single citation sentence in isolation, without addressing the expository and transition sentences needed to connect multiple papers in a coherent story. In this work, we explore a feature-based, LLM-prompting approach to generate richer citation texts, as well as generating multiple citations at once to capture the complex relationships among research papers. We perform an expert evaluation to investigate the impact of our proposed features on the quality of the generated paragraphs and find a strong correlation between human preference and integrative writing style, suggesting that humans prefer high-level, abstract citations, with transition sentences between them to provide an overall story.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13426v1,2024-02
Structure Guided Prompt: Instructing Large Language Model in Multi-Step Reasoning by Exploring Graph Structure of the Text,"Kewei Cheng, Nesreen K. Ahmed, Theodore Willke, Yizhou Sun","Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at addressing straightforward reasoning tasks, they frequently struggle with difficulties when confronted by more complex multi-step reasoning due to a range of factors. Firstly, natural language often encompasses complex relationships among entities, making it challenging to maintain a clear reasoning chain over longer spans. Secondly, the abundance of linguistic diversity means that the same entities and relationships can be expressed using different terminologies and structures, complicating the task of identifying and establishing connections between multiple pieces of information. Graphs provide an effective solution to represent data rich in relational information and capture long-term dependencies among entities. To harness the potential of graphs, our paper introduces Structure Guided Prompt, an innovative three-stage task-agnostic prompting framework designed to improve the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a zero-shot setting. This framework explicitly converts unstructured text into a graph via LLMs and instructs them to navigate this graph using task-specific strategies to formulate responses. By effectively organizing information and guiding navigation, it enables LLMs to provide more accurate and context-aware responses. Our experiments show that this framework significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling them to excel in a broader spectrum of natural language scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13415v1,2024-02
Harnessing Large Language Models as Post-hoc Correctors,"Zhiqiang Zhong, Kuangyu Zhou, Davide Mottin","As Machine Learning (ML) models grow in size and demand higher-quality training data, the expenses associated with re-training and fine-tuning these models are escalating rapidly. Inspired by recent impressive achievements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in different fields, this paper delves into the question: can LLMs efficiently improve an ML's performance at a minimal cost? We show that, through our proposed training-free framework LlmCorr, an LLM can work as a post-hoc corrector to propose corrections for the predictions of an arbitrary ML model. In particular, we form a contextual knowledge database by incorporating the dataset's label information and the ML model's predictions on the validation dataset. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of LLMs, we ask the LLM to summarise the instances in which the ML model makes mistakes and the correlation between primary predictions and true labels. Following this, the LLM can transfer its acquired knowledge to suggest corrections for the ML model's predictions. Our experimental results on text analysis and the challenging molecular predictions show that \model improves the performance of a number of models by up to 39%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13414v2,2024-02
Healthcare Copilot: Eliciting the Power of General LLMs for Medical Consultation,"Zhiyao Ren, Yibing Zhan, Baosheng Yu, Liang Ding, Dacheng Tao","The copilot framework, which aims to enhance and tailor large language models (LLMs) for specific complex tasks without requiring fine-tuning, is gaining increasing attention from the community. In this paper, we introduce the construction of a Healthcare Copilot designed for medical consultation. The proposed Healthcare Copilot comprises three main components: 1) the Dialogue component, responsible for effective and safe patient interactions; 2) the Memory component, storing both current conversation data and historical patient information; and 3) the Processing component, summarizing the entire dialogue and generating reports. To evaluate the proposed Healthcare Copilot, we implement an auto-evaluation scheme using ChatGPT for two roles: as a virtual patient engaging in dialogue with the copilot, and as an evaluator to assess the quality of the dialogue. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed Healthcare Copilot significantly enhances the capabilities of general LLMs for medical consultations in terms of inquiry capability, conversational fluency, response accuracy, and safety. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of each individual module in the Healthcare Copilot. Code will be made publicly available on GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13408v1,2024-02
A Unified Taxonomy-Guided Instruction Tuning Framework for Entity Set Expansion and Taxonomy Expansion,"Yanzhen Shen, Yu Zhang, Yunyi Zhang, Jiawei Han","Entity set expansion, taxonomy expansion, and seed-guided taxonomy construction are three representative tasks that can be applied to automatically populate an existing taxonomy with emerging concepts. Previous studies view them as three separate tasks. Therefore, their proposed techniques usually work for one specific task only, lacking generalizability and a holistic perspective. In this paper, we aim at a unified solution to the three tasks. To be specific, we identify two common skills needed for entity set expansion, taxonomy expansion, and seed-guided taxonomy construction: finding ""siblings"" and finding ""parents"". We propose a taxonomy-guided instruction tuning framework to teach a large language model to generate siblings and parents for query entities, where the joint pre-training process facilitates the mutual enhancement of the two skills. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed TaxoInstruct framework, which outperforms task-specific baselines across all three tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13405v4,2024-02
Reliable LLM-based User Simulator for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems,"Ivan Sekulić, Silvia Terragni, Victor Guimarães, Nghia Khau, Bruna Guedes, Modestas Filipavicius, André Ferreira Manso, Roland Mathis","In the realm of dialogue systems, user simulation techniques have emerged as a game-changer, redefining the evaluation and enhancement of task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. These methods are crucial for replicating real user interactions, enabling applications like synthetic data augmentation, error detection, and robust evaluation. However, existing approaches often rely on rigid rule-based methods or on annotated data. This paper introduces DAUS, a Domain-Aware User Simulator. Leveraging large language models, we fine-tune DAUS on real examples of task-oriented dialogues. Results on two relevant benchmarks showcase significant improvements in terms of user goal fulfillment.

EvoGrad: A Dynamic Take on the Winograd Schema Challenge with Human Adversaries,"Jing Han Sun, Ali Emami","While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a coreference resolution task testing common-sense reasoning through pronoun disambiguation, they struggle with instances that feature minor alterations or rewording. To address this, we introduce EvoGrad, an open-source platform that harnesses a human-in-the-loop approach to create a dynamic dataset tailored to such altered WSC instances. Leveraging ChatGPT's capabilities, we expand our task instances from 182 to 3,691, setting a new benchmark for diverse common-sense reasoning datasets. Additionally, we introduce the error depth metric, assessing model stability in dynamic tasks. Our results emphasize the challenge posed by EvoGrad: Even the best performing LLM, GPT-3.5, achieves an accuracy of 65.0% with an average error depth of 7.2, a stark contrast to human performance of 92. 8% accuracy without perturbation errors.

ChatEL: Entity Linking with Chatbots,"Yifan Ding, Qingkai Zeng, Tim Weninger","Entity Linking (EL) is an essential and challenging task in natural language processing that seeks to link some text representing an entity within a document or sentence with its corresponding entry in a dictionary or knowledge base. Most existing approaches focus on creating elaborate contextual models that look for clues the words surrounding the entity-text to help solve the linking problem. Although these fine-tuned language models tend to work, they can be unwieldy, difficult to train, and do not transfer well to other domains. Fortunately, Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT provide a highly-advanced solution to the problems inherent in EL models, but simply naive prompts to LLMs do not work well. In the present work, we define ChatEL, which is a three-step framework to prompt LLMs to return accurate results. Overall the ChatEL framework improves the average F1 performance across 10 datasets by more than 2%. Finally, a thorough error analysis shows many instances with the ground truth labels were actually incorrect, and the labels predicted by ChatEL were actually correct. This indicates that the quantitative results presented in this paper may be a conservative estimate of the actual performance.

A Simple but Effective Approach to Improve Structured Language Model Output for Information Extraction,"Yinghao Li, Rampi Ramprasad, Chao Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in generating unstructured natural language according to instructions. However, their performance can be inconsistent when tasked with producing text that adheres to specific structured formats, which is crucial in applications like named entity recognition (NER) or relation extraction (RE). To address this issue, this paper introduces an efficient method, G&O, to enhance their structured text generation capabilities. It breaks the generation into a two-step pipeline: initially, LLMs generate answers in natural language as intermediate responses. Subsequently, LLMs are asked to organize the output into the desired structure, using the intermediate responses as context. G&O effectively separates the generation of content from the structuring process, reducing the pressure of completing two orthogonal tasks simultaneously. Tested on zero-shot NER and RE, the results indicate a significant improvement in LLM performance with minimal additional efforts. This straightforward and adaptable prompting technique can also be combined with other strategies, like self-consistency, to further elevate LLM capabilities in various structured text generation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13364v1,2024-02

CounterCurate: Enhancing Physical and Semantic Visio-Linguistic Compositional Reasoning via Counterfactual Examples,"Jianrui Zhang, Mu Cai, Tengyang Xie, Yong Jae Lee","We propose CounterCurate, a framework to comprehensively improve the visio-linguistic compositional reasoning capability for both contrastive and generative multimodal models. In particular, we identify two critical under-explored problems: the neglect of the physically grounded reasoning (counting and position understanding) and the potential of using highly capable text and image generation models for semantic counterfactual fine-tuning. Our work pioneers an approach that addresses these gaps. We first spotlight the near-chance performance of multimodal models like CLIP and LLaVA in physically grounded compositional reasoning. We then apply simple data augmentation using grounded image generation model GLIGEN to generate fine-tuning data, resulting in significant performance improvements: +33% and +37% for CLIP and LLaVA, respectively, on our newly curated Flickr30k-Positions benchmark. Moreover, we exploit the capabilities of high-performing text generation and image generation models, specifically GPT-4V and DALLE-3, to curate challenging semantic counterfactuals, thereby further enhancing compositional reasoning capabilities on benchmarks such as SugarCrepe, where CounterCurate outperforms GPT-4V.

We ask whether these advances carry over to other text summarization domains. We propose a new evaluation benchmark on topic-focused dialogue summarization, generated by LLMs of varying sizes. We provide binary sentence-level human annotations of the factual consistency of these summaries along with detailed explanations of factually inconsistent sentences. Our analysis shows that existing LLMs hallucinate significant amounts of factual errors in the dialogue domain, regardless of the model's size. On the other hand, when LLMs, including GPT-4, serve as binary factual evaluators, they perform poorly and can be outperformed by prevailing state-of-the-art specialized factuality evaluation metrics. Finally, we conducted an analysis of hallucination types with a curated error taxonomy.

Exploring the Frontier of Vision-Language Models: A Survey of Current Methodologies and Future Directions,"Akash Ghosh, Arkadeep Acharya, Sriparna Saha, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components.

We demonstrate a semantic search framework that achieves a comprehensive semantic understanding of the entire notebook's contents, enabling it to effectively handle various types of user queries. Key components of this framework include:   1). A data preprocessor is designed to handle diverse types of cells within Jupyter Notebooks, encompassing both markdown and code cells. 2). An innovative methodology is devised to address token size limitations that arise with code-type cells. We implement a finer-grained approach to data input, transitioning from the cell level to the function level, effectively resolving these issues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13234v1,2024-02
Investigating Cultural Alignment of Large Language Models,"Badr AlKhamissi, Muhammad ElNokrashy, Mai AlKhamissi, Mona Diab","The intricate relationship between language and culture has long been a subject of exploration within the realm of linguistic anthropology. Large Language Models (LLMs), promoted as repositories of collective human knowledge, raise a pivotal question: do these models genuinely encapsulate the diverse knowledge adopted by different cultures? Our study reveals that these models demonstrate greater cultural alignment along two dimensions -- firstly, when prompted with the dominant language of a specific culture, and secondly, when pretrained with a refined mixture of languages employed by that culture. We quantify cultural alignment by simulating sociological surveys, comparing model responses to those of actual survey participants as references. Specifically, we replicate a survey conducted in various regions of Egypt and the United States through prompting LLMs with different pretraining data mixtures in both Arabic and English with the personas of the real respondents and the survey questions. Further analysis reveals that misalignment becomes more pronounced for underrepresented personas and for culturally sensitive topics, such as those probing social values. Finally, we introduce Anthropological Prompting, a novel method leveraging anthropological reasoning to enhance cultural alignment. Our study emphasizes the necessity for a more balanced multilingual pretraining dataset to better represent the diversity of human experience and the plurality of different cultures with many implications on the topic of cross-lingual transfer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13231v2,2024-02
Smaug: Fixing Failure Modes of Preference Optimisation with DPO-Positive,"Arka Pal, Deep Karkhanis, Samuel Dooley, Manley Roberts, Siddartha Naidu, Colin White","Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) is effective at significantly improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks such as reasoning, summarisation, and alignment. Using pairs of preferred and dispreferred data, DPO models the relative probability of picking one response over another. In this work, first we show theoretically that the standard DPO loss can lead to a reduction of the model's likelihood of the preferred examples, as long as the relative probability between the preferred and dispreferred classes increases. We then show empirically that this phenomenon occurs when fine-tuning LLMs on common datasets, especially datasets in which the edit distance between pairs of completions is low. Using these insights, we design DPO-Positive (DPOP), a new loss function and training procedure which avoids this failure mode. Surprisingly, we find that DPOP outperforms DPO and other fine-tuning procedures across a wide variety of datasets and downstream tasks, including datasets with high edit distances between completions. Furthermore, we find that the DPOP-tuned model outperforms the DPO-tuned model (all else equal) on benchmarks independent of the fine-tuning data, such as MT-Bench. Finally, using DPOP, we create and open-source Smaug-34B and Smaug-72B, with the latter becoming the first open-source LLM to surpass an average accuracy of 80% on the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13228v2,2024-02
AgentMD: Empowering Language Agents for Risk Prediction with Large-Scale Clinical Tool Learning,"Qiao Jin, Zhizheng Wang, Yifan Yang, Qingqing Zhu, Donald Wright, Thomas Huang, W John Wilbur, Zhe He, Andrew Taylor, Qingyu Chen, Zhiyong Lu","Clinical calculators play a vital role in healthcare by offering accurate evidence-based predictions for various purposes such as prognosis. Nevertheless, their widespread utilization is frequently hindered by usability challenges, poor dissemination, and restricted functionality. Augmenting large language models with extensive collections of clinical calculators presents an opportunity to overcome these obstacles and improve workflow efficiency, but the scalability of the manual curation process poses a significant challenge. In response, we introduce AgentMD, a novel language agent capable of curating and applying clinical calculators across various clinical contexts. Using the published literature, AgentMD has automatically curated a collection of 2,164 diverse clinical calculators with executable functions and structured documentation, collectively named RiskCalcs. Manual evaluations show that RiskCalcs tools achieve an accuracy of over 80% on three quality metrics. At inference time, AgentMD can automatically select and apply the relevant RiskCalcs tools given any patient description. On the newly established RiskQA benchmark, AgentMD significantly outperforms chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4 (87.7% vs. 40.9% in accuracy). Additionally, we also applied AgentMD to real-world clinical notes for analyzing both population-level and risk-level patient characteristics. In summary, our study illustrates the utility of language agents augmented with clinical calculators for healthcare analytics and patient care.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13225v1,2024-02
RoCode: A Dataset for Measuring Code Intelligence from Problem Definitions in Romanian,"Adrian Cosma, Bogdan Iordache, Paolo Rosso","Recently, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and have become capable of solving a plethora of tasks through proper instructions in natural language. However, the vast majority of testing suites assume that the instructions are written in English, the de facto prompting language. Code intelligence and problem solving still remain a difficult task, even for the most advanced LLMs. Currently, there are no datasets to measure the generalization power for code-generation models in a language other than English. In this work, we present RoCode, a competitive programming dataset, consisting of 2,642 problems written in Romanian, 11k solutions in C, C++ and Python and comprehensive testing suites for each problem. The purpose of RoCode is to provide a benchmark for evaluating the code intelligence of language models trained on Romanian / multilingual text as well as a fine-tuning set for pretrained Romanian models. Through our results and review of related works, we argue for the need to develop code models for languages other than English.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13222v1,2024-02
How Easy is It to Fool Your Multimodal LLMs? An Empirical Analysis on Deceptive Prompts,"Yusu Qian, Haotian Zhang, Yinfei Yang, Zhe Gan","The remarkable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have not rendered them immune to challenges, particularly in the context of handling deceptive information in prompts, thus producing hallucinated responses under such conditions. To quantitatively assess this vulnerability, we present MAD-Bench, a carefully curated benchmark that contains 1000 test samples divided into 5 categories, such as non-existent objects, count of objects, and spatial relationship. We provide a comprehensive analysis of popular MLLMs, ranging from GPT-4v, Reka, Gemini-Pro, to open-sourced models, such as LLaVA-NeXT and MiniCPM-Llama3. Empirically, we observe significant performance gaps between GPT-4o and other models; and previous robust instruction-tuned models are not effective on this new benchmark. While GPT-4o achieves 82.82% accuracy on MAD-Bench, the accuracy of any other model in our experiments ranges from 9% to 50%. We further propose a remedy that adds an additional paragraph to the deceptive prompts to encourage models to think twice before answering the question. Surprisingly, this simple method can even double the accuracy; however, the absolute numbers are still too low to be satisfactory. We hope MAD-Bench can serve as a valuable benchmark to stimulate further research to enhance model resilience against deceptive prompts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13220v2,2024-02
Probabilities of Chat LLMs Are Miscalibrated but Still Predict Correctness on Multiple-Choice Q&A,"Benjamin Plaut, Nguyen X. Khanh, Tu Trinh","We study 14 large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for chat and find that their maximum softmax probabilities (MSPs) are consistently miscalibrated on multiple-choice Q&A. However, those MSPs might still encode useful uncertainty information. Specifically, we hypothesized that wrong answers would be associated with smaller MSPs compared to correct answers. Via rigororous statistical testing, we show that this hypothesis holds for models which perform well on the underlying Q&A task. We also find a strong direction correlation between Q&A accuracy and MSP correctness prediction, while finding no correlation between Q&A accuracy and calibration error. This suggests that within the current fine-tuning paradigm, we can expect correctness prediction but not calibration to improve as LLM capabilities progress. To demonstrate the utility of correctness prediction, we show that when models have the option to abstain, performance can be improved by selectively abstaining based on the MSP of the initial model response, using only a small amount of labeled data to choose the MSP threshold.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13213v2,2024-02
Soft Self-Consistency Improves Language Model Agents,"Han Wang, Archiki Prasad, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal","Generations from large language models (LLMs) can be improved by sampling and scoring multiple solutions to select a final answer. Current ""sample and select"" methods such as self-consistency (SC) rely on majority voting to score answers. However, when tasks have many distinct and valid answers, selection by voting requires a large number of samples. This makes SC prohibitively expensive for interactive tasks that involve generating multiple actions (answers) sequentially. After establishing that majority voting fails to provide consistent gains on such tasks, we demonstrate how to increase success rates by softening the scoring criterion. We introduce Soft Self-Consistency (SOFT-SC), which replaces SC's discontinuous scoring with a continuous score computed from model likelihoods, allowing for selection even when actions are sparsely distributed. SOFT-SC improves both performance and efficiency on long-horizon interactive tasks, requiring half as many samples as SC for comparable or better performance. For a fixed number of samples, SOFT-SC leads to a 1.3% increase over SC in absolute success rate on writing bash programs, a 6.6% increase on online shopping (WebShop), and a 4.7% increase for an interactive household game (ALFWorld). Finally, we show that SOFT-SC can be applied to both open-source and black-box models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13212v2,2024-02
Can Large Language Models be Good Emotional Supporter? Mitigating Preference Bias on Emotional Support Conversation,"Dongjin Kang, Sunghwan Kim, Taeyoon Kwon, Seungjun Moon, Hyunsouk Cho, Youngjae Yu, Dongha Lee, Jinyoung Yeo","Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) is a task aimed at alleviating individuals' emotional distress through daily conversation. Given its inherent complexity and non-intuitive nature, ESConv dataset incorporates support strategies to facilitate the generation of appropriate responses. Recently, despite the remarkable conversational ability of large language models (LLMs), previous studies have suggested that they often struggle with providing useful emotional support. Hence, this work initially analyzes the results of LLMs on ESConv, revealing challenges in selecting the correct strategy and a notable preference for a specific strategy. Motivated by these, we explore the impact of the inherent preference in LLMs on providing emotional support, and consequently, we observe that exhibiting high preference for specific strategies hinders effective emotional support, aggravating its robustness in predicting the appropriate strategy. Moreover, we conduct a methodological study to offer insights into the necessary approaches for LLMs to serve as proficient emotional supporters. Our findings emphasize that (1) low preference for specific strategies hinders the progress of emotional support, (2) external assistance helps reduce preference bias, and (3) existing LLMs alone cannot become good emotional supporters. These insights suggest promising avenues for future research to enhance the emotional intelligence of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13211v2,2024-02
How do Hyenas deal with Human Speech? Speech Recognition and Translation with ConfHyena,"Marco Gaido, Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, Luisa Bentivogli","The attention mechanism, a cornerstone of state-of-the-art neural models, faces computational hurdles in processing long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Consequently, research efforts in the last few years focused on finding more efficient alternatives. Among them, Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) stands out for achieving competitive results in both language modeling and image classification, while offering sub-quadratic memory and computational complexity. Building on these promising results, we propose ConfHyena, a Conformer whose encoder self-attentions are replaced with an adaptation of Hyena for speech processing, where the long input sequences cause high computational costs. Through experiments in automatic speech recognition (for English) and translation (from English into 8 target languages), we show that our best ConfHyena model significantly reduces the training time by 27%, at the cost of minimal quality degradation (~1%), which, in most cases, is not statistically significant.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13208v1,2024-02
Question Calibration and Multi-Hop Modeling for Temporal Question Answering,"Chao Xue, Di Liang, Pengfei Wang, Jing Zhang","Many models that leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in question answering (QA) tasks. In the real world, many facts contained in KGs are time-constrained thus temporal KGQA has received increasing attention. Despite the fruitful efforts of previous models in temporal KGQA, they still have several limitations. (I) They adopt pre-trained language models (PLMs) to obtain question representations, while PLMs tend to focus on entity information and ignore entity transfer caused by temporal constraints, and finally fail to learn specific temporal representations of entities. (II) They neither emphasize the graph structure between entities nor explicitly model the multi-hop relationship in the graph, which will make it difficult to solve complex multi-hop question answering. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Question Calibration and Multi-Hop Modeling (QC-MHM) approach. Specifically, We first calibrate the question representation by fusing the question and the time-constrained concepts in KG. Then, we construct the GNN layer to complete multi-hop message passing. Finally, the question representation is combined with the embedding output by the GNN to generate the final prediction. Empirical results verify that the proposed model achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the benchmark dataset. Notably, the Hits@1 and Hits@10 results of QC-MHM on the CronQuestions dataset's complex questions are absolutely improved by 5.1% and 1.2% compared to the best-performing baseline. Moreover, QC-MHM can generate interpretable and trustworthy predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13188v1,2024-02
What if LLMs Have Different World Views: Simulating Alien Civilizations with LLM-based Agents,"Zhaoqian Xue, Mingyu Jin, Beichen Wang, Suiyuan Zhu, Kai Mei, Hua Tang, Wenyue Hua, Mengnan Du, Yongfeng Zhang","This study introduces ""CosmoAgent,"" an innovative artificial intelligence system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate complex interactions between human and extraterrestrial civilizations. This paper introduces a mathematical model for quantifying the levels of civilization development and further employs a state transition matrix approach to evaluate their trajectories. Through this methodology, our study quantitatively analyzes the growth trajectories of civilizations, providing insights into future decision-making at critical points of growth and saturation. Furthermore, this paper acknowledges the vast diversity of potential living conditions across the universe, which could foster unique cosmologies, ethical codes, and worldviews among different civilizations. Recognizing the Earth-centric bias inherent in current LLM designs, we propose the novel concept of using LLM agents with diverse ethical paradigms and simulating interactions between entities with distinct moral principles. This innovative research not only introduces a novel method for comprehending potential inter-civilizational dynamics but also holds practical value in enabling entities with divergent value systems to strategize, prevent conflicts, and engage in games under conditions of asymmetric information.

Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Medicine,"Guangzhi Xiong, Qiao Jin, Zhiyong Lu, Aidong Zhang","While large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of medical question answering (QA) tasks, they still face challenges with hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising solution and has been widely adopted. However, a RAG system can involve multiple flexible components, and there is a lack of best practices regarding the optimal RAG setting for various medical purposes. To systematically evaluate such systems, we propose the Medical Information Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (MIRAGE), a first-of-its-kind benchmark including 7,663 questions from five medical QA datasets. Using MIRAGE, we conducted large-scale experiments with over 1.8 trillion prompt tokens on 41 combinations of different corpora, retrievers, and backbone LLMs through the MedRAG toolkit introduced in this work. Overall, MedRAG improves the accuracy of six different LLMs by up to 18% over chain-of-thought prompting, elevating the performance of GPT-3.5 and Mixtral to GPT-4-level. Our results show that the combination of various medical corpora and retrievers achieves the best performance. In addition, we discovered a log-linear scaling property and the ""lost-in-the-middle"" effects in medical RAG. We believe our comprehensive evaluations can serve as practical guidelines for implementing RAG systems for medicine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13178v2,2024-02
Is the System Message Really Important to Jailbreaks in Large Language Models?,"Xiaotian Zou, Yongkang Chen, Ke Li","The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has rendered them indispensable in modern society. While security measures are typically to align LLMs with human values prior to release, recent studies have unveiled a concerning phenomenon named ""Jailbreak"". This term refers to the unexpected and potentially harmful responses generated by LLMs when prompted with malicious questions. Most existing research focus on generating jailbreak prompts but system message configurations vary significantly in experiments. In this paper, we aim to answer a question: Is the system message really important for jailbreaks in LLMs? We conduct experiments in mainstream LLMs to generate jailbreak prompts with varying system messages: short, long, and none. We discover that different system messages have distinct resistances to jailbreaks. Therefore, we explore the transferability of jailbreaks across LLMs with different system messages. Furthermore, we propose the System Messages Evolutionary Algorithm (SMEA) to generate system messages that are more resistant to jailbreak prompts, even with minor changes. Through SMEA, we get a robust system messages population with little change in the length of system messages. Our research not only bolsters LLMs security but also raises the bar for jailbreaks, fostering advancements in this field of study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14857v2,2024-02
AnnoTheia: A Semi-Automatic Annotation Toolkit for Audio-Visual Speech Technologies,"José-M. Acosta-Triana, David Gimeno-Gómez, Carlos-D. Martínez-Hinarejos","More than 7,000 known languages are spoken around the world. However, due to the lack of annotated resources, only a small fraction of them are currently covered by speech technologies. Albeit self-supervised speech representations, recent massive speech corpora collections, as well as the organization of challenges, have alleviated this inequality, most studies are mainly benchmarked on English. This situation is aggravated when tasks involving both acoustic and visual speech modalities are addressed. In order to promote research on low-resource languages for audio-visual speech technologies, we present AnnoTheia, a semi-automatic annotation toolkit that detects when a person speaks on the scene and the corresponding transcription. In addition, to show the complete process of preparing AnnoTheia for a language of interest, we also describe the adaptation of a pre-trained model for active speaker detection to Spanish, using a database not initially conceived for this type of task. The AnnoTheia toolkit, tutorials, and pre-trained models are available on GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13152v1,2024-02
CMDAG: A Chinese Metaphor Dataset with Annotated Grounds as CoT for Boosting Metaphor Generation,"Yujie Shao, Xinrong Yao, Xingwei Qu, Chenghua Lin, Shi Wang, Stephen W. Huang, Ge Zhang, Jie Fu","Metaphor is a prominent linguistic device in human language and literature, as they add color, imagery, and emphasis to enhance effective communication. This paper introduces a large-scale high quality annotated Chinese Metaphor Corpus, which comprises around 28K sentences drawn from a diverse range of Chinese literary sources, such as poems, prose, song lyrics, etc. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of our annotations, we introduce a comprehensive set of guidelines. These guidelines address the facets of metaphor annotation, including identifying tenors, vehicles, and grounds to handling the complexities of similes, personifications, juxtapositions, and hyperboles. Breaking tradition, our approach to metaphor generation emphasizes grounds and their distinct features rather than the conventional combination of tenors and vehicles. By integrating ""ground"" as a CoT (Chain of Thoughts) input, we are able to generate metaphors that resonate more with real-world intuition. We test generative models such as Belle, Baichuan, and Chinese-alpaca-33B using our annotated corpus. These models are able to generate creative and fluent metaphor sentences more frequently induced by selected samples from our dataset, demonstrating the value of our corpus for Chinese metaphor research.

The Hidden Space of Transformer Language Adapters,"Jesujoba O. Alabi, Marius Mosbach, Matan Eyal, Dietrich Klakow, Mor Geva","We analyze the operation of transformer language adapters, which are small modules trained on top of a frozen language model to adapt its predictions to new target languages. We show that adapted predictions mostly evolve in the source language the model was trained on, while the target language becomes pronounced only in the very last layers of the model. Moreover, the adaptation process is gradual and distributed across layers, where it is possible to skip small groups of adapters without decreasing adaptation performance. Last, we show that adapters operate on top of the model's frozen representation space while largely preserving its structure, rather than on an 'isolated' subspace. Our findings provide a deeper view into the adaptation process of language models to new languages, showcasing the constraints imposed on it by the underlying model and introduces practical implications to enhance its efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13137v2,2024-02
Are ELECTRA's Sentence Embeddings Beyond Repair? The Case of Semantic Textual Similarity,"Ivan Rep, David Dukić, Jan Šnajder","While BERT produces high-quality sentence embeddings, its pre-training computational cost is a significant drawback. In contrast, ELECTRA provides a cost-effective pre-training objective and downstream task performance improvements, but worse sentence embeddings. The community tacitly stopped utilizing ELECTRA's sentence embeddings for semantic textual similarity (STS). We notice a significant drop in performance for the ELECTRA discriminator's last layer in comparison to prior layers. We explore this drop and propose a way to repair the embeddings using a novel truncated model fine-tuning (TMFT) method. TMFT improves the Spearman correlation coefficient by over $8$ points while increasing parameter efficiency on the STS Benchmark. We extend our analysis to various model sizes, languages, and two other tasks. Further, we discover the surprising efficacy of ELECTRA's generator model, which performs on par with BERT, using significantly fewer parameters and a substantially smaller embedding size. Finally, we observe boosts by combining TMFT with word similarity or domain adaptive pre-training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13130v3,2024-02
TreeEval: Benchmark-Free Evaluation of Large Language Models through Tree Planning,"Xiang Li, Yunshi Lan, Chao Yang","Recently, numerous new benchmarks have been established to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) via either computing a holistic score or employing another LLM as a judge. However, these approaches suffer from data leakage due to the open access of the benchmark and inflexible evaluation process. To address this issue, we introduce $\textbf{TreeEval}$, a benchmark-free evaluation method for LLMs that let a high-performance LLM host an irreproducible evaluation session and essentially avoids the data leakage. Moreover, this LLM performs as an examiner to raise up a series of questions under a topic with a tree planing strategy, which considers the current evaluation status to decide the next question generation and ensures the completeness and efficiency of the evaluation process. We evaluate $6$ models of different parameter sizes, including $7$B, $13$B, and $33$B, and ultimately achieved the highest correlation coefficient with AlpacaEval2.0 using only around $45$ questions.

A Survey on Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models,"Xiaohan Xu, Ming Li, Chongyang Tao, Tao Shen, Reynold Cheng, Jinyang Li, Can Xu, Dacheng Tao, Tianyi Zhou","In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Knowledge Distillation (KD) emerges as a pivotal methodology for transferring advanced capabilities from leading proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, to their open-source counterparts like LLaMA and Mistral. Additionally, as open-source LLMs flourish, KD plays a crucial role in both compressing these models, and facilitating their self-improvement by employing themselves as teachers. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of KD's role within the realm of LLM, highlighting its critical function in imparting advanced knowledge to smaller models and its utility in model compression and self-improvement. Our survey is meticulously structured around three foundational pillars: \textit{algorithm}, \textit{skill}, and \textit{verticalization} -- providing a comprehensive examination of KD mechanisms, the enhancement of specific cognitive abilities, and their practical implications across diverse fields. Crucially, the survey navigates the intricate interplay between data augmentation (DA) and KD, illustrating how DA emerges as a powerful paradigm within the KD framework to bolster LLMs' performance. By leveraging DA to generate context-rich, skill-specific training data, KD transcends traditional boundaries, enabling open-source models to approximate the contextual adeptness, ethical alignment, and deep semantic insights characteristic of their proprietary counterparts. This work aims to provide an insightful guide for researchers and practitioners, offering a detailed overview of current methodologies in KD and proposing future research directions. Importantly, we firmly advocate for compliance with the legal terms that regulate the use of LLMs, ensuring ethical and lawful application of KD of LLMs. An associated Github repository is available at https://github.com/Tebmer/Awesome-Knowledge-Distillation-of-LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13116v4,2024-02
When Only Time Will Tell: Interpreting How Transformers Process Local Ambiguities Through the Lens of Restart-Incrementality,"Brielen Madureira, Patrick Kahardipraja, David Schlangen","Incremental models that process sentences one token at a time will sometimes encounter points where more than one interpretation is possible. Causal models are forced to output one interpretation and continue, whereas models that can revise may edit their previous output as the ambiguity is resolved. In this work, we look at how restart-incremental Transformers build and update internal states, in an effort to shed light on what processes cause revisions not viable in autoregressive models. We propose an interpretable way to analyse the incremental states, showing that their sequential structure encodes information on the garden path effect and its resolution. Our method brings insights on various bidirectional encoders for contextualised meaning representation and dependency parsing, contributing to show their advantage over causal models when it comes to revisions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13113v2,2024-02
CIF-Bench: A Chinese Instruction-Following Benchmark for Evaluating the Generalizability of Large Language Models,"Yizhi LI, Ge Zhang, Xingwei Qu, Jiali Li, Zhaoqun Li, Zekun Wang, Hao Li, Ruibin Yuan, Yinghao Ma, Kai Zhang, Wangchunshu Zhou, Yiming Liang, Lei Zhang, Lei Ma, Jiajun Zhang, Zuowen Li, Stephen W. Huang, Chenghua Lin, Jie Fu","The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enhanced the ability to generalize across a wide range of unseen natural language processing (NLP) tasks through instruction-following. Yet, their effectiveness often diminishes in low-resource languages like Chinese, exacerbated by biased evaluations from data leakage, casting doubt on their true generalizability to new linguistic territories. In response, we introduce the Chinese Instruction-Following Benchmark (CIF-Bench), designed to evaluate the zero-shot generalizability of LLMs to the Chinese language. CIF-Bench comprises 150 tasks and 15,000 input-output pairs, developed by native speakers to test complex reasoning and Chinese cultural nuances across 20 categories. To mitigate data contamination, we release only half of the dataset publicly, with the remainder kept private, and introduce diversified instructions to minimize score variance, totaling 45,000 data instances. Our evaluation of 28 selected LLMs reveals a noticeable performance gap, with the best model scoring only 52.9%, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in less familiar language and task contexts. This work not only uncovers the current limitations of LLMs in handling Chinese language tasks but also sets a new standard for future LLM generalizability research, pushing towards the development of more adaptable, culturally informed, and linguistically diverse models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13109v2,2024-02
ELAD: Explanation-Guided Large Language Models Active Distillation,"Yifei Zhang, Bo Pan, Chen Ling, Yuntong Hu, Liang Zhao","The deployment and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by their memory inefficiency, computational demands, and the high costs of API inferences. Traditional distillation methods, which transfer the capabilities of LLMs to smaller models, often fail to determine whether the knowledge has been sufficiently transferred, potentially resulting in high costs or incomplete distillation. In this paper, we propose an Explanation-Guided LLMs Active Distillation (ELAD) framework that employs an active learning strategy to optimize the balance between annotation costs and model performance. To improve efficient sample selection, we introduce an explanation-guided sample selection method that identifies samples challenging its reasoning by exploiting uncertainties in explanation steps. Additionally, we present a customized LLM-annotated explanation revision technique where the teacher model detects and corrects flaws in the student model's reasoning. Our experiments across various reasoning datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the efficiency of LLM knowledge distillation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13098v1,2024-02
Digital Comprehensibility Assessment of Simplified Texts among Persons with Intellectual Disabilities,"Andreas Säuberli, Franz Holzknecht, Patrick Haller, Silvana Deilen, Laura Schiffl, Silvia Hansen-Schirra, Sarah Ebling","Text simplification refers to the process of increasing the comprehensibility of texts. Automatic text simplification models are most commonly evaluated by experts or crowdworkers instead of the primary target groups of simplified texts, such as persons with intellectual disabilities. We conducted an evaluation study of text comprehensibility including participants with and without intellectual disabilities reading unsimplified, automatically and manually simplified German texts on a tablet computer. We explored four different approaches to measuring comprehensibility: multiple-choice comprehension questions, perceived difficulty ratings, response time, and reading speed. The results revealed significant variations in these measurements, depending on the reader group and whether the text had undergone automatic or manual simplification. For the target group of persons with intellectual disabilities, comprehension questions emerged as the most reliable measure, while analyzing reading speed provided valuable insights into participants' reading behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13094v1,2024-02
Event-level Knowledge Editing,"Hao Peng, Xiaozhi Wang, Chunyang Li, Kaisheng Zeng, Jiangshan Duo, Yixin Cao, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li","Knowledge editing aims at updating knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to prevent them from becoming outdated. Existing work edits LLMs at the level of factual knowledge triplets. However, natural knowledge updates in the real world come from the occurrences of new events rather than direct changes in factual triplets. In this paper, we propose a new task setting: event-level knowledge editing, which directly edits new events into LLMs and improves over conventional triplet-level editing on (1) Efficiency. A single event edit leads to updates in multiple entailed knowledge triplets. (2) Completeness. Beyond updating factual knowledge, event-level editing also requires considering the event influences and updating LLMs' knowledge about future trends. We construct a high-quality event-level editing benchmark ELKEN, consisting of 1,515 event edits, 6,449 questions about factual knowledge, and 10,150 questions about future tendencies. We systematically evaluate the performance of various knowledge editing methods and LLMs on this benchmark. We find that ELKEN poses significant challenges to existing knowledge editing approaches.

Unlike prior work that relies on seed examples or existing datasets to construct instruction tuning data, GLAN exclusively utilizes a pre-curated taxonomy of human knowledge and capabilities as input and generates large-scale synthetic instruction data across all disciplines. Specifically, inspired by the systematic structure in human education system, we build the taxonomy by decomposing human knowledge and capabilities to various fields, sub-fields and ultimately, distinct disciplines semi-automatically, facilitated by LLMs. Subsequently, we generate a comprehensive list of subjects for every discipline and proceed to design a syllabus tailored to each subject, again utilizing LLMs. With the fine-grained key concepts detailed in every class session of the syllabus, we are able to generate diverse instructions with a broad coverage across the entire spectrum of human knowledge and skills. Extensive experiments on large language models (e.g., Mistral) demonstrate that GLAN excels in multiple dimensions from mathematical reasoning, coding, academic exams, logical reasoning to general instruction following without using task-specific training data of these tasks. In addition, GLAN allows for easy customization and new fields or skills can be added by simply incorporating a new node into our taxonomy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13064v1,2024-02
Identifying Semantic Induction Heads to Understand In-Context Learning,"Jie Ren, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Dongrui Liu, Quanshi Zhang, Xipeng Qiu, Dahua Lin","Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, the lack of transparency in their inference logic raises concerns about their trustworthiness. To gain a better understanding of LLMs, we conduct a detailed analysis of the operations of attention heads and aim to better understand the in-context learning of LLMs. Specifically, we investigate whether attention heads encode two types of relationships between tokens present in natural languages: the syntactic dependency parsed from sentences and the relation within knowledge graphs. We find that certain attention heads exhibit a pattern where, when attending to head tokens, they recall tail tokens and increase the output logits of those tail tokens. More crucially, the formulation of such semantic induction heads has a close correlation with the emergence of the in-context learning ability of language models. The study of semantic attention heads advances our understanding of the intricate operations of attention heads in transformers, and further provides new insights into the in-context learning of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13055v2,2024-02
Stable Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models,"Zihao Wei, Liang Pang, Hanxing Ding, Jingcheng Deng, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng","Efficient knowledge editing of large language models is crucial for replacing obsolete information or incorporating specialized knowledge on a large scale. However, previous methods implicitly assume that knowledge is localized and isolated within the model, an assumption that oversimplifies the interconnected nature of model knowledge. The premise of localization results in an incomplete knowledge editing, whereas an isolated assumption may impair both other knowledge and general abilities. It introduces instability to the performance of the knowledge editing method. To transcend these assumptions, we introduce StableKE, a method adopts a novel perspective based on knowledge augmentation rather than knowledge localization. To overcome the expense of human labeling, StableKE integrates two automated knowledge augmentation strategies: Semantic Paraphrase Enhancement strategy, which diversifies knowledge descriptions to facilitate the teaching of new information to the model, and Contextual Description Enrichment strategy, expanding the surrounding knowledge to prevent the forgetting of related information. StableKE surpasses other knowledge editing methods, demonstrating stability both edited knowledge and multi-hop knowledge, while also preserving unrelated knowledge and general abilities. Moreover, StableKE can edit knowledge on ChatGPT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13048v1,2024-02
Effective and Efficient Conversation Retrieval for Dialogue State Tracking with Implicit Text Summaries,"Seanie Lee, Jianpeng Cheng, Joris Driesen, Alexandru Coca, Anders Johannsen","Few-shot dialogue state tracking (DST) with Large Language Models (LLM) relies on an effective and efficient conversation retriever to find similar in-context examples for prompt learning. Previous works use raw dialogue context as search keys and queries, and a retriever is fine-tuned with annotated dialogues to achieve superior performance. However, the approach is less suited for scaling to new domains or new annotation languages, where fine-tuning data is unavailable. To address this problem, we handle the task of conversation retrieval based on text summaries of the conversations. A LLM-based conversation summarizer is adopted for query and key generation, which enables effective maximum inner product search. To avoid the extra inference cost brought by LLM-based conversation summarization, we further distill a light-weight conversation encoder which produces query embeddings without decoding summaries for test conversations. We validate our retrieval approach on MultiWOZ datasets with GPT-Neo-2.7B and LLaMA-7B/30B. The experimental results show a significant improvement over relevant baselines in real few-shot DST settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13043v3,2024-02
Text-Guided Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model,"Haisong Gong, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang","Text-guided molecule generation is a task where molecules are generated to match specific textual descriptions. Recently, most existing SMILES-based molecule generation methods rely on an autoregressive architecture. In this work, we propose the Text-Guided Molecule Generation with Diffusion Language Model (TGM-DLM), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to address the limitations of autoregressive methods. TGM-DLM updates token embeddings within the SMILES string collectively and iteratively, using a two-phase diffusion generation process. The first phase optimizes embeddings from random noise, guided by the text description, while the second phase corrects invalid SMILES strings to form valid molecular representations. We demonstrate that TGM-DLM outperforms MolT5-Base, an autoregressive model, without the need for additional data resources. Our findings underscore the remarkable effectiveness of TGM-DLM in generating coherent and precise molecules with specific properties, opening new avenues in drug discovery and related scientific domains.

SiLLM: Large Language Models for Simultaneous Machine Translation,"Shoutao Guo, Shaolei Zhang, Zhengrui Ma, Min Zhang, Yang Feng","Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) generates translations while reading the source sentence, necessitating a policy to determine the optimal timing for reading and generating words. Despite the remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) across various NLP tasks, existing SiMT methods predominantly focus on conventional transformers, employing a single model to concurrently determine the policy and generate the translations. However, given the complexity of SiMT, it is challenging to effectively address both tasks with a single model. Therefore, there is a need to decouple the SiMT task into policy-decision and translation sub-tasks. We propose SiLLM, which delegates the two sub-tasks to separate agents, thereby incorporating LLM into SiMT. The policy-decision agent is managed by a conventional SiMT model, responsible for determining the translation policy. The translation agent, leveraging the capabilities of LLM, generates translation using the partial source sentence. The two agents collaborate to accomplish SiMT. To facilitate the application of token-level policies determined by conventional SiMT models to LLM, we propose a word-level policy adapted for LLM. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that, with a small amount of data for fine-tuning LLM, SiLLM attains state-of-the-art performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13036v1,2024-02
Learning to Check: Unleashing Potentials for Self-Correction in Large Language Models,"Che Zhang, Zhenyang Xiao, Chengcheng Han, Yixin Lian, Yuejian Fang","Self-correction has achieved impressive results in enhancing the style and security of the generated output from large language models (LLMs). However, recent studies suggest that self-correction might be limited or even counterproductive in reasoning tasks due to LLMs' difficulties in identifying logical mistakes.   In this paper, we aim to enhance the self-checking capabilities of LLMs by constructing training data for checking tasks. Specifically, we apply the Chain of Thought (CoT) methodology to self-checking tasks, utilizing fine-grained step-level analyses and explanations to assess the correctness of reasoning paths. We propose a specialized checking format called ""Step CoT Check"". Following this format, we construct a checking-correction dataset that includes detailed step-by-step analysis and checking. Then we fine-tune LLMs to enhance their error detection and correction abilities.   Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with the ""Step CoT Check"" format significantly improves the self-checking and self-correction abilities of LLMs across multiple benchmarks. This approach outperforms other formats, especially in locating the incorrect position, with greater benefits observed in larger models.   For reproducibility, all the datasets and code are provided in https://github.com/bammt/Learn-to-check.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13035v3,2024-02
Heterogeneous Graph Reasoning for Fact Checking over Texts and Tables,"Haisong Gong, Weizhi Xu, Shu wu, Qiang Liu, Liang Wang","Fact checking aims to predict claim veracity by reasoning over multiple evidence pieces. It usually involves evidence retrieval and veracity reasoning. In this paper, we focus on the latter, reasoning over unstructured text and structured table information. Previous works have primarily relied on fine-tuning pretrained language models or training homogeneous-graph-based models. Despite their effectiveness, we argue that they fail to explore the rich semantic information underlying the evidence with different structures. To address this, we propose a novel word-level Heterogeneous-graph-based model for Fact Checking over unstructured and structured information, namely HeterFC. Our approach leverages a heterogeneous evidence graph, with words as nodes and thoughtfully designed edges representing different evidence properties. We perform information propagation via a relational graph neural network, facilitating interactions between claims and evidence. An attention-based method is utilized to integrate information, combined with a language model for generating predictions. We introduce a multitask loss function to account for potential inaccuracies in evidence retrieval. Comprehensive experiments on the large fact checking dataset FEVEROUS demonstrate the effectiveness of HeterFC.

CFEVER comprises 30,012 manually created claims based on content in Chinese Wikipedia.

Similar to the FEVER dataset, claims in the ""Supports"" and ""Refutes"" categories are also annotated with corresponding evidence sentences sourced from single or multiple pages in Chinese Wikipedia. Our labeled dataset holds a Fleiss' kappa value of 0.7934 for five-way inter-annotator agreement. In addition, through the experiments with the state-of-the-art approaches developed on the FEVER dataset and a simple baseline for CFEVER, we demonstrate that our dataset is a new rigorous benchmark for factual extraction and verification, which can be further used for developing automated systems to alleviate human fact-checking efforts.

SoMeLVLM: A Large Vision Language Model for Social Media Processing,"Xinnong Zhang, Haoyu Kuang, Xinyi Mou, Hanjia Lyu, Kun Wu, Siming Chen, Jiebo Luo, Xuanjing Huang, Zhongyu Wei","The growth of social media, characterized by its multimodal nature, has led to the emergence of diverse phenomena and challenges, which calls for an effective approach to uniformly solve automated tasks. The powerful Large Vision Language Models make it possible to handle a variety of tasks simultaneously, but even with carefully designed prompting methods, the general domain models often fall short in aligning with the unique speaking style and context of social media tasks. In this paper, we introduce a Large Vision Language Model for Social Media Processing (SoMeLVLM), which is a cognitive framework equipped with five key capabilities including knowledge & comprehension, application, analysis, evaluation, and creation. SoMeLVLM is designed to understand and generate realistic social media behavior. We have developed a 654k multimodal social media instruction-tuning dataset to support our cognitive framework and fine-tune our model. Our experiments demonstrate that SoMeLVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple social media tasks. Further analysis shows its significant advantages over baselines in terms of cognitive abilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13022v1,2024-02
Understanding the effects of language-specific class imbalance in multilingual fine-tuning,"Vincent Jung, Lonneke van der Plas","We study the effect of one type of imbalance often present in real-life multilingual classification datasets: an uneven distribution of labels across languages. We show evidence that fine-tuning a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) on a dataset with this imbalance leads to worse performance, a more pronounced separation of languages in the latent space, and the promotion of uninformative features. We modify the traditional class weighing approach to imbalance by calculating class weights separately for each language and show that this helps mitigate those detrimental effects. These results create awareness of the negative effects of language-specific class imbalance in multilingual fine-tuning and the way in which the model learns to rely on the separation of languages to perform the task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13016v1,2024-02
Code Needs Comments: Enhancing Code LLMs with Comment Augmentation,"Demin Song, Honglin Guo, Yunhua Zhou, Shuhao Xing, Yudong Wang, Zifan Song, Wenwei Zhang, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Xipeng Qiu, Dahua Lin","The programming skill is one crucial ability for Large Language Models (LLMs), necessitating a deep understanding of programming languages (PLs) and their correlation with natural languages (NLs). We examine the impact of pre-training data on code-focused LLMs' performance by assessing the comment density as a measure of PL-NL alignment. Given the scarcity of code-comment aligned data in pre-training corpora, we introduce a novel data augmentation method that generates comments for existing code, coupled with a data filtering strategy that filters out code data poorly correlated with natural language. We conducted experiments on three code-focused LLMs and observed consistent improvements in performance on two widely-used programming skill benchmarks. Notably, the model trained on the augmented data outperformed both the model used for generating comments and the model further trained on the data without augmentation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13013v1,2024-02
Enhancing Modern Supervised Word Sense Disambiguation Models by Semantic Lexical Resources,"Stefano Melacci, Achille Globo, Leonardo Rigutini","Supervised models for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) currently yield to state-of-the-art results in the most popular benchmarks. Despite the recent introduction of Word Embeddings and Recurrent Neural Networks to design powerful context-related features, the interest in improving WSD models using Semantic Lexical Resources (SLRs) is mostly restricted to knowledge-based approaches. In this paper, we enhance ""modern"" supervised WSD models exploiting two popular SLRs: WordNet and WordNet Domains. We propose an effective way to introduce semantic features into the classifiers, and we consider using the SLR structure to augment the training data. We study the effect of different types of semantic features, investigating their interaction with local contexts encoded by means of mixtures of Word Embeddings or Recurrent Neural Networks, and we extend the proposed model into a novel multi-layer architecture for WSD. A detailed experimental comparison in the recent Unified Evaluation Framework (Raganato et al., 2017) shows that the proposed approach leads to supervised models that compare favourably with the state-of-the art.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13302v1,2024-02
Investigating the Impact of Model Instability on Explanations and Uncertainty,"Sara Vera Marjanović, Isabelle Augenstein, Christina Lioma","Explainable AI methods facilitate the understanding of model behaviour, yet, small, imperceptible perturbations to inputs can vastly distort explanations. As these explanations are typically evaluated holistically, before model deployment, it is difficult to assess when a particular explanation is trustworthy. Some studies have tried to create confidence estimators for explanations, but none have investigated an existing link between uncertainty and explanation quality. We artificially simulate epistemic uncertainty in text input by introducing noise at inference time. In this large-scale empirical study, we insert different levels of noise perturbations and measure the effect on the output of pre-trained language models and different uncertainty metrics. Realistic perturbations have minimal effect on performance and explanations, yet masking has a drastic effect. We find that high uncertainty doesn't necessarily imply low explanation plausibility; the correlation between the two metrics can be moderately positive when noise is exposed during the training process. This suggests that noise-augmented models may be better at identifying salient tokens when uncertain. Furthermore, when predictive and epistemic uncertainty measures are over-confident, the robustness of a saliency map to perturbation can indicate model stability issues. Integrated Gradients shows the overall greatest robustness to perturbation, while still showing model-specific patterns in performance; however, this phenomenon is limited to smaller Transformer-based language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13006v2,2024-02
Phonotactic Complexity across Dialects,"Ryan Soh-Eun Shim, Kalvin Chang, David R. Mortensen","Received wisdom in linguistic typology holds that if the structure of a language becomes more complex in one dimension, it will simplify in another, building on the assumption that all languages are equally complex (Joseph and Newmeyer, 2012). We study this claim on a micro-level, using a tightly-controlled sample of Dutch dialects (across 366 collection sites) and Min dialects (across 60 sites), which enables a more fair comparison across varieties. Even at the dialect level, we find empirical evidence for a tradeoff between word length and a computational measure of phonotactic complexity from a LSTM-based phone-level language model-a result previously documented only at the language level. A generalized additive model (GAM) shows that dialects with low phonotactic complexity concentrate around the capital regions, which we hypothesize to correspond to prior hypotheses that language varieties of greater or more diverse populations show reduced phonotactic complexity. We also experiment with incorporating the auxiliary task of predicting syllable constituency, but do not find an increase in the negative correlation observed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12998v1,2024-02
Towards Trustworthy Reranking: A Simple yet Effective Abstention Mechanism,"Hippolyte Gisserot-Boukhlef, Manuel Faysse, Emmanuel Malherbe, Céline Hudelot, Pierre Colombo","Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) has significantly improved upon heuristic-based Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Yet, failures remain frequent, the models used often being unable to retrieve documents relevant to the user's query. We address this challenge by proposing a lightweight abstention mechanism tailored for real-world constraints, with particular emphasis placed on the reranking phase. We introduce a protocol for evaluating abstention strategies in black-box scenarios (typically encountered when relying on API services), demonstrating their efficacy, and propose a simple yet effective data-driven mechanism. We provide open-source code for experiment replication and abstention implementation, fostering wider adoption and application in diverse contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12997v5,2024-02
TRAP: Targeted Random Adversarial Prompt Honeypot for Black-Box Identification,"Martin Gubri, Dennis Ulmer, Hwaran Lee, Sangdoo Yun, Seong Joon Oh","Large Language Model (LLM) services and models often come with legal rules on who can use them and how they must use them. Assessing the compliance of the released LLMs is crucial, as these rules protect the interests of the LLM contributor and prevent misuse. In this context, we describe the novel fingerprinting problem of Black-box Identity Verification (BBIV). The goal is to determine whether a third-party application uses a certain LLM through its chat function. We propose a method called Targeted Random Adversarial Prompt (TRAP) that identifies the specific LLM in use. We repurpose adversarial suffixes, originally proposed for jailbreaking, to get a pre-defined answer from the target LLM, while other models give random answers. TRAP detects the target LLMs with over 95% true positive rate at under 0.2% false positive rate even after a single interaction. TRAP remains effective even if the LLM has minor changes that do not significantly alter the original function.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12991v2,2024-02
Can GNN be Good Adapter for LLMs?,"Xuanwen Huang, Kaiqiao Han, Yang Yang, Dezheng Bao, Quanjin Tao, Ziwei Chai, Qi Zhu","Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior capabilities in understanding and zero-shot learning on textual data, promising significant advances for many text-related domains. In the graph domain, various real-world scenarios also involve textual data, where tasks and node features can be described by text. These text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have broad applications in social media, recommendation systems, etc. Thus, this paper explores how to utilize LLMs to model TAGs. Previous methods for TAG modeling are based on million-scale LMs. When scaled up to billion-scale LLMs, they face huge challenges in computational costs. Additionally, they also ignore the zero-shot inference capabilities of LLMs. Therefore, we propose GraphAdapter, which uses a graph neural network (GNN) as an efficient adapter in collaboration with LLMs to tackle TAGs. In terms of efficiency, the GNN adapter introduces only a few trainable parameters and can be trained with low computation costs. The entire framework is trained using auto-regression on node text (next token prediction). Once trained, GraphAdapter can be seamlessly fine-tuned with task-specific prompts for various downstream tasks. Through extensive experiments across multiple real-world TAGs, GraphAdapter based on Llama 2 gains an average improvement of approximately 5\% in terms of node classification. Furthermore, GraphAdapter can also adapt to other language models, including RoBERTa, GPT-2. The promising results demonstrate that GNNs can serve as effective adapters for LLMs in TAG modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12984v1,2024-02
Comparing Inferential Strategies of Humans and Large Language Models in Deductive Reasoning,"Philipp Mondorf, Barbara Plank","Deductive reasoning plays a pivotal role in the formulation of sound and cohesive arguments. It allows individuals to draw conclusions that logically follow, given the truth value of the information provided. Recent progress in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has showcased their capability in executing deductive reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, a significant portion of research primarily assesses the accuracy of LLMs in solving such tasks, often overlooking a deeper analysis of their reasoning behavior. In this study, we draw upon principles from cognitive psychology to examine inferential strategies employed by LLMs, through a detailed evaluation of their responses to propositional logic problems. Our findings indicate that LLMs display reasoning patterns akin to those observed in humans, including strategies like $\textit{supposition following}$ or $\textit{chain construction}$. Moreover, our research demonstrates that the architecture and scale of the model significantly affect its preferred method of reasoning, with more advanced models tending to adopt strategies more frequently than less sophisticated ones. Importantly, we assert that a model's accuracy, that is the correctness of its final conclusion, does not necessarily reflect the validity of its reasoning process. This distinction underscores the necessity for more nuanced evaluation procedures in the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14856v2,2024-02
The Impact of Demonstrations on Multilingual In-Context Learning: A Multidimensional Analysis,"Miaoran Zhang, Vagrant Gautam, Mingyang Wang, Jesujoba O. Alabi, Xiaoyu Shen, Dietrich Klakow, Marius Mosbach","In-context learning is a popular inference strategy where large language models solve a task using only a few labeled demonstrations without needing any parameter updates. Although there have been extensive studies on English in-context learning, multilingual in-context learning remains under-explored, and we lack an in-depth understanding of the role of demonstrations in this context. To address this gap, we conduct a multidimensional analysis of multilingual in-context learning, experimenting with 5 models from different model families, 9 datasets covering classification and generation tasks, and 56 typologically diverse languages. Our results reveal that the effectiveness of demonstrations varies significantly across models, tasks, and languages. We also find that strong instruction-following models including Llama 2-Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 are largely insensitive to the quality of demonstrations. Instead, a carefully crafted template often eliminates the benefits of demonstrations for some tasks and languages altogether. These findings show that the importance of demonstrations might be overestimated. Our work highlights the need for granular evaluation across multiple axes towards a better understanding of in-context learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12976v2,2024-02
GlórIA -- A Generative and Open Large Language Model for Portuguese,"Ricardo Lopes, João Magalhães, David Semedo","Significant strides have been made in natural language tasks, largely attributed to the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs).

Despite the abundance of LLMs for many high-resource languages, the availability of such models remains limited for European Portuguese. We introduce Gl\'orIA, a robust European Portuguese decoder LLM. To pre-train Gl\'orIA, we assembled a comprehensive PT-PT text corpus comprising 35 billion tokens from various sources. We present our pre-training methodology, followed by an assessment of the model's effectiveness on multiple downstream tasks. Additionally, to evaluate our models' language modeling capabilities, we introduce CALAME-PT (Context-Aware LAnguage Modeling Evaluation for Portuguese), the first Portuguese zero-shot language-modeling benchmark. Evaluation shows that Gl\'orIA significantly outperforms existing open PT decoder models in language modeling and that it can generate sound, knowledge-rich, and coherent PT-PT text.

Prompt Stealing Attacks Against Large Language Models,"Zeyang Sha, Yang Zhang","The increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT in various fields emphasizes the importance of ``prompt engineering,'' a technology to improve the quality of model outputs. With companies investing significantly in expert prompt engineers and educational resources rising to meet market demand, designing high-quality prompts has become an intriguing challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel attack against LLMs, named prompt stealing attacks. Our proposed prompt stealing attack aims to steal these well-designed prompts based on the generated answers. The prompt stealing attack contains two primary modules: the parameter extractor and the prompt reconstruction. The goal of the parameter extractor is to figure out the properties of the original prompts. We first observe that most prompts fall into one of three categories: direct prompt, role-based prompt, and in-context prompt. Our parameter extractor first tries to distinguish the type of prompts based on the generated answers. Then, it can further predict which role or how many contexts are used based on the types of prompts. Following the parameter extractor, the prompt reconstructor can be used to reconstruct the original prompts based on the generated answers and the extracted features. The final goal of the prompt reconstructor is to generate the reversed prompts, which are similar to the original prompts. Our experimental results show the remarkable performance of our proposed attacks. Our proposed attacks add a new dimension to the study of prompt engineering and call for more attention to the security issues on LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12959v1,2024-02
GumbelSoft: Diversified Language Model Watermarking via the GumbelMax-trick,"Jiayi Fu, Xuandong Zhao, Ruihan Yang, Yuansen Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Yanghua Xiao","Large language models (LLMs) excellently generate human-like text, but also raise concerns about misuse in fake news and academic dishonesty. Decoding-based watermark, particularly the GumbelMax-trick-based watermark(GM watermark), is a standout solution for safeguarding machine-generated texts due to its notable detectability. However, GM watermark encounters a major challenge with generation diversity, always yielding identical outputs for the same prompt, negatively impacting generation diversity and user experience. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new type of GM watermark, the Logits-Addition watermark, and its three variants, specifically designed to enhance diversity. Among these, the GumbelSoft watermark (a softmax variant of the Logits-Addition watermark) demonstrates superior performance in high diversity settings, with its AUROC score outperforming those of the two alternative variants by 0.1 to 0.3 and surpassing other decoding-based watermarking methods by a minimum of 0.1.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12948v3,2024-02

This task aims to detect hallucination with LLMs for three different text-generation tasks without labeled training data. We utilize prompt engineering and few-shot learning to verify the performance of different LLMs on the validation data. Then we select the LLMs with better performance to generate high-quality weakly supervised training data, which not only satisfies the consistency of different LLMs, but also satisfies the consistency of the optimal LLM with different sampling parameters. Furthermore, we finetune different LLMs by using the constructed training data, and finding that a relatively small LLM can achieve a competitive level of performance in hallucination detection, when compared to the large LLMs and the prompt-based approaches using GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12913v1,2024-02

TEXT2AFFORD: Probing Object Affordance Prediction abilities of Language Models solely from Text,"Sayantan Adak, Daivik Agrawal, Animesh Mukherjee, Somak Aditya","We investigate the knowledge of object affordances in pre-trained language models (LMs) and pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs). A growing body of literature shows that PTLMs fail inconsistently and non-intuitively, demonstrating a lack of reasoning and grounding. To take a first step toward quantifying the effect of grounding (or lack thereof), we curate a novel and comprehensive dataset of object affordances -- Text2Afford, characterized by 15 affordance classes. Unlike affordance datasets collected in vision and language domains, we annotate in-the-wild sentences with objects and affordances. Experimental results reveal that PTLMs exhibit limited reasoning abilities when it comes to uncommon object affordances. We also observe that pre-trained VLMs do not necessarily capture object affordances effectively. Through few-shot fine-tuning, we demonstrate improvement in affordance knowledge in PTLMs and VLMs. Our research contributes a novel dataset for language grounding tasks, and presents insights into LM capabilities, advancing the understanding of object affordances.

Autism Detection in Speech -- A Survey,"Nadine Probol, Margot Mieskes","There has been a range of studies of how autism is displayed in voice, speech, and language. We analyse studies from the biomedical, as well as the psychological domain, but also from the NLP domain in order to find linguistic, prosodic and acoustic cues that could indicate autism. Our survey looks at all three domains. We define autism and which comorbidities might influence the correct detection of the disorder. We especially look at observations such as verbal and semantic fluency, prosodic features, but also disfluencies and speaking rate. We also show word-based approaches and describe machine learning and transformer-based approaches both on the audio data as well as the transcripts. Lastly, we conclude, while there already is a lot of research, female patients seem to be severely under-researched. Also, most NLP research focuses on traditional machine learning methods instead of transformers which could be beneficial in this context. Additionally, we were unable to find research combining both features from audio and transcripts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12880v1,2024-02
Exploring the Impact of Table-to-Text Methods on Augmenting LLM-based Question Answering with Domain Hybrid Data,"Dehai Min, Nan Hu, Rihui Jin, Nuo Lin, Jiaoyan Chen, Yongrui Chen, Yu Li, Guilin Qi, Yun Li, Nijun Li, Qianren Wang","Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) for Question Answering (QA) with domain specific data has attracted wide attention. However, domain data often exists in a hybrid format, including text and semi-structured tables, posing challenges for the seamless integration of information. Table-to-Text Generation is a promising solution by facilitating the transformation of hybrid data into a uniformly text-formatted corpus. Although this technique has been widely studied by the NLP community, there is currently no comparative analysis on how corpora generated by different table-to-text methods affect the performance of QA systems. In this paper, we address this research gap in two steps. First, we innovatively integrate table-to-text generation into the framework of enhancing LLM-based QA systems with domain hybrid data. Then, we utilize this framework in real-world industrial data to conduct extensive experiments on two types of QA systems (DSFT and RAG frameworks) with four representative methods: Markdown format, Template serialization, TPLM-based method, and LLM-based method. Based on the experimental results, we draw some empirical findings and explore the underlying reasons behind the success of some methods. We hope the findings of this work will provide a valuable reference for the academic and industrial communities in developing robust QA systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12869v2,2024-02
Backward Lens: Projecting Language Model Gradients into the Vocabulary Space,"Shahar Katz, Yonatan Belinkov, Mor Geva, Lior Wolf","Understanding how Transformer-based Language Models (LMs) learn and recall information is a key goal of the deep learning community. Recent interpretability methods project weights and hidden states obtained from the forward pass to the models' vocabularies, helping to uncover how information flows within LMs. In this work, we extend this methodology to LMs' backward pass and gradients. We first prove that a gradient matrix can be cast as a low-rank linear combination of its forward and backward passes' inputs. We then develop methods to project these gradients into vocabulary items and explore the mechanics of how new information is stored in the LMs' neurons.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12865v1,2024-02
Handling Ambiguity in Emotion: From Out-of-Domain Detection to Distribution Estimation,"Wen Wu, Bo Li, Chao Zhang, Chung-Cheng Chiu, Qiujia Li, Junwen Bai, Tara N. Sainath, Philip C. Woodland","The subjective perception of emotion leads to inconsistent labels from human annotators. Typically, utterances lacking majority-agreed labels are excluded when training an emotion classifier, which cause problems when encountering ambiguous emotional expressions during testing. This paper investigates three methods to handle ambiguous emotion. First, we show that incorporating utterances without majority-agreed labels as an additional class in the classifier reduces the classification performance of the other emotion classes. Then, we propose detecting utterances with ambiguous emotions as out-of-domain samples by quantifying the uncertainty in emotion classification using evidential deep learning. This approach retains the classification accuracy while effectively detects ambiguous emotion expressions. Furthermore, to obtain fine-grained distinctions among ambiguous emotions, we propose representing emotion as a distribution instead of a single class label. The task is thus re-framed from classification to distribution estimation where every individual annotation is taken into account, not just the majority opinion. The evidential uncertainty measure is extended to quantify the uncertainty in emotion distribution estimation. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and CREMA-D datasets demonstrate the superior capability of the proposed method in terms of majority class prediction, emotion distribution estimation, and uncertainty estimation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12862v1,2024-02
MoELoRA: Contrastive Learning Guided Mixture of Experts on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models,"Tongxu Luo, Jiahe Lei, Fangyu Lei, Weihao Liu, Shizhu He, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu","Fine-tuning is often necessary to enhance the adaptability of Large Language Models (LLM) to downstream tasks. Nonetheless, the process of updating billions of parameters demands significant computational resources and training time, which poses a substantial obstacle to the widespread application of large-scale models in various scenarios. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a prominent paradigm in recent research. However, current PEFT approaches that employ a limited set of global parameters (such as LoRA, which adds low-rank approximation matrices to all weights) face challenges in flexibly combining different computational modules in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel PEFT method: MoELoRA. We consider LoRA as Mixture of Experts (MoE), and to mitigate the random routing phenomenon observed in MoE, we propose the utilization of contrastive learning to encourage experts to learn distinct features. We conducted experiments on 11 tasks in math reasoning and common-sense reasoning benchmarks. With the same number of parameters, our approach outperforms LoRA significantly. In math reasoning, MoELoRA achieved an average performance that was 4.2% higher than LoRA, and demonstrated competitive performance compared to the 175B GPT-3.5 on several benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12851v1,2024-02
Instruction-tuned Language Models are Better Knowledge Learners,"Zhengbao Jiang, Zhiqing Sun, Weijia Shi, Pedro Rodriguez, Chunting Zhou, Graham Neubig, Xi Victoria Lin, Wen-tau Yih, Srinivasan Iyer","In order for large language model (LLM)-based assistants to effectively adapt to evolving information needs, it must be possible to update their factual knowledge through continued training on new data. The standard recipe for doing so involves continued pre-training on new documents followed by instruction-tuning on question-answer (QA) pairs. However, we find that LLMs trained with this recipe struggle to answer questions, even though the perplexity of documents is minimized. We found that QA pairs are generally straightforward, while documents are more complex, weaving many factual statements together in an intricate manner. Therefore, we hypothesize that it is beneficial to expose LLMs to QA pairs before continued pre-training on documents so that the process of encoding knowledge from complex documents takes into account how this knowledge is accessed through questions. Based on this, we propose pre-instruction-tuning (PIT), a method that instruction-tunes on questions prior to training on documents. This contrasts with standard instruction-tuning, which learns how to extract knowledge after training on documents. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that pre-instruction-tuning significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to absorb knowledge from new documents, outperforming standard instruction-tuning by 17.8%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12847v2,2024-02
ICON: Improving Inter-Report Consistency in Radiology Report Generation via Lesion-aware Mixup Augmentation,"Wenjun Hou, Yi Cheng, Kaishuai Xu, Yan Hu, Wenjie Li, Jiang Liu","Previous research on radiology report generation has made significant progress in terms of increasing the clinical accuracy of generated reports. In this paper, we emphasize another crucial quality that it should possess, i.e., inter-report consistency, which refers to the capability of generating consistent reports for semantically equivalent radiographs. This quality is even of greater significance than the overall report accuracy in terms of ensuring the system's credibility, as a system prone to providing conflicting results would severely erode users' trust. Regrettably, existing approaches struggle to maintain inter-report consistency, exhibiting biases towards common patterns and susceptibility to lesion variants. To address this issue, we propose ICON, which improves the inter-report consistency of radiology report generation. Aiming to enhance the system's ability to capture similarities in semantically equivalent lesions, our approach first involves extracting lesions from input images and examining their characteristics. Then, we introduce a lesion-aware mixup technique to ensure that the representations of the semantically equivalent lesions align with the same attributes, achieved through a linear combination during the training phase. Extensive experiments on three publicly available chest X-ray datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach, both in terms of improving the consistency and accuracy of the generated reports.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12844v2,2024-02
PromptKD: Distilling Student-Friendly Knowledge for Generative Language Models via Prompt Tuning,"Gyeongman Kim, Doohyuk Jang, Eunho Yang","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about inference costs, increasing the need for research into model compression. While knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent method for this, research on KD for generative language models like LLMs is relatively sparse, and the approach of distilling student-friendly knowledge, which has shown promising performance in KD for classification models, remains unexplored in generative language models. To explore this approach, we propose PromptKD, a simple yet effective method that utilizes prompt tuning - for the first time in KD - to enable generative language models to transfer student-friendly knowledge. Unlike previous works in classification that require fine-tuning the entire teacher model for extracting student-friendly knowledge, PromptKD achieves similar effects by adding a small number of prompt tokens and tuning only the prompt with student guidance. Extensive experiments on instruction-following datasets show that PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance while adding only 0.0007% of the teacher's parameters as prompts. Further analysis suggests that distilling student-friendly knowledge alleviates exposure bias effectively throughout the entire training process, leading to performance enhancements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12842v3,2024-02

Our data comprises 40 tasks and 14,575 multiple-choice questions in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and is carefully constructed by collaborating with native speakers in the region. Our comprehensive evaluations of 35 models reveal substantial room for improvement, particularly among the best open-source models.

PANDA: Preference Adaptation for Enhancing Domain-Specific Abilities of LLMs,"An Liu, Zonghan Yang, Zhenhe Zhang, Qingyuan Hu, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Yang Liu","While Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable capabilities across various natural language tasks, they often fall short of the performance achieved by domain-specific state-of-the-art models. One potential approach to enhance domain-specific capabilities of LLMs involves fine-tuning them using corresponding datasets. However, this method can be both resource and time-intensive, and not applicable to closed-source commercial LLMs. In this paper, we propose Preference Adaptation for Enhancing Domain-specific Abilities of LLMs (PANDA), a method designed to augment the domain-specific capabilities of LLMs by leveraging insights from the response preference of expert models without requiring fine-tuning. Our experimental results reveal that PANDA significantly enhances the domain-specific ability of LLMs on text classification and interactive decision tasks. Moreover, LLM with PANDA even outperforms the expert model that being learned on 4 tasks of ScienceWorld. This finding highlights the potential of exploring tuning-free approaches to achieve weak-to-strong generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12835v2,2024-02
Identifying Factual Inconsistencies in Summaries: Grounding LLM Inference via Task Taxonomy,"Liyan Xu, Zhenlin Su, Mo Yu, Jin Xu, Jinho D. Choi, Jie Zhou, Fei Liu","Factual inconsistencies pose a significant hurdle for the faithful summarization by generative models. While a major direction to enhance inconsistency detection is to derive stronger Natural Language Inference (NLI) models, we propose an orthogonal aspect that underscores the importance of incorporating task-specific taxonomy into the inference. To this end, we consolidate key error types of inconsistent facts in summaries, and incorporate them to facilitate both the zero-shot and supervised paradigms of LLMs. Extensive experiments on ten datasets of five distinct domains suggest that, zero-shot LLM inference could benefit from the explicit solution space depicted by the error type taxonomy, and achieves state-of-the-art performance overall, surpassing specialized non-LLM baselines, as well as recent LLM baselines. We further distill models that fuse the taxonomy into parameters through our designed prompt completions and supervised training strategies, efficiently substituting state-of-the-art zero-shot inference with much larger LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12821v3,2024-02
Comparing Specialised Small and General Large Language Models on Text Classification: 100 Labelled Samples to Achieve Break-Even Performance,"Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova","When solving NLP tasks with limited labelled data, researchers can either use a general large language model without further update, or use a small number of labelled examples to tune a specialised smaller model. In this work, we address the research gap of how many labelled samples are required for the specialised small models to outperform general large models, while taking the performance variance into consideration. By observing the behaviour of fine-tuning, instruction-tuning, prompting and in-context learning on 7 language models, we identify such performance break-even points across 8 representative text classification tasks of varying characteristics. We show that the specialised models often need only few samples (on average $10 - 1000$) to be on par or better than the general ones. At the same time, the number of required labels strongly depends on the dataset or task characteristics, with this number being significantly lower on multi-class datasets (up to $100$) than on binary datasets (up to $5000$). When performance variance is taken into consideration, the number of required labels increases on average by $100 - 200\%$ and even up to $1500\%$ in specific cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12819v2,2024-02
On Sensitivity of Learning with Limited Labelled Data to the Effects of Randomness: Impact of Interactions and Systematic Choices,"Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova","While learning with limited labelled data can improve performance when the labels are lacking, it is also sensitive to the effects of uncontrolled randomness introduced by so-called randomness factors (e.g., varying order of data). We propose a method to systematically investigate the effects of randomness factors while taking the interactions between them into consideration. To measure the true effects of an individual randomness factor, our method mitigates the effects of other factors and observes how the performance varies across multiple runs. Applying our method to multiple randomness factors across in-context learning and fine-tuning approaches on 7 representative text classification tasks and meta-learning on 3 tasks, we show that: 1) disregarding interactions between randomness factors in existing works caused inconsistent findings due to incorrect attribution of the effects of randomness factors, such as disproving the consistent sensitivity of in-context learning to sample order even with random sample selection; and 2) besides mutual interactions, the effects of randomness factors, especially sample order, are also dependent on more systematic choices unexplored in existing works, such as number of classes, samples per class or choice of prompt format.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12817v2,2024-02
SymBa: Symbolic Backward Chaining for Structured Natural Language Reasoning,"Jinu Lee, Wonseok Hwang","To improve the performance and explainability of LLM-based natural language reasoning, structured reasoning can be applied to generate explicitly structured proofs. Among different methods for structured reasoning, we specifically focus on backward chaining, where the proof goal is recursively decomposed to subgoals by searching and applying rules. We argue that current LLM-based backward chaining systems (e.g. Least-to-most prompting and LAMBADA) are incomplete, as they omit crucial algorithmic components identified from the classic backward chaining algorithm (SLD Resolution) in computational logic. To this end, we propose a novel backward chaining system, SymBa (Symbolic Backward Chaining), which integrates a symbolic solver and an LLM. In SymBa, the solver controls the proof process, and the LLM is only called when the solver requires new information to complete the proof. Empowered by completeness, SymBa achieves a significant improvement in deductive, relational, and arithmetic reasoning benchmarks compared to the baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12806v3,2024-02
"Few-shot clinical entity recognition in English, French and Spanish: masked language models outperform generative model prompting","Marco Naguib, Xavier Tannier, Aurélie Névéol","Large language models (LLMs) have become the preferred solution for many natural language processing tasks. In low-resource environments such as specialized domains, their few-shot capabilities are expected to deliver high performance. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in information extraction that is not covered in recent LLM benchmarks. There is a need for better understanding the performance of LLMs for NER in a variety of settings including languages other than English. This study aims to evaluate generative LLMs, employed through prompt engineering, for few-shot clinical NER. %from the perspective of F1 performance and environmental impact. We compare 13 auto-regressive models using prompting and 16 masked models using fine-tuning on 14 NER datasets covering English, French and Spanish. While prompt-based auto-regressive models achieve competitive F1 for general NER, they are outperformed within the clinical domain by lighter biLSTM-CRF taggers based on masked models. Additionally, masked models exhibit lower environmental impact compared to auto-regressive models. Findings are consistent across the three languages studied, which suggests that LLM prompting is not yet suited for NER production in the clinical domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12801v2,2024-02
Advancing Large Language Models to Capture Varied Speaking Styles and Respond Properly in Spoken Conversations,"Guan-Ting Lin, Cheng-Han Chiang, Hung-yi Lee","In spoken dialogue, even if two current turns are the same sentence, their responses might still differ when they are spoken in different styles. The spoken styles, containing paralinguistic and prosodic information, mark the most significant difference between text and speech modality. When using text-only LLMs to model spoken dialogue, text-only LLMs cannot give different responses based on the speaking style of the current turn. In this paper, we focus on enabling LLMs to listen to the speaking styles and respond properly. Our goal is to teach the LLM that ""even if the sentences are identical if they are spoken in different styles, their corresponding responses might be different"". Since there is no suitable dataset for achieving this goal, we collect a speech-to-speech dataset, StyleTalk, with the following desired characteristics: when two current speeches have the same content but are spoken in different styles, their responses will be different. To teach LLMs to understand and respond properly to the speaking styles, we propose the Spoken-LLM framework that can model the linguistic content and the speaking styles. We train Spoken-LLM using the StyleTalk dataset and devise a two-stage training pipeline to help the Spoken-LLM better learn the speaking styles. Based on extensive experiments, we show that Spoken-LLM outperforms text-only baselines and prior speech LLMs methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12786v2,2024-02
Understanding and Mitigating the Threat of Vec2Text to Dense Retrieval Systems,"Shengyao Zhuang, Bevan Koopman, Xiaoran Chu, Guido Zuccon","The emergence of Vec2Text -- a method for text embedding inversion -- has raised serious privacy concerns for dense retrieval systems which use text embeddings, such as those offered by OpenAI and Cohere. This threat comes from the ability for a malicious attacker with access to embeddings to reconstruct the original text. In this paper, we investigate various factors related to embedding models that may impact text recoverability via Vec2Text. We explore factors such as distance metrics, pooling functions, bottleneck pre-training, training with noise addition, embedding quantization, and embedding dimensions, which were not considered in the original Vec2Text paper. Through a comprehensive analysis of these factors, our objective is to gain a deeper understanding of the key elements that affect the trade-offs between the text recoverability and retrieval effectiveness of dense retrieval systems, offering insights for practitioners designing privacy-aware dense retrieval systems. We also propose a simple embedding transformation fix that guarantees equal ranking effectiveness while mitigating the recoverability risk. Overall, this study reveals that Vec2Text could pose a threat to current dense retrieval systems, but there are some effective methods to patch such systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12784v2,2024-02

Utilizing Japanese EmpatheticDialogues dataset - a textual-based dialogue dataset consisting of 8 emotional categories from Plutchik's wheel of emotions - the Task Adaptive Pre-Training (TAPT) BERT-based model outperforms both random baseline and the ChatGPT performance, in term of F1-score, in all modules. Further validation of our model's efficacy is confirmed in its application to the TUT Emotional Storytelling Corpus (TESC), a speech-based dialogue dataset, by surpassing both random baseline and the ChatGPT.

Model Composition for Multimodal Large Language Models,"Chi Chen, Yiyang Du, Zheng Fang, Ziyue Wang, Fuwen Luo, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu","Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown rapid progress, moving towards the goal of creating versatile MLLMs that understand inputs from various modalities. However, existing methods typically rely on joint training with paired multimodal instruction data, which is resource-intensive and challenging to extend to new modalities. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm through the model composition of existing MLLMs to create a new model that retains the modal understanding capabilities of each original model. Our basic implementation, NaiveMC, demonstrates the effectiveness of this paradigm by reusing modality encoders and merging LLM parameters. Furthermore, we introduce DAMC to address parameter interference and mismatch issues during the merging process, thereby enhancing the model performance. To facilitate research in this area, we propose MCUB, a benchmark for assessing ability of MLLMs to understand inputs from diverse modalities.

However, crafting formulas on spreadsheets remains a tedious and error-prone task for many end-users, particularly when dealing with complex operations. To alleviate the burden associated with writing spreadsheet formulas, this paper introduces a novel benchmark task called NL2Formula, with the aim to generate executable formulas that are grounded on a spreadsheet table, given a Natural Language (NL) query as input. To accomplish this, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of 70,799 paired NL queries and corresponding spreadsheet formulas, covering 21,670 tables and 37 types of formula functions. We realize the NL2Formula task by providing a sequence-to-sequence baseline implementation called fCoder.

UMBCLU at SemEval-2024 Task 1A and 1C: Semantic Textual Relatedness with and without machine translation,"Shubhashis Roy Dipta, Sai Vallurupalli","The aim of SemEval-2024 Task 1, ""Semantic Textual Relatedness for African and Asian Languages"" is to develop models for identifying semantic textual relatedness (STR) between two sentences using multiple languages (14 African and Asian languages) and settings (supervised, unsupervised, and cross-lingual). Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on several natural language understanding tasks such as multilingual machine translation (MMT), semantic similarity (STS), and encoding sentence embeddings. Using a combination of LLMs that perform well on these tasks, we developed two STR models, $\textit{TranSem}$ and $\textit{FineSem}$, for the supervised and cross-lingual settings. We explore the effectiveness of several training methods and the usefulness of machine translation. We find that direct fine-tuning on the task is comparable to using sentence embeddings and translating to English leads to better performance for some languages. In the supervised setting, our model performance is better than the official baseline for 3 languages with the remaining 4 performing on par. In the cross-lingual setting, our model performance is better than the baseline for 3 languages (leading to $1^{st}$ place for Africaans and $2^{nd}$ place for Indonesian), is on par for 2 languages and performs poorly on the remaining 7 languages.

Modality-Aware Integration with Large Language Models for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering,"Junnan Dong, Qinggang Zhang, Huachi Zhou, Daochen Zha, Pai Zheng, Xiao Huang","Knowledge-based visual question answering (KVQA) has been extensively studied to answer visual questions with external knowledge, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). While several attempts have been proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) as an implicit knowledge source, it remains challenging since LLMs may generate hallucinations. Moreover, multiple knowledge sources, e.g., images, KGs and LLMs, cannot be readily aligned for complex scenarios. To tackle these, we present a novel modality-aware integration with LLMs for KVQA (MAIL). It carefully leverages multimodal knowledge for both image understanding and knowledge reasoning. Specifically, (i) we propose a two-stage prompting strategy with LLMs to densely embody the image into a scene graph with detailed visual features; (ii) We construct a coupled concept graph by linking the mentioned entities with external facts. (iii) A tailored pseudo-siamese graph medium fusion is designed for sufficient multimodal fusion. We utilize the shared mentioned entities in two graphs as mediums to bridge a tight inter-modal exchange, while maximally preserving insightful intra-modal learning by constraining the fusion within mediums.

Are LLMs Rational Investors? A Study on Detecting and Reducing the Financial Bias in LLMs,"Yuhang Zhou, Yuchen Ni, Yunhui Gan, Zhangyue Yin, Xiang Liu, Jian Zhang, Sen Liu, Xipeng Qiu, Guangnan Ye, Hongfeng Chai","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in financial analysis for interpreting complex market data and trends. However, their use is challenged by intrinsic biases (e.g., risk-preference bias) and a superficial understanding of market intricacies, necessitating a thorough assessment of their financial insight. To address these issues, we introduce Financial Bias Indicators (FBI), a framework with components like Bias Unveiler, Bias Detective, Bias Tracker, and Bias Antidote to identify, detect, analyze, and eliminate irrational biases in LLMs. By combining behavioral finance principles with bias examination, we evaluate 23 leading LLMs and propose a de-biasing method based on financial causal knowledge. Results show varying degrees of financial irrationality among models, influenced by their design and training. Models trained specifically on financial datasets may exhibit more irrationality, and even larger financial language models (FinLLMs) can show more bias than smaller, general models. We utilize four prompt-based methods incorporating causal debiasing, effectively reducing financial biases in these models. This work enhances the understanding of LLMs' bias in financial applications, laying the foundation for developing more reliable and rational financial analysis tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12713v2,2024-02
HumanEval on Latest GPT Models -- 2024,"Daniel Li, Lincoln Murr","In 2023, we are using the latest models of GPT-4 to advance program synthesis. The large language models have significantly improved the state-of-the-art for this purpose. To make these advancements more accessible, we have created a repository that connects these models to Huamn Eval. This dataset was initally developed to be used with a language model called CODEGEN on natural and programming language data. The utility of these trained models is showcased by demonstrating their competitive performance in zero-shot Python code generation on HumanEval tasks compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. Additionally, this gives way to developing more multi-step paradigm synthesis. This benchmark features 160 diverse problem sets factorized into multistep prompts that our analysis shows significantly improves program synthesis over single-turn inputs.

Thermometer: Towards Universal Calibration for Large Language Models,"Maohao Shen, Subhro Das, Kristjan Greenewald, Prasanna Sattigeri, Gregory Wornell, Soumya Ghosh","We consider the issue of calibration in large language models (LLM). Recent studies have found that common interventions such as instruction tuning often result in poorly calibrated LLMs. Although calibration is well-explored in traditional applications, calibrating LLMs is uniquely challenging. These challenges stem as much from the severe computational requirements of LLMs as from their versatility, which allows them to be applied to diverse tasks. Addressing these challenges, we propose THERMOMETER, a calibration approach tailored to LLMs. THERMOMETER learns an auxiliary model, given data from multiple tasks, for calibrating a LLM. It is computationally efficient, preserves the accuracy of the LLM, and produces better-calibrated responses for new tasks. Extensive empirical evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08819v2,2024-02

FormulaReasoning: A Dataset for Formula-Based Numerical Reasoning,"Xiao Li, Bolin Zhu, Sichen Liu, Yin Zhu, Yiwei Liu, Gong Cheng","The application of formulas is a fundamental ability of humans when addressing numerical reasoning problems. However, existing numerical reasoning datasets seldom indicate explicitly the formulas employed during the reasoning steps. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset for formula-based numerical reasoning called FormulaReasoning, which consists of 5,420 reasoning-based questions. We employ it to conduct evaluations of LLMs with size ranging from 7B to over 100B parameters utilizing zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought methods, and we further explore using retrieval-augmented LLMs provided with an external formula database associated with our dataset. We also experiment with supervised methods where we divide the reasoning process into formula generation, parameter extraction, and numerical calculation, and perform data augmentation. Our empirical findings underscore the significant potential for improvement in existing models when applied to our challenging, formula-driven FormulaReasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12692v4,2024-02
Tree-Planted Transformers: Unidirectional Transformer Language Models with Implicit Syntactic Supervision,"Ryo Yoshida, Taiga Someya, Yohei Oseki","Syntactic Language Models (SLMs) can be trained efficiently to reach relatively high performance; however, they have trouble with inference efficiency due to the explicit generation of syntactic structures. In this paper, we propose a new method dubbed tree-planting: instead of explicitly generating syntactic structures, we ""plant"" trees into attention weights of unidirectional Transformer LMs to implicitly reflect syntactic structures of natural language. Specifically, unidirectional Transformer LMs trained with tree-planting will be called Tree-Planted Transformers (TPT), which inherit the training efficiency from SLMs without changing the inference efficiency of their underlying Transformer LMs. Targeted syntactic evaluations on the SyntaxGym benchmark demonstrated that TPTs, despite the lack of explicit generation of syntactic structures, significantly outperformed not only vanilla Transformer LMs but also various SLMs that generate hundreds of syntactic structures in parallel. This result suggests that TPTs can learn human-like syntactic knowledge as data-efficiently as SLMs while maintaining the modeling space of Transformer LMs unchanged.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12691v2,2024-02
Simpson's Paradox and the Accuracy-Fluency Tradeoff in Translation,"Zheng Wei Lim, Ekaterina Vylomova, Trevor Cohn, Charles Kemp","A good translation should be faithful to the source and should respect the norms of the target language. We address a theoretical puzzle about the relationship between these objectives. On one hand, intuition and some prior work suggest that accuracy and fluency should trade off against each other, and that capturing every detail of the source can only be achieved at the cost of fluency. On the other hand, quality assessment researchers often suggest that accuracy and fluency are highly correlated and difficult for human raters to distinguish (Callison-Burch et al., 2007). We show that the tension between these views is an instance of Simpson's paradox, and that accuracy and fluency are positively correlated at the level of the corpus but trade off at the level of individual source segments. We further suggest that the relationship between accuracy and fluency is best evaluated at the segment (or sentence) level, and that the trade off between these dimensions has implications both for assessing translation quality and developing improved MT systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12690v2,2024-02

SoftQE incorporates knowledge from LLMs by mapping embeddings of input queries to those of the LLM-expanded queries. While improvements over various strong baselines on in-domain MS-MARCO metrics are marginal, SoftQE improves performance by 2.83 absolute percentage points on average on five out-of-domain BEIR tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12663v1,2024-02

In this paper, we introduce FinBen, the first extensive open-source evaluation benchmark, including 36 datasets spanning 24 financial tasks, covering seven critical aspects: information extraction (IE), textual analysis, question answering (QA), text generation, risk management, forecasting, and decision-making. FinBen offers several key innovations: a broader range of tasks and datasets, the first evaluation of stock trading, novel agent and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation, and three novel open-source evaluation datasets for text summarization, question answering, and stock trading. Our evaluation of 15 representative LLMs, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and the latest Gemini, reveals several key findings: While LLMs excel in IE and textual analysis, they struggle with advanced reasoning and complex tasks like text generation and forecasting. GPT-4 excels in IE and stock trading, while Gemini is better at text generation and forecasting. Instruction-tuned LLMs improve textual analysis but offer limited benefits for complex tasks such as QA. FinBen has been used to host the first financial LLMs shared task at the FinNLP-AgentScen workshop during IJCAI-2024, attracting 12 teams.

"OWSM-CTC: An Open Encoder-Only Speech Foundation Model for Speech Recognition, Translation, and Language Identification","Yifan Peng, Yui Sudo, Muhammad Shakeel, Shinji Watanabe","There has been an increasing interest in large speech models that can perform multiple tasks in a single model. Such models usually adopt an encoder-decoder or decoder-only architecture due to their popularity and good performance in many domains. However, autoregressive models can be slower during inference compared to non-autoregressive models and also have potential risks of hallucination. Though prior studies observed promising results of non-autoregressive models for certain tasks at small scales, it remains unclear if they can be scaled to speech-to-text generation in diverse languages and tasks. Inspired by the Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) project, we propose OWSM-CTC, a novel encoder-only speech foundation model based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). It is trained on 180k hours of public audio data for multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST), and language identification (LID). Compared to encoder-decoder OWSM, our OWSM-CTC achieves competitive results on ASR and up to 24% relative improvement on ST, while it is more robust and 3 to 4 times faster for inference. OWSM-CTC also improves the long-form ASR result with 20x speed-up. We will publicly release our code, pre-trained model, and training logs to promote open science in speech foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12654v3,2024-02
CHATATC: Large Language Model-Driven Conversational Agents for Supporting Strategic Air Traffic Flow Management,"Sinan Abdulhak, Wayne Hubbard, Karthik Gopalakrishnan, Max Z.

The adoption of LLMs for personal and professional use is fueled by the natural interactions between human users and computer applications such as ChatGPT, along with powerful summarization and text generation capabilities. Given the widespread use of such generative AI tools, in this work we investigate how these tools can be deployed in a non-safety critical, strategic traffic flow management setting. Specifically, we train an LLM, CHATATC, based on a large historical data set of Ground Delay Program (GDP) issuances, spanning 2000-2023 and consisting of over 80,000 GDP implementations, revisions, and cancellations. We test the query and response capabilities of CHATATC, documenting successes (e.g., providing correct GDP rates, durations, and reason) and shortcomings (e.g,. superlative questions). We also detail the design of a graphical user interface for future users to interact and collaborate with the CHATATC conversational agent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14850v2,2024-02
Bias in Language Models: Beyond Trick Tests and Toward RUTEd Evaluation,"Kristian Lum, Jacy Reese Anthis, Chirag Nagpal, Alexander D'Amour","Bias benchmarks are a popular method for studying the negative impacts of bias in LLMs, yet there has been little empirical investigation of whether these benchmarks are actually indicative of how real world harm may manifest in the real world. In this work, we study the correspondence between such decontextualized ""trick tests"" and evaluations that are more grounded in Realistic Use and Tangible {Effects (i.e. RUTEd evaluations). We explore this correlation in the context of gender-occupation bias--a popular genre of bias evaluation. We compare three de-contextualized evaluations adapted from the current literature to three analogous RUTEd evaluations applied to long-form content generation. We conduct each evaluation for seven instruction-tuned LLMs. For the RUTEd evaluations, we conduct repeated trials of three text generation tasks: children's bedtime stories, user personas, and English language learning exercises. We found no correspondence between trick tests and RUTEd evaluations. Specifically, selecting the least biased model based on the de-contextualized results coincides with selecting the model with the best performance on RUTEd evaluations only as often as random chance. We conclude that evaluations that are not based in realistic use are likely insufficient to mitigate and assess bias and real-world harms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12649v1,2024-02
StyleDubber: Towards Multi-Scale Style Learning for Movie Dubbing,"Gaoxiang Cong, Yuankai Qi, Liang Li, Amin Beheshti, Zhedong Zhang, Anton van den Hengel, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Chenggang Yan, Qingming Huang","Given a script, the challenge in Movie Dubbing (Visual Voice Cloning, V2C) is to generate speech that aligns well with the video in both time and emotion, based on the tone of a reference audio track. Existing state-of-the-art V2C models break the phonemes in the script according to the divisions between video frames, which solves the temporal alignment problem but leads to incomplete phoneme pronunciation and poor identity stability. To address this problem, we propose StyleDubber, which switches dubbing learning from the frame level to phoneme level. It contains three main components: (1) A multimodal style adaptor operating at the phoneme level to learn pronunciation style from the reference audio, and generate intermediate representations informed by the facial emotion presented in the video; (2) An utterance-level style learning module, which guides both the mel-spectrogram decoding and the refining processes from the intermediate embeddings to improve the overall style expression; And (3) a phoneme-guided lip aligner to maintain lip sync. Extensive experiments on two of the primary benchmarks, V2C and Grid, demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed method as compared to the current stateof-the-art.

Reflect-RL: Two-Player Online RL Fine-Tuning for LMs,"Runlong Zhou, Simon S. Du, Beibin Li","As language models (LMs) demonstrate their capabilities in various fields, their application to tasks requiring multi-round interactions has become increasingly popular. These tasks usually have complex dynamics, so supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a limited offline dataset does not yield good performance. However, only a few works attempted to directly train the LMs within interactive decision-making environments. We aim to create an effective approach to fine-tune LMs with online reinforcement learning (RL) in these environments. We propose Reflect-RL, a two-player system to fine-tune an LM using SFT and online RL, where a frozen reflection model (player) assists the policy model (player). To generate data for the warm-up SFT stage, we use negative example generation to enhance the error-correction ability of the reflection model. Furthermore, we designed single-prompt action enumeration and applied curriculum learning to allow the policy model to learn more efficiently. Empirically, we verify that Reflect-RL outperforms SFT and online RL without reflection. Testing results indicate GPT-2 XL 1.56B fine-tuned with Reflect-RL outperforms larger open-source LMs, such as Mistral 7B.

What is a word?,Elliot Murphy,"In order to design strong paradigms for isolating lexical access and semantics, we need to know what a word is. Surprisingly few linguists and philosophers have a clear model of what a word is, even though words impact basically every aspect of human life.

This short pedagogical document outlines what the lexicon is most certainly not (though is often mistakenly taken to be), what it might be (based on current good theories), and what some implications for experimental design are.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12605v1,2024-02
Multimodal Fusion of EHR in Structures and Semantics: Integrating Clinical Records and Notes with Hypergraph and LLM,"Hejie Cui, Xinyu Fang, Ran Xu, Xuan Kan, Joyce C. Ho, Carl Yang","Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become increasingly popular to support clinical decision-making and healthcare in recent decades. EHRs usually contain heterogeneous information, such as structural data in tabular form and unstructured data in textual notes. Different types of information in EHRs can complement each other and provide a more complete picture of the health status of a patient. While there has been a lot of research on representation learning of structured EHR data, the fusion of different types of EHR data (multimodal fusion) is not well studied. This is mostly because of the complex medical coding systems used and the noise and redundancy present in the written notes. In this work, we propose a new framework called MINGLE, which integrates both structures and semantics in EHR effectively. Our framework uses a two-level infusion strategy to combine medical concept semantics and clinical note semantics into hypergraph neural networks, which learn the complex interactions between different types of data to generate visit representations for downstream prediction. Experiment results on two EHR datasets, the public MIMIC-III and private CRADLE, show that MINGLE can effectively improve predictive performance by 11.83% relatively, enhancing semantic integration as well as multimodal fusion for structural and textual EHR data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08818v1,2024-02
Standardize: Aligning Language Models with Expert-Defined Standards for Content Generation,"Joseph Marvin Imperial, Gail Forey, Harish Tayyar Madabushi","Domain experts across engineering, healthcare, and education follow strict standards for producing quality content such as technical manuals, medication instructions, and children's reading materials. However, current works in controllable text generation have yet to explore using these standards as references for control. Towards this end, we introduce Standardize, a retrieval-style in-context learning-based framework to guide large language models to align with expert-defined standards. Focusing on English language standards in the education domain as a use case, we consider the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and Common Core Standards (CCS) for the task of open-ended content generation. Our findings show that models can gain a 45% to 100% increase in precise accuracy across open and commercial LLMs evaluated, demonstrating that the use of knowledge artifacts extracted from standards and integrating them in the generation process can effectively guide models to produce better standard-aligned content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12593v2,2024-02
Evolving AI Collectives to Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation,"Shiyang Lai, Yujin Potter, Junsol Kim, Richard Zhuang, Dawn Song, James Evans","Large language model behavior is shaped by the language of those with whom they interact.

Here, we call upon the research community to investigate these ""societies"" of interacting artificial intelligences to increase their rewards and reduce their risks for human society and the health of online environments. We use a small ""community"" of models and their evolving outputs to illustrate how such emergent, decentralized AI collectives can spontaneously expand the bounds of human diversity and reduce the risk of toxic, anti-social behavior online.

Detecting misinformation through Framing Theory: the Frame Element-based Model,"Guan Wang, Rebecca Frederick, Jinglong Duan, William Wong, Verica Rupar, Weihua Li, Quan Bai","In this paper, we delve into the rapidly evolving challenge of misinformation detection, with a specific focus on the nuanced manipulation of narrative frames - an under-explored area within the AI community. The potential for Generative AI models to generate misleading narratives underscores the urgency of this problem. Drawing from communication and framing theories, we posit that the presentation or 'framing' of accurate information can dramatically alter its interpretation, potentially leading to misinformation. We highlight this issue through real-world examples, demonstrating how shifts in narrative frames can transmute fact-based information into misinformation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an innovative approach leveraging the power of pre-trained Large Language Models and deep neural networks to detect misinformation originating from accurate facts portrayed under different frames. These advanced AI techniques offer unprecedented capabilities in identifying complex patterns within unstructured data critical for examining the subtleties of narrative frames. The objective of this paper is to bridge a significant research gap in the AI domain, providing valuable insights and methodologies for tackling framing-induced misinformation, thus contributing to the advancement of responsible and trustworthy AI technologies. Several experiments are intensively conducted and experimental results explicitly demonstrate the various impact of elements of framing theory proving the rationale of applying framing theory to increase the performance in misinformation detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15525v1,2024-02
GenAudit: Fixing Factual Errors in Language Model Outputs with Evidence,"Kundan Krishna, Sanjana Ramprasad, Prakhar Gupta, Byron C. Wallace, Zachary C. Lipton, Jeffrey P. Bigham","LLMs can generate factually incorrect statements even when provided access to reference documents. Such errors can be dangerous in high-stakes applications (e.g., document-grounded QA for healthcare or finance). We present GenAudit -- a tool intended to assist fact-checking LLM responses for document-grounded tasks. GenAudit suggests edits to the LLM response by revising or removing claims that are not supported by the reference document, and also presents evidence from the reference for facts that do appear to have support. We train models to execute these tasks, and design an interactive interface to present suggested edits and evidence to users. Comprehensive evaluation by human raters shows that GenAudit can detect errors in 8 different LLM outputs when summarizing documents from diverse domains. To ensure that most errors are flagged by the system, we propose a method that can increase the error recall while minimizing impact on precision. We release our tool (GenAudit) and fact-checking model for public use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12566v2,2024-02
Confidence Matters: Revisiting Intrinsic Self-Correction Capabilities of Large Language Models,"Loka Li, Zhenhao Chen, Guangyi Chen, Yixuan Zhang, Yusheng Su, Eric Xing, Kun Zhang","The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed an increasing interest in their self-correction capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the intrinsic self-correction of LLMs, attempting to address the ongoing debate about its feasibility. Our research has identified an important latent factor - the ""confidence"" of LLMs - during the self-correction process. Overlooking this factor may cause the models to over-criticize themselves, resulting in unreliable conclusions regarding the efficacy of self-correction. We have experimentally observed that LLMs possess the capability to understand the ""confidence"" in their own responses. It motivates us to develop an ""If-or-Else"" (IoE) prompting framework, designed to guide LLMs in assessing their own ""confidence"", facilitating intrinsic self-corrections. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that our IoE-based Prompt can achieve a consistent improvement regarding the accuracy of self-corrected responses over the initial answers. Our study not only sheds light on the underlying factors affecting self-correction in LLMs, but also introduces a practical framework that utilizes the IoE prompting principle to efficiently improve self-correction capabilities with ""confidence"".

CausalGym: Benchmarking causal interpretability methods on linguistic tasks,"Aryaman Arora, Dan Jurafsky, Christopher Potts","Language models (LMs) have proven to be powerful tools for psycholinguistic research, but most prior work has focused on purely behavioural measures (e.g., surprisal comparisons). At the same time, research in model interpretability has begun to illuminate the abstract causal mechanisms shaping LM behavior. To help bring these strands of research closer together, we introduce CausalGym. We adapt and expand the SyntaxGym suite of tasks to benchmark the ability of interpretability methods to causally affect model behaviour. To illustrate how CausalGym can be used, we study the pythia models (14M--6.9B) and assess the causal efficacy of a wide range of interpretability methods, including linear probing and distributed alignment search (DAS). We find that DAS outperforms the other methods, and so we use it to study the learning trajectory of two difficult linguistic phenomena in pythia-1b: negative polarity item licensing and filler--gap dependencies. Our analysis shows that the mechanism implementing both of these tasks is learned in discrete stages, not gradually.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12560v1,2024-02
Creating a Fine Grained Entity Type Taxonomy Using LLMs,"Michael Gunn, Dohyun Park, Nidhish Kamath","In this study, we investigate the potential of GPT-4 and its advanced iteration, GPT-4 Turbo, in autonomously developing a detailed entity type taxonomy. Our objective is to construct a comprehensive taxonomy, starting from a broad classification of entity types - including objects, time, locations, organizations, events, actions, and subjects - similar to existing manually curated taxonomies. This classification is then progressively refined through iterative prompting techniques, leveraging GPT-4's internal knowledge base. The result is an extensive taxonomy comprising over 5000 nuanced entity types, which demonstrates remarkable quality upon subjective evaluation.   We employed a straightforward yet effective prompting strategy, enabling the taxonomy to be dynamically expanded. The practical applications of this detailed taxonomy are diverse and significant. It facilitates the creation of new, more intricate branches through pattern-based combinations and notably enhances information extraction tasks, such as relation extraction and event argument extraction. Our methodology not only introduces an innovative approach to taxonomy creation but also opens new avenues for applying such taxonomies in various computational linguistics and AI-related fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12557v1,2024-02
IMBUE: Improving Interpersonal Effectiveness through Simulation and Just-in-time Feedback with Human-Language Model Interaction,"Inna Wanyin Lin, Ashish Sharma, Christopher Michael Rytting, Adam S. Miner, Jina Suh, Tim Althoff","Navigating certain communication situations can be challenging due to individuals' lack of skills and the interference of strong emotions. However, effective learning opportunities are rarely accessible. In this work, we conduct a human-centered study that uses language models to simulate bespoke communication training and provide just-in-time feedback to support the practice and learning of interpersonal effectiveness skills. We apply the interpersonal effectiveness framework from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), DEAR MAN, which focuses on both conversational and emotional skills. We present IMBUE, an interactive training system that provides feedback 25% more similar to experts' feedback, compared to that generated by GPT-4. IMBUE is the first to focus on communication skills and emotion management simultaneously, incorporate experts' domain knowledge in providing feedback, and be grounded in psychology theory. Through a randomized trial of 86 participants, we find that IMBUE's simulation-only variant significantly improves participants' self-efficacy (up to 17%) and reduces negative emotions (up to 25%). With IMBUE's additional just-in-time feedback, participants demonstrate 17% improvement in skill mastery, along with greater enhancements in self-efficacy (27% more) and reduction of negative emotions (16% more) compared to simulation-only. The improvement in skill mastery is the only measure that is transferred to new and more difficult situations; situation specific training is necessary for improving self-efficacy and emotion reduction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12556v1,2024-02

However, concerns have arisen regarding the trustworthiness of LLMs outputs, particularly in closed-book question-answering tasks, where non-experts may struggle to identify inaccuracies due to the absence of contextual or ground truth information. This paper introduces TrustScore, a framework based on the concept of Behavioral Consistency, which evaluates whether an LLMs response aligns with its intrinsic knowledge. Additionally, TrustScore can seamlessly integrate with fact-checking methods, which assesses alignment with external knowledge sources.

Parallel Structures in Pre-training Data Yield In-Context Learning,"Yanda Chen, Chen Zhao, Zhou Yu, Kathleen McKeown, He He","Pre-trained language models (LMs) are capable of in-context learning (ICL): they can adapt to a task with only a few examples given in the prompt without any parameter update. However, it is unclear where this capability comes from as there is a stark distribution shift between pre-training text and ICL prompts. In this work, we study what patterns of the pre-training data contribute to ICL. We find that LMs' ICL ability depends on $\textit{parallel structures}$ in the pre-training data -- pairs of phrases following similar templates in the same context window. Specifically, we detect parallel structures by checking whether training on one phrase improves prediction of the other, and conduct ablation experiments to study their effect on ICL. We show that removing parallel structures in the pre-training data reduces LMs' ICL accuracy by 51% (vs 2% from random ablation). This drop persists even when excluding common patterns such as n-gram repetitions and long-range dependency, showing the diversity and generality of parallel structures. A closer look at the detected parallel structures indicates that they cover diverse linguistic tasks and span long distances in the data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12530v1,2024-02
Induced Model Matching: How Restricted Models Can Help Larger Ones,"Usama Muneeb, Mesrob I. Ohannessian","We consider scenarios where a very accurate predictive model using restricted features is available at the time of training of a larger, full-featured, model. This restricted model may be thought of as ""side-information"", derived either from an auxiliary exhaustive dataset or on the same dataset, by forcing the restriction. How can the restricted model be useful to the full model? We propose an approach for transferring the knowledge of the restricted model to the full model, by aligning the full model's context-restricted performance with that of the restricted model's. We call this methodology Induced Model Matching (IMM) and first illustrate its general applicability by using logistic regression as a toy example. We then explore IMM's use in language modeling, the application that initially inspired it, and where it offers an explicit foundation in contrast to the implicit use of restricted models in techniques such as noising. We demonstrate the methodology on both LSTM and transformer full models, using $N$-grams as restricted models. To further illustrate the potential of the principle whenever it is much cheaper to collect restricted rather than full information, we conclude with a simple RL example where POMDP policies can improve learned MDP policies via IMM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12513v1,2024-02
Your Vision-Language Model Itself Is a Strong Filter: Towards High-Quality Instruction Tuning with Data Selection,"Ruibo Chen, Yihan Wu, Lichang Chen, Guodong Liu, Qi He, Tianyi Xiong, Chenxi Liu, Junfeng Guo, Heng Huang","Data selection in instruction tuning emerges as a pivotal process for acquiring high-quality data and training instruction-following large language models (LLMs), but it is still a new and unexplored research area for vision-language models (VLMs). Existing data selection approaches on LLMs either rely on single unreliable scores, or use downstream tasks for selection, which is time-consuming and can lead to potential over-fitting on the chosen evaluation datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dataset selection method, Self-Filter, that utilizes the VLM itself as a filter. This approach is inspired by the observation that VLMs benefit from training with the most challenging instructions. Self-Filter operates in two stages. In the first stage, we devise a scoring network to evaluate the difficulty of training instructions, which is co-trained with the VLM. In the second stage, we use the trained score net to measure the difficulty of each instruction, select the most challenging samples, and penalize similar samples to encourage diversity. Comprehensive experiments on LLaVA and MiniGPT-4 show that Self-Filter can reach better results compared to full data settings with merely about 15% samples, and can achieve superior performance against competitive baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12501v1,2024-02
Do Pre-Trained Language Models Detect and Understand Semantic Underspecification? Ask the DUST!,"Frank Wildenburg, Michael Hanna, Sandro Pezzelle","In everyday language use, speakers frequently utter and interpret sentences that are semantically underspecified, namely, whose content is insufficient to fully convey their message or interpret them univocally. For example, to interpret the underspecified sentence ""Don't spend too much"", which leaves implicit what (not) to spend, additional linguistic context or outside knowledge is needed. In this work, we propose a novel Dataset of semantically Underspecified Sentences grouped by Type (DUST) and use it to study whether pre-trained language models (LMs) correctly identify and interpret underspecified sentences. We find that newer LMs are reasonably able to identify underspecified sentences when explicitly prompted. However, interpreting them correctly is much harder for any LMs. Our experiments show that when interpreting underspecified sentences, LMs exhibit little uncertainty, contrary to what theoretical accounts of underspecification would predict. Overall, our study reveals limitations in current models' processing of sentence semantics and highlights the importance of using naturalistic data and communicative scenarios when evaluating LMs' language capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12486v2,2024-02
Asynchronous and Segmented Bidirectional Encoding for NMT,"Jingpu Yang, Zehua Han, Mengyu Xiang, Helin Wang, Yuxiao Huang, Miao Fang","With the rapid advancement of Neural Machine Translation (NMT), enhancing translation efficiency and quality has become a focal point of research. Despite the commendable performance of general models such as the Transformer in various aspects, they still fall short in processing long sentences and fully leveraging bidirectional contextual information. This paper introduces an improved model based on the Transformer, implementing an asynchronous and segmented bidirectional decoding strategy aimed at elevating translation efficiency and accuracy. Compared to traditional unidirectional translations from left-to-right or right-to-left, our method demonstrates heightened efficiency and improved translation quality, particularly in handling long sentences. Experimental results on the IWSLT2017 dataset confirm the effectiveness of our approach in accelerating translation and increasing accuracy, especially surpassing traditional unidirectional strategies in long sentence translation. Furthermore, this study analyzes the impact of sentence length on decoding outcomes and explores the model's performance in various scenarios. The findings of this research not only provide an effective encoding strategy for the NMT field but also pave new avenues and directions for future studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14849v1,2024-02
Artifacts or Abduction: How Do LLMs Answer Multiple-Choice Questions Without the Question?,"Nishant Balepur, Abhilasha Ravichander, Rachel Rudinger","Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is often used to evaluate large language models (LLMs). To see if MCQA assesses LLMs as intended, we probe if LLMs can perform MCQA with choices-only prompts, where models must select the correct answer only from the choices. In three MCQA datasets and four LLMs, this prompt bests a majority baseline in 11/12 cases, with up to 0.33 accuracy gain. To help explain this behavior, we conduct an in-depth, black-box analysis on memorization, choice dynamics, and question inference. Our key findings are threefold. First, we find no evidence that the choices-only accuracy stems from memorization alone. Second, priors over individual choices do not fully explain choices-only accuracy, hinting that LLMs use the group dynamics of choices. Third, LLMs have some ability to infer a relevant question from choices, and surprisingly can sometimes even match the original question. Inferring the original question is an impressive reasoning strategy, but it cannot fully explain the high choices-only accuracy of LLMs in MCQA. Thus, while LLMs are not fully incapable of reasoning in MCQA, we still advocate for the use of stronger baselines in MCQA benchmarks, the design of robust MCQA datasets for fair evaluations, and further efforts to explain LLM decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12483v2,2024-02
The Revolution of Multimodal Large Language Models: A Survey,"Davide Caffagni, Federico Cocchi, Luca Barsellotti, Nicholas Moratelli, Sara Sarto, Lorenzo Baraldi, Lorenzo Baraldi, Marcella Cornia, Rita Cucchiara","Connecting text and visual modalities plays an essential role in generative intelligence. For this reason, inspired by the success of large language models, significant research efforts are being devoted to the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). These models can seamlessly integrate visual and textual modalities, while providing a dialogue-based interface and instruction-following capabilities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of recent visual-based MLLMs, analyzing their architectural choices, multimodal alignment strategies, and training techniques. We also conduct a detailed analysis of these models across a wide range of tasks, including visual grounding, image generation and editing, visual understanding, and domain-specific applications. Additionally, we compile and describe training datasets and evaluation benchmarks, conducting comparisons among existing models in terms of performance and computational requirements. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art, laying the groundwork for future MLLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12451v2,2024-02
Understanding Fine-grained Distortions in Reports of Scientific Findings,"Amelie Wührl, Dustin Wright, Roman Klinger, Isabelle Augenstein","Distorted science communication harms individuals and society as it can lead to unhealthy behavior change and decrease trust in scientific institutions. Given the rapidly increasing volume of science communication in recent years, a fine-grained understanding of how findings from scientific publications are reported to the general public, and methods to detect distortions from the original work automatically, are crucial. Prior work focused on individual aspects of distortions or worked with unpaired data. In this work, we make three foundational contributions towards addressing this problem: (1) annotating 1,600 instances of scientific findings from academic papers paired with corresponding findings as reported in news articles and tweets wrt. four characteristics: causality, certainty, generality and sensationalism; (2) establishing baselines for automatically detecting these characteristics; and (3) analyzing the prevalence of changes in these characteristics in both human-annotated and large-scale unlabeled data. Our results show that scientific findings frequently undergo subtle distortions when reported. Tweets distort findings more often than science news reports. Detecting fine-grained distortions automatically poses a challenging task. In our experiments, fine-tuned task-specific models consistently outperform few-shot LLM prompting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12431v1,2024-02
"Sequoia: Scalable, Robust, and Hardware-aware Speculative Decoding","Zhuoming Chen, Avner May, Ruslan Svirschevski, Yuhsun Huang, Max Ryabinin, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen","As the usage of large language models (LLMs) grows, performing efficient inference with these models becomes increasingly important. While speculative decoding has recently emerged as a promising direction for speeding up inference, existing methods are limited in their ability to scale to larger speculation budgets, and adapt to different hyperparameters and hardware. This paper introduces Sequoia, a scalable, robust, and hardware-aware algorithm for speculative decoding. To attain better scalability, Sequoia introduces a dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal tree structure for the speculated tokens. To achieve robust speculative performance, Sequoia uses a novel sampling and verification method that outperforms prior work across different decoding temperatures. Finally, Sequoia introduces a hardware-aware tree optimizer that maximizes speculative performance by automatically selecting the token tree size and depth for a given hardware platform. Evaluation shows that Sequoia improves the decoding speed of Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and Vicuna-33B on an A100 by up to $4.04\times$, $3.73\times$, and $2.27\times$. For offloading setting on L40, Sequoia achieves as low as 0.56 s/token for exact Llama2-70B inference latency, which is $9.96\times$ on our optimized offloading system (5.6 s/token), $9.7\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference, $19.5\times$ than Huggingface Accelerate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12374v2,2024-02
HunFlair2 in a cross-corpus evaluation of biomedical named entity recognition and normalization tools,"Mario Sänger, Samuele Garda, Xing David Wang, Leon Weber-Genzel, Pia Droop, Benedikt Fuchs, Alan Akbik, Ulf Leser","With the exponential growth of the life science literature, biomedical text mining (BTM) has become an essential technology for accelerating the extraction of insights from publications. Identifying named entities (e.g., diseases, drugs, or genes) in texts and their linkage to reference knowledge bases are crucial steps in BTM pipelines to enable information aggregation from different documents. However, tools for these two steps are rarely applied in the same context in which they were developed. Instead, they are applied in the wild, i.e., on application-dependent text collections different from those used for the tools' training, varying, e.g., in focus, genre, style, and text type. This raises the question of whether the reported performance of BTM tools can be trusted for downstream applications. Here, we report on the results of a carefully designed cross-corpus benchmark for named entity extraction, where tools were applied systematically to corpora not used during their training. Based on a survey of 28 published systems, we selected five for an in-depth analysis on three publicly available corpora encompassing four different entity types. Comparison between tools results in a mixed picture and shows that, in a cross-corpus setting, the performance is significantly lower than the one reported in an in-corpus setting. HunFlair2 showed the best performance on average, being closely followed by PubTator. Our results indicate that users of BTM tools should expect diminishing performances when applying them in the wild compared to original publications and show that further research is necessary to make BTM tools more robust.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12372v2,2024-02
AnaloBench: Benchmarking the Identification of Abstract and Long-context Analogies,"Xiao Ye, Andrew Wang, Jacob Choi, Yining Lu, Shreya Sharma, Lingfeng Shen, Vijay Tiyyala, Nicholas Andrews, Daniel Khashabi","Humans regularly engage in analogical thinking, relating personal experiences to current situations (X is analogous to Y because of Z). Analogical thinking allows humans to solve problems in creative ways, grasp difficult concepts, and articulate ideas more effectively. Can language models (LMs) do the same? To answer this question, we propose AnaloBench, a benchmark to determine analogical reasoning ability in LMs. Our benchmarking approach focuses on aspects of this ability that are common among humans: (i) recalling related experiences from a large amount of information, and (ii) applying analogical reasoning to complex and lengthy scenarios. We test a broad collection of proprietary models (e.g., GPT family, Claude V2) and open source models such as LLaMA2. As in prior results, scaling up LMs results in some performance boosts. Surprisingly, scale offers minimal gains when, (i) analogies involve lengthy scenarios, or (ii) recalling relevant scenarios from a large pool of information, a process analogous to finding a needle in a haystack. We hope these observations encourage further research in this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12370v2,2024-02
A synthetic data approach for domain generalization of NLI models,"Mohammad Javad Hosseini, Andrey Petrov, Alex Fabrikant, Annie Louis","Natural Language Inference (NLI) remains an important benchmark task for LLMs. NLI datasets are a springboard for transfer learning to other semantic tasks, and NLI models are standard tools for identifying the faithfulness of model-generated text. There are several large scale NLI datasets today, and models have improved greatly by hill-climbing on these collections. Yet their realistic performance on out-of-distribution/domain data is less well-understood. We explore the opportunity for synthetic high-quality datasets to adapt NLI models for zero-shot use in downstream applications across new and unseen text domains. We demonstrate a new approach for generating NLI data in diverse domains and lengths, so far not covered by existing training sets. The resulting examples have meaningful premises, the hypotheses are formed in creative ways rather than simple edits to a few premise tokens, and the labels have high accuracy. We show that models trained on this data ($685$K synthetic examples) have the best generalization to completely new downstream test settings. On the TRUE benchmark, a T5-small model trained with our data improves around $7\%$ on average compared to training on the best alternative dataset. The improvements are more pronounced for smaller models, while still meaningful on a T5 XXL model. We also demonstrate gains on test sets when in-domain training data is augmented with our domain-general synthetic data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12368v2,2024-02
A Critical Evaluation of AI Feedback for Aligning Large Language Models,"Archit Sharma, Sedrick Keh, Eric Mitchell, Chelsea Finn, Kushal Arora, Thomas Kollar","Reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF) is a popular paradigm for improving the instruction-following abilities of powerful pre-trained language models. RLAIF first performs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using demonstrations from a teacher model and then further fine-tunes the model with reinforcement learning (RL), using feedback from a critic model. While recent popular open-source models have demonstrated substantial improvements in performance from the RL step, in this paper we question whether the complexity of this RL step is truly warranted for AI feedback. We show that the improvements of the RL step are virtually entirely due to the widespread practice of using a weaker teacher model (e.g. GPT-3.5) for SFT data collection than the critic (e.g., GPT-4) used for AI feedback generation. Specifically, we show that simple supervised fine-tuning with GPT-4 as the teacher outperforms existing RLAIF pipelines. More generally, we find that the gains from RLAIF vary substantially across base model families, test-time evaluation protocols, and critic models. Finally, we provide a mechanistic explanation for when SFT may outperform the full two-step RLAIF pipeline as well as suggestions for making RLAIF maximally useful in practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12366v1,2024-02
Emergent Word Order Universals from Cognitively-Motivated Language Models,"Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Ryo Ueda, Ryo Yoshida, Yohei Oseki, Ted Briscoe, Timothy Baldwin","The world's languages exhibit certain so-called typological or implicational universals; for example, Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) languages typically use postpositions. Explaining the source of such biases is a key goal of linguistics. We study word-order universals through a computational simulation with language models (LMs). Our experiments show that typologically-typical word orders tend to have lower perplexity estimated by LMs with cognitively plausible biases: syntactic biases, specific parsing strategies, and memory limitations. This suggests that the interplay of cognitive biases and predictability (perplexity) can explain many aspects of word-order universals. It also showcases the advantage of cognitively-motivated LMs, typically employed in cognitive modeling, in the simulation of language universals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12363v2,2024-02
LoRA+: Efficient Low Rank Adaptation of Large Models,"Soufiane Hayou, Nikhil Ghosh, Bin Yu","In this paper, we show that Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as originally introduced in Hu et al. (2021) leads to suboptimal finetuning of models with large width (embedding dimension). This is due to the fact that adapter matrices A and B in LoRA are updated with the same learning rate. Using scaling arguments for large width networks, we demonstrate that using the same learning rate for A and B does not allow efficient feature learning. We then show that this suboptimality of LoRA can be corrected simply by setting different learning rates for the LoRA adapter matrices A and B with a well-chosen ratio. We call this proposed algorithm LoRA$+$. In our extensive experiments, LoRA$+$ improves performance (1-2 $\%$ improvements) and finetuning speed (up to $\sim$ 2X SpeedUp), at the same computational cost as LoRA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12354v2,2024-02
Graph-Based Retriever Captures the Long Tail of Biomedical Knowledge,"Julien Delile, Srayanta Mukherjee, Anton Van Pamel, Leonid Zhukov","Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the way information is retrieved with vast amounts of knowledge being summarized and presented via natural language conversations. Yet, LLMs are prone to highlight the most frequently seen pieces of information from the training set and to neglect the rare ones. In the field of biomedical research, latest discoveries are key to academic and industrial actors and are obscured by the abundance of an ever-increasing literature corpus (the information overload problem). Surfacing new associations between biomedical entities, e.g., drugs, genes, diseases, with LLMs becomes a challenge of capturing the long-tail knowledge of the biomedical scientific production. To overcome this challenge, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to alleviate some of the shortcomings of LLMs by augmenting the prompts with context retrieved from external datasets. RAG methods typically select the context via maximum similarity search over text embeddings. In this study, we show that RAG methods leave out a significant proportion of relevant information due to clusters of over-represented concepts in the biomedical literature. We introduce a novel information-retrieval method that leverages a knowledge graph to downsample these clusters and mitigate the information overload problem. Its retrieval performance is about twice better than embedding similarity alternatives on both precision and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that both embedding similarity and knowledge graph retrieval methods can be advantageously combined into a hybrid model that outperforms both, enabling potential improvements to biomedical question-answering models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12352v1,2024-02
GTBench: Uncovering the Strategic Reasoning Limitations of LLMs via Game-Theoretic Evaluations,"Jinhao Duan, Renming Zhang, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Lichao Sun, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal, Tianlong Chen, Kaidi Xu","As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial. This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents. We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios. Then, we (1) Characterize the game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; and (2) Perform LLM-vs.-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation. We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Most open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct and Llama-2-70b-chat, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games, yet the recently released Llama-3-70b-Instruct makes up for this shortcoming. In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. We further characterize the game-theoretic properties of LLMs, such as equilibrium and Pareto Efficiency in repeated games. Detailed error profiles are provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior. We hope our research provides standardized protocols and serves as a foundation to spur further explorations in the strategic reasoning of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12348v2,2024-02
Emulated Disalignment: Safety Alignment for Large Language Models May Backfire!,"Zhanhui Zhou, Jie Liu, Zhichen Dong, Jiaheng Liu, Chao Yang, Wanli Ouyang, Yu Qiao","Large language models (LLMs) undergo safety alignment to ensure safe conversations with humans. However, this paper introduces a training-free attack method capable of reversing safety alignment, converting the outcomes of stronger alignment into greater potential for harm by accessing only LLM output token distributions. Specifically, our method achieves this reversal by contrasting the output token distribution of a safety-aligned language model (e.g., Llama-2-chat) against its pre-trained version (e.g., Llama-2), so that the token predictions are shifted towards the opposite direction of safety alignment. We name this method emulated disalignment (ED) because sampling from this contrastive distribution provably emulates the result of fine-tuning to minimize a safety reward. Our experiments with ED across three evaluation datasets and four model families (Llama-1, Llama-2, Mistral, and Alpaca) show that ED doubles the harmfulness of pre-trained models and outperforms strong baselines, achieving the highest harmful rates in 43 out of 48 evaluation subsets by a large margin. Eventually, given ED's reliance on language model output token distributions, which particularly compromises open-source models, our findings highlight the need to reassess the open accessibility of language models, even if they have been safety-aligned.

"Triple-Encoders: Representations That Fire Together, Wire Together","Justus-Jonas Erker, Florian Mai, Nils Reimers, Gerasimos Spanakis, Iryna Gurevych","Search-based dialog models typically re-encode the dialog history at every turn, incurring high cost. Curved Contrastive Learning, a representation learning method that encodes relative distances between utterances into the embedding space via a bi-encoder, has recently shown promising results for dialog modeling at far superior efficiency. While high efficiency is achieved through independently encoding utterances, this ignores the importance of contextualization. To overcome this issue, this study introduces triple-encoders, which efficiently compute distributed utterance mixtures from these independently encoded utterances through a novel hebbian inspired co-occurrence learning objective in a self-organizing manner, without using any weights, i.e., merely through local interactions. Empirically, we find that triple-encoders lead to a substantial improvement over bi-encoders, and even to better zero-shot generalization than single-vector representation models without requiring re-encoding. Our code (https://github.com/UKPLab/acl2024-triple-encoders) and model (https://huggingface.co/UKPLab/triple-encoders-dailydialog) are publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12332v2,2024-02
Query-Based Adversarial Prompt Generation,"Jonathan Hayase, Ema Borevkovic, Nicholas Carlini, Florian Tramèr, Milad Nasr","Recent work has shown it is possible to construct adversarial examples that cause an aligned language model to emit harmful strings or perform harmful behavior. Existing attacks work either in the white-box setting (with full access to the model weights), or through transferability: the phenomenon that adversarial examples crafted on one model often remain effective on other models. We improve on prior work with a query-based attack that leverages API access to a remote language model to construct adversarial examples that cause the model to emit harmful strings with (much) higher probability than with transfer-only attacks. We validate our attack on GPT-3.5 and OpenAI's safety classifier; we can cause GPT-3.5 to emit harmful strings that current transfer attacks fail at, and we can evade the safety classifier with nearly 100% probability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12329v2,2024-02
Shall We Team Up: Exploring Spontaneous Cooperation of Competing LLM Agents,"Zengqing Wu, Run Peng, Shuyuan Zheng, Qianying Liu, Xu Han, Brian Inhyuk Kwon, Makoto Onizuka, Shaojie Tang, Chuan Xiao","Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been utilized in social simulations, where they are often guided by carefully crafted instructions to stably exhibit human-like behaviors during simulations. Nevertheless, we doubt the necessity of shaping agents' behaviors for accurate social simulations. Instead, this paper emphasizes the importance of spontaneous phenomena, wherein agents deeply engage in contexts and make adaptive decisions without explicit directions. We explored spontaneous cooperation across three competitive scenarios and successfully simulated the gradual emergence of cooperation, findings that align closely with human behavioral data. This approach not only aids the computational social science community in bridging the gap between simulations and real-world dynamics but also offers the AI community a novel method to assess LLMs' capability of deliberate reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12327v3,2024-02
PsychoGAT: A Novel Psychological Measurement Paradigm through Interactive Fiction Games with LLM Agents,"Qisen Yang, Zekun Wang, Honghui Chen, Shenzhi Wang, Yifan Pu, Xin Gao, Wenhao Huang, Shiji Song, Gao Huang","Psychological measurement is essential for mental health, self-understanding, and personal development. Traditional methods, such as self-report scales and psychologist interviews, often face challenges with engagement and accessibility. While game-based and LLM-based tools have been explored to improve user interest and automate assessment, they struggle to balance engagement with generalizability. In this work, we propose PsychoGAT (Psychological Game AgenTs) to achieve a generic gamification of psychological assessment. The main insight is that powerful LLMs can function both as adept psychologists and innovative game designers. By incorporating LLM agents into designated roles and carefully managing their interactions, PsychoGAT can transform any standardized scales into personalized and engaging interactive fiction games. To validate the proposed method, we conduct psychometric evaluations to assess its effectiveness and employ human evaluators to examine the generated content across various psychological constructs, including depression, cognitive distortions, and personality traits. Results demonstrate that PsychoGAT serves as an effective assessment tool, achieving statistically significant excellence in psychometric metrics such as reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Moreover, human evaluations confirm PsychoGAT's enhancements in content coherence, interactivity, interest, immersion, and satisfaction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12326v2,2024-02
Large Language Model for Mental Health: A Systematic Review,"Zhijun Guo, Alvina Lai, Johan Hilge Thygesen, Joseph Farrington, Thomas Keen, Kezhi Li","Large language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention for potential applications in digital health, while their application in mental health is subject to ongoing debate. This systematic review aims to evaluate the usage of LLMs in mental health, focusing on their strengths and limitations in early screening, digital interventions, and clinical applications. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, JMIR, and ACM using keywords: 'mental health OR mental illness OR mental disorder OR psychiatry' AND 'large language models'. We included articles published between January 1, 2017, and April 30, 2024, excluding non-English articles. 30 articles were evaluated, which included research on mental health conditions and suicidal ideation detection through text (n=15), usage of LLMs for mental health conversational agents (CAs) (n=7), and other applications and evaluations of LLMs in mental health (n=18). LLMs exhibit substantial effectiveness in detecting mental health issues and providing accessible, de-stigmatized eHealth services. However, the current risks associated with the clinical use might surpass their benefits. The study identifies several significant issues: the lack of multilingual datasets annotated by experts, concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the content generated, challenges in interpretability due to the 'black box' nature of LLMs, and persistent ethical dilemmas. These include the lack of a clear ethical framework, concerns about data privacy, and the potential for over-reliance on LLMs by both therapists and patients, which could compromise traditional medical practice. Despite these issues, the rapid development of LLMs underscores their potential as new clinical aids, emphasizing the need for continued research and development in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15401v3,2024-02
EVOR: Evolving Retrieval for Code Generation,"Hongjin Su, Shuyang Jiang, Yuhang Lai, Haoyuan Wu, Boao Shi, Che Liu, Qian Liu, Tao Yu","Recently the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been successfully applied in code generation. However, existing pipelines for retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) employ static knowledge bases with a single source, limiting the adaptation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to domains they have insufficient knowledge of. In this work, we develop a novel pipeline, EVOR, that employs the synchronous evolution of both queries and diverse knowledge bases. On two realistic settings where the external knowledge is required to solve code generation tasks, we compile four new datasets associated with frequently updated libraries and long-tail programming languages, named EVOR-BENCH. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOR achieves two to four times of execution accuracy compared to other methods such as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2024), DocPrompting (Zhou et al., 2023), etc. We demonstrate that EVOR is flexible and can be easily combined with them to achieve further improvement. Further analysis reveals that EVOR benefits from the synchronous evolution of queries and documents and the diverse information sources in the knowledge base. We hope that our studies will inspire more insights into the design of advanced RACG pipelines in future research.

TILP: Differentiable Learning of Temporal Logical Rules on Knowledge Graphs,"Siheng Xiong, Yuan Yang, Faramarz Fekri, James Clayton Kerce","Compared with static knowledge graphs, temporal knowledge graphs (tKG), which can capture the evolution and change of information over time, are more realistic and general. However, due to the complexity that the notion of time introduces to the learning of the rules, an accurate graph reasoning, e.g., predicting new links between entities, is still a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose TILP, a differentiable framework for temporal logical rules learning. By designing a constrained random walk mechanism and the introduction of temporal operators, we ensure the efficiency of our model. We present temporal features modeling in tKG, e.g., recurrence, temporal order, interval between pair of relations, and duration, and incorporate it into our learning process. We compare TILP with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. We show that our proposed framework can improve upon the performance of baseline methods while providing interpretable results. In particular, we consider various scenarios in which training samples are limited, data is biased, and the time range between training and inference are different. In all these cases, TILP works much better than the state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12309v1,2024-02

Bressem, Christopher P. Bridge","Introduction: With the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there have been numerous new open source as well as commercial models. While recent publications have explored GPT-4 in its application to extracting information of interest from radiology reports, there has not been a real-world comparison of GPT-4 to different leading open-source models.   Materials and Methods: Two different and independent datasets were used. The first dataset consists of 540 chest x-ray reports that were created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021. The second dataset consists of 500 chest x-ray reports from the ImaGenome dataset. We then compared the commercial models GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 from OpenAI to the open-source models Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama2-13B, Llama2-70B, QWEN1.5-72B and CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in x-ray text reports using different prompting techniques.   Results: On the ImaGenome dataset, the best performing open-source model was Llama2-70B with micro F1-scores of 0.972 and 0.970 for zero- and few-shot prompts, respectively. GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.984, respectively. On the institutional dataset, the best performing open-source model was QWEN1.5-72B with micro F1-scores of 0.952 and 0.965 for zero- and few-shot prompting, respectively. GPT-4 achieved micro F1-scores of 0.975 and 0.973, respectively.   Conclusion: In this paper, we show that while GPT-4 is superior to open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, the implementation of few-shot prompting can bring open-source models on par with GPT-4. This shows that open-source models could be a performant and privacy preserving alternative to GPT-4 for the task of radiology report classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12298v1,2024-02
KARL: Knowledge-Aware Retrieval and Representations aid Retention and Learning in Students,"Matthew Shu, Nishant Balepur, Shi Feng, Jordan Boyd-Graber","Flashcard schedulers rely on 1) student models to predict the flashcards a student knows; and 2) teaching policies to pick which cards to show next via these predictions. Prior student models, however, just use study data like the student's past responses, ignoring the text on cards. We propose content-aware scheduling, the first schedulers exploiting flashcard content. To give the first evidence that such schedulers enhance student learning, we build KARL, a simple but effective content-aware student model employing deep knowledge tracing (DKT), retrieval, and BERT to predict student recall. We train KARL by collecting a new dataset of 123,143 study logs on diverse trivia questions. KARL bests existing student models in AUC and calibration error. To ensure our improved predictions lead to better student learning, we create a novel delta-based teaching policy to deploy KARL online. Based on 32 study paths from 27 users, KARL improves learning efficiency over SOTA, showing KARL's strength and encouraging researchers to look beyond historical study data to fully capture student abilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12291v3,2024-02
Ontology Enhanced Claim Detection,"Zehra Melce Hüsünbeyi, Tatjana Scheffler","We propose an ontology enhanced model for sentence based claim detection. We fused ontology embeddings from a knowledge base with BERT sentence embeddings to perform claim detection for the ClaimBuster and the NewsClaims datasets. Our ontology enhanced approach showed the best results with these small-sized unbalanced datasets, compared to other statistical and neural machine learning models. The experiments demonstrate that adding domain specific features (either trained word embeddings or knowledge graph metadata) can improve traditional ML methods. In addition, adding domain knowledge in the form of ontology embeddings helps avoid the bias encountered in neural network based models, for example the pure BERT model bias towards larger classes in our small corpus.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12282v1,2024-02
Adaptive Skeleton Graph Decoding,"Shuowei Jin, Yongji Wu, Haizhong Zheng, Qingzhao Zhang, Matthew Lentz, Z. Morley Mao, Atul Prakash, Feng Qian, Danyang Zhuo","Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant adoption for natural language tasks, owing their success to massive numbers of model parameters (e.g., 70B+); however, LLM inference incurs significant computation and memory costs. Recent approaches propose parallel decoding strategies, such as Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), to improve performance by breaking prompts down into sub-problems that can be decoded in parallel; however, they often suffer from reduced response quality. Our key insight is that we can request additional information, specifically dependencies and difficulty, when generating the sub-problems to improve both response quality and performance. In this paper, we propose Skeleton Graph Decoding (SGD), which uses dependencies exposed between sub-problems to support information forwarding between dependent sub-problems for improved quality while exposing parallelization opportunities for decoding independent sub-problems. Additionally, we leverage difficulty estimates for each sub-problem to select an appropriately-sized model, improving performance without significantly reducing quality. Compared to standard autoregressive generation and SoT, SGD achieves a 1.69x speedup while improving quality by up to 51%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12280v1,2024-02
Key ingredients for effective zero-shot cross-lingual knowledge transfer in generative tasks,"Nadezhda Chirkova, Vassilina Nikoulina","Zero-shot cross-lingual knowledge transfer enables a multilingual pretrained language model, finetuned on a task in one language, make predictions for this task in other languages. While being broadly studied for natural language understanding tasks, the described setting is understudied for generation. Previous works notice a frequent problem of generation in a wrong language and propose approaches to address it, usually using mT5 as a backbone model. In this work we compare various approaches proposed from the literature in unified settings, also including alternative backbone models, namely mBART and NLLB-200. We first underline the importance of tuning learning rate used for finetuning, which helps to substantially alleviate the problem of generation in the wrong language. Then, we show that with careful learning rate tuning, the simple full finetuning of the model acts as a very strong baseline and alternative approaches bring only marginal improvements. Finally, we find that mBART performs similarly to mT5 of the same size, and NLLB-200 can be competitive in some cases. Our final zero-shot models reach the performance of the approach based on data translation which is usually considered as an upper baseline for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer in generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12279v2,2024-02
"WorldCoder, a Model-Based LLM Agent: Building World Models by Writing Code and Interacting with the Environment","Hao Tang, Darren Key, Kevin Ellis","We give a model-based agent that builds a Python program representing its knowledge of the world based on its interactions with the environment. The world model tries to explain its interactions, while also being optimistic about what reward it can achieve. We define this optimism as a logical constraint between a program and a planner. We study our agent on gridworlds, and on task planning, finding our approach is more sample-efficient compared to deep RL, more compute-efficient compared to ReAct-style agents, and that it can transfer its knowledge across environments by editing its code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12275v3,2024-02
Tables as Texts or Images: Evaluating the Table Reasoning Ability of LLMs and MLLMs,"Naihao Deng, Zhenjie Sun, Ruiqi He, Aman Sikka, Yulong Chen, Lin Ma, Yue Zhang, Rada Mihalcea","In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of various LLMs in interpreting tabular data through different prompting strategies and data formats. Our analyses extend across six benchmarks for table-related tasks such as question-answering and fact-checking. We introduce for the first time the assessment of LLMs' performance on image-based table representations. Specifically, we compare five text-based and three image-based table representations, demonstrating the role of representation and prompting on LLM performance. Our study provides insights into the effective use of LLMs on table-related tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12424v5,2024-02
High-quality Data-to-Text Generation for Severely Under-Resourced Languages with Out-of-the-box Large Language Models,"Michela Lorandi, Anya Belz","The performance of NLP methods for severely under-resourced languages cannot currently hope to match the state of the art in NLP methods for well resourced languages. We explore the extent to which pretrained large language models (LLMs) can bridge this gap, via the example of data-to-text generation for Irish, Welsh, Breton and Maltese. We test LLMs on these under-resourced languages and English, in a range of scenarios. We find that LLMs easily set the state of the art for the under-resourced languages by substantial margins, as measured by both automatic and human evaluations. For all our languages, human evaluation shows on-a-par performance with humans for our best systems, but BLEU scores collapse compared to English, casting doubt on the metric's suitability for evaluating non-task-specific systems. Overall, our results demonstrate the great potential of LLMs to bridge the performance gap for under-resourced languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12267v1,2024-02
Uncertainty quantification in fine-tuned LLMs using LoRA ensembles,"Oleksandr Balabanov, Hampus Linander","Fine-tuning large language models can improve task specific performance, although a general understanding of what the fine-tuned model has learned, forgotten and how to trust its predictions is still missing. We derive principled uncertainty quantification for fine-tuned LLMs with posterior approximations using computationally efficient low-rank adaptation ensembles. We analyze three common multiple-choice datasets using low-rank adaptation ensembles based on Mistral-7b, and draw quantitative and qualitative conclusions on their perceived complexity and model efficacy on the different target domains during and after fine-tuning. In particular, backed by the numerical experiments, we hypothesise about signals from entropic uncertainty measures for data domains that are inherently difficult for a given architecture to learn.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12264v1,2024-02
On the Semantic Latent Space of Diffusion-Based Text-to-Speech Models,"Miri Varshavsky-Hassid, Roy Hirsch, Regev Cohen, Tomer Golany, Daniel Freedman, Ehud Rivlin","The incorporation of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) in the Text-to-Speech (TTS) domain is rising, providing great value in synthesizing high quality speech. Although they exhibit impressive audio quality, the extent of their semantic capabilities is unknown, and controlling their synthesized speech's vocal properties remains a challenge. Inspired by recent advances in image synthesis, we explore the latent space of frozen TTS models, which is composed of the latent bottleneck activations of the DDM's denoiser. We identify that this space contains rich semantic information, and outline several novel methods for finding semantic directions within it, both supervised and unsupervised. We then demonstrate how these enable off-the-shelf audio editing, without any further training, architectural changes or data requirements. We present evidence of the semantic and acoustic qualities of the edited audio, and provide supplemental samples: https://latent-analysis-grad-tts.github.io/speech-samples/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12423v2,2024-02
NEO-BENCH: Evaluating Robustness of Large Language Models with Neologisms,"Jonathan Zheng, Alan Ritter, Wei Xu","The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) degrades from the temporal drift between data used for model training and newer text seen during inference. One understudied avenue of language change causing data drift is the emergence of neologisms -- new word forms -- over time. We create a diverse resource of recent English neologisms by using several popular collection methods. We analyze temporal drift using neologisms by comparing sentences containing new words with near-identical sentences that replace neologisms with existing substitute words. Model performance is nearly halved in machine translation when a single neologism is introduced in a sentence. Motivated by these results, we construct a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to generalize to neologisms with various natural language understanding tasks and model perplexity. Models with later knowledge cutoff dates yield lower perplexities and perform better in downstream tasks. LLMs are also affected differently based on the linguistic origins of words, indicating that neologisms are complex for static LLMs to address. We will release our benchmark and code for reproducing our experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12261v4,2024-02
Shallow Synthesis of Knowledge in GPT-Generated Texts: A Case Study in Automatic Related Work Composition,"Anna Martin-Boyle, Aahan Tyagi, Marti A. Hearst, Dongyeop Kang","Numerous AI-assisted scholarly applications have been developed to aid different stages of the research process. We present an analysis of AI-assisted scholarly writing generated with ScholaCite, a tool we built that is designed for organizing literature and composing Related Work sections for academic papers. Our evaluation method focuses on the analysis of citation graphs to assess the structural complexity and inter-connectedness of citations in texts and involves a three-way comparison between (1) original human-written texts, (2) purely GPT-generated texts, and (3) human-AI collaborative texts. We find that GPT-4 can generate reasonable coarse-grained citation groupings to support human users in brainstorming, but fails to perform detailed synthesis of related works without human intervention. We suggest that future writing assistant tools should not be used to draft text independently of the human author.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12255v1,2024-02
Analysis of Levenshtein Transformer's Decoder and Its Variants,Ruiyang Zhou,"Levenshtein transformer (LevT) is a non-autoregressive machine translation model with high decoding efficiency and comparable translation quality in terms of bleu score, due to its parallel decoding and iterative refinement procedure. Are there any deficiencies of its translations and what improvements could be made? In this report, we focus on LevT's decoder and analyse the decoding results length, subword generation, and deletion module's capability. We hope to identify weaknesses of the decoder for future improvements.   We also compare translations of the original LevT, knowledge-distilled LevT, LevT with translation memory, and the KD-LevT with translation memory to see how KD and translation memory can help.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12249v1,2024-02
"Same Task, More Tokens: the Impact of Input Length on the Reasoning Performance of Large Language Models","Mosh Levy, Alon Jacoby, Yoav Goldberg","This paper explores the impact of extending input lengths on the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite LLMs advancements in recent times, their performance consistency across different input lengths is not well understood. We investigate this aspect by introducing a novel QA reasoning framework, specifically designed to assess the impact of input length. We isolate the effect of input length using multiple versions of the same sample, each being extended with padding of different lengths, types and locations. Our findings show a notable degradation in LLMs' reasoning performance at much shorter input lengths than their technical maximum. We show that the degradation trend appears in every version of our dataset, although at different intensities. Additionally, our study reveals that the traditional metric of next word prediction correlates negatively with performance of LLMs' on our reasoning dataset. We analyse our results and identify failure modes that can serve as useful guides for future research, potentially informing strategies to address the limitations observed in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14848v2,2024-02
Understanding the Effects of Noise in Text-to-SQL: An Examination of the BIRD-Bench Benchmark,"Niklas Wretblad, Fredrik Gordh Riseby, Rahul Biswas, Amin Ahmadi, Oskar Holmström","Text-to-SQL, which involves translating natural language into Structured Query Language (SQL), is crucial for enabling broad access to structured databases without expert knowledge. However, designing models for such tasks is challenging due to numerous factors, including the presence of 'noise,' such as ambiguous questions and syntactical errors. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the distribution and types of noise in the widely used BIRD-Bench benchmark and the impact of noise on models. While BIRD-Bench was created to model dirty and noisy database values, it was not created to contain noise and errors in the questions and gold queries. We found that noise in questions and gold queries are prevalent in the dataset, with varying amounts across domains, and with an uneven distribution between noise types. The presence of incorrect gold SQL queries, which then generate incorrect gold answers, has a significant impact on the benchmark's reliability. Surprisingly, when evaluating models on corrected SQL queries, zero-shot baselines surpassed the performance of state-of-the-art prompting methods. We conclude that informative noise labels and reliable benchmarks are crucial to developing new Text-to-SQL methods that can handle varying types of noise. All datasets, annotations, and code are available at https://github.com/niklaswretblad/the-effects-of-noise-in-text-to-SQL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12243v4,2024-02
Task-Oriented Dialogue with In-Context Learning,"Tom Bocklisch, Thomas Werkmeister, Daksh Varshneya, Alan Nichol","We describe a system for building task-oriented dialogue systems combining the in-context learning abilities of large language models (LLMs) with the deterministic execution of business logic. LLMs are used to translate between the surface form of the conversation and a domain-specific language (DSL) which is used to progress the business logic. We compare our approach to the intent-based NLU approach predominantly used in industry today. Our experiments show that developing chatbots with our system requires significantly less effort than established approaches, that these chatbots can successfully navigate complex dialogues which are extremely challenging for NLU-based systems, and that our system has desirable properties for scaling task-oriented dialogue systems to a large number of tasks. We make our implementation available for use and further study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12234v1,2024-02

AnyGPT: Unified Multimodal LLM with Discrete Sequence Modeling,"Jun Zhan, Junqi Dai, Jiasheng Ye, Yunhua Zhou, Dong Zhang, Zhigeng Liu, Xin Zhang, Ruibin Yuan, Ge Zhang, Linyang Li, Hang Yan, Jie Fu, Tao Gui, Tianxiang Sun, Yugang Jiang, Xipeng Qiu","We introduce AnyGPT, an any-to-any multimodal language model that utilizes discrete representations for the unified processing of various modalities, including speech, text, images, and music. AnyGPT can be trained stably without any alterations to the current large language model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language model.

CovRL: Fuzzing JavaScript Engines with Coverage-Guided Reinforcement Learning for LLM-based Mutation,"Jueon Eom, Seyeon Jeong, Taekyoung Kwon","Fuzzing is an effective bug-finding technique but it struggles with complex systems like JavaScript engines that demand precise grammatical input. Recently, researchers have adopted language models for context-aware mutation in fuzzing to address this problem. However, existing techniques are limited in utilizing coverage guidance for fuzzing, which is rather performed in a black-box manner. This paper presents a novel technique called CovRL (Coverage-guided Reinforcement Learning) that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning from coverage feedback. Our fuzzer, CovRL-Fuzz, integrates coverage feedback directly into the LLM by leveraging the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method to construct a weighted coverage map. This map is key in calculating the fuzzing reward, which is then applied to the LLM-based mutator through reinforcement learning. CovRL-Fuzz, through this approach, enables the generation of test cases that are more likely to discover new coverage areas, thus improving vulnerability detection while minimizing syntax and semantic errors, all without needing extra post-processing. Our evaluation results indicate that CovRL-Fuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of code coverage and bug-finding capabilities: CovRL-Fuzz identified 48 real-world security-related bugs in the latest JavaScript engines, including 39 previously unknown vulnerabilities and 11 CVEs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12222v1,2024-02
Reformatted Alignment,"Run-Ze Fan, Xuefeng Li, Haoyang Zou, Junlong Li, Shwai He, Ethan Chern, Jiewen Hu, Pengfei Liu","The quality of finetuning data is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Current methods to improve data quality are either labor-intensive or prone to factual errors caused by LLM hallucinations. This paper explores elevating the quality of existing instruction data to better align with human values, introducing a simple and effective approach named ReAlign, which reformats the responses of instruction data into a format that better aligns with pre-established criteria and the collated evidence. This approach minimizes human annotation, hallucination, and the difficulty in scaling, remaining orthogonal to existing alignment techniques. Experimentally, ReAlign significantly boosts the general alignment ability, math reasoning, factuality, and readability of the LLMs.   Encouragingly, without introducing any additional data or advanced training techniques, and merely by reformatting the response, LLaMA-2-13B's mathematical reasoning ability on GSM8K can be improved from 46.77% to 56.63% in accuracy. Additionally, a mere 5% of ReAlign data yields a 67% boost in general alignment ability measured by the Alpaca dataset. This work highlights the need for further research into the science and mechanistic interpretability of LLMs. We have made the associated code and data publicly accessible to support future studies at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/ReAlign.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12219v2,2024-02
Polarization of Autonomous Generative AI Agents Under Echo Chambers,Masaya Ohagi,"Online social networks often create echo chambers where people only hear opinions reinforcing their beliefs. An echo chamber often generates polarization, leading to conflicts caused by people with radical opinions, such as the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The echo chamber has been viewed as a human-specific problem, but this implicit assumption is becoming less reasonable as large language models, such as ChatGPT, acquire social abilities. In response to this situation, we investigated the potential for polarization to occur among a group of autonomous AI agents based on generative language models in an echo chamber environment. We had AI agents discuss specific topics and analyzed how the group's opinions changed as the discussion progressed. As a result, we found that the group of agents based on ChatGPT tended to become polarized in echo chamber environments. The analysis of opinion transitions shows that this result is caused by ChatGPT's high prompt understanding ability to update its opinion by considering its own and surrounding agents' opinions. We conducted additional experiments to investigate under what specific conditions AI agents tended to polarize. As a result, we identified factors that strongly influence polarization, such as the agent's persona. These factors should be monitored to prevent the polarization of AI agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12212v1,2024-02
Enhancing Multilingual Capabilities of Large Language Models through Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages,"Yuanchi Zhang, Yile Wang, Zijun Liu, Shuo Wang, Xiaolong Wang, Peng Li, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu","While large language models (LLMs) have been pre-trained on multilingual corpora, their performance still lags behind in most languages compared to a few resource-rich languages. One common approach to mitigate this issue is to translate training data from resource-rich languages into other languages and then continue training. However, using the data obtained solely relying on translation while ignoring the original capabilities of LLMs across languages is not always effective, which we show will limit the performance of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose SDRRL, a method based on Self-Distillation from Resource-Rich Languages that effectively improve multilingual performance by leveraging the internal capabilities of LLMs on resource-rich languages. We evaluate on different LLMs (LLaMA-2 and SeaLLM) and source languages across various comprehension and generation tasks, experimental results demonstrate that SDRRL can significantly enhance multilingual capabilities while minimizing the impact on original performance in resource-rich languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12204v1,2024-02
Zero shot VLMs for hate meme detection: Are we there yet?,"Naquee Rizwan, Paramananda Bhaskar, Mithun Das, Swadhin Satyaprakash Majhi, Punyajoy Saha, Animesh Mukherjee","Multimedia content on social media is rapidly evolving, with memes gaining prominence as a distinctive form. Unfortunately, some malicious users exploit memes to target individuals or vulnerable communities, making it imperative to identify and address such instances of hateful memes. Extensive research has been conducted to address this issue by developing hate meme detection models. However, a notable limitation of traditional machine/deep learning models is the requirement for labeled datasets for accurate classification. Recently, the research community has witnessed the emergence of several visual language models that have exhibited outstanding performance across various tasks. In this study, we aim to investigate the efficacy of these visual language models in handling intricate tasks such as hate meme detection. We use various prompt settings to focus on zero-shot classification of hateful/harmful memes. Through our analysis, we observe that large VLMs are still vulnerable for zero-shot hate meme detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12198v2,2024-02
Browse and Concentrate: Comprehending Multimodal Content via prior-LLM Context Fusion,"Ziyue Wang, Chi Chen, Yiqi Zhu, Fuwen Luo, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu","With the bloom of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that incorporate LLMs with pre-trained vision models have recently demonstrated impressive performance across diverse vision-language tasks. However, they fall short to comprehend context involving multiple images. A primary reason for this shortcoming is that the visual features for each images are encoded individually by frozen encoders before feeding into the LLM backbone, lacking awareness of other images and the multimodal instructions. We term this issue as prior-LLM modality isolation and propose a two phase paradigm, browse-and-concentrate, to enable in-depth multimodal context fusion prior to feeding the features into LLMs. This paradigm initially ""browses"" through the inputs for essential insights, and then revisits the inputs to ""concentrate"" on crucial details, guided by these insights, to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the multimodal inputs. Additionally, we develop training strategies specifically to enhance the understanding of multi-image inputs. Our method markedly boosts the performance on 7 multi-image scenarios, contributing to increments on average accuracy by 2.13% and 7.60% against strong MLLMs baselines with 3B and 11B LLMs, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12195v2,2024-02
A Chinese Dataset for Evaluating the Safeguards in Large Language Models,"Yuxia Wang, Zenan Zhai, Haonan Li, Xudong Han, Lizhi Lin, Zhenxuan Zhang, Jingru Zhao, Preslav Nakov, Timothy Baldwin","Many studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can produce harmful responses, exposing users to unexpected risks when LLMs are deployed. Previous studies have proposed comprehensive taxonomies of the risks posed by LLMs, as well as corresponding prompts that can be used to examine the safety mechanisms of LLMs. However, the focus has been almost exclusively on English, and little has been explored for other languages. Here we aim to bridge this gap. We first introduce a dataset for the safety evaluation of Chinese LLMs, and then extend it to two other scenarios that can be used to better identify false negative and false positive examples in terms of risky prompt rejections. We further present a set of fine-grained safety assessment criteria for each risk type, facilitating both manual annotation and automatic evaluation in terms of LLM response harmfulness. Our experiments on five LLMs show that region-specific risks are the prevalent type of risk, presenting the major issue with all Chinese LLMs we experimented with.

Stick to your Role! Stability of Personal Values Expressed in Large Language Models,"Grgur Kovač, Rémy Portelas, Masataka Sawayama, Peter Ford Dominey, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer","The standard way to study Large Language Models (LLMs) with benchmarks or psychology questionnaires is to provide many different queries from similar minimal contexts (e.g. multiple choice questions). However, due to LLMs' highly context-dependent nature, conclusions from such minimal-context evaluations may be little informative about the model's behavior in deployment (where it will be exposed to many new contexts). We argue that context-dependence (specifically, value stability) should be studied as a specific property of LLMs and used as another dimension of LLM comparison (alongside others such as cognitive abilities, knowledge, or model size). We present a case-study on the stability of value expression over different contexts (simulated conversations on different topics) as measured using a standard psychology questionnaire (PVQ) and on behavioral downstream tasks. Reusing methods from psychology, we study Rank-order stability on the population (interpersonal) level, and Ipsative stability on the individual (intrapersonal) level. We consider two settings (with and without instructing LLMs to simulate particular personas), two simulated populations, and three downstream tasks. We observe consistent trends in the stability of models and model families - Mixtral, Mistral, GPT-3.5 and Qwen families are more stable than LLaMa-2 and Phi. The consistency of these trends implies that some models exhibit higher value stability than others, and that stability can be estimated with the set of introduced methodological tools. When instructed to simulate particular personas, LLMs exhibit low Rank-order stability, which further diminishes with conversation length. This highlights the need for future research on LLMs that coherently simulate different personas. This paper provides a foundational step in that direction, and, to our knowledge, it is the first study of value stability in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14846v4,2024-02
Amplifying Training Data Exposure through Fine-Tuning with Pseudo-Labeled Memberships,"Myung Gyo Oh, Hong Eun Ahn, Leo Hyun Park, Taekyoung Kwon","Neural language models (LMs) are vulnerable to training data extraction attacks due to data memorization. This paper introduces a novel attack scenario wherein an attacker adversarially fine-tunes pre-trained LMs to amplify the exposure of the original training data. This strategy differs from prior studies by aiming to intensify the LM's retention of its pre-training dataset. To achieve this, the attacker needs to collect generated texts that are closely aligned with the pre-training data. However, without knowledge of the actual dataset, quantifying the amount of pre-training data within generated texts is challenging. To address this, we propose the use of pseudo-labels for these generated texts, leveraging membership approximations indicated by machine-generated probabilities from the target LM. We subsequently fine-tune the LM to favor generations with higher likelihoods of originating from the pre-training data, based on their membership probabilities. Our empirical findings indicate a remarkable outcome: LMs with over 1B parameters exhibit a four to eight-fold increase in training data exposure. We discuss potential mitigations and suggest future research directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12189v2,2024-02
Mafin: Enhancing Black-Box Embeddings with Model Augmented Fine-Tuning,"Mingtian Zhang, Shawn Lan, Peter Hayes, David Barber","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective solution for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). The retrieval stage in RAG typically involves a pre-trained embedding model, which converts queries and passages into vectors to capture their semantics. However, a standard pre-trained embedding model may exhibit sub-optimal performance when applied to specific domain knowledge, necessitating fine-tuning. This paper addresses scenarios where the embeddings are only available from a black-box model. We introduce Model augmented fine-tuning (Mafin) -- a novel approach for fine-tuning a black-box embedding model by augmenting it with a trainable embedding model. Our results demonstrate that Mafin significantly enhances the performance of the black-box embeddings by only requiring the training of a small augmented model. We validate the effectiveness of our method on both labeled and unlabeled datasets, illustrating its broad applicability and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12177v4,2024-02
BIDER: Bridging Knowledge Inconsistency for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented LLMs via Key Supporting Evidence,"Jiajie Jin, Yutao Zhu, Yujia Zhou, Zhicheng Dou","Retrieval-augmented large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated efficacy in knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain QA, addressing inherent challenges in knowledge update and factual inadequacy. However, inconsistencies between retrieval knowledge and the necessary knowledge for LLMs, leading to a decline in LLM's answer quality. This paper introduces BIDER, an approach that refines retrieval documents into Key Supporting Evidence (KSE) through knowledge synthesis, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference alignment. We train BIDER by learning from crafting KSE, while maximizing its output to align with LLM's information acquisition preferences through reinforcement learning. Evaluations across five datasets show BIDER boosts LLMs' answer quality by 7% while reducing input content length in retrieval documents by 80%, outperforming existing methods. The proposed KSE simulation effectively equips LLMs with essential information for accurate question answering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12174v2,2024-02
Defending Against Weight-Poisoning Backdoor Attacks for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning,"Shuai Zhao, Leilei Gan, Luu Anh Tuan, Jie Fu, Lingjuan Lyu, Meihuizi Jia, Jinming Wen","Recently, various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies for application to language models have been proposed and successfully implemented. However, this raises the question of whether PEFT, which only updates a limited set of model parameters, constitutes security vulnerabilities when confronted with weight-poisoning backdoor attacks. In this study, we show that PEFT is more susceptible to weight-poisoning backdoor attacks compared to the full-parameter fine-tuning method, with pre-defined triggers remaining exploitable and pre-defined targets maintaining high confidence, even after fine-tuning. Motivated by this insight, we developed a Poisoned Sample Identification Module (PSIM) leveraging PEFT, which identifies poisoned samples through confidence, providing robust defense against weight-poisoning backdoor attacks. Specifically, we leverage PEFT to train the PSIM with randomly reset sample labels. During the inference process, extreme confidence serves as an indicator for poisoned samples, while others are clean. We conduct experiments on text classification tasks, five fine-tuning strategies, and three weight-poisoning backdoor attack methods. Experiments show near 100% success rates for weight-poisoning backdoor attacks when utilizing PEFT. Furthermore, our defensive approach exhibits overall competitive performance in mitigating weight-poisoning backdoor attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12168v3,2024-02
Transformer-based Causal Language Models Perform Clustering,"Xinbo Wu, Lav R. Varshney","Even though large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in solving various natural language tasks, the capability of an LLM to follow human instructions is still a concern. Recent works have shown great improvements in the instruction-following capability via additional training for instruction-following tasks. However, the mechanisms responsible for effective instruction-following capabilities remain inadequately understood. Here, we introduce a simplified instruction-following task and use synthetic datasets to analyze a Transformer-based causal language model. Our findings suggest that the model learns task-specific information by clustering data within its hidden space, with this clustering process evolving dynamically during learning. We also demonstrate how this phenomenon assists the model in handling unseen instances, and validate our results in a more realistic setting. Furthermore, we present inspired applications regarding pre-training and alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12151v2,2024-02
Your Large Language Model is Secretly a Fairness Proponent and You Should Prompt it Like One,"Tianlin Li, Xiaoyu Zhang, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Qian Liu, Qing Guo, Chao Shen, Yang Liu","The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) underscores the urgent need to ensure their fairness. However, LLMs frequently present dominant viewpoints while ignoring alternative perspectives from minority parties, resulting in potential biases. We hypothesize that these fairness-violating behaviors occur because LLMs express their viewpoints using a human personality that represents the majority of training data. In response to this, we validate that prompting LLMs with specific roles can allow LLMs to express diverse viewpoints. Building on this insight and observation, we develop FairThinking, a pipeline designed to automatically generate roles that enable LLMs to articulate diverse perspectives for fair expressions. To evaluate FairThinking, we create a dataset with a thousand items covering three fairness-related topics and conduct experiments on GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama2, and Mistral to demonstrate its superior performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12150v1,2024-02
Purifying Large Language Models by Ensembling a Small Language Model,"Tianlin Li, Qian Liu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qing Guo, Yang Liu, Min Lin","The emerging success of large language models (LLMs) heavily relies on collecting abundant training data from external (untrusted) sources. Despite substantial efforts devoted to data cleaning and curation, well-constructed LLMs have been reported to suffer from copyright infringement, data poisoning, and/or privacy violations, which would impede practical deployment of LLMs. In this study, we propose a simple and easily implementable method for purifying LLMs from the negative effects caused by uncurated data, namely, through ensembling LLMs with benign and small language models (SLMs). Aside from theoretical guarantees, we perform comprehensive experiments to empirically confirm the efficacy of ensembling LLMs with SLMs, which can effectively preserve the performance of LLMs while mitigating issues such as copyright infringement, data poisoning, and privacy violations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14845v1,2024-02
Surprising Efficacy of Fine-Tuned Transformers for Fact-Checking over Larger Language Models,Vinay Setty,"In this paper, we explore the challenges associated with establishing an end-to-end fact-checking pipeline in a real-world context, covering over 90 languages. Our real-world experimental benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning Transformer models specifically for fact-checking tasks, such as claim detection and veracity prediction, provide superior performance over large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Mistral-7b. However, we illustrate that LLMs excel in generative tasks such as question decomposition for evidence retrieval. Through extensive evaluation, we show the efficacy of fine-tuned models for fact-checking in a multilingual setting and complex claims that include numerical quantities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12147v3,2024-02
Enabling Weak LLMs to Judge Response Reliability via Meta Ranking,"Zijun Liu, Boqun Kou, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Yang Liu","Despite the strong performance of large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks, they still have reliability issues. Previous studies indicate that strong LLMs like GPT-4-turbo excel in evaluating the reliability of responses from LLMs, but face efficiency and local deployment issues. Thus, to enable weak LLMs to effectively assess the reliability of LLM responses, we propose a novel cross-query-comparison-based method called $\textit{Meta Ranking}$ (MR). Unlike previous few-shot methods that solely based on in-context learning capabilities in LLMs, MR assesses reliability by pairwisely ranking the target query-response pair with multiple reference query-response pairs. We found that MR is highly effective in error detection for LLM responses, where weak LLMs, such as Phi-2, could surpass strong baselines like GPT-3.5-turbo, requiring only five reference samples and significantly improving efficiency. We further demonstrate that MR can enhance strong LLMs' performance in two practical applications: model cascading and instruction tuning. In model cascading, we combine open- and closed-source LLMs to achieve performance comparable to GPT-4-turbo with lower costs. In instruction tuning, we use MR for iterative training data filtering, significantly reducing data processing time and enabling LLaMA-7B and Phi-2 to surpass Alpaca-13B with fewer training tokens. These results underscore the high potential of MR in both efficiency and effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12146v3,2024-02
IRR: Image Review Ranking Framework for Evaluating Vision-Language Models,"Kazuki Hayashi, Kazuma Onishi, Toma Suzuki, Yusuke Ide, Seiji Gobara, Shigeki Saito, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Taro Watanabe","Large-scale Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process both images and text, excelling in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and description generation. However, while these models excel at generating factual content, their ability to generate and evaluate texts reflecting perspectives on the same image, depending on the context, has not been sufficiently explored. To address this, we propose IRR: Image Review Rank, a novel evaluation framework designed to assess critic review texts from multiple perspectives. IRR evaluates LVLMs by measuring how closely their judgments align with human interpretations. We validate it using a dataset of images from 15 categories, each with five critic review texts and annotated rankings in both English and Japanese, totaling over 2,000 data instances. The datasets are available at https://hf.co/datasets/naist-nlp/Wiki-ImageReview1.0. Our results indicate that, although LVLMs exhibited consistent performance across languages, their correlation with human annotations was insufficient, highlighting the need for further advancements. These findings highlight the limitations of current evaluation methods and the need for approaches that better capture human reasoning in Vision & Language tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12121v2,2024-02
Is It a Free Lunch for Removing Outliers during Pretraining?,"Baohao Liao, Christof Monz","With the growing size of large language models, the role of quantization becomes increasingly significant. However, outliers present in weights or activations notably influence the performance of quantized models. Recently, \citet{qtransformer} introduced a novel softmax function aimed at pretraining models in an outlier-free manner, thereby enhancing their suitability for quantization. Interestingly, we observed that such an approach leads to performance degradation in full precision. Building on this insight, we enhance the method by ensuring its normalization is invariant to sequence length, a crucial factor for bridging the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning. Moreover, this improved method also facilitates successful pretraining of causal language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12102v1,2024-02
Groot: Adversarial Testing for Generative Text-to-Image Models with Tree-based Semantic Transformation,"Yi Liu, Guowei Yang, Gelei Deng, Feiyue Chen, Yuqi Chen, Ling Shi, Tianwei Zhang, Yang Liu","With the prevalence of text-to-image generative models, their safety becomes a critical concern. adversarial testing techniques have been developed to probe whether such models can be prompted to produce Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. However, existing solutions face several challenges, including low success rate and inefficiency. We introduce Groot, the first automated framework leveraging tree-based semantic transformation for adversarial testing of text-to-image models. Groot employs semantic decomposition and sensitive element drowning strategies in conjunction with LLMs to systematically refine adversarial prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation confirms the efficacy of Groot, which not only exceeds the performance of current state-of-the-art approaches but also achieves a remarkable success rate (93.66%) on leading text-to-image models such as DALL-E 3 and Midjourney.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12100v1,2024-02
Do Large Language Models Understand Logic or Just Mimick Context?,"Junbing Yan, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Wei Zhang","Over the past few years, the abilities of large language models (LLMs) have received extensive attention, which have performed exceptionally well in complicated scenarios such as logical reasoning and symbolic inference. A significant factor contributing to this progress is the benefit of in-context learning and few-shot prompting. However, the reasons behind the success of such models using contextual reasoning have not been fully explored. Do LLMs have understand logical rules to draw inferences, or do they ``guess'' the answers by learning a type of probabilistic mapping through context? This paper investigates the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on two logical reasoning datasets by using counterfactual methods to replace context text and modify logical concepts. Based on our analysis, it is found that LLMs do not truly understand logical rules; rather, in-context learning has simply enhanced the likelihood of these models arriving at the correct answers. If one alters certain words in the context text or changes the concepts of logical terms, the outputs of LLMs can be significantly disrupted, leading to counter-intuitive responses. This work provides critical insights into the limitations of LLMs, underscoring the need for more robust mechanisms to ensure reliable logical reasoning in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12091v1,2024-02

This limitation is further amplified in average Small LangSLMs with limited context and training data. To address this challenge, we propose an ""Inductive Learning"" approach utilizing a distributed network of SLMs. This network leverages error-based learning and hint incorporation to refine the reasoning capabilities of SLMs. Our goal is to provide a framework that empowers SLMs to approach the level of logic-based applications achieved by high-parameter models, potentially benefiting any language model. Ultimately, this novel concept paves the way for bridging the logical gap between humans and LLMs across various fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12080v1,2024-02
LVCHAT: Facilitating Long Video Comprehension,"Yu Wang, Zeyuan Zhang, Julian McAuley, Zexue He","Enabling large language models (LLMs) to read videos is vital for multimodal LLMs. Existing works show promise on short videos whereas long video (longer than e.g.~1 minute) comprehension remains challenging. The major problem lies in the over-compression of videos, i.e., the encoded video representations are not enough to represent the whole video. To address this issue, we propose Long Video Chat (LVChat), where Frame-Scalable Encoding (FSE) is introduced to dynamically adjust the number of embeddings in alignment with the duration of the video to ensure long videos are not overly compressed into a few embeddings. To deal with long videos whose length is beyond videos seen during training, we propose Interleaved Frame Encoding (IFE), repeating positional embedding and interleaving multiple groups of videos to enable long video input, avoiding performance degradation due to overly long videos. Experimental results show that LVChat significantly outperforms existing methods by up to 27\% in accuracy on long-video QA datasets and long-video captioning benchmarks.

WKVQuant: Quantizing Weight and Key/Value Cache for Large Language Models Gains More,"Yuxuan Yue, Zhihang Yuan, Haojie Duanmu, Sifan Zhou, Jianlong Wu, Liqiang Nie","Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant deployment challenges due to their substantial memory requirements and the computational demands of auto-regressive text generation process. This paper addresses these challenges by focusing on the quantization of LLMs, a technique that reduces memory consumption by converting model parameters and activations into low-bit integers. We critically analyze the existing quantization approaches, identifying their limitations in balancing the accuracy and efficiency of the quantized LLMs. To advance beyond these limitations, we propose WKVQuant, a PTQ framework especially designed for quantizing weights and the key/value (KV) cache of LLMs. Specifically, we incorporates past-only quantization to improve the computation of attention. Additionally, we introduce two-dimensional quantization strategy to handle the distribution of KV cache, along with a cross-block reconstruction regularization for parameter optimization. Experiments show that WKVQuant achieves almost comparable memory savings to weight-activation quantization, while also approaching the performance of weight-only quantization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12065v2,2024-02
All Language Models Large and Small,"Zhixun Chen, Yali Du, David Mguni","Many leading language models (LMs) use high-intensity computational resources both during training and execution. This poses the challenge of lowering resource costs for deployment and faster execution of decision-making tasks among others. We introduce a novel plug-and-play LM framework named Language Optimising Network Distribution (LONDI) framework. LONDI learns to selectively employ large LMs only where complex decision-making and reasoning are required while using low-resource LMs (i.e. LMs require less GPU usage, but may not be able to solve the problem alone) everywhere else. LONDI consists of a system of two (off-)policy networks, an LM, a large LM (LLM), and a reinforcement learning module that uses switching controls to quickly learn which system states to call the LLM. We then introduce a variant of LONDI that maintains budget constraints on LLM calls and hence its resource usage. Theoretically, we prove LONDI learns the subset of system states to activate the LLM required to solve the task. We then prove that LONDI converges to optimal solutions while also preserving budgetary constraints on LLM calls almost surely enabling it to solve various tasks while significantly lowering computational costs. We test LONDI's performance in a range of tasks in ScienceWorld and BabyAI-Text and demonstrate that LONDI can solve tasks only solvable by resource-intensive LLMs while reducing GPU usage by up to 30%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12061v2,2024-02
Scaffolding Coordinates to Promote Vision-Language Coordination in Large Multi-Modal Models,"Xuanyu Lei, Zonghan Yang, Xinrui Chen, Peng Li, Yang Liu","State-of-the-art Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in vision-language tasks.

Existing prompting techniques for LMMs focus on either improving textual reasoning or leveraging tools for image preprocessing, lacking a simple and general visual prompting scheme to promote vision-language coordination in LMMs. In this work, we propose Scaffold prompting that scaffolds coordinates to promote vision-language coordination. Specifically, Scaffold overlays a dot matrix within the image as visual information anchors and leverages multi-dimensional coordinates as textual positional references. Extensive experiments on a wide range of challenging vision-language tasks demonstrate the superiority of Scaffold over GPT-4V with the textual CoT prompting.

However, we discover that LLMs seem to confuse different evaluation criteria, which reduces their reliability. For further verification, we first consider avoiding issues of inconsistent conceptualization and vague expression in existing NLG quality criteria themselves. So we summarize a clear hierarchical classification system for 11 common aspects with corresponding different criteria from previous studies involved. Inspired by behavioral testing, we elaborately design 18 types of aspect-targeted perturbation attacks for fine-grained analysis of the evaluation behaviors of different LLMs. We also conduct human annotations beyond the guidance of the classification system to validate the impact of the perturbations.

"Small Models, Big Insights: Leveraging Slim Proxy Models To Decide When and What to Retrieve for LLMs","Jiejun Tan, Zhicheng Dou, Yutao Zhu, Peidong Guo, Kun Fang, Ji-Rong Wen","The integration of large language models (LLMs) and search engines represents a significant evolution in knowledge acquisition methodologies. However, determining the knowledge that an LLM already possesses and the knowledge that requires the help of a search engine remains an unresolved issue. Most existing methods solve this problem through the results of preliminary answers or reasoning done by the LLM itself, but this incurs excessively high computational costs. This paper introduces a novel collaborative approach, namely SlimPLM, that detects missing knowledge in LLMs with a slim proxy model, to enhance the LLM's knowledge acquisition process. We employ a proxy model which has far fewer parameters, and take its answers as heuristic answers. Heuristic answers are then utilized to predict the knowledge required to answer the user question, as well as the known and unknown knowledge within the LLM. We only conduct retrieval for the missing knowledge in questions that the LLM does not know. Extensive experimental results on five datasets with two LLMs demonstrate a notable improvement in the end-to-end performance of LLMs in question-answering tasks, achieving or surpassing current state-of-the-art models with lower LLM inference costs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12052v3,2024-02

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs and introduces a post-training adjustment method called Model Tailor. Our method primarily preserves the pre-trained parameters while replacing a small number ($\leq$ 10\%) of fine-tuned parameters, maintaining $\sim$ 99\% effectiveness on original tasks versus pre-training, and achieving $\sim$ 97\% on new tasks compared to standard fine-tuning. Specifically, we derive a sparse mask to identify the ""model patch"", based on a fusion strategy that integrates salience and sensitivity analysis. Subsequently, a compensation mechanism is introduced to ""decorate the patch"", enhancing the model's performance on both target and original tasks.

Citation Amnesia: On The Recency Bias of NLP and Other Academic Fields,"Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Mohamed Abdalla, Bela Gipp, Saif M. Mohammad","This study examines the tendency to cite older work across 20 fields of study over 43 years (1980--2023). We put NLP's propensity to cite older work in the context of these 20 other fields to analyze whether NLP shows similar temporal citation patterns to these other fields over time or whether differences can be observed. Our analysis, based on a dataset of approximately 240 million papers, reveals a broader scientific trend: many fields have markedly declined in citing older works (e.g., psychology, computer science). We term this decline a 'citation age recession', analogous to how economists define periods of reduced economic activity. The trend is strongest in NLP and ML research (-12.8% and -5.5% in citation age from previous peaks). Our results suggest that citing more recent works is not directly driven by the growth in publication rates (-3.4% across fields; -5.2% in humanities; -5.5% in formal sciences) -- even when controlling for an increase in the volume of papers. Our findings raise questions about the scientific community's engagement with past literature, particularly for NLP, and the potential consequences of neglecting older but relevant research.

Self-AMPLIFY is a 3-step method that targets samples, generates rationales and builds a final prompt to leverage ICL. Self-AMPLIFY performance is evaluated on four SLMs and five datasets requiring strong reasoning abilities.

Towards Cross-Tokenizer Distillation: the Universal Logit Distillation Loss for LLMs,"Nicolas Boizard, Kevin El Haddad, Céline Hudelot, Pierre Colombo","Deploying large language models (LLMs) of several billion parameters can be impractical in most industrial use cases due to constraints such as cost, latency limitations, and hardware accessibility. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing knowledge from resource-intensive large models to smaller ones. Various strategies exist, some relying on the text generated by the teacher model and optionally utilizing his logits to enhance learning. However, these methods based on logits often require both teacher and student models to share the same tokenizer, limiting their applicability across different LLM families. In this paper, we introduce Universal Logit Distillation (ULD) loss, grounded in optimal transport, to address this limitation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ULD loss in enabling distillation across models with different architectures and tokenizers, paving the way to a more widespread use of distillation techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12030v2,2024-02
Acquiring Clean Language Models from Backdoor Poisoned Datasets by Downscaling Frequency Space,"Zongru Wu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Pengzhou Cheng, Gongshen Liu","Despite the notable success of language models (LMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the reliability of LMs is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Prior research attempts to mitigate backdoor learning while training the LMs on the poisoned dataset, yet struggles against complex backdoor attacks in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the learning mechanisms of backdoor LMs in the frequency space by Fourier analysis. Our findings indicate that the backdoor mapping presented on the poisoned datasets exhibits a more discernible inclination towards lower frequency compared to clean mapping, resulting in the faster convergence of backdoor mapping. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Multi-Scale Low-Rank Adaptation (MuScleLoRA), which deploys multiple radial scalings in the frequency space with low-rank adaptation to the target model and further aligns the gradients when updating parameters. Through downscaling in the frequency space, MuScleLoRA encourages the model to prioritize the learning of relatively high-frequency clean mapping, consequently mitigating backdoor learning. Experimental results demonstrate that MuScleLoRA outperforms baselines significantly. Notably, MuScleLoRA reduces the average success rate of diverse backdoor attacks to below 15\% across multiple datasets and generalizes to various backbone LMs, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT2-XL, and Llama2.

Speech Translation with Speech Foundation Models and Large Language Models: What is There and What is Missing?,"Marco Gaido, Sara Papi, Matteo Negri, Luisa Bentivogli","The field of natural language processing (NLP) has recently witnessed a transformative shift with the emergence of foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) that have revolutionized text-based NLP. This paradigm has extended to other modalities, including speech, where researchers are actively exploring the combination of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and LLMs into single, unified models capable of addressing multimodal tasks. Among such tasks, this paper focuses on speech-to-text translation (ST). By examining the published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the architectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting similarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only organize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation approaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each architectural building block and training choice.

Distilling Large Language Models for Text-Attributed Graph Learning,"Bo Pan, Zheng Zhang, Yifei Zhang, Yuntong Hu, Liang Zhao","Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) are graphs of connected textual documents. Graph models can efficiently learn TAGs, but their training heavily relies on human-annotated labels, which are scarce or even unavailable in many applications. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in few-shot and zero-shot TAG learning, but they suffer from scalability, cost, and privacy issues. Therefore, in this work, we focus on synergizing LLMs and graph models with their complementary strengths by distilling the power of LLMs to a local graph model on TAG learning. To address the inherent gaps between LLMs (generative models for texts) and graph models (discriminative models for graphs), we propose first to let LLMs teach an interpreter with rich textual rationale and then let a student model mimic the interpreter's reasoning without LLMs' textual rationale. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12022v2,2024-02

We further break the LSC problem into Word-in-Context (WiC) and Word Sense Induction (WSI) tasks, and compare models across these different levels. Our evaluation is performed across different languages on eight available benchmarks for LSC, and shows that (i) APD outperforms other approaches for GCD; (ii) XL-LEXEME outperforms other contextualized models for WiC, WSI, and GCD, while being comparable to GPT-4; (iii) there is a clear need for improving the modeling of word meanings, as well as focus on how, when, and why these meanings change, rather than solely focusing on the extent of semantic change.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12011v3,2024-02

Our approach involves sampling a small dataset for calibration and utilizing backpropagation to iteratively optimize block-wise reconstruction error, on a block-by-block basis, aiming for optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of our method over other baselines. For instance, on the Wikitext2 dataset with LlamaV1-7B at 70% sparsity, our proposed EBFT achieves a perplexity of 16.88, surpassing the state-of-the-art DSnoT with a perplexity of 75.14. Moreover, with a structured sparsity ratio of 26\%, EBFT achieves a perplexity of 16.27, outperforming LoRA (perplexity 16.44). Furthermore, the fine-tuning process of EBFT for LlamaV1-7B only takes approximately 30 minutes, and the entire framework can be executed on a single 16GB GPU.

Remember This Event That Year? Assessing Temporal Information and Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Himanshu Beniwal, Dishant Patel, Kowsik Nandagopan D, Hritik Ladia, Ankit Yadav, Mayank Singh","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly ubiquitous, yet their ability to retain and reason about temporal information remains limited, hindering their application in real-world scenarios where understanding the sequential nature of events is crucial. Our study experiments with 12 state-of-the-art models (ranging from 2B to 70B+ parameters) on a novel numerical-temporal dataset, \textbf{TempUN}, spanning from 10,000 BCE to 2100 CE, to uncover significant temporal retention and comprehension limitations. We propose six metrics to assess three learning paradigms to enhance temporal knowledge acquisition. Our findings reveal that open-source models exhibit knowledge gaps more frequently, suggesting a trade-off between limited knowledge and incorrect responses. Additionally, various fine-tuning approaches significantly improved performance, reducing incorrect outputs and impacting the identification of 'information not available' in the generations. The associated dataset and code are available at (https://github.com/lingoiitgn/TempUN).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11997v2,2024-02
Text Diffusion with Reinforced Conditioning,"Yuxuan Liu, Tianchi Yang, Shaohan Huang, Zihan Zhang, Haizhen Huang, Furu Wei, Weiwei Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang","Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capability in generating high-quality images, videos, and audio. Due to their adaptiveness in iterative refinement, they provide a strong potential for achieving better non-autoregressive sequence generation. However, existing text diffusion models still fall short in their performance due to a challenge in handling the discreteness of language. This paper thoroughly analyzes text diffusion models and uncovers two significant limitations: degradation of self-conditioning during training and misalignment between training and sampling. Motivated by our findings, we propose a novel Text Diffusion model called TREC, which mitigates the degradation with Reinforced Conditioning and the misalignment by Time-Aware Variance Scaling. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of TREC against autoregressive, non-autoregressive, and diffusion baselines. Moreover, qualitative analysis shows its advanced ability to fully utilize the diffusion process in refining samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14843v1,2024-02
Compress to Impress: Unleashing the Potential of Compressive Memory in Real-World Long-Term Conversations,"Nuo Chen, Hongguang Li, Juhua Huang, Baoyuan Wang, Jia Li","Existing retrieval-based methods have made significant strides in maintaining long-term conversations. However, these approaches face challenges in memory database management and accurate memory retrieval, hindering their efficacy in dynamic, real-world interactions. This study introduces a novel framework, COmpressive Memory-Enhanced Dialogue sYstems (COMEDY), which eschews traditional retrieval modules and memory databases. Instead, COMEDY adopts a ""One-for-All"" approach, utilizing a single language model to manage memory generation, compression, and response generation. Central to this framework is the concept of compressive memory, which intergrates session-specific summaries, user-bot dynamics, and past events into a concise memory format. To support COMEDY, we curated a large-scale Chinese instruction-tuning dataset, Dolphin, derived from real user-chatbot interactions. Comparative evaluations demonstrate COMEDY's superiority over traditional retrieval-based methods in producing more nuanced and human-like conversational experiences. Our codes are available at https://github.com/nuochenpku/COMEDY.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11975v2,2024-02
What Do Dialect Speakers Want? A Survey of Attitudes Towards Language Technology for German Dialects,"Verena Blaschke, Christoph Purschke, Hinrich Schütze, Barbara Plank","Natural language processing (NLP) has largely focused on modelling standardized languages. More recently, attention has increasingly shifted to local, non-standardized languages and dialects. However, the relevant speaker populations' needs and wishes with respect to NLP tools are largely unknown. In this paper, we focus on dialects and regional languages related to German -- a group of varieties that is heterogeneous in terms of prestige and standardization. We survey speakers of these varieties (N=327) and present their opinions on hypothetical language technologies for their dialects. Although attitudes vary among subgroups of our respondents, we find that respondents are especially in favour of potential NLP tools that work with dialectal input (especially audio input) such as virtual assistants, and less so for applications that produce dialectal output such as machine translation or spellcheckers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11968v2,2024-02
Structure Guided Large Language Model for SQL Generation,"Qinggang Zhang, Junnan Dong, Hao Chen, Wentao Li, Feiran Huang, Xiao Huang","Generating accurate Structured Querying Language (SQL) is a long-standing problem, especially in matching users' semantic queries with structured databases and then generating structured SQL. Existing models typically input queries and database schemas into the LLM and rely on the LLM to perform semantic-structure matching and generate structured SQL. However, such solutions overlook the structural information within user queries and databases, which can be utilized to enhance the generation of structured SQL. This oversight can lead to inaccurate or unexecutable SQL generation. To fully exploit the structure, we propose a structure-to-SQL framework, which leverages the inherent structure information to improve the SQL generation of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce our Structure Guided SQL~(SGU-SQL) generation model. SGU-SQL first links user queries and databases in a structure-enhanced manner. It then decomposes complicated linked structures with grammar trees to guide the LLM to generate the SQL step by step. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets illustrate that SGU-SQL can outperform sixteen SQL generation baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13284v2,2024-02
DB-LLM: Accurate Dual-Binarization for Efficient LLMs,"Hong Chen, Chengtao Lv, Liang Ding, Haotong Qin, Xiabin Zhou, Yifu Ding, Xuebo Liu, Min Zhang, Jinyang Guo, Xianglong Liu, Dacheng Tao","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, while the expensive memory and computation consumption impede their practical deployment. Quantization emerges as one of the most effective methods for improving the computational efficiency of LLMs. However, existing ultra-low-bit quantization always causes severe accuracy drops. In this paper, we empirically relieve the micro and macro characteristics of ultra-low bit quantization and present a novel Dual-Binarization method for LLMs, namely DB-LLM. For the micro-level, we take both the accuracy advantage of 2-bit-width and the efficiency advantage of binarization into account, introducing Flexible Dual Binarization (FDB). By splitting 2-bit quantized weights into two independent sets of binaries, FDB ensures the accuracy of representations and introduces flexibility, utilizing the efficient bitwise operations of binarization while retaining the inherent high sparsity of ultra-low bit quantization. For the macro-level, we find the distortion that exists in the prediction of LLM after quantization, which is specified as the deviations related to the ambiguity of samples. We propose the Deviation-Aware Distillation (DAD) method, enabling the model to focus differently on various samples. Comprehensive experiments show that our DB-LLM not only significantly surpasses the current State-of-The-Art (SoTA) in ultra-low bit quantization (eg, perplexity decreased from 9.64 to 7.23), but also achieves an additional 20\% reduction in computational consumption compared to the SOTA method under the same bit-width. Our code will be released soon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11960v1,2024-02
Understanding the Therapeutic Relationship between Counselors and Clients in Online Text-based Counseling using LLMs,"Anqi Li, Yu Lu, Nirui Song, Shuai Zhang, Lizhi Ma, Zhenzhong Lan","Robust therapeutic relationships between counselors and clients are fundamental to counseling effectiveness. The assessment of therapeutic alliance is well-established in traditional face-to-face therapy but may not directly translate to text-based settings. With millions of individuals seeking support through online text-based counseling, understanding the relationship in such contexts is crucial.   In this paper, we present an automatic approach using large language models (LLMs) to understand the development of therapeutic alliance in text-based counseling. We adapt a theoretically grounded framework specifically to the context of online text-based counseling and develop comprehensive guidelines for characterizing the alliance. We collect a comprehensive counseling dataset and conduct multiple expert evaluations on a subset based on this framework. Our LLM-based approach, combined with guidelines and simultaneous extraction of supportive evidence underlying its predictions, demonstrates effectiveness in identifying the therapeutic alliance. Through further LLM-based evaluations on additional conversations, our findings underscore the challenges counselors face in cultivating strong online relationships with clients. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of LLM-based feedback mechanisms to enhance counselors' ability to build relationships, supported by a small-scale proof-of-concept.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11958v2,2024-02
Analysis of Multidomain Abstractive Summarization Using Salience Allocation,"Tohida Rehman, Raghubir Bose, Soumik Dey, Samiran Chattopadhyay","This paper explores the realm of abstractive text summarization through the lens of the SEASON (Salience Allocation as Guidance for Abstractive SummarizatiON) technique, a model designed to enhance summarization by leveraging salience allocation techniques. The study evaluates SEASON's efficacy by comparing it with prominent models like BART, PEGASUS, and ProphetNet, all fine-tuned for various text summarization tasks. The assessment is conducted using diverse datasets including CNN/Dailymail, SAMSum, and Financial-news based Event-Driven Trading (EDT), with a specific focus on a financial dataset containing a substantial volume of news articles from 2020/03/01 to 2021/05/06. This paper employs various evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, and MoverScore to evaluate the performance of these models fine-tuned for generating abstractive summaries. The analysis of these metrics offers a thorough insight into the strengths and weaknesses demonstrated by each model in summarizing news dataset, dialogue dataset and financial text dataset.

LEMMA: Towards LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation,"Keyang Xuan, Li Yi, Fan Yang, Ruochen Wu, Yi R. Fung, Heng Ji","The rise of multimodal misinformation on social platforms poses significant challenges for individuals and societies. Its increased credibility and broader impact compared to textual misinformation make detection complex, requiring robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate verification. The emergence of Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) offers a potential solution to this problem. Leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills. In this paper, we first investigate the potential of LVLM on multimodal misinformation detection. We find that even though LVLM has a superior performance compared to LLMs, its profound reasoning may present limited power with a lack of evidence. Based on these observations, we propose LEMMA: LVLM-Enhanced Multimodal Misinformation Detection with External Knowledge Augmentation. LEMMA leverages LVLM intuition and reasoning capabilities while augmenting them with external knowledge to enhance the accuracy of misinformation detection. Our method improves the accuracy over the top baseline LVLM by 7% and 13% on Twitter and Fakeddit datasets respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11943v2,2024-02
CoCo-Agent: A Comprehensive Cognitive MLLM Agent for Smartphone GUI Automation,"Xinbei Ma, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential as human-like autonomous language agents to interact with real-world environments, especially for graphical user interface (GUI) automation. However, those GUI agents require comprehensive cognition ability including exhaustive perception and reliable action response. We propose a Comprehensive Cognitive LLM Agent, CoCo-Agent, with two novel approaches, comprehensive environment perception (CEP) and conditional action prediction (CAP), to systematically improve the GUI automation performance. First, CEP facilitates the GUI perception through different aspects and granularity, including screenshots and complementary detailed layouts for the visual channel and historical actions for the textual channel. Second, CAP decomposes the action prediction into sub-problems: action type prediction and action target conditioned on the action type. With our technical design, our agent achieves new state-of-the-art performance on AITW and META-GUI benchmarks, showing promising abilities in realistic scenarios.

We first performed data augmentation and cleaning on the dataset to enhance model training efficiency and accuracy. In the monolingual task, we evaluated traditional deep-learning methods, multiscale positive-unlabeled framework (MPU), fine-tuning, adapters and ensemble methods. Then, we selected the top-performing models based on their accuracy from the monolingual models and evaluated them in subtasks A and B. The final model construction employed a stacking ensemble that combined fine-tuning with MPU. Our system achieved 8th (scored 8th in terms of accuracy, officially ranked 13th) place in the official test set in multilingual settings of subtask A.

Cofca: A Step-Wise Counterfactual Multi-hop QA benchmark,"Jian Wu, Linyi Yang, Zhen Wang, Manabu Okumura, Yue Zhang","While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in question-answering (QA) tasks, their real reasoning abilities on multiple evidence retrieval and integration on Multi-hop QA tasks remain less explored. Firstly, LLMs sometimes generate answers that rely on internal memory rather than retrieving evidence and reasoning in the given context, which brings concerns about the evaluation quality of real reasoning abilities. Although previous counterfactual QA benchmarks can separate the internal memory of LLMs, they focus solely on final QA performance, which is insufficient for reporting LLMs' real reasoning abilities. Because LLMs are expected to engage in intricate reasoning processes that involve evidence retrieval and answering a series of sub-questions from given passages. Moreover, current factual Multi-hop QA (MHQA) benchmarks are annotated on open-source corpora such as Wikipedia, although useful for multi-step reasoning evaluation, they show limitations due to the potential data contamination in LLMs' pre-training stage. To address these issues, we introduce a Step-wise Counterfactual benchmark (CofCA), a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of factual data and counterfactual data that reveals LLMs' real reasoning abilities on multi-step reasoning and reasoning chain evaluation. Our experimental results reveal a significant performance gap of several LLMs between Wikipedia-based factual data and counterfactual data, deeming data contamination issues in existing benchmarks. Moreover, we observe that LLMs usually bypass the correct reasoning chain, showing an inflated multi-step reasoning performance. We believe that our CofCA benchmark will enhance and facilitate the evaluations of trustworthy LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11924v5,2024-02
Semantic Textual Similarity Assessment in Chest X-ray Reports Using a Domain-Specific Cosine-Based Metric,"Sayeh Gholipour Picha, Dawood Al Chanti, Alice Caplier","Medical language processing and deep learning techniques have emerged as critical tools for improving healthcare, particularly in the analysis of medical imaging and medical text data. These multimodal data fusion techniques help to improve the interpretation of medical imaging and lead to increased diagnostic accuracy, informed clinical decisions, and improved patient outcomes. The success of these models relies on the ability to extract and consolidate semantic information from clinical text. This paper addresses the need for more robust methods to evaluate the semantic content of medical reports. Conventional natural language processing approaches and metrics are initially designed for considering the semantic context in the natural language domain and machine translation, often failing to capture the complex semantic meanings inherent in medical content. In this study, we introduce a novel approach designed specifically for assessing the semantic similarity between generated medical reports and the ground truth. Our approach is validated, demonstrating its efficiency in assessing domain-specific semantic similarity within medical contexts. By applying our metric to state-of-the-art Chest X-ray report generation models, we obtain results that not only align with conventional metrics but also provide more contextually meaningful scores in the considered medical domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11908v1,2024-02
Direct Large Language Model Alignment Through Self-Rewarding Contrastive Prompt Distillation,"Aiwei Liu, Haoping Bai, Zhiyun Lu, Xiang Kong, Simon Wang, Jiulong Shan, Meng Cao, Lijie Wen","Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human expectations without human-annotated preference data is an important problem. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the response preference by using the output probabilities of response pairs under contrastive prompt pairs, which could achieve better performance on LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B compared to RLAIF. Based on this, we propose an automatic alignment method, Direct Large Model Alignment (DLMA). First, we use contrastive prompt pairs to automatically generate preference data. Then, we continue to evaluate the generated preference data using contrastive prompt pairs and calculate a self-rewarding score. Finally, we use the DPO algorithm to effectively align LLMs by combining this self-rewarding score. In the experimental stage, our DLMA method could surpass the \texttt{RLHF} method without relying on human-annotated preference data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11907v2,2024-02
Learning to Edit: Aligning LLMs with Knowledge Editing,"Yuxin Jiang, Yufei Wang, Chuhan Wu, Wanjun Zhong, Xingshan Zeng, Jiahui Gao, Liangyou Li, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Ruiming Tang, Qun Liu, Wei Wang","Knowledge editing techniques, aiming to efficiently modify a minor proportion of knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without negatively impacting performance across other inputs, have garnered widespread attention. However, existing methods predominantly rely on memorizing the updated knowledge, impeding LLMs from effectively combining the new knowledge with their inherent knowledge when answering questions. To this end, we propose a Learning to Edit (LTE) framework, focusing on teaching LLMs to apply updated knowledge into input questions, inspired by the philosophy of ""Teach a man to fish."" LTE features a two-phase process: (i) the Alignment Phase, which fine-tunes LLMs on a meticulously curated parallel dataset to make reliable, in-scope edits while preserving out-of-scope information and linguistic proficiency; and (ii) the Inference Phase, which employs a retrieval-based mechanism for real-time and mass knowledge editing. By comparing our approach with seven advanced baselines across four popular knowledge editing benchmarks and two LLM architectures, we demonstrate LTE's superiority in knowledge editing performance, robustness in both batch and sequential editing, minimal interference on general tasks, and rapid editing speeds.

DiLA: Enhancing LLM Tool Learning with Differential Logic Layer,"Yu Zhang, Hui-Ling Zhen, Zehua Pei, Yingzhao Lian, Lihao Yin, Mingxuan Yuan, Bei Yu","Considering the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in logical reasoning and planning, prior efforts have sought to augment LLMs with access to external solvers. While progress has been made on simple reasoning problems, solving classical constraint satisfaction problems, such as the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) and Graph Coloring Problem (GCP), remains difficult for off-the-shelf solvers due to their intricate expressions and exponential search spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel differential logic layer-aided language modeling (DiLA) approach, where logical constraints are integrated into the forward and backward passes of a network layer, to provide another option for LLM tool learning. In DiLA, LLM aims to transform the language description to logic constraints and identify initial solutions of the highest quality, while the differential logic layer focuses on iteratively refining the LLM-prompted solution. Leveraging the logic layer as a bridge, DiLA enhances the logical reasoning ability of LLMs on a range of reasoning problems encoded by Boolean variables, guaranteeing the efficiency and correctness of the solution process. We evaluate the performance of DiLA on two classic reasoning problems and empirically demonstrate its consistent outperformance against existing prompt-based and solver-aided approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11903v3,2024-02
Investigating Multi-Hop Factual Shortcuts in Knowledge Editing of Large Language Models,"Tianjie Ju, Yijin Chen, Xinwei Yuan, Zhuosheng Zhang, Wei Du, Yubin Zheng, Gongshen Liu","Recent work has showcased the powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) in recalling knowledge and reasoning. However, the reliability of LLMs in combining these two capabilities into reasoning through multi-hop facts has not been widely explored. This paper systematically investigates the possibilities for LLMs to utilize shortcuts based on direct connections between the initial and terminal entities of multi-hop knowledge. We first explore the existence of factual shortcuts through Knowledge Neurons, revealing that: (i) the strength of factual shortcuts is highly correlated with the frequency of co-occurrence of initial and terminal entities in the pre-training corpora; (ii) few-shot prompting leverage more shortcuts in answering multi-hop questions compared to chain-of-thought prompting. Then, we analyze the risks posed by factual shortcuts from the perspective of multi-hop knowledge editing. Analysis shows that approximately 20% of the failures are attributed to shortcuts, and the initial and terminal entities in these failure instances usually have higher co-occurrences in the pre-training corpus. Finally, we propose erasing shortcut neurons to mitigate the associated risks and find that this approach significantly reduces failures in multiple-hop knowledge editing caused by shortcuts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11900v2,2024-02
SIBO: A Simple Booster for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning,"Zhihao Wen, Jie Zhang, Yuan Fang","Fine-tuning all parameters of large language models (LLMs) necessitates substantial computational power and extended time. Latest advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Adapter tuning and LoRA, allow for adjustments to only a minor fraction of the parameters of these LLMs. Concurrently, it has been noted that the issue of over-smoothing diminishes the effectiveness of these Transformer-based LLMs, resulting in suboptimal performances in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present SIBO, which is a SImple BOoster to enhance PEFT, by injecting an initial residual. SIBO is straightforward and readily extensible to a range of state-of-the-art PEFT techniques to alleviate over-smoothing and enhance performance. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SIBO significantly enhances the performance of various strong baselines, achieving up to 15.7% and 23.5% improvement over existing PEFT methods on the arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11896v2,2024-02
Bridging or Breaking: Impact of Intergroup Interactions on Religious Polarization,"Rochana Chaturvedi, Sugat Chaturvedi, Elena Zheleva","While exposure to diverse viewpoints may reduce polarization, it can also have a backfire effect and exacerbate polarization when the discussion is adversarial. Here, we examine the question whether intergroup interactions around important events affect polarization between majority and minority groups in social networks. We compile data on the religious identity of nearly 700,000 Indian Twitter users engaging in COVID-19-related discourse during 2020. We introduce a new measure for an individual's group conformity based on contextualized embeddings of tweet text, which helps us assess polarization between religious groups. We then use a meta-learning framework to examine heterogeneous treatment effects of intergroup interactions on an individual's group conformity in the light of communal, political, and socio-economic events. We find that for political and social events, intergroup interactions reduce polarization. This decline is weaker for individuals at the extreme who already exhibit high conformity to their group. In contrast, during communal events, intergroup interactions can increase group conformity. Finally, we decompose the differential effects across religious groups in terms of emotions and topics of discussion. The results show that the dynamics of religious polarization are sensitive to the context and have important implications for understanding the role of intergroup interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11895v3,2024-02
Automating Dataset Updates Towards Reliable and Timely Evaluation of Large Language Models,"Jiahao Ying, Yixin Cao, Yushi Bai, Qianru Sun, Bo Wang, Wei Tang, Zhaojun Ding, Yizhe Yang, Xuanjing Huang, Shuicheng Yan","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across various natural language benchmarks, prompting a continual need to curate more difficult datasets for larger LLMs, which is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose to automate dataset updating and provide systematic analysis regarding its effectiveness in dealing with benchmark leakage issue, difficulty control, and stability. Thus, once the current benchmark has been mastered or leaked, we can update it for timely and reliable evaluation. There are two updating strategies: 1) mimicking strategy to generate similar samples based on original data, preserving stylistic and contextual essence, and 2) extending strategy that further expands existing samples at varying cognitive levels by adapting Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives. Extensive experiments on updated MMLU and BIG-Bench demonstrate the stability of the proposed strategies and find that the mimicking strategy can effectively alleviate issues of overestimation from benchmark leakage. In cases where the efficient mimicking strategy fails, our extending strategy still shows promising results. Additionally, by controlling the difficulty, we can better discern the models' performance and enable fine-grained analysis neither too difficult nor too easy an exam can fairly judge students' learning status. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to automate updating benchmarks for reliable and timely evaluation.

FeB4RAG: Evaluating Federated Search in the Context of Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Shuai Wang, Ekaterina Khramtsova, Shengyao Zhuang, Guido Zuccon","Federated search systems aggregate results from multiple search engines, selecting appropriate sources to enhance result quality and align with user intent. With the increasing uptake of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, federated search can play a pivotal role in sourcing relevant information across heterogeneous data sources to generate informed responses. However, existing datasets, such as those developed in the past TREC FedWeb tracks, predate the RAG paradigm shift and lack representation of modern information retrieval challenges. To bridge this gap, we present FeB4RAG, a novel dataset specifically designed for federated search within RAG frameworks. This dataset, derived from 16 sub-collections of the widely used \beir benchmarking collection, includes 790 information requests (akin to conversational queries) tailored for chatbot applications, along with top results returned by each resource and associated LLM-derived relevance judgements. Additionally, to support the need for this collection, we demonstrate the impact on response generation of a high quality federated search system for RAG compared to a naive approach to federated search. We do so by comparing answers generated through the RAG pipeline through a qualitative side-by-side comparison. Our collection fosters and supports the development and evaluation of new federated search methods, especially in the context of RAG pipelines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11891v1,2024-02
Revisiting Knowledge Distillation for Autoregressive Language Models,"Qihuang Zhong, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao","Knowledge distillation (KD) is a common approach to compress a teacher model to reduce its inference cost and memory footprint, by training a smaller student model. However, in the context of autoregressive language models (LMs), we empirically find that larger teacher LMs might dramatically result in a poorer student. In response to this problem, we conduct a series of analyses and reveal that different tokens have different teaching modes, neglecting which will lead to performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive teaching approach (ATKD) to improve the KD. The core of ATKD is to reduce rote learning and make teaching more diverse and flexible. Extensive experiments on 8 LM tasks show that, with the help of ATKD, various baseline KD methods can achieve consistent and significant performance gains (up to +3.04% average score) across all model types and sizes. More encouragingly, ATKD can improve the student model generalization effectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11890v2,2024-02
ROSE Doesn't Do That: Boosting the Safety of Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models with Reverse Prompt Contrastive Decoding,"Qihuang Zhong, Liang Ding, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao","With the development of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), improving the safety of LLMs has become more critical. However, the current approaches for aligning the LLMs output with expected safety usually require substantial training efforts, e.g., high-quality safety data and expensive computational resources, which are costly and inefficient. To this end, we present reverse prompt contrastive decoding (ROSE), a simple-yet-effective method to directly boost the safety of existing instruction-tuned LLMs without any additional training. The principle of ROSE is to improve the probability of desired safe output via suppressing the undesired output induced by the carefully-designed reverse prompts. Experiments on 6 safety and 2 general-purpose tasks show that, our ROSE not only brings consistent and significant safety improvements (up to +13.8% safety score) upon 5 types of instruction-tuned LLMs, but also benefits the general-purpose ability of LLMs. In-depth analyses explore the underlying mechanism of ROSE, and reveal when and where to use it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11889v2,2024-02

Although impressive results have been achieved, we find that existing benchmarks do not reflect the complexity of real medical reports and specialized in-depth reasoning capabilities. In this work, we introduced RJUA-MedDQA, a comprehensive benchmark in the field of medical specialization, which poses several challenges: comprehensively interpreting imgage content across diverse challenging layouts, possessing numerical reasoning ability to identify abnormal indicators and demonstrating clinical reasoning ability to provide statements of disease diagnosis, status and advice based on medical contexts. We carefully design the data generation pipeline and proposed the Efficient Structural Restoration Annotation (ESRA) Method, aimed at restoring textual and tabular content in medical report images. This method substantially enhances annotation efficiency, doubling the productivity of each annotator, and yields a 26.8% improvement in accuracy. We conduct extensive evaluations, including few-shot assessments of 5 LMMs which are capable of solving Chinese medical QA tasks. To further investigate the limitations and potential of current LMMs, we conduct comparative experiments on a set of strong LLMs by using image-text generated by ESRA method. We report the performance of baselines and offer several observations: (1) The overall performance of existing LMMs is still limited; however LMMs more robust to low-quality and diverse-structured images compared to LLMs. (3) Reasoning across context and image content present significant challenges.

The Colorful Future of LLMs: Evaluating and Improving LLMs as Emotional Supporters for Queer Youth,"Shir Lissak, Nitay Calderon, Geva Shenkman, Yaakov Ophir, Eyal Fruchter, Anat Brunstein Klomek, Roi Reichart","Queer youth face increased mental health risks, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Hindered by negative stigma, they often avoid seeking help and rely on online resources, which may provide incompatible information. Although access to a supportive environment and reliable information is invaluable, many queer youth worldwide have no access to such support. However, this could soon change due to the rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. This paper aims to comprehensively explore the potential of LLMs to revolutionize emotional support for queers. To this end, we conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of LLM's interactions with queer-related content. To evaluate response quality, we develop a novel ten-question scale that is inspired by psychological standards and expert input. We apply this scale to score several LLMs and human comments to posts where queer youth seek advice and share experiences. We find that LLM responses are supportive and inclusive, outscoring humans. However, they tend to be generic, not empathetic enough, and lack personalization, resulting in nonreliable and potentially harmful advice. We discuss these challenges, demonstrate that a dedicated prompt can improve the performance, and propose a blueprint of an LLM-supporter that actively (but sensitively) seeks user context to provide personalized, empathetic, and reliable responses. Our annotated dataset is available for further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11886v1,2024-02
M2K-VDG: Model-Adaptive Multimodal Knowledge Anchor Enhanced Video-grounded Dialogue Generation,"Hongcheng Liu, Pingjie Wang, Yu Wang, Yanfeng Wang","Video-grounded dialogue generation (VDG) requires the system to generate a fluent and accurate answer based on multimodal knowledge. However, the difficulty in multimodal knowledge utilization brings serious hallucinations to VDG models in practice. Although previous works mitigate the hallucination in a variety of ways, they hardly take notice of the importance of the multimodal knowledge anchor answer tokens. In this paper, we reveal via perplexity that different VDG models experience varying hallucinations and exhibit diverse anchor tokens. Based on this observation, we propose M2K-VDG, a model-adaptive multimodal knowledge anchor enhancement framework for hallucination reduction. Furthermore, we introduce the counterfactual effect for more accurate anchor token detection. The experimental results on three popular benchmarks exhibit the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11875v1,2024-02
How Interpretable are Reasoning Explanations from Prompting Large Language Models?,"Wei Jie Yeo, Ranjan Satapathy, Rick Siow Mong Goh, Erik Cambria","Prompt Engineering has garnered significant attention for enhancing the performance of large language models across a multitude of tasks. Techniques such as the Chain-of-Thought not only bolster task performance but also delineate a clear trajectory of reasoning steps, offering a tangible form of explanation for the audience. Prior works on interpretability assess the reasoning chains yielded by Chain-of-Thought solely along a singular axis, namely faithfulness. We present a comprehensive and multifaceted evaluation of interpretability, examining not only faithfulness but also robustness and utility across multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Likewise, our investigation is not confined to a single prompting technique; it expansively covers a multitude of prevalent prompting techniques employed in large language models, thereby ensuring a wide-ranging and exhaustive evaluation. In addition, we introduce a simple interpretability alignment technique, termed Self-Entailment-Alignment Chain-of-thought, that yields more than 70\% improvements across multiple dimensions of interpretability.

Modularized Networks for Few-shot Hateful Meme Detection,"Rui Cao, Roy Ka-Wei Lee, Jing Jiang","In this paper, we address the challenge of detecting hateful memes in the low-resource setting where only a few labeled examples are available. Our approach leverages the compositionality of Low-rank adaptation (LoRA), a widely used parameter-efficient tuning technique. We commence by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with LoRA on selected tasks pertinent to hateful meme detection, thereby generating a suite of LoRA modules. These modules are capable of essential reasoning skills for hateful meme detection. We then use the few available annotated samples to train a module composer, which assigns weights to the LoRA modules based on their relevance. The model's learnable parameters are directly proportional to the number of LoRA modules. This modularized network, underpinned by LLMs and augmented with LoRA modules, exhibits enhanced generalization in the context of hateful meme detection. Our evaluation spans three datasets designed for hateful meme detection in a few-shot learning context. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance to traditional in-context learning, which is also more computationally intensive during inference.We then use the few available annotated samples to train a module composer, which assigns weights to the LoRA modules based on their relevance.

CodeArt: Better Code Models by Attention Regularization When Symbols Are Lacking,"Zian Su, Xiangzhe Xu, Ziyang Huang, Zhuo Zhang, Yapeng Ye, Jianjun Huang, Xiangyu Zhang","Transformer based code models have impressive performance in many software engineering tasks. However, their effectiveness degrades when symbols are missing or not informative. The reason is that the model may not learn to pay attention to the right correlations/contexts without the help of symbols. We propose a new method to pre-train general code models when symbols are lacking. We observe that in such cases, programs degenerate to something written in a very primitive language. We hence propose to use program analysis to extract contexts a priori (instead of relying on symbols and masked language modeling as in vanilla models). We then leverage a novel attention masking method to only allow the model attending to these contexts, e.g., bi-directional program dependence transitive closures and token co-occurrences. In the meantime, the inherent self-attention mechanism is utilized to learn which of the allowed attentions are more important compared to others. To realize the idea, we enhance the vanilla tokenization and model architecture of a BERT model, construct and utilize attention masks, and introduce a new pre-training algorithm. We pre-train this BERT-like model from scratch, using a dataset of 26 million stripped binary functions with explicit program dependence information extracted by our tool. We apply the model in three downstream tasks: binary similarity, type inference, and malware family classification. Our pre-trained model can improve the SOTAs in these tasks from 53% to 64%, 49% to 60%, and 74% to 94%, respectively. It also substantially outperforms other general pre-training techniques of code understanding models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11842v1,2024-02
An enhanced Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) with Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) for text feature selection and clustering,"Mahsa Azarshab, Mohammad Fathian, Babak Amiri","Text document clustering can play a vital role in organizing and handling the everincreasing number of text documents. Uninformative and redundant features included in large text documents reduce the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm. Feature selection (FS) is a well-known technique for removing these features. Since FS can be formulated as an optimization problem, various meta-heuristic algorithms have been employed to solve it. Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) is a novel meta-heuristic algorithm that benefits from the low number of parameters and fast convergence. A hybrid method can simultaneously benefit from the advantages of TLBO and tackle the possible entrapment in the local optimum. By proposing a hybrid of TLBO, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) operators, this paper suggests a filter-based FS algorithm (TLBO-GWO). Six benchmark datasets are selected, and TLBO-GWO is compared with three recently proposed FS algorithms with similar approaches, the main TLBO and GWO. The comparison is conducted based on clustering evaluation measures, convergence behavior, and dimension reduction, and is validated using statistical tests. The results reveal that TLBO-GWO can significantly enhance the effectiveness of the text clustering technique (K-means).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11839v1,2024-02
Ask Optimal Questions: Aligning Large Language Models with Retriever's Preference in Conversational Search,"Chanwoong Yoon, Gangwoo Kim, Byeongguk Jeon, Sungdong Kim, Yohan Jo, Jaewoo Kang","Conversational search, unlike single-turn retrieval tasks, requires understanding the current question within a dialogue context. The common approach of rewrite-then-retrieve aims to decontextualize questions to be self-sufficient for off-the-shelf retrievers, but most existing methods produce sub-optimal query rewrites due to the limited ability to incorporate signals from the retrieval results. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework RetPO (Retriever's Preference Optimization), which is designed to optimize a language model (LM) for reformulating search queries in line with the preferences of the target retrieval systems. The process begins by prompting a large LM to produce various potential rewrites and then collects retrieval performance for these rewrites as the retrievers' preferences. Through the process, we construct a large-scale dataset called RF collection, containing Retrievers' Feedback on over 410K query rewrites across 12K conversations. Furthermore, we fine-tune a smaller LM using this dataset to align it with the retrievers' preferences as feedback. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two recent conversational search benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing baselines, including GPT-3.5.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11827v1,2024-02
Microstructures and Accuracy of Graph Recall by Large Language Models,"Yanbang Wang, Hejie Cui, Jon Kleinberg","Graphs data is crucial for many applications, and much of it exists in the relations described in textual format. As a result, being able to accurately recall and encode a graph described in earlier text is a basic yet pivotal ability that LLMs need to demonstrate if they are to perform reasoning tasks that involve graph-structured information. Human performance at graph recall has been studied by cognitive scientists for decades, and has been found to often exhibit certain structural patterns of bias that align with human handling of social relationships. To date, however, we know little about how LLMs behave in analogous graph recall tasks: do their recalled graphs also exhibit certain biased patterns, and if so, how do they compare with humans and affect other graph reasoning tasks? In this work, we perform the first systematical study of graph recall by LLMs, investigating the accuracy and biased microstructures (local structural patterns) in their recall. We find that LLMs not only underperform often in graph recall, but also tend to favor more triangles and alternating 2-paths. Moreover, we find that more advanced LLMs have a striking dependence on the domain that a real-world graph comes from -- by yielding the best recall accuracy when the graph is narrated in a language style consistent with its original domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11821v3,2024-02
Head-wise Shareable Attention for Large Language Models,"Zouying Cao, Yifei Yang, Hai Zhao","Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from huge number of parameters, which restricts their deployment on edge devices. Weight sharing is one promising solution that encourages weight reuse, effectively reducing memory usage with less performance drop. However, current weight sharing techniques primarily focus on small-scale models like BERT and employ coarse-grained sharing rules, e.g., layer-wise. This becomes limiting given the prevalence of LLMs and sharing an entire layer or block obviously diminishes the flexibility of weight sharing. In this paper, we present a perspective on head-wise shareable attention for large language models. We further propose two memory-efficient methods that share parameters across attention heads, with a specific focus on LLMs. Both of them use the same dynamic strategy to select the shared weight matrices. The first method directly reuses the pre-trained weights without retraining, denoted as $\textbf{DirectShare}$. The second method first post-trains with constraint on weight matrix similarity and then shares, denoted as $\textbf{PostShare}$. Experimental results reveal our head-wise shared models still maintain satisfactory capabilities, demonstrating the feasibility of fine-grained weight sharing applied to LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11819v3,2024-02
Where It Really Matters: Few-Shot Environmental Conservation Media Monitoring for Low-Resource Languages,"Sameer Jain, Sedrick Scott Keh, Shova Chettri, Karun Dewan, Pablo Izquierdo, Johanna Prussman, Pooja Shreshtha, Cesar Suarez, Zheyuan Ryan Shi, Lei Li, Fei Fang","Environmental conservation organizations routinely monitor news content on conservation in protected areas to maintain situational awareness of developments that can have an environmental impact. Existing automated media monitoring systems require large amounts of data labeled by domain experts, which is only feasible at scale for high-resource languages like English. However, such tools are most needed in the global south where news of interest is mainly in local low-resource languages, and far fewer experts are available to annotate datasets sustainably. In this paper, we propose NewsSerow, a method to automatically recognize environmental conservation content in low-resource languages. NewsSerow is a pipeline of summarization, in-context few-shot classification, and self-reflection using large language models (LLMs). Using at most 10 demonstration example news articles in Nepali, NewsSerow significantly outperforms other few-shot methods and achieves comparable performance with models fully fine-tuned using thousands of examples. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has deployed NewsSerow for media monitoring in Nepal, significantly reducing their operational burden, and ensuring that AI tools for conservation actually reach the communities that need them the most. NewsSerow has also been deployed for countries with other languages like Colombia.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11818v1,2024-02
HU at SemEval-2024 Task 8A: Can Contrastive Learning Learn Embeddings to Detect Machine-Generated Text?,"Shubhashis Roy Dipta, Sadat Shahriar","This paper describes our system developed for SemEval-2024 Task 8, ``Multigenerator, Multidomain, and Multilingual Black-Box Machine-Generated Text Detection'' Machine-generated texts have been one of the main concerns due to the use of large language models (LLM) in fake text generation, phishing, cheating in exams, or even plagiarizing copyright materials. A lot of systems have been developed to detect machine-generated text. Nonetheless, the majority of these systems rely on the text-generating model. This limitation is impractical in real-world scenarios, as it's often impossible to know which specific model the user has used for text generation. In this work, we propose a $\textbf{single}$ model based on contrastive learning, which uses $\textbf{$\approx$40% of the baseline's parameters}$ (149M vs. 355M) but shows a comparable performance on the test dataset $(\textbf{21st out of 137 participants})$. Our key finding is that even without an ensemble of multiple models, a single base model can have comparable performance with the help of data augmentation and contrastive learning.

FIPO: Free-form Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization with Preference Dataset and Modular Fine-tuning Schema,"Junru Lu, Siyu An, Min Zhang, Yulan He, Di Yin, Xing Sun","When the quality of naive prompts is carefully optimized by human experts, the task performance of large language models (LLMs) can be significantly improved. However, expert-based prompt optimizations are expensive. Herein, some works have proposed Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), to optimize naive prompts according to task outputs of given in-box testing models, with the help of advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) in an ad-hoc way. Although effective, existing schemes suffer from poor generalization ability and privacy risk. To this end, we collect the first large-scale Prompt Optimization Preference dataset (POP), fine-tune offline local LLM-based optimizers, then fairly test with various downstream models. Our method allows accurate optimization of the core task instruction part within the naive prompt in a model-agnostic manner, and thus is named Free-from Instruction-oriented Prompt Optimization (FIPO). In specific, FIPO uses a modular APO template that dynamically integrate the naive task instruction, optional instruction responses, and optional ground truth to produce finely optimized prompts. The POP dataset is meticulously constructed using advanced LLMs, undergoing rigorous cross-validation by human experts and analytical models. Leveraging insights from the data with Tulu2 models and diverse fine-tuning strategies, we validate the efficacy of FIPO framework across five public benchmarks and six testing models.

Generation Meets Verification: Accelerating Large Language Model Inference with Smart Parallel Auto-Correct Decoding,"Hanling Yi, Feng Lin, Hongbin Li, Peiyang Ning, Xiaotian Yu, Rong Xiao","This research aims to accelerate the inference speed of large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters.

This is realized through a specialized semi-autoregressive supervised fine-tuning process that equips existing LLMs with the ability to simultaneously predict multiple tokens. Additionally, an auto-correct decoding algorithm facilitates the simultaneous generation and verification of token sequences within a single model invocation. Through extensive experiments on a range of LLMs, SPACE has demonstrated inference speedup ranging from 2.7x-4.0x on HumanEval-X while maintaining output quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11809v3,2024-02
LLM as Prompter: Low-resource Inductive Reasoning on Arbitrary Knowledge Graphs,"Kai Wang, Yuwei Xu, Zhiyong Wu, Siqiang Luo","Knowledge Graph (KG) inductive reasoning, which aims to infer missing facts from new KGs that are not seen during training, has been widely adopted in various applications. One critical challenge of KG inductive reasoning is handling low-resource scenarios with scarcity in both textual and structural aspects. In this paper, we attempt to address this challenge with Large Language Models (LLMs). Particularly, we utilize the state-of-the-art LLMs to generate a graph-structural prompt to enhance the pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which brings us new methodological insights into the KG inductive reasoning methods, as well as high generalizability in practice. On the methodological side, we introduce a novel pretraining and prompting framework ProLINK, designed for low-resource inductive reasoning across arbitrary KGs without requiring additional training. On the practical side, we experimentally evaluate our approach on 36 low-resource KG datasets and find that ProLINK outperforms previous methods in three-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot reasoning tasks, exhibiting average performance improvements by 20%, 45%, and 147%, respectively. Furthermore, ProLINK demonstrates strong robustness for various LLM promptings as well as full-shot scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11804v3,2024-02
Unveiling the Magic: Investigating Attention Distillation in Retrieval-augmented Generation,"Zizhong Li, Haopeng Zhang, Jiawei Zhang","Retrieval-augmented generation framework can address the limitations of large language models by enabling real-time knowledge updates for more accurate answers. An efficient way in the training phase of retrieval-augmented models is attention distillation, which uses attention scores as a supervision signal instead of manually annotated query-document pairs. Despite its growing popularity, the detailed mechanisms behind the success of attention distillation remain unexplored, particularly the specific patterns it leverages to benefit training. In this paper, we address this gap by conducting a comprehensive review of attention distillation workflow and identifying key factors influencing the learning quality of retrieval-augmented language models. We further propose indicators for optimizing models' training methods and avoiding ineffective training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11794v1,2024-02
What Evidence Do Language Models Find Convincing?,"Alexander Wan, Eric Wallace, Dan Klein","Retrieval-augmented language models are being increasingly tasked with subjective, contentious, and conflicting queries such as ""is aspartame linked to cancer"". To resolve these ambiguous queries, one must search through a large range of websites and consider ""which, if any, of this evidence do I find convincing?"". In this work, we study how LLMs answer this question. In particular, we construct ConflictingQA, a dataset that pairs controversial queries with a series of real-world evidence documents that contain different facts (e.g., quantitative results), argument styles (e.g., appeals to authority), and answers (Yes or No). We use this dataset to perform sensitivity and counterfactual analyses to explore which text features most affect LLM predictions. Overall, we find that current models rely heavily on the relevance of a website to the query, while largely ignoring stylistic features that humans find important such as whether a text contains scientific references or is written with a neutral tone. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of RAG corpus quality (e.g., the need to filter misinformation), and possibly even a shift in how LLMs are trained to better align with human judgements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11782v2,2024-02
Uncovering Latent Human Wellbeing in Language Model Embeddings,"Pedro Freire, ChengCheng Tan, Adam Gleave, Dan Hendrycks, Scott Emmons","Do language models implicitly learn a concept of human wellbeing? We explore this through the ETHICS Utilitarianism task, assessing if scaling enhances pretrained models' representations. Our initial finding reveals that, without any prompt engineering or finetuning, the leading principal component from OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 achieves 73.9% accuracy. This closely matches the 74.6% of BERT-large finetuned on the entire ETHICS dataset, suggesting pretraining conveys some understanding about human wellbeing. Next, we consider four language model families, observing how Utilitarianism accuracy varies with increased parameters.

Structured Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Few-Shot Generation of Content-Grounded QA Conversations,"Md Arafat Sultan, Jatin Ganhotra, Ramón Fernandez Astudillo","We introduce a structured chain-of-thought (SCoT) prompting approach to generating content-grounded multi-turn question-answer conversations using a pre-trained large language model (LLM). At the core of our proposal is a structured breakdown of the complex task into a number of states in a state machine, so that actions corresponding to various subtasks, e.g., content reading and utterance generation, can be executed in their own dedicated states. Each state leverages a unique set of resources including prompts and (optionally) additional tools to augment the generation process. Our experimental results show that SCoT prompting with designated states for hallucination mitigation increases agent faithfulness to grounding documents by up to 16.8%. When used as training data, our open-domain conversations synthesized from only 6 Wikipedia-based seed demonstrations train strong conversational QA agents; in out-of-domain evaluation, for example, we observe improvements of up to 13.9% over target domain gold data when the latter is augmented with our generated examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11770v2,2024-02
ChatGPT Based Data Augmentation for Improved Parameter-Efficient Debiasing of LLMs,"Pengrui Han, Rafal Kocielnik, Adhithya Saravanan, Roy Jiang, Or Sharir, Anima Anandkumar","Large Language models (LLMs), while powerful, exhibit harmful social biases. Debiasing is often challenging due to computational costs, data constraints, and potential degradation of multi-task language capabilities. This work introduces a novel approach utilizing ChatGPT to generate synthetic training data, aiming to enhance the debiasing of LLMs. We propose two strategies: Targeted Prompting, which provides effective debiasing for known biases but necessitates prior specification of bias in question; and General Prompting, which, while slightly less effective, offers debiasing across various categories. We leverage resource-efficient LLM debiasing using adapter tuning and compare the effectiveness of our synthetic data to existing debiasing datasets. Our results reveal that: (1) ChatGPT can efficiently produce high-quality training data for debiasing other LLMs; (2) data produced via our approach surpasses existing datasets in debiasing performance while also preserving internal knowledge of a pre-trained LLM; and (3) synthetic data exhibits generalizability across categories, effectively mitigating various biases, including intersectional ones. These findings underscore the potential of synthetic data in advancing the fairness of LLMs with minimal retraining cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11764v2,2024-02
"Large Language Models for Stemming: Promises, Pitfalls and Failures","Shuai Wang, Shengyao Zhuang, Guido Zuccon","Text stemming is a natural language processing technique that is used to reduce words to their base form, also known as the root form. The use of stemming in IR has been shown to often improve the effectiveness of keyword-matching models such as BM25. However, traditional stemming methods, focusing solely on individual terms, overlook the richness of contextual information. Recognizing this gap, in this paper, we investigate the promising idea of using large language models (LLMs) to stem words by leveraging its capability of context understanding. With this respect, we identify three avenues, each characterised by different trade-offs in terms of computational cost, effectiveness and robustness : (1) use LLMs to stem the vocabulary for a collection, i.e., the set of unique words that appear in the collection (vocabulary stemming), (2) use LLMs to stem each document separately (contextual stemming), and (3) use LLMs to extract from each document entities that should not be stemmed, then use vocabulary stemming to stem the rest of the terms (entity-based contextual stemming). Through a series of empirical experiments, we compare the use of LLMs for stemming with that of traditional lexical stemmers such as Porter and Krovetz for English text. We find that while vocabulary stemming and contextual stemming fail to achieve higher effectiveness than traditional stemmers, entity-based contextual stemming can achieve a higher effectiveness than using Porter stemmer alone, under specific conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11757v1,2024-02
MARS: Meaning-Aware Response Scoring for Uncertainty Estimation in Generative LLMs,"Yavuz Faruk Bakman, Duygu Nur Yaldiz, Baturalp Buyukates, Chenyang Tao, Dimitrios Dimitriadis, Salman Avestimehr","Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized for their excellence in various tasks. However, their tendency to produce inaccurate or misleading outputs poses a potential risk, particularly in high-stakes environments. Therefore, estimating the correctness of generative LLM outputs is an important task for enhanced reliability. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in generative LLMs is an evolving domain, where SOTA probability-based methods commonly employ length-normalized scoring. In this work, we propose Meaning-Aware Response Scoring (MARS) as an alternative to length-normalized scoring for UE methods. MARS is a novel scoring function that considers the semantic contribution of each token in the generated sequence in the context of the question. We demonstrate that integrating MARS into UE methods results in a universal and significant improvement in UE performance. We conduct experiments using three distinct closed-book question-answering datasets across five popular pre-trained LLMs. Lastly, we validate the efficacy of MARS on a Medical QA dataset.

SPML: A DSL for Defending Language Models Against Prompt Attacks,"Reshabh K Sharma, Vinayak Gupta, Dan Grossman","Large language models (LLMs) have profoundly transformed natural language applications, with a growing reliance on instruction-based definitions for designing chatbots. However, post-deployment the chatbot definitions are fixed and are vulnerable to attacks by malicious users, emphasizing the need to prevent unethical applications and financial losses. Existing studies explore user prompts' impact on LLM-based chatbots, yet practical methods to contain attacks on application-specific chatbots remain unexplored. This paper presents System Prompt Meta Language (SPML), a domain-specific language for refining prompts and monitoring the inputs to the LLM-based chatbots. SPML actively checks attack prompts, ensuring user inputs align with chatbot definitions to prevent malicious execution on the LLM backbone, optimizing costs. It also streamlines chatbot definition crafting with programming language capabilities, overcoming natural language design challenges. Additionally, we introduce a groundbreaking benchmark with 1.8k system prompts and 20k user inputs, offering the inaugural language and benchmark for chatbot definition evaluation.

ArtPrompt: ASCII Art-based Jailbreak Attacks against Aligned LLMs,"Fengqing Jiang, Zhangchen Xu, Luyao Niu, Zhen Xiang, Bhaskar Ramasubramanian, Bo Li, Radha Poovendran","Safety is critical to the usage of large language models (LLMs). Multiple techniques such as data filtering and supervised fine-tuning have been developed to strengthen LLM safety. However, currently known techniques presume that corpora used for safety alignment of LLMs are solely interpreted by semantics. This assumption, however, does not hold in real-world applications, which leads to severe vulnerabilities in LLMs. For example, users of forums often use ASCII art, a form of text-based art, to convey image information. In this paper, we propose a novel ASCII art-based jailbreak attack and introduce a comprehensive benchmark Vision-in-Text Challenge (ViTC) to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in recognizing prompts that cannot be solely interpreted by semantics. We show that five SOTA LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and Llama2) struggle to recognize prompts provided in the form of ASCII art. Based on this observation, we develop the jailbreak attack ArtPrompt, which leverages the poor performance of LLMs in recognizing ASCII art to bypass safety measures and elicit undesired behaviors from LLMs. ArtPrompt only requires black-box access to the victim LLMs, making it a practical attack. We evaluate ArtPrompt on five SOTA LLMs, and show that ArtPrompt can effectively and efficiently induce undesired behaviors from all five LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/ArtPrompt.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11753v4,2024-02

Additionally, due to the participation of remarkable companies such as Google and OpenAI, LLMs are now more accessible, and people can easily use them. However, an important issue is how we can detect AI-generated texts from human-written ones. In this article, we have investigated the problem of AI-generated text detection from two different aspects: semantics and syntax. Finally, we presented an AI model that can distinguish AI-generated texts from human-written ones with high accuracy on both multilingual and monolingual tasks using the M4 dataset. According to our results, using a semantic approach would be more helpful for detection.

To tackle this issue, we propose a demonstration selection method named InfICL, which utilizes influence functions to analyze impacts of training samples. By identifying the most influential training samples as demonstrations, InfICL aims to enhance the ICL generalization performance. To keep InfICL cost-effective, we only use the LLM to generate sample input embeddings, avoiding expensive fine-tuning.

Language Models are Homer Simpson! Safety Re-Alignment of Fine-tuned Language Models through Task Arithmetic,"Rishabh Bhardwaj, Do Duc Anh, Soujanya Poria","Aligned language models face a significant limitation as their fine-tuning often results in compromised safety. To tackle this, we propose a simple method RESTA that performs LLM safety realignment. RESTA stands for REstoring Safety through Task Arithmetic. At its core, it involves a simple arithmetic addition of a safety vector to the weights of the compromised model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RESTA in both parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning, covering a wide range of downstream tasks, including instruction following in Chinese, English, and Hindi, as well as problem-solving capabilities in Code and Math. We also showcase the generalizability of RESTA on three existing safety evaluation benchmarks and a multilingual benchmark dataset proposed as a part of this work, consisting of 550 harmful questions covering 11 categories, each with 5 sub-categories of harm. Overall, RESTA decreases the harmfulness of the compromised model from 18.6% to 5.1% and from 9.2% to 1.5% in parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning, respectively, while maintaining most of the model's performance on the task.

Thus, if a bad actor were to change a key portion of a news article to spread misinformation, whole document MGT detection may fail since the vast majority is human written, but our approach can succeed due to its granular approach. A key challenge in our MGT localization task is that short spans of text, e.g., a single sentence, provides little information indicating if it is machine generated due to its short length. To address this, we leverage contextual information, where we predict whether multiple sentences are machine or human written at once. This enables our approach to identify changes in style or content to boost performance. A gain of 4-13% mean Average Precision (mAP) over prior work demonstrates the effectiveness of approach on five diverse datasets: GoodNews, VisualNews, WikiText, Essay, and WP. We release our implementation at https://github.com/Zhongping-Zhang/MGT_Localization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11744v2,2024-02
"Utilizing BERT for Information Retrieval: Survey, Applications, Resources, and Challenges","Jiajia Wang, Jimmy X. Huang, Xinhui Tu, Junmei Wang, Angela J. Huang, Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Amran Bhuiyan","Recent years have witnessed a substantial increase in the use of deep learning to solve various natural language processing (NLP) problems. Early deep learning models were constrained by their sequential or unidirectional nature, such that they struggled to capture the contextual relationships across text inputs. The introduction of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) leads to a robust encoder for the transformer model that can understand the broader context and deliver state-of-the-art performance across various NLP tasks. This has inspired researchers and practitioners to apply BERT to practical problems, such as information retrieval (IR). A survey that focuses on a comprehensive analysis of prevalent approaches that apply pretrained transformer encoders like BERT to IR can thus be useful for academia and the industry. In light of this, we revisit a variety of BERT-based methods in this survey, cover a wide range of techniques of IR, and group them into six high-level categories: (i) handling long documents, (ii) integrating semantic information, (iii) balancing effectiveness and efficiency, (iv) predicting the weights of terms, (v) query expansion, and (vi) document expansion. We also provide links to resources, including datasets and toolkits, for BERT-based IR systems. A key highlight of our survey is the comparison between BERT's encoder-based models and the latest generative Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, which rely on decoders. Despite the popularity of LLMs, we find that for specific tasks, finely tuned BERT encoders still outperform, and at a lower deployment cost. Finally, we summarize the comprehensive outcomes of the survey and suggest directions for future research in the area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00784v1,2024-02
An Empirical Categorization of Prompting Techniques for Large Language Models: A Practitioner's Guide,"Oluwole Fagbohun, Rachel M. Harrison, Anton Dereventsov","Due to rapid advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), programming these models with prompts has recently gained significant attention. However, the sheer number of available prompt engineering techniques creates an overwhelming landscape for practitioners looking to utilize these tools. For the most efficient and effective use of LLMs, it is important to compile a comprehensive list of prompting techniques and establish a standardized, interdisciplinary categorization framework. In this survey, we examine some of the most well-known prompting techniques from both academic and practical viewpoints and classify them into seven distinct categories. We present an overview of each category, aiming to clarify their unique contributions and showcase their practical applications in real-world examples in order to equip fellow practitioners with a structured framework for understanding and categorizing prompting techniques tailored to their specific domains. We believe that this approach will help simplify the complex landscape of prompt engineering and enable more effective utilization of LLMs in various applications. By providing practitioners with a systematic approach to prompt categorization, we aim to assist in navigating the intricacies of effective prompt design for conversational pre-trained LLMs and inspire new possibilities in their respective fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14837v1,2024-02

To facilitate a comprehensive analysis, we construct a new financial dataset for the claim detection task in the financial domain. We benchmark various language models on this dataset and propose a novel weak-supervision model that incorporates the knowledge of subject matter experts (SMEs) in the aggregation function, outperforming existing approaches. We also demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed model by constructing a novel measure of optimism. Here, we observe the dependence of earnings surprise and return on our optimism measure.

How Susceptible are Large Language Models to Ideological Manipulation?,"Kai Chen, Zihao He, Jun Yan, Taiwei Shi, Kristina Lerman","Large Language Models (LLMs) possess the potential to exert substantial influence on public perceptions and interactions with information. This raises concerns about the societal impact that could arise if the ideologies within these models can be easily manipulated. In this work, we investigate how effectively LLMs can learn and generalize ideological biases from their instruction-tuning data. Our findings reveal a concerning vulnerability: exposure to only a small amount of ideologically driven samples significantly alters the ideology of LLMs. Notably, LLMs demonstrate a startling ability to absorb ideology from one topic and generalize it to even unrelated ones. The ease with which LLMs' ideologies can be skewed underscores the risks associated with intentionally poisoned training data by malicious actors or inadvertently introduced biases by data annotators. It also emphasizes the imperative for robust safeguards to mitigate the influence of ideological manipulations on LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11725v3,2024-02
Shaping Human-AI Collaboration: Varied Scaffolding Levels in Co-writing with Language Models,"Paramveer S. Dhillon, Somayeh Molaei, Jiaqi Li, Maximilian Golub, Shaochun Zheng, Lionel P. Robert","Advances in language modeling have paved the way for novel human-AI co-writing experiences. This paper explores how varying levels of scaffolding from large language models (LLMs) shape the co-writing process. Employing a within-subjects field experiment with a Latin square design, we asked participants (N=131) to respond to argumentative writing prompts under three randomly sequenced conditions: no AI assistance (control), next-sentence suggestions (low scaffolding), and next-paragraph suggestions (high scaffolding). Our findings reveal a U-shaped impact of scaffolding on writing quality and productivity (words/time). While low scaffolding did not significantly improve writing quality or productivity, high scaffolding led to significant improvements, especially benefiting non-regular writers and less tech-savvy users. No significant cognitive burden was observed while using the scaffolded writing tools, but a moderate decrease in text ownership and satisfaction was noted. Our results have broad implications for the design of AI-powered writing tools, including the need for personalized scaffolding mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11723v1,2024-02
Modelling Political Coalition Negotiations Using LLM-based Agents,"Farhad Moghimifar, Yuan-Fang Li, Robert Thomson, Gholamreza Haffari","Coalition negotiations are a cornerstone of parliamentary democracies, characterised by complex interactions and strategic communications among political parties. Despite its significance, the modelling of these negotiations has remained unexplored with the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), mostly due to lack of proper data. In this paper, we introduce coalition negotiations as a novel NLP task, and model it as a negotiation between large language model-based agents. We introduce a multilingual dataset, POLCA, comprising manifestos of European political parties and coalition agreements over a number of elections in these countries. This dataset addresses the challenge of the current scope limitations in political negotiation modelling by providing a diverse, real-world basis for simulation. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical Markov decision process designed to simulate the process of coalition negotiation between political parties and predict the outcomes. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as agents in handling coalition negotiations, offering insights into their capabilities and paving the way for future advancements in political modelling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11712v1,2024-02
MORL-Prompt: An Empirical Analysis of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Discrete Prompt Optimization,"Yasaman Jafari, Dheeraj Mekala, Rose Yu, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick","RL-based techniques can be employed to search for prompts that, when fed into a target language model, maximize a set of user-specified reward functions. However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11711v2,2024-02
A Note on Bias to Complete,"Jia Xu, Mona Diab","Minimizing social bias strengthens societal bonds, promoting shared understanding and better decision-making. We revisit the definition of bias by discovering new bias types (e.g., societal status) in dynamic environments and describe them relative to context, such as culture, region, time, and personal background. Our framework includes eight hypotheses about bias and a minimizing bias strategy for each assumption as well as five methods as proposed solutions in LLM. The realization of the framework is yet to be completed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11710v1,2024-02
GNNavi: Navigating the Information Flow in Large Language Models by Graph Neural Network,"Shuzhou Yuan, Ercong Nie, Michael Färber, Helmut Schmid, Hinrich Schütze","Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities when prompts with demonstrations are used. However, fine-tuning still remains crucial to further enhance their adaptability. Prompt-based fine-tuning proves to be an effective fine-tuning method in low-data scenarios, but high demands on computing resources limit its practicality. We address this issue by introducing a prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach. GNNavi leverages insights into ICL's information flow dynamics, which indicates that label words act in prompts as anchors for information propagation. GNNavi employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) layer to precisely guide the aggregation and distribution of information flow during the processing of prompts by hardwiring the desired information flow into the GNN. Our experiments on text classification tasks with GPT-2 and Llama2 show GNNavi surpasses standard prompt-based fine-tuning methods in few-shot settings by updating just 0.2% to 0.5% of parameters. We compare GNNavi with prevalent PEFT approaches, such as prefix tuning, LoRA and Adapter in terms of performance and efficiency. Our analysis reveals that GNNavi enhances information flow and ensures a clear aggregation process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11709v2,2024-02
Why Lift so Heavy? Slimming Large Language Models by Cutting Off the Layers,"Shuzhou Yuan, Ercong Nie, Bolei Ma, Michael Färber","Large Language Models (LLMs) possess outstanding capabilities in addressing various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the sheer size of these models poses challenges in terms of storage, training and inference due to the inclusion of billions of parameters through layer stacking. While traditional approaches such as model pruning or distillation offer ways for reducing model size, they often come at the expense of performance retention. In our investigation, we systematically explore the approach of reducing the number of layers in LLMs. Surprisingly, we observe that even with fewer layers, LLMs maintain similar or better performance levels, particularly in prompt-based fine-tuning for text classification tasks. Remarkably, in certain cases, models with a single layer outperform their fully layered counterparts. These findings offer valuable insights for future work aimed at mitigating the size constraints of LLMs while preserving their performance, thereby opening avenues for significantly more efficient use of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11700v1,2024-02
Vision-Flan: Scaling Human-Labeled Tasks in Visual Instruction Tuning,"Zhiyang Xu, Chao Feng, Rulin Shao, Trevor Ashby, Ying Shen, Di Jin, Yu Cheng, Qifan Wang, Lifu Huang","Despite vision-language models' (VLMs) remarkable capabilities as versatile visual assistants, two substantial challenges persist within the existing VLM frameworks: (1) lacking task diversity in pretraining and visual instruction tuning, and (2) annotation error and bias in GPT-4 synthesized instruction tuning data. Both challenges lead to issues such as poor generalizability, hallucination, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we construct Vision-Flan, the most diverse publicly available visual instruction tuning dataset to date, comprising 187 diverse tasks and 1,664,261 instances sourced from academic datasets, and each task is accompanied by an expert-written instruction. In addition, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning framework, in which VLMs are firstly finetuned on Vision-Flan and further tuned on GPT-4 synthesized data. We find this two-stage tuning framework significantly outperforms the traditional single-stage visual instruction tuning framework and achieves the state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of multi-modal evaluation benchmarks. Finally, we conduct in-depth analyses to understand visual instruction tuning and our findings reveal that: (1) GPT-4 synthesized data does not substantially enhance VLMs' capabilities but rather modulates the model's responses to human-preferred formats; (2) A minimal quantity (e.g., 1,000) of GPT-4 synthesized data can effectively align VLM responses with human-preference; (3) Visual instruction tuning mainly helps large-language models (LLMs) to understand visual features.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11690v1,2024-02

However, they require considerable computational resources for training and deployment. This study aims to bridge the performance gap between traditional-scale LVLMs and resource-friendly lite versions by adopting high-quality training data. To this end, we propose a comprehensive pipeline for generating a synthetic dataset. The key idea is to leverage strong proprietary models to generate (i) fine-grained image annotations for vision-language alignment and (ii) complex reasoning visual question-answering pairs for visual instruction fine-tuning, yielding 1.3M samples in total. We train a series of lite VLMs on the synthetic dataset and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, where they achieve competitive performance on 17 benchmarks among 4B LVLMs, and even perform on par with 7B/13B-scale models on various benchmarks.

One Prompt To Rule Them All: LLMs for Opinion Summary Evaluation,"Tejpalsingh Siledar, Swaroop Nath, Sankara Sri Raghava Ravindra Muddu, Rupasai Rangaraju, Swaprava Nath, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Suman Banerjee, Amey Patil, Sudhanshu Shekhar Singh, Muthusamy Chelliah, Nikesh Garera","Evaluation of opinion summaries using conventional reference-based metrics rarely provides a holistic evaluation and has been shown to have a relatively low correlation with human judgments. Recent studies suggest using Large Language Models (LLMs) as reference-free metrics for NLG evaluation, however, they remain unexplored for opinion summary evaluation. Moreover, limited opinion summary evaluation datasets inhibit progress. To address this, we release the SUMMEVAL-OP dataset covering 7 dimensions related to the evaluation of opinion summaries: fluency, coherence, relevance, faithfulness, aspect coverage, sentiment consistency, and specificity. We investigate Op-I-Prompt a dimension-independent prompt, and Op-Prompts, a dimension-dependent set of prompts for opinion summary evaluation. Experiments indicate that Op-I-Prompt emerges as a good alternative for evaluating opinion summaries achieving an average Spearman correlation of 0.70 with humans, outperforming all previous approaches.

Opening the black box of language acquisition,"Jérôme Michaud, Anna Jon-and","Recent advances in large language models using deep learning techniques have renewed interest on how languages can be learned from data. However, it is unclear whether or how these models represent grammatical information from the learned languages. In addition, the models must be pre-trained on large corpora before they can be used. In this work, we propose an alternative, more transparent and cognitively plausible architecture for learning language. Instead of using deep learning, our approach uses a minimal cognitive architecture based on sequence memory and chunking. The learning mechanism is based on the principles of reinforcement learning. We test our architecture on a number of natural-like toy languages. Results show that the model can learn these artificial languages from scratch and extract grammatical information that supports learning. Our study demonstrates the power of this simple architecture and stresses the importance of sequence memory as a key component of the language learning process. Since other animals do not seem to have a faithful sequence memory, this may explain why only humans have developed complex languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11681v1,2024-02
A Multi-Aspect Framework for Counter Narrative Evaluation using Large Language Models,"Jaylen Jones, Lingbo Mo, Eric Fosler-Lussier, Huan Sun","Counter narratives - informed responses to hate speech contexts designed to refute hateful claims and de-escalate encounters - have emerged as an effective hate speech intervention strategy. While previous work has proposed automatic counter narrative generation methods to aid manual interventions, the evaluation of these approaches remains underdeveloped. Previous automatic metrics for counter narrative evaluation lack alignment with human judgment as they rely on superficial reference comparisons instead of incorporating key aspects of counter narrative quality as evaluation criteria. To address prior evaluation limitations, we propose a novel evaluation framework prompting LLMs to provide scores and feedback for generated counter narrative candidates using 5 defined aspects derived from guidelines from counter narrative specialized NGOs. We found that LLM evaluators achieve strong alignment to human-annotated scores and feedback and outperform alternative metrics, indicating their potential as multi-aspect, reference-free and interpretable evaluators for counter narrative evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11676v2,2024-02
Autocorrect for Estonian texts: final report from project EKTB25,"Agnes Luhtaru, Martin Vainikko, Krista Liin, Kais Allkivi-Metsoja, Jaagup Kippar, Pille Eslon, Mark Fishel","The project was funded in 2021-2023 by the National Programme of Estonian Language Technology. Its main aim was to develop spelling and grammar correction tools for the Estonian language. The main challenge was the very small amount of available error correction data needed for such development. To mitigate this, (1) we annotated more correction data for model training and testing, (2) we tested transfer-learning, i.e. retraining machine learning models created for other tasks, so as not to depend solely on correction data, (3) we compared the developed method and model with alternatives, including large language models. We also developed automatic evaluation, which can calculate the accuracy and yield of corrections by error category, so that the effectiveness of different methods can be compared in detail.   There has been a breakthrough in large language models during the project: GPT4, a commercial language model with Estonian-language support, has been created. We took into account the existence of the model when adjusting plans and in the report we present a comparison with the ability of GPT4 to improve the Estonian language text.   The final results show that the approach we have developed provides better scores than GPT4 and the result is usable but not entirely reliable yet. The report also contains ideas on how GPT4 and other major language models can be implemented in the future, focusing on open-source solutions.

Integrating Pre-Trained Language Model with Physical Layer Communications,"Ju-Hyung Lee, Dong-Ho Lee, Joohan Lee, Jay Pujara","The burgeoning field of on-device AI communication, where devices exchange information directly through embedded foundation models, such as language models (LMs), requires robust, efficient, and generalizable communication frameworks. However, integrating these frameworks with existing wireless systems and effectively managing noise and bit errors pose significant challenges. In this work, we introduce a practical ondevice AI communication framework, integrated with physical layer (PHY) communication functions, demonstrated through its performance on a link-level simulator. Our framework incorporates end-to-end training with channel noise to enhance resilience, incorporates vector quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE) for efficient and robust communication, and utilizes pre-trained encoder-decoder transformers for improved generalization capabilities.

Competition of Mechanisms: Tracing How Language Models Handle Facts and Counterfactuals,"Francesco Ortu, Zhijing Jin, Diego Doimo, Mrinmaya Sachan, Alberto Cazzaniga, Bernhard Schölkopf","Interpretability research aims to bridge the gap between empirical success and our scientific understanding of the inner workings of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing research focuses on analyzing a single mechanism, such as how models copy or recall factual knowledge. In this work, we propose a formulation of competition of mechanisms, which focuses on the interplay of multiple mechanisms instead of individual mechanisms and traces how one of them becomes dominant in the final prediction. We uncover how and where mechanisms compete within LLMs using two interpretability methods: logit inspection and attention modification. Our findings show traces of the mechanisms and their competition across various model components and reveal attention positions that effectively control the strength of certain mechanisms.

Learning From Failure: Integrating Negative Examples when Fine-tuning Large Language Models as Agents,"Renxi Wang, Haonan Li, Xudong Han, Yixuan Zhang, Timothy Baldwin","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved success in acting as agents, which interact with environments through tools such as search engines. However, LLMs are optimized for language generation instead of tool use during training or alignment, limiting their effectiveness as agents. To resolve this problem, previous work has first collected interaction trajectories between LLMs and environments, using only trajectories that successfully finished the task to fine-tune smaller models, making fine-tuning data scarce and acquiring it both difficult and costly. Discarding failed trajectories also leads to significant wastage of data and resources and limits the possible optimization paths during fine-tuning. In this paper, we argue that unsuccessful trajectories offer valuable insights, and LLMs can learn from these trajectories through appropriate quality control and fine-tuning strategies. By simply adding a prefix or suffix that tells the model whether to generate a successful trajectory during training, we improve model performance by a large margin on mathematical reasoning, multi-hop question answering, and strategic question answering tasks. We further analyze the inference results and find that our method provides a better trade-off between valuable information and errors in unsuccessful trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate the value of negative trajectories and their application in agent-tunning scenarios. Our findings offer guidance for developing better agent-tuning methods and low-resource data usage techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11651v2,2024-02
Stealthy Attack on Large Language Model based Recommendation,"Jinghao Zhang, Yuting Liu, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Guibing Guo, Liang Wang","Recently, the powerful large language models (LLMs) have been instrumental in propelling the progress of recommender systems (RS). However, while these systems have flourished, their susceptibility to security threats has been largely overlooked. In this work, we reveal that the introduction of LLMs into recommendation models presents new security vulnerabilities due to their emphasis on the textual content of items. We demonstrate that attackers can significantly boost an item's exposure by merely altering its textual content during the testing phase, without requiring direct interference with the model's training process. Additionally, the attack is notably stealthy, as it does not affect the overall recommendation performance and the modifications to the text are subtle, making it difficult for users and platforms to detect. Our comprehensive experiments across four mainstream LLM-based recommendation models demonstrate the superior efficacy and stealthiness of our approach. Our work unveils a significant security gap in LLM-based recommendation systems and paves the way for future research on protecting these systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14836v2,2024-02
In-Context Learning with Transformers: Softmax Attention Adapts to Function Lipschitzness,"Liam Collins, Advait Parulekar, Aryan Mokhtari, Sujay Sanghavi, Sanjay Shakkottai","A striking property of transformers is their ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), a machine learning framework in which the learner is presented with a novel context during inference implicitly through some data, and tasked with making a prediction in that context. As such, that learner must adapt to the context without additional training. We explore the role of softmax attention in an ICL setting where each context encodes a regression task. We show that an attention unit learns a window that it uses to implement a nearest-neighbors predictor adapted to the landscape of the pretraining tasks. Specifically, we show that this window widens with decreasing Lipschitzness and increasing label noise in the pretraining tasks. We also show that on low-rank, linear problems, the attention unit learns to project onto the appropriate subspace before inference. Further, we show that this adaptivity relies crucially on the softmax activation and thus cannot be replicated by the linear activation often studied in prior theoretical analyses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11639v2,2024-02

The goal of our study is to stress test the detectors' robustness to malicious attacks under realistic scenarios. We comprehensively study the robustness of popular machine-generated text detectors under attacks from diverse categories: editing, paraphrasing, prompting, and co-generating. Our attacks assume limited access to the generator LLMs, and we compare the performance of detectors on different attacks under different budget levels. Our experiments reveal that almost none of the existing detectors remain robust under all the attacks, and all detectors exhibit different loopholes. Averaging all detectors, the performance drops by 35% across all attacks. Further, we investigate the reasons behind these defects and propose initial out-of-the-box patches to improve robustness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11638v1,2024-02
Self-seeding and Multi-intent Self-instructing LLMs for Generating Intent-aware Information-Seeking dialogs,"Arian Askari, Roxana Petcu, Chuan Meng, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Amin Abolghasemi, Evangelos Kanoulas, Suzan Verberne","Identifying user intents in information-seeking dialogs is crucial for a system to meet user's information needs. Intent prediction (IP) is challenging and demands sufficient dialogs with human-labeled intents for training. However, manually annotating intents is resource-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective in generating synthetic data, there is no study on using LLMs to generate intent-aware information-seeking dialogs. In this paper, we focus on leveraging LLMs for zero-shot generation of large-scale, open-domain, and intent-aware information-seeking dialogs. We propose SOLID, which has novel self-seeding and multi-intent self-instructing schemes. The former improves the generation quality by using the LLM's own knowledge scope to initiate dialog generation; the latter prompts the LLM to generate utterances sequentially, and mitigates the need for manual prompt design by asking the LLM to autonomously adapt its prompt instruction when generating complex multi-intent utterances. Furthermore, we propose SOLID-RL, which is further trained to generate a dialog in one step on the data generated by SOLID. We propose a length-based quality estimation mechanism to assign varying weights to SOLID-generated dialogs based on their quality during the training process of SOLID-RL. We use SOLID and SOLID-RL to generate more than 300k intent-aware dialogs, surpassing the size of existing datasets. Experiments show that IP methods trained on dialogs generated by SOLID and SOLID-RL achieve better IP quality than ones trained on human-generated dialogs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11633v1,2024-02
Discrete Neural Algorithmic Reasoning,"Gleb Rodionov, Liudmila Prokhorenkova","Neural algorithmic reasoning aims to capture computations with neural networks via learning the models to imitate the execution of classic algorithms. While common architectures are expressive enough to contain the correct model in the weights space, current neural reasoners are struggling to generalize well on out-of-distribution data. On the other hand, classic computations are not affected by distributional shifts as they can be described as transitions between discrete computational states. In this work, we propose to force neural reasoners to maintain the execution trajectory as a combination of finite predefined states. To achieve that, we separate discrete and continuous data flows and describe the interaction between them. Trained with supervision on the algorithm's state transitions, such models are able to perfectly align with the original algorithm. To show this, we evaluate our approach on multiple algorithmic problems and get perfect test scores both in single-task and multitask setups. Moreover, the proposed architectural choice allows us to prove the correctness of the learned algorithms for any test~data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11628v2,2024-02
Metacognitive Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models,"Yujia Zhou, Zheng Liu, Jiajie Jin, Jian-Yun Nie, Zhicheng Dou","Retrieval-augmented generation have become central in natural language processing due to their efficacy in generating factual content. While traditional methods employ single-time retrieval, more recent approaches have shifted towards multi-time retrieval for multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, these strategies are bound by predefined reasoning steps, potentially leading to inaccuracies in response generation. This paper introduces MetaRAG, an approach that combines the retrieval-augmented generation process with metacognition. Drawing from cognitive psychology, metacognition allows an entity to self-reflect and critically evaluate its cognitive processes. By integrating this, MetaRAG enables the model to monitor, evaluate, and plan its response strategies, enhancing its introspective reasoning abilities. Through a three-step metacognitive regulation pipeline, the model can identify inadequacies in initial cognitive responses and fixes them. Empirical evaluations show that MetaRAG significantly outperforms existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11626v1,2024-02
SpeCrawler: Generating OpenAPI Specifications from API Documentation Using Large Language Models,"Koren Lazar, Matan Vetzler, Guy Uziel, David Boaz, Esther Goldbraich, David Amid, Ateret Anaby-Tavor","In the digital era, the widespread use of APIs is evident.

Logical Closed Loop: Uncovering Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models,"Junfei Wu, Qiang Liu, Ding Wang, Jinghao Zhang, Shu Wu, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan","Object hallucination has been an Achilles' heel which hinders the broader applications of large vision-language models (LVLMs). Object hallucination refers to the phenomenon that the LVLMs claim non-existent objects in the image. To mitigate the object hallucinations, instruction tuning and external model-based detection methods have been proposed, which either require large-scare computational resources or depend on the detection result of external models. However, there remains an under-explored field to utilize the LVLM itself to alleviate object hallucinations. In this work, we adopt the intuition that the LVLM tends to respond logically consistently for existent objects but inconsistently for hallucinated objects. Therefore, we propose a Logical Closed Loop-based framework for Object Hallucination Detection and Mitigation, namely LogicCheckGPT. In specific, we devise logical consistency probing to raise questions with logical correlations, inquiring about attributes from objects and vice versa. Whether their responses can form a logical closed loop serves as an indicator of object hallucination. As a plug-and-play method, it can be seamlessly applied to all existing LVLMs. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks across four LVLMs have demonstrated significant improvements brought by our method, indicating its effectiveness and generality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11622v2,2024-02
Decoding News Narratives: A Critical Analysis of Large Language Models in Framing Detection,"Valeria Pastorino, Jasivan A. Sivakumar, Nafise Sadat Moosavi","Previous studies on framing have relied on manual analysis or fine-tuning models with limited annotated datasets. However, pre-trained models, with their diverse training backgrounds, offer a promising alternative. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and FLAN-T5 models in detecting framing in news headlines. We evaluated these models in various scenarios: zero-shot, few-shot with in-domain examples, cross-domain examples, and settings where models explain their predictions. Our results show that explainable predictions lead to more reliable outcomes. GPT-4 performed exceptionally well in few-shot settings but often misinterpreted emotional language as framing, highlighting a significant challenge. Additionally, the results suggest that consistent predictions across multiple models could help identify potential annotation inaccuracies in datasets. Finally, we propose a new small dataset for real-world evaluation on headlines from a diverse set of topics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11621v3,2024-02
Metric-Learning Encoding Models Identify Processing Profiles of Linguistic Features in BERT's Representations,"Louis Jalouzot, Robin Sobczyk, Bastien Lhopitallier, Jeanne Salle, Nur Lan, Emmanuel Chemla, Yair Lakretz","We introduce Metric-Learning Encoding Models (MLEMs) as a new approach to understand how neural systems represent the theoretical features of the objects they process. As a proof-of-concept, we apply MLEMs to neural representations extracted from BERT, and track a wide variety of linguistic features (e.g., tense, subject person, clause type, clause embedding). We find that: (1) linguistic features are ordered: they separate representations of sentences to different degrees in different layers; (2) neural representations are organized hierarchically: in some layers, we find clusters of representations nested within larger clusters, following successively important linguistic features; (3) linguistic features are disentangled in middle layers: distinct, selective units are activated by distinct linguistic features. Methodologically, MLEMs are superior (4) to multivariate decoding methods, being more robust to type-I errors, and (5) to univariate encoding methods, in being able to predict both local and distributed representations. Together, this demonstrates the utility of Metric-Learning Encoding Methods for studying how linguistic features are neurally encoded in language models and the advantage of MLEMs over traditional methods. MLEMs can be extended to other domains (e.g. vision) and to other neural systems, such as the human brain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11608v1,2024-02
Multi-Task Inference: Can Large Language Models Follow Multiple Instructions at Once?,"Guijin Son, Sangwon Baek, Sangdae Nam, Ilgyun Jeong, Seungone Kim","Large language models (LLMs) are typically prompted to follow a single instruction per inference call. In this work, we analyze whether LLMs also hold the capability to handle multiple instructions simultaneously, denoted as Multi-Task Inference. For this purpose, we introduce the MTI Bench(Multi-Task Inference Benchmark), a comprehensive evaluation benchmark encompassing 5,000 instances across 25 tasks. Each task in the MTI Bench involves 2 to 3 sub-tasks. As expected, we first demonstrate that Multi-Task Inference reduces the total inference time by 1.46 times in average since it does not require multiple inference calls. Interestingly, contrary to the expectation that LLMs would perform better when tasks are divided, we find that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama-2-Chat-70B and GPT-4, show up to 7.3% and 12.4% improved performance with Multi-Task Inference compared to Single-Task Inference on the MTI Bench. We release the MTI Bench dataset and our code at this link https://github.com/guijinSON/MTI-Bench.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11597v2,2024-02
Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning: A Benchmark,"Yihua Zhang, Pingzhi Li, Junyuan Hong, Jiaxiang Li, Yimeng Zhang, Wenqing Zheng, Pin-Yu Chen, Jason D. Lee, Wotao Yin, Mingyi Hong, Zhangyang Wang, Sijia Liu, Tianlong Chen","In the evolving landscape of natural language processing (NLP), fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with first-order (FO) optimizers like SGD and Adam has become standard. Yet, as LLMs grow {in size}, the substantial memory overhead from back-propagation (BP) for FO gradient computation presents a significant challenge. Addressing this issue is crucial, especially for applications like on-device training where memory efficiency is paramount. This paper proposes a shift towards BP-free, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization as a solution for reducing memory costs during LLM fine-tuning, building on the initial concept introduced by MeZO. Unlike traditional ZO-SGD methods, our work expands the exploration to a wider array of ZO optimization techniques, through a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind benchmarking study across five LLM families (Roberta, OPT, LLaMA, Vicuna, Mistral), three task complexities, and five fine-tuning schemes. Our study unveils previously overlooked optimization principles, highlighting the importance of task alignment, the role of the forward gradient method, and the balance between algorithm complexity and fine-tuning performance. We further introduce novel enhancements to ZO optimization, including block-wise descent, hybrid training, and gradient sparsity. Our study offers a promising direction for achieving further memory-efficient LLM fine-tuning.

Extensible Embedding: A Flexible Multipler For LLM's Context Length,"Ninglu Shao, Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) call for extension of context to handle many critical applications. However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component.

BESA: Pruning Large Language Models with Blockwise Parameter-Efficient Sparsity Allocation,"Peng Xu, Wenqi Shao, Mengzhao Chen, Shitao Tang, Kaipeng Zhang, Peng Gao, Fengwei An, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various tasks, such as text summarization, text question-answering, and etc. While their performance is impressive, the computational footprint due to their vast number of parameters can be prohibitive. Existing solutions such as SparseGPT and Wanda attempt to alleviate this issue through weight pruning. However, their layer-wise approach results in significant perturbation to the model's output and requires meticulous hyperparameter tuning, such as the pruning rate, which can adversely affect overall model performance. To address this, this paper introduces a novel LLM pruning technique dubbed blockwise parameter-efficient sparsity allocation (BESA) by applying a blockwise reconstruction loss. In contrast to the typical layer-wise pruning techniques, BESA is characterized by two distinctive attributes: i) it targets the overall pruning error with respect to individual transformer blocks, and ii) it allocates layer-specific sparsity in a differentiable manner, both of which ensure reduced performance degradation after pruning. Our experiments show that BESA achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently pruning LLMs like LLaMA1, and LLaMA2 with 7B to 70B parameters on a single A100 GPU in just five hours.

Visual In-Context Learning for Large Vision-Language Models,"Yucheng Zhou, Xiang Li, Qianning Wang, Jianbing Shen","In Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), the efficacy of In-Context Learning (ICL) remains limited by challenges in cross-modal interactions and representation disparities. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) method comprising Visual Demonstration Retrieval, Intent-Oriented Image Summarization, and Intent-Oriented Demonstration Composition. Our approach retrieves images via ''Retrieval & Rerank'' paradigm, summarises images with task intent and task-specific visual parsing, and composes language-based demonstrations that reduce token count and alleviate cross-modal interaction problem. Experimental evaluations on five visual reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, our extensive experiments leverage information flow analysis to elucidate the effectiveness of our method, and investigate the impact of length and position of demonstrations for LVLM.

Cobra Effect in Reference-Free Image Captioning Metrics,"Zheng Ma, Changxin Wang, Yawen Ouyang, Fei Zhao, Jianbing Zhang, Shujian Huang, Jiajun Chen","Evaluating the compatibility between textual descriptions and corresponding images represents a core endeavor within multi-modal research. In recent years, a proliferation of reference-free methods, leveraging visual-language pre-trained models (VLMs), has emerged. Empirical evidence has substantiated that these innovative approaches exhibit a higher correlation with human judgment, marking a significant advancement in the field. However, does a higher correlation with human evaluations alone sufficiently denote the complete of a metric? In response to this question, in this paper, we study if there are any deficiencies in reference-free metrics. Specifically, inspired by the Cobra Effect, we utilize metric scores as rewards to direct the captioning model toward generating descriptions that closely align with the metric's criteria. If a certain metric has flaws, it will be exploited by the model and reflected in the generated sentences. Our findings reveal that descriptions guided by these metrics contain significant flaws, e.g. incoherent statements and excessive repetition. Subsequently, we propose a novel method termed Self-Improving to rectify the identified shortcomings within these metrics. We employ GPT-4V as an evaluative tool to assess generated sentences and the result reveals that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. In addition, we also introduce a challenging evaluation benchmark called Flaws Caption to evaluate reference-free image captioning metrics comprehensively.

Ain't Misbehavin' -- Using LLMs to Generate Expressive Robot Behavior in Conversations with the Tabletop Robot Haru,"Zining Wang, Paul Reisert, Eric Nichols, Randy Gomez","Social robots aim to establish long-term bonds with humans through engaging conversation. However, traditional conversational approaches, reliant on scripted interactions, often fall short in maintaining engaging conversations. This paper addresses this limitation by integrating large language models (LLMs) into social robots to achieve more dynamic and expressive conversations. We introduce a fully-automated conversation system that leverages LLMs to generate robot responses with expressive behaviors, congruent with the robot's personality. We incorporate robot behavior with two modalities: 1) a text-to-speech (TTS) engine capable of various delivery styles, and 2) a library of physical actions for the robot. We develop a custom, state-of-the-art emotion recognition model to dynamically select the robot's tone of voice and utilize emojis from LLM output as cues for generating robot actions. A demo of our system is available here. To illuminate design and implementation issues, we conduct a pilot study where volunteers chat with a social robot using our proposed system, and we analyze their feedback, conducting a rigorous error analysis of chat transcripts. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with participants commenting on the robot's empathy, helpfulness, naturalness, and entertainment. Most negative feedback was due to automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors which had limited impact on conversations. However, we observed a small class of errors, such as the LLM repeating itself or hallucinating fictitious information and human responses, that have the potential to derail conversations, raising important issues for LLM application.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11571v1,2024-02
Developing Autonomous Robot-Mediated Behavior Coaching Sessions with Haru,"Matouš Jelínek, Eric Nichols, Randy Gomez","This study presents an empirical investigation into the design and impact of autonomous dialogues in human-robot interaction for behavior change coaching. We focus on the use of Haru, a tabletop social robot, and explore the implementation of the Tiny Habits method for fostering positive behavior change. The core of our study lies in developing a fully autonomous dialogue system that maximizes Haru's emotional expressiveness and unique personality. Our methodology involved iterative design and extensive testing of the dialogue system, ensuring it effectively embodied the principles of the Tiny Habits method while also incorporating strategies for trust-raising and trust-dampening. The effectiveness of the final version of the dialogue was evaluated in an experimental study with human participants (N=12). The results indicated a significant improvement in perceptions of Haru's liveliness, interactivity, and neutrality.

LongAgent: Scaling Language Models to 128k Context through Multi-Agent Collaboration,"Jun Zhao, Can Zu, Hao Xu, Yi Lu, Wei He, Yiwen Ding, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in understanding language and executing complex reasoning tasks. However, LLMs with long context windows have been notorious for their expensive training costs and high inference latency. Even the most advanced models such as GPT-4 and Claude2 often make mistakes when processing inputs of over $100k$ tokens, a phenomenon also known as \textit{lost in the middle}. In this paper, we propose \textsc{LongAgent}, a method based on multi-agent collaboration, which scales LLMs (e.g., LLaMA) to a context of 128K and demonstrates potential superiority in long-text processing compared to GPT-4. In \textsc{LongAgent}, a leader is responsible for understanding user intent and directing team members to acquire information from documents. Due to members' hallucinations, it is non-trivial for a leader to obtain accurate information from the responses of dozens to hundreds of members. To address this, we develop an \textit{inter-member communication} mechanism to resolve response conflicts caused by hallucinations through information sharing. Our experimental results indicate that \textsc{LongAgent} offers a promising alternative for long-text processing. The agent team instantiated with LLaMA-7B achieves significant improvements in tasks such as 128k-long text retrieval, multi-hop question answering, compared to GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11550v2,2024-02
"Syntactic Language Change in English and German: Metrics, Parsers, and Convergences","Yanran Chen, Wei Zhao, Anne Breitbarth, Manuel Stoeckel, Alexander Mehler, Steffen Eger","Many studies have shown that human languages tend to optimize for lower complexity and increased communication efficiency. Syntactic dependency distance, which measures the linear distance between dependent words, is often considered a key indicator of language processing difficulty and working memory load. The current paper looks at diachronic trends in syntactic language change in both English and German, using corpora of parliamentary debates from the last c. 160 years. We base our observations on five dependency parsers, including the widely used Stanford CoreNLP as well as 4 newer alternatives. Our analysis of syntactic language change goes beyond linear dependency distance and explores 15 metrics relevant to dependency distance minimization (DDM) and/or based on tree graph properties, such as the tree height and degree variance. Even though we have evidence that recent parsers trained on modern treebanks are not heavily affected by data 'noise' such as spelling changes and OCR errors in our historic data, we find that results of syntactic language change are sensitive to the parsers involved, which is a caution against using a single parser for evaluating syntactic language change as done in previous work. We also show that syntactic language change over the time period investigated is largely similar between English and German for the different metrics explored: only 4% of cases we examine yield opposite conclusions regarding upwards and downtrends of syntactic metrics across German and English. We also show that changes in syntactic measures seem to be more frequent at the tails of sentence length distributions. To our best knowledge, ours is the most comprehensive analysis of syntactic language change using modern NLP technology in recent corpora of English and German.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11549v2,2024-02
KMMLU: Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding in Korean,"Guijin Son, Hanwool Lee, Sungdong Kim, Seungone Kim, Niklas Muennighoff, Taekyoon Choi, Cheonbok Park, Kang Min Yoo, Stella Biderman","We propose KMMLU, a new Korean benchmark with 35,030 expert-level multiple-choice questions across 45 subjects ranging from humanities to STEM. While prior Korean benchmarks are translated from existing English benchmarks, KMMLU is collected from original Korean exams, capturing linguistic and cultural aspects of the Korean language. We test 27 public and proprietary LLMs and observe the best public model to score 50.5%, leaving significant room for improvement. This model was primarily trained for English and Chinese, not Korean. Current LLMs tailored to Korean, such as Polyglot-Ko, perform far worse. Surprisingly, even the most capable proprietary LLMs, e.g., GPT-4 and HyperCLOVA X do not exceed 60%. This suggests that further work is needed to improve LLMs for Korean, and we believe KMMLU offers the appropriate tool to track this progress. We make our dataset publicly available on the Hugging Face Hub and integrate the benchmark into EleutherAI's Language Model Evaluation Harness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11548v2,2024-02

Question Answering Over Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph,"Xinbang Dai, Huiying Li, Guilin Qi","Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) extend the concept of knowledge graphs (KGs) by incorporating time and location information. While the research community's focus on Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA), the field of answering questions incorporating both spatio-temporal information based on STKGs remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, a lack of comprehensive datasets also has hindered progress in this area. To address this issue, we present STQAD, a dataset comprising 10,000 natural language questions for spatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA). Unfortunately, various state-of-the-art KGQA approaches fall far short of achieving satisfactory performance on our dataset. In response, we propose STCQA, a new spatio-temporal KGQA approach that utilizes a novel STKG embedding method named STComplEx. By extracting temporal and spatial information from a question, our QA model can better comprehend the question and retrieve accurate answers from the STKG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the quality of our dataset and the effectiveness of our STKGQA method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11542v1,2024-02
Large Language Models Can Better Understand Knowledge Graphs Than We Thought,"Xinbang Dai, Yuncheng Hua, Tongtong Wu, Yang Sheng, Qiu Ji, Guilin Qi","As the parameter scale of large language models (LLMs) grows, jointly training knowledge graph (KG) embeddings with model parameters to enhance LLM capabilities becomes increasingly costly. Consequently, the community has shown interest in developing prompt strategies that effectively integrate KG information into LLMs. However, the format for incorporating KGs into LLMs lacks standardization; for instance, KGs can be transformed into linearized triples or natural language (NL) text. Current prompting methods often rely on a trial-and-error approach, leaving researchers with an incomplete understanding of which KG input format best facilitates LLM comprehension of KG content. To elucidate this, we design a series of experiments to explore LLMs' understanding of different KG input formats within the context of prompt engineering. Our analysis examines both literal and attention distribution levels. Through extensive experiments, we indicate a counter-intuitive phenomenon: when addressing fact-related questions, unordered linearized triples are more effective for LLMs' understanding of KGs compared to fluent NL text. Furthermore, noisy, incomplete, or marginally relevant subgraphs can still enhance LLM performance. Finally, different LLMs have distinct preferences for different formats of organizing unordered triples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11541v3,2024-02
Deciphering the Impact of Pretraining Data on Large Language Models through Machine Unlearning,"Yang Zhao, Li Du, Xiao Ding, Kai Xiong, Zhouhao Sun, Jun Shi, Ting Liu, Bing Qin","Through pretraining on a corpus with various sources, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained impressive performance. However, the impact of each component of the pretraining corpus remains opaque. As a result, the organization of the pretraining corpus is still empirical and may deviate from the optimal. To address this issue, we systematically analyze the impact of 48 datasets from 5 major categories of pretraining data of LLMs and measure their impacts on LLMs using benchmarks about nine major categories of model capabilities. Our analyses provide empirical results about the contribution of multiple corpora on the performances of LLMs, along with their joint impact patterns, including complementary, orthogonal, and correlational relationships. We also identify a set of ``high-impact data'' such as Books that is significantly related to a set of model capabilities.

Ploutos: Towards interpretable stock movement prediction with financial large language model,"Hanshuang Tong, Jun Li, Ning Wu, Ming Gong, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new pathways for many domains. However, the full potential of LLMs in financial investments remains largely untapped. There are two main challenges for typical deep learning-based methods for quantitative finance. First, they struggle to fuse textual and numerical information flexibly for stock movement prediction. Second, traditional methods lack clarity and interpretability, which impedes their application in scenarios where the justification for predictions is essential. To solve the above challenges, we propose Ploutos, a novel financial LLM framework that consists of PloutosGen and PloutosGPT. The PloutosGen contains multiple primary experts that can analyze different modal data, such as text and numbers, and provide quantitative strategies from different perspectives. Then PloutosGPT combines their insights and predictions and generates interpretable rationales. To generate accurate and faithful rationales, the training strategy of PloutosGPT leverage rearview-mirror prompting mechanism to guide GPT-4 to generate rationales, and a dynamic token weighting mechanism to finetune LLM by increasing key tokens weight.

Chain-of-Instructions: Compositional Instruction Tuning on Large Language Models,"Shirley Anugrah Hayati, Taehee Jung, Tristan Bodding-Long, Sudipta Kar, Abhinav Sethy, Joo-Kyung Kim, Dongyeop Kang","Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with a collection of large and diverse instructions has improved the model's generalization to different tasks, even for unseen tasks. However, most existing instruction datasets include only single instructions, and they struggle to follow complex instructions composed of multiple subtasks. In this work, we propose a novel concept of compositional instructions called chain-of-instructions (CoI), where the output of one instruction becomes an input for the next like a chain. Unlike the conventional practice of solving single instruction tasks, our proposed method encourages a model to solve each subtask step by step until the final answer is reached. CoI-tuning (i.e., fine-tuning with CoI instructions) improves the model's ability to handle instructions composed of multiple subtasks as well as unseen composite tasks such as multilingual summarization. Overall, our study find that simple CoI tuning of existing instruction data can provide consistent generalization to solve more complex, unseen, and longer chains of instructions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11532v3,2024-02
Advancing Translation Preference Modeling with RLHF: A Step Towards Cost-Effective Solution,"Nuo Xu, Jun Zhao, Can Zu, Sixian Li, Lu Chen, Zhihao Zhang, Rui Zheng, Shihan Dou, Wenjuan Qin, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","Faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance is the constant pursuit in machine translation. However, traditional metrics like \textit{BLEU} do not strictly align with human preference of translation quality. In this paper, we explore leveraging reinforcement learning with human feedback (\textit{RLHF}) to improve translation quality. It is non-trivial to collect a large high-quality dataset of human comparisons between translations, especially for low-resource languages. To address this issue, we propose a cost-effective preference learning strategy, optimizing reward models by distinguishing between human and machine translations. In this manner, the reward model learns the deficiencies of machine translation compared to human and guides subsequent improvements in machine translation. Experimental results demonstrate that \textit{RLHF} can effectively enhance translation quality and this improvement benefits other translation directions not trained with \textit{RLHF}. Further analysis indicates that the model's language capabilities play a crucial role in preference learning. A reward model with strong language capabilities can more sensitively learn the subtle differences in translation quality and align better with real human translation preferences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11525v3,2024-02
Unveiling the Secrets of Engaging Conversations: Factors that Keep Users Hooked on Role-Playing Dialog Agents,"Shuai Zhang, Yu Lu, Junwen Liu, Jia Yu, Huachuan Qiu, Yuming Yan, Zhenzhong Lan","With the growing humanlike nature of dialog agents, people are now engaging in extended conversations that can stretch from brief moments to substantial periods of time. Understanding the factors that contribute to sustaining these interactions is crucial, yet existing studies primarily focusing on short-term simulations that rarely explore such prolonged and real conversations.   In this paper, we investigate the factors influencing retention rates in real interactions with roleplaying models. By analyzing a large dataset of interactions between real users and thousands of characters, we systematically examine multiple factors and assess their impact on user retention rate. Surprisingly, we find that the degree to which the bot embodies the roles it plays has limited influence on retention rates, while the length of each turn it speaks significantly affects retention rates. This study sheds light on the critical aspects of user engagement with role-playing models and provides valuable insights for future improvements in the development of large language models for role-playing purposes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11522v2,2024-02
Large Language Model-driven Meta-structure Discovery in Heterogeneous Information Network,"Lin Chen, Fengli Xu, Nian Li, Zhenyu Han, Meng Wang, Yong Li, Pan Hui","Heterogeneous information networks (HIN) have gained increasing popularity in recent years for capturing complex relations between diverse types of nodes. Meta-structures are proposed as a useful tool to identify the important patterns in HINs, but hand-crafted meta-structures pose significant challenges for scaling up, drawing wide research attention towards developing automatic search algorithms. Previous efforts primarily focused on searching for meta-structures with good empirical performance, overlooking the importance of human comprehensibility and generalizability. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from the emergent reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). We propose ReStruct, a meta-structure search framework that integrates LLM reasoning into the evolutionary procedure. ReStruct uses a grammar translator to encode the meta-structures into natural language sentences, and leverages the reasoning power of LLMs to evaluate their semantic feasibility. Besides, ReStruct also employs performance-oriented evolutionary operations. These two competing forces allow ReStruct to jointly optimize the semantic explainability and empirical performance of meta-structures. Furthermore, ReStruct contains a differential LLM explainer to generate and refine natural language explanations for the discovered meta-structures by reasoning through the search history. Experiments on eight representative HIN datasets demonstrate that ReStruct achieves state-of-the-art performance in both recommendation and node classification tasks. Moreover, a survey study involving 73 graduate students shows that the discovered meta-structures and generated explanations by ReStruct are substantially more comprehensible.

Knowledge-to-SQL: Enhancing SQL Generation with Data Expert LLM,"Zijin Hong, Zheng Yuan, Hao Chen, Qinggang Zhang, Feiran Huang, Xiao Huang","Generating accurate SQL queries for user questions (text-to-SQL) has been a long-standing challenge since it requires a deep understanding of both the user's question and the corresponding database schema in order to retrieve the desired content accurately. Existing methods rely on the comprehensive capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate the SQL. However, some necessary knowledge is not explicitly included in the database schema and user question or has been learned by LLMs. Thus, the generated SQL of the knowledge-insufficient questions may be inaccurate, negatively influencing the text-to-SQL models' performance and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge-to-SQL framework, which employs tailored Data Expert LLM (DELLM) to provide helpful knowledge for all text-to-SQL models. Specifically, we introduce the detailed implementation of DELLM regarding table reading and the basic fine-tuning process. We further propose a Preference Learning via Database Feedback (PLDBF) strategy, refining the DELLM to generate more helpful knowledge for LLMs. Extensive experiments verify that DELLM can enhance the state-of-the-art approaches for text-to-SQL tasks. The corresponding code of DELLM is released for further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11517v3,2024-02
From Prejudice to Parity: A New Approach to Debiasing Large Language Model Word Embeddings,"Aishik Rakshit, Smriti Singh, Shuvam Keshari, Arijit Ghosh Chowdhury, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha","Embeddings play a pivotal role in the efficacy of Large Language Models. They are the bedrock on which these models grasp contextual relationships and foster a more nuanced understanding of language and consequently perform remarkably on a plethora of complex tasks that require a fundamental understanding of human language. Given that these embeddings themselves often reflect or exhibit bias, it stands to reason that these models may also inadvertently learn this bias. In this work, we build on the seminal previous work and propose DeepSoftDebias, an algorithm that uses a neural network to perform 'soft debiasing'. We exhaustively evaluate this algorithm across a variety of SOTA datasets, accuracy metrics, and challenging NLP tasks. We find that DeepSoftDebias outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods at reducing bias across gender, race, and religion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11512v6,2024-02
Federated Fine-tuning of Large Language Models under Heterogeneous Tasks and Client Resources,"Jiamu Bai, Daoyuan Chen, Bingchen Qian, Liuyi Yao, Yaliang Li","Federated Learning (FL) has recently been applied to the parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). While promising, it raises significant challenges due to the heterogeneous resources and data distributions of clients. This study introduces FlexLoRA, a simple yet effective aggregation scheme for LLM fine-tuning, which mitigates the ``bucket effect'' in traditional FL that restricts the potential of clients with ample resources by tying them to the capabilities of the least-resourced participants. FlexLoRA allows for dynamic adjustment of local LoRA ranks, fostering the development of a global model imbued with broader, less task-specific knowledge. By synthesizing a full-size LoRA weight from individual client contributions and employing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for weight redistribution, FlexLoRA fully leverages heterogeneous client resources. Involving thousands of clients performing heterogeneous NLP tasks and client resources, our experiments validate the efficacy of FlexLoRA, with the federated global model achieving consistently better improvement over SOTA FL methods in downstream NLP task performance across various heterogeneous distributions. FlexLoRA's practicality is further underscored by our theoretical analysis and its seamless integration with existing LoRA-based FL methods, offering a path toward cross-device, privacy-preserving federated tuning for LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11505v2,2024-02
Benchmarking Knowledge Boundary for Large Language Models: A Different Perspective on Model Evaluation,"Xunjian Yin, Xu Zhang, Jie Ruan, Xiaojun Wan","In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the development of large language models, achieving remarkable performance across diverse tasks. To evaluate the knowledge ability of language models, previous studies have proposed lots of benchmarks based on question-answering pairs. We argue that it is not reliable and comprehensive to evaluate language models with a fixed question or limited paraphrases as the query, since language models are sensitive to prompt. Therefore, we introduce a novel concept named knowledge boundary to encompass both prompt-agnostic and prompt-sensitive knowledge within language models. Knowledge boundary avoids prompt sensitivity in language model evaluations, rendering them more dependable and robust. To explore the knowledge boundary for a given model, we propose projected gradient descent method with semantic constraints, a new algorithm designed to identify the optimal prompt for each piece of knowledge. Experiments demonstrate a superior performance of our algorithm in computing the knowledge boundary compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the ability of multiple language models in several domains with knowledge boundary.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11493v2,2024-02
What's the Plan? Evaluating and Developing Planning-Aware Techniques for Language Models,"Eran Hirsch, Guy Uziel, Ateret Anaby-Tavor","Planning is a fundamental task in artificial intelligence that involves finding a sequence of actions that achieve a specified goal in a given environment. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for applications that require planning capabilities, such as web or embodied agents. In line with recent studies, we demonstrate through experimentation that LLMs lack necessary skills required for planning. Based on these observations, we advocate for the potential of a hybrid approach that combines LLMs with classical planning methodology. Then, we introduce SimPlan, a novel hybrid-method, and evaluate its performance in a new challenging setup. Our extensive experiments across various planning domains demonstrate that SimPlan significantly outperforms existing LLM-based planners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11489v2,2024-02
"ChatGPT in Linear Algebra: Strides Forward, Steps to Go","Eli Bagno, Thierry Dana-Picard, Shulamit Reches","As soon as a new technology emerges, the education community explores its affordances and the possibilities to apply it in education. In this paper, we analyze sessions with ChatGPT around topics in basic Linear Algebra. We reflect the process undertaken by the ChatGPT along the recent year in our area of interest, emphasising the vast improvement that has been done in grappling with Linear Algebra problems. In particular, the question whether this software can be a teaching assistant or even somehow replace the human teacher, is addressed. As of the time this paper is written, the answer is generally negative. For the small part where the answer can be positive, some reflections about an original instrumental genesis are given.   Communication with the software gives the impression to talk to a human, and sometimes the question is whether the software understands the question or not. Therefore, the reader's attention is drawn to the fact that ChatGPT works on a statistical basis and not according to reflection and understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15399v1,2024-02
LEIA: Facilitating Cross-lingual Knowledge Transfer in Language Models with Entity-based Data Augmentation,"Ikuya Yamada, Ryokan Ri","Adapting English-based large language models (LLMs) to other languages has become increasingly popular due to the efficiency and potential of cross-lingual transfer. However, existing language adaptation methods often overlook the benefits of cross-lingual supervision. In this study, we introduce LEIA, a language adaptation tuning method that utilizes Wikipedia entity names aligned across languages. This method involves augmenting the target language corpus with English entity names and training the model using left-to-right language modeling.

MIKE: A New Benchmark for Fine-grained Multimodal Entity Knowledge Editing,"Jiaqi Li, Miaozeng Du, Chuanyi Zhang, Yongrui Chen, Nan Hu, Guilin Qi, Haiyun Jiang, Siyuan Cheng, Bozhong Tian","Multimodal knowledge editing represents a critical advancement in enhancing the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite its potential, current benchmarks predominantly focus on coarse-grained knowledge, leaving the intricacies of fine-grained (FG) multimodal entity knowledge largely unexplored. This gap presents a notable challenge, as FG entity recognition is pivotal for the practical deployment and effectiveness of MLLMs in diverse real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIKE, a comprehensive benchmark and dataset specifically designed for the FG multimodal entity knowledge editing. MIKE encompasses a suite of tasks tailored to assess different perspectives, including Vanilla Name Answering, Entity-Level Caption, and Complex-Scenario Recognition. In addition, a new form of knowledge editing, Multi-step Editing, is introduced to evaluate the editing efficiency. Through our extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art methods face significant challenges in tackling our proposed benchmark, underscoring the complexity of FG knowledge editing in MLLMs. Our findings spotlight the urgent need for novel approaches in this domain, setting a clear agenda for future research and development efforts within the community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14835v1,2024-02
DictLLM: Harnessing Key-Value Data Structures with Large Language Models for Enhanced Medical Diagnostics,"YiQiu Guo, Yuchen Yang, Ya Zhang, Yu Wang, Yanfeng Wang","Structured data offers a sophisticated mechanism for the organization of information. Existing methodologies for the text-serialization of structured data in the context of large language models fail to adequately address the heterogeneity inherent in key-value structured data. These methods are not ideal and frequently result in larger input sizes and poor adaptability to input changes. In this paper, we introduce DictLLM, an innovative framework designed to improve the modeling of key-value structured data, like medical laboratory reports, for generating medical diagnoses. DictLLM integrates three key components: (1) group positional encoding to maintain permutation invariance, (2) hierarchical attention bias to capture the inherent bias in structured data, and (3) an optimal transport alignment layer that aligns the embedding generated by the dictionary encoder with the LLM, thereby producing a sequence of fixed-length virtual tokens. We carry out experiments using various LLM models on a comprehensive real-world medical laboratory report dataset for automatic diagnosis generation, our findings illustrate that DictLLM significantly outperforms established baseline methods and few-shot GPT-4 implementations in terms of both Rouge-L and Knowledge F1 scores. Furthermore, our evaluation of the framework's scalability and robustness, through a series of experiments, underscores its exceptional capability in accurately modeling the complex key-value data structure of medical dictionary data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11481v1,2024-02
A Curious Case of Searching for the Correlation between Training Data and Adversarial Robustness of Transformer Textual Models,"Cuong Dang, Dung D. Le, Thai Le","Existing works have shown that fine-tuned textual transformer models achieve state-of-the-art prediction performances but are also vulnerable to adversarial text perturbations. Traditional adversarial evaluation is often done \textit{only after} fine-tuning the models and ignoring the training data. In this paper, we want to prove that there is also a strong correlation between training data and model robustness. To this end, we extract 13 different features representing a wide range of input fine-tuning corpora properties and use them to predict the adversarial robustness of the fine-tuned models. Focusing mostly on encoder-only transformer models BERT and RoBERTa with additional results for BART, ELECTRA, and GPT2, we provide diverse evidence to support our argument. First, empirical analyses show that (a) extracted features can be used with a lightweight classifier such as Random Forest to predict the attack success rate effectively, and (b) features with the most influence on the model robustness have a clear correlation with the robustness. Second, our framework can be used as a fast and effective additional tool for robustness evaluation since it (a) saves 30x-193x runtime compared to the traditional technique, (b) is transferable across models, (c) can be used under adversarial training, and (d) robust to statistical randomness.

MSynFD: Multi-hop Syntax aware Fake News Detection,"Liang Xiao, Qi Zhang, Chongyang Shi, Shoujin Wang, Usman Naseem, Liang Hu","The proliferation of social media platforms has fueled the rapid dissemination of fake news, posing threats to our real-life society. Existing methods use multimodal data or contextual information to enhance the detection of fake news by analyzing news content and/or its social context. However, these methods often overlook essential textual news content (articles) and heavily rely on sequential modeling and global attention to extract semantic information. These existing methods fail to handle the complex, subtle twists in news articles, such as syntax-semantics mismatches and prior biases, leading to lower performance and potential failure when modalities or social context are missing. To bridge these significant gaps, we propose a novel multi-hop syntax aware fake news detection (MSynFD) method, which incorporates complementary syntax information to deal with subtle twists in fake news. Specifically, we introduce a syntactical dependency graph and design a multi-hop subgraph aggregation mechanism to capture multi-hop syntax. It extends the effect of word perception, leading to effective noise filtering and adjacent relation enhancement. Subsequently, a sequential relative position-aware Transformer is designed to capture the sequential information, together with an elaborate keyword debiasing module to mitigate the prior bias. Extensive experimental results on two public benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and superior performance of our proposed MSynFD over state-of-the-art detection models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14834v2,2024-02
When Do LLMs Need Retrieval Augmentation? Mitigating LLMs' Overconfidence Helps Retrieval Augmentation,"Shiyu Ni, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to have difficulty knowing they do not possess certain knowledge and tend to provide specious answers in such cases. Retrieval Augmentation (RA) has been extensively studied to mitigate LLMs' hallucinations. However, due to the extra overhead and unassured quality of retrieval, it may not be optimal to conduct RA all the time. A straightforward idea is to only conduct retrieval when LLMs are uncertain about a question. This motivates us to enhance the LLMs' ability to perceive their knowledge boundaries to help RA. In this paper, we first quantitatively measure LLMs' such ability and confirm their overconfidence. Then, we study how LLMs' certainty about a question correlates with their dependence on external retrieved information. We propose several methods to enhance LLMs' perception of knowledge boundaries and show that they are effective in reducing overconfidence. Additionally, equipped with these methods, LLMs can achieve comparable or even better performance of RA with much fewer retrieval calls.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11457v2,2024-02
FactPICO: Factuality Evaluation for Plain Language Summarization of Medical Evidence,"Sebastian Antony Joseph, Lily Chen, Jan Trienes, Hannah Louisa Göke, Monika Coers, Wei Xu, Byron C Wallace, Junyi Jessy Li","Plain language summarization with LLMs can be useful for improving textual accessibility of technical content. But how factual are these summaries in a high-stakes domain like medicine? This paper presents FactPICO, a factuality benchmark for plain language summarization of medical texts describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are the basis of evidence-based medicine and can directly inform patient treatment. FactPICO consists of 345 plain language summaries of RCT abstracts generated from three LLMs (i.e., GPT-4, Llama-2, and Alpaca), with fine-grained evaluation and natural language rationales from experts. We assess the factuality of critical elements of RCTs in those summaries: Populations, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes (PICO), as well as the reported findings concerning these. We also evaluate the correctness of the extra information (e.g., explanations) added by LLMs. Using FactPICO, we benchmark a range of existing factuality metrics, including the newly devised ones based on LLMs. We find that plain language summarization of medical evidence is still challenging, especially when balancing between simplicity and factuality, and that existing metrics correlate poorly with expert judgments on the instance level.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11456v2,2024-02
LoRA-Flow: Dynamic LoRA Fusion for Large Language Models in Generative Tasks,"Hanqing Wang, Bowen Ping, Shuo Wang, Xu Han, Yun Chen, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","LoRA employs lightweight modules to customize large language models (LLMs) for each downstream task or domain, where different learned additional modules represent diverse skills. Combining existing LoRAs to address new tasks can enhance the reusability of learned LoRAs, particularly beneficial for tasks with limited annotated data. Most prior works on LoRA combination primarily rely on task-level weights for each involved LoRA, making different examples and tokens share the same LoRA weights. However, in generative tasks, different tokens may necessitate diverse skills to manage. Taking the Chinese math task as an example, understanding the problem description may depend more on the Chinese LoRA, while the calculation part may rely more on the math LoRA. To this end, we propose LoRA-Flow, which utilizes dynamic weights to adjust the impact of different LoRAs. The weights at each step are determined by a fusion gate with extremely few parameters, which can be learned with only 200 training examples. Experiments across six generative tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines with task-level fusion weights. This underscores the necessity of introducing dynamic fusion weights for LoRA combination.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11455v1,2024-02

Despite its importance, the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for scientific data visualization remains rather unexplored. In this study, we introduce MatPlotAgent, an efficient model-agnostic LLM agent framework designed to automate scientific data visualization tasks. Leveraging the capabilities of both code LLMs and multi-modal LLMs, MatPlotAgent consists of three core modules: query understanding, code generation with iterative debugging, and a visual feedback mechanism for error correction. To address the lack of benchmarks in this field, we present MatPlotBench, a high-quality benchmark consisting of 100 human-verified test cases. Additionally, we introduce a scoring approach that utilizes GPT-4V for automatic evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that MatPlotAgent can improve the performance of various LLMs, including both commercial and open-source models.

To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework AutoPRM that efficiently enhances the fine-tuning of LLMs for intricate reasoning challenges. Specifically, AutoPRM first decomposes complex problems into more manageable subquestions with a controllable granularity switch, then sequentially apply reinforcement learning to iteratively improve the subquestion solver. Additionally, we propose context-guided-decoding to avoid reward tampering and guide the subquestion solver towards the solution of the holistic problem. Extensive experiments show that AutoPRM significantly improves performance on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks over SOTA. More encouragingly, AutoPRM can be easily integrated with other orthogonal reasoning pipelines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11452v1,2024-02

To make this task more practical and solvable for LLMs, we introduce a new task setting named tool-augmented scientific reasoning. This setting supplements LLMs with scalable toolsets, and shifts the focus from pursuing an omniscient problem solver to a proficient tool-user. To facilitate the research of such setting, we construct a tool-augmented training corpus named MathFunc which encompasses over 30,000 samples and roughly 6,000 tools. Building on MathFunc, we develop SciAgent to retrieve, understand and, if necessary, use tools for scientific problem solving. Additionally, we craft a benchmark, SciToolBench, spanning five scientific domains to evaluate LLMs' abilities with tool assistance. Extensive experiments on SciToolBench confirm the effectiveness of SciAgent. Notably, SciAgent-Mistral-7B surpasses other LLMs with the same size by more than 13% in absolute accuracy.

In-Context Example Ordering Guided by Label Distributions,"Zhichao Xu, Daniel Cohen, Bei Wang, Vivek Srikumar","By allowing models to predict without task-specific training, in-context learning (ICL) with pretrained LLMs has enormous potential in NLP. However, a number of problems persist in ICL. In particular, its performance is sensitive to the choice and order of in-context examples. Given the same set of in-context examples with different orderings, model performance may vary between near random to near state-of-the-art. In this work, we formulate in-context example ordering as an optimization problem. We examine three problem settings that differ in the assumptions they make about what is known about the task. Inspired by the idea of learning from label proportions, we propose two principles for in-context example ordering guided by model's probability predictions. We apply our proposed principles to thirteen text classification datasets and nine different autoregressive LLMs with 700M to 13B parameters. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baselines by improving the classification accuracy, reducing model miscalibration, and also by selecting better in-context examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11447v1,2024-02
Benchmark Self-Evolving: A Multi-Agent Framework for Dynamic LLM Evaluation,"Siyuan Wang, Zhuohan Long, Zhihao Fan, Zhongyu Wei, Xuanjing Huang","This paper presents a benchmark self-evolving framework to dynamically evaluate rapidly advancing Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming for a more accurate assessment of their capabilities and limitations. We utilize a multi-agent system to manipulate the context or question of original instances, reframing new evolving instances with high confidence that dynamically extend existing benchmarks. Towards a more scalable, robust and fine-grained evaluation, we implement six reframing operations to construct evolving instances testing LLMs against diverse queries, data noise and probing their problem-solving sub-abilities. With this framework, we extend benchmark datasets of four tasks. Experimental results show a general performance decline in most LLMs against their original results. This decline under our scalable and robust evaluations, alongside our fine-grained evaluation, more accurately reflect models' capabilities.

Can LLMs Reason with Rules? Logic Scaffolding for Stress-Testing and Improving LLMs,"Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Yejin Choi, Xiang Ren","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive human-like performance across various reasoning tasks. However, their mastery of underlying inferential rules still falls short of human capabilities. To investigate this, we propose a logic scaffolding inferential rule generation framework, to construct an inferential rule base, ULogic, comprising both primitive and compositional rules across five domains. Our analysis of GPT-series models over a rule subset reveals significant gaps in LLMs' logic understanding compared to human performance, especially in compositional and structural complex rules with certain bias patterns. We further distill these rules into a smaller-scale inference engine for flexible rule generation and enhancing downstream reasoning. Through a multi-judger evaluation, our inference engine proves effective in generating accurate, complex and abstract conclusions and premises, and improve various commonsense reasoning tasks. Overall, our work sheds light on LLMs' limitations in grasping inferential rule and suggests ways to enhance their logical reasoning abilities~\footnote{Code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/SiyuanWangw/ULogic}.}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11442v3,2024-02
InfuserKI: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graphs via Infuser-Guided Knowledge Integration,"Fali Wang, Runxue Bao, Suhang Wang, Wenchao Yu, Yanchi Liu, Wei Cheng, Haifeng Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional capabilities in open generation across various domains, yet they encounter difficulties with tasks that require intensive knowledge. To address these challenges, methods for integrating knowledge have been developed, which augment LLMs with domain-specific knowledge graphs through external modules. These approaches, however, face data inefficiency issues as they necessitate the processing of both known and unknown knowledge for fine-tuning. Thus, our research focuses on a novel problem: efficiently integrating unknown knowledge into LLMs without unnecessary overlap of known knowledge. A risk of introducing new knowledge is the potential forgetting of existing knowledge. To mitigate this risk, we propose the innovative {\method} framework. This framework employs transformer internal states to determine when to enrich LLM outputs with additional information, effectively preventing knowledge forgetting. Performance evaluations using the UMLS-2.5k and MetaQA domain knowledge graphs reveal that {\method} not only successfully integrates new knowledge but also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing knowledge forgetting by 9\% and 6\%, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11441v2,2024-02
Pride and Prejudice: LLM Amplifies Self-Bias in Self-Refinement,"Wenda Xu, Guanglei Zhu, Xuandong Zhao, Liangming Pan, Lei Li, William Yang Wang","Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs) improve their performance through self-feedback on certain tasks while degrade on others. We discovered that such a contrary is due to LLM's bias in evaluating their own output. In this paper, we formally define LLM's self-bias - the tendency to favor its own generation - using two statistics. We analyze six LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini, LLaMA2, Mixtral and DeepSeek) on translation, constrained text generation, and mathematical reasoning tasks. We find that self-bias is prevalent in all examined LLMs across multiple languages and tasks. Our analysis reveals that while the self-refine pipeline improves the fluency and understandability of model outputs, it further amplifies self-bias. To mitigate such biases, we discover that larger model size and external feedback with accurate assessment can significantly reduce bias in the self-refine pipeline, leading to actual performance improvement in downstream tasks.

Its main goal is to detect deceptive behaviors from multimodal clues such as gestures, facial expressions, prosody, etc. However, these bases are usually subjective and related to personal habits. Therefore, we extend deception detection to deception reasoning, further providing objective evidence to support subjective judgment. Specifically, we provide potential lies and basic facts and then analyze why this sentence may be a lie by combining factual inconsistencies and intent behind them. Compared with deception detection, this task is more applicable to real-world scenarios. For example, in interrogation, the police should judge whether a person is lying based on solid evidence.

We evaluate EventRL against existing methods like Few-Shot Prompting (FSP) (based on GPT4) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) across various LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMa, and CodeLLaMa models. Our findings show that EventRL significantly outperforms these conventional approaches by improving the performance in identifying and structuring events, particularly in handling novel event types.

Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Multi-domain Chinese Spelling Correction by Multi-stage Knowledge Transfer Framework,"Peng Xing, Yinghui Li, Shirong Ma, Xinnian Liang, Haojing Huang, Yangning Li, Hai-Tao Zheng, Wenhao Jiang, Ying Shen","Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) aims to detect and correct spelling errors in given sentences. Recently, multi-domain CSC has gradually attracted the attention of researchers because it is more practicable. In this paper, we focus on the key flaw of the CSC model when adapting to multi-domain scenarios: the tendency to forget previously acquired knowledge upon learning new domain-specific knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). To address this, we propose a novel model-agnostic Multi-stage Knowledge Transfer (MKT) framework, which utilizes a continuously evolving teacher model for knowledge transfer in each domain, rather than focusing solely on new domain knowledge. It deserves to be mentioned that we are the first to apply continual learning methods to the multi-domain CSC task.

As a fundamental task in the NLP field, Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (CGEC) aims to correct all potential grammatical errors in the input sentences. Previous studies have shown that LLMs' performance as correctors on CGEC remains unsatisfactory due to its challenging task focus. To promote the CGEC field to better adapt to the era of LLMs, we rethink the roles of LLMs in the CGEC task so that they can be better utilized and explored in CGEC. Considering the rich grammatical knowledge stored in LLMs and their powerful semantic understanding capabilities, we utilize LLMs as explainers to provide explanation information for the CGEC small models during error correction to enhance performance. We also use LLMs as evaluators to bring more reasonable CGEC evaluations, thus alleviating the troubles caused by the subjectivity of the CGEC task. In particular, our work is also an active exploration of how LLMs and small models better collaborate in downstream tasks.

However, existing PEFT methods are still limited by the growing number of trainable parameters with the rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we present LoRETTA, an ultra-parameter-efficient framework that significantly reduces trainable parameters through tensor-train decomposition. Specifically, we propose two methods, named {LoRETTA}$_{adp}$ and {LoRETTA}$_{rep}$. The former employs tensorized adapters, offering a high-performance yet lightweight approach for the fine-tuning of LLMs. The latter emphasizes fine-tuning via weight parameterization with a set of small tensor factors. LoRETTA achieves comparable or better performance than most widely used PEFT methods with up to $100\times$ fewer parameters on the LLaMA-2-7B models.

Notably, the reference-free factuality evaluation framework doesn't need ground truth and hence it has a wider application scenario. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, we compute the correlation between our frameworks and the other metrics. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method. We will release our code and dataset via github.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11414v3,2024-02

Since these components are trained separately, the learned representations need to be aligned with joint training on additional image-language pairs. This procedure is not perfect and can cause the model to hallucinate - provide answers that do not accurately reflect the image, even when the core LLM is highly factual and the vision backbone has sufficiently complete representations. In this work, we frame the hallucination problem as an alignment issue, tackle it with preference tuning. Specifically, we propose POVID to generate feedback data with AI models. We use ground-truth instructions as the preferred response and a two-stage approach to generate dispreferred data. First, we prompt GPT-4V to inject plausible hallucinations into the correct answer. Second, we distort the image to trigger the inherent hallucination behavior of the VLLM. This is an automated approach, which does not rely on human data generation or require a perfect expert, which makes it easily scalable. Finally, both of these generation strategies are integrated into an RLHF pipeline via Direct Preference Optimization. In experiments across broad benchmarks, we show that we can not only reduce hallucinations, but improve model performance across standard benchmarks, outperforming prior approaches. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/YiyangZhou/POVID.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11411v1,2024-02
Multi-dimensional Evaluation of Empathetic Dialog Responses,"Zhichao Xu, Jiepu Jiang","Empathy is critical for effective and satisfactory conversational communication. Prior efforts to measure conversational empathy mostly focus on expressed communicative intents -- that is, the way empathy is expressed. Yet, these works ignore the fact that conversation is also a collaboration involving both speakers and listeners. In contrast, we propose a multi-dimensional empathy evaluation framework to measure both \emph{expressed intents from the speaker's perspective} and \emph{perceived empathy from the listener's perspective}. We apply our analytical framework to examine internal customer-service dialogues. We find the two dimensions (expressed intent types and perceived empathy) are inter-connected, while perceived empathy has high correlations with dialogue satisfaction levels.   To reduce the annotation cost, we explore different options to automatically measure conversational empathy: prompting LLMs and training language model-based classifiers. Our experiments show that prompting methods with even popular models like GPT-4 and Flan family models perform relatively poorly on both public and our internal datasets. In contrast, instruction-finetuned classifiers based on Flan-T5 family models outperform prior works and competitive baselines. We conduct a detailed ablation study to give more insights into instruction finetuning method's strong performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11409v3,2024-02
Don't Go To Extremes: Revealing the Excessive Sensitivity and Calibration Limitations of LLMs in Implicit Hate Speech Detection,"Min Zhang, Jianfeng He, Taoran Ji, Chang-Tien Lu","The fairness and trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) are receiving increasing attention. Implicit hate speech, which employs indirect language to convey hateful intentions, occupies a significant portion of practice. However, the extent to which LLMs effectively address this issue remains insufficiently examined. This paper delves into the capability of LLMs to detect implicit hate speech (Classification Task) and express confidence in their responses (Calibration Task). Our evaluation meticulously considers various prompt patterns and mainstream uncertainty estimation methods. Our findings highlight that LLMs exhibit two extremes: (1) LLMs display excessive sensitivity towards groups or topics that may cause fairness issues, resulting in misclassifying benign statements as hate speech. (2) LLMs' confidence scores for each method excessively concentrate on a fixed range, remaining unchanged regardless of the dataset's complexity. Consequently, the calibration performance is heavily reliant on primary classification accuracy. These discoveries unveil new limitations of LLMs, underscoring the need for caution when optimizing models to ensure they do not veer towards extremes. This serves as a reminder to carefully consider sensitivity and confidence in the pursuit of model fairness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11406v3,2024-02
k-SemStamp: A Clustering-Based Semantic Watermark for Detection of Machine-Generated Text,"Abe Bohan Hou, Jingyu Zhang, Yichen Wang, Daniel Khashabi, Tianxing He","Recent watermarked generation algorithms inject detectable signatures during language generation to facilitate post-hoc detection. While token-level watermarks are vulnerable to paraphrase attacks, SemStamp (Hou et al., 2023) applies watermark on the semantic representation of sentences and demonstrates promising robustness. SemStamp employs locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to partition the semantic space with arbitrary hyperplanes, which results in a suboptimal tradeoff between robustness and speed. We propose k-SemStamp, a simple yet effective enhancement of SemStamp, utilizing k-means clustering as an alternative of LSH to partition the embedding space with awareness of inherent semantic structure. Experimental results indicate that k-SemStamp saliently improves its robustness and sampling efficiency while preserving the generation quality, advancing a more effective tool for machine-generated text detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11399v2,2024-02
Reasoning before Comparison: LLM-Enhanced Semantic Similarity Metrics for Domain Specialized Text Analysis,"Shaochen Xu, Zihao Wu, Huaqin Zhao, Peng Shu, Zhengliang Liu, Wenxiong Liao, Sheng Li, Andrea Sikora, Tianming Liu, Xiang Li","In this study, we leverage LLM to enhance the semantic analysis and develop similarity metrics for texts, addressing the limitations of traditional unsupervised NLP metrics like ROUGE and BLEU. We develop a framework where LLMs such as GPT-4 are employed for zero-shot text identification and label generation for radiology reports, where the labels are then used as measurements for text similarity. By testing the proposed framework on the MIMIC data, we find that GPT-4 generated labels can significantly improve the semantic similarity assessment, with scores more closely aligned with clinical ground truth than traditional NLP metrics. Our work demonstrates the possibility of conducting semantic analysis of the text data using semi-quantitative reasoning results by the LLMs for highly specialized domains. While the framework is implemented for radiology report similarity analysis, its concept can be extended to other specialized domains as well.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11398v2,2024-02
CliqueParcel: An Approach For Batching LLM Prompts That Jointly Optimizes Efficiency And Faithfulness,"Jiayi Liu, Tinghan Yang, Jennifer Neville","Large language models (LLMs) have become pivotal in recent research. However, during the inference process, LLMs still require substantial resources. In this paper, we propose CliqueParcel, a method designed to improve the efficiency of LLMs via prompt batching. Existing strategies to optimize inference efficiency often compromise on output quality, leading to a discounted output problem. This issue might result in reduced accuracy or outputs that are less detailed. CliqueParcel is our answer to this challenge. While ensuring accuracy and minimizing deviations from the original outputs (i.e., faithfulness), our method significantly improves efficiency during inference.   To lay the groundwork, we first redefine efficiency measurements by excluding the reduction in running time due to shorter lengths. Then, we provide a comprehensive trade-off between efficiency and faithfulness to clarify the nature of the 'discounted output' problem. Within the CliqueParcel framework, we suggest multiple batching sub-methods and discuss the specific scenarios in which they can be applied. During evaluation, CliqueParcel is tested on eight widely recognized datasets, which can be classified into three types: reading comprehension, open-source question-answering, and reasoning. Our experiments explore the performance of CliqueParcel, including efficiency, faithfulness, and the trade-off between them. This work provides novel insights into inference efficiency and demonstrates promising performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14833v1,2024-02
Offline Training of Language Model Agents with Functions as Learnable Weights,"Shaokun Zhang, Jieyu Zhang, Jiale Liu, Linxin Song, Chi Wang, Ranjay Krishna, Qingyun Wu","Researchers and practitioners have recently reframed powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents, enabling them to automate complex tasks largely via the use of specialized functions. To facilitate the development of LLM agents, we present a novel paradigm of training LLM agents without modifying the LLM weights, which is particularly useful when the LLMs are difficult or inaccessible for modifications. Inspired by how humans continuously forge tools to adapt to real-world tasks, rather than change our biological structure to fit a static set of tools, we propose to progressively forge agent's functions to better solve the downstream tasks instead of modifying the LLM weights. By treating the functions as learnable `agent parameters' and leveraging the fundamental idea of model training in artificial intelligence, we develop AgentOptimizer that employs the LLM to update agents' functions and devise an agent training algorithm with two strategies, roll-back, and early-stop, to streamline the training process. With extensive experiments, we showcase that the agent training paradigm could significantly improve the performance of representative LLM agents in various downstream tasks. We also study the behavior of the agent training regarding aspects like the learning curve and domain transferability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11359v4,2024-02
Intervention Lens: from Representation Surgery to String Counterfactuals,"Matan Avitan, Ryan Cotterell, Yoav Goldberg, Shauli Ravfogel","Interventions targeting the representation space of language models (LMs) have emerged as an effective means to influence model behavior. Such methods are employed, for example, to eliminate or alter the encoding of demographic information such as gender within the model's representations and, in so doing, create a counterfactual representation. However, because the intervention operates within the representation space, understanding precisely what aspects of the text it modifies poses a challenge. In this paper, we give a method to convert representation counterfactuals into string counterfactuals. We demonstrate that this approach enables us to analyze the linguistic alterations corresponding to a given representation space intervention and to interpret the features utilized to encode a specific concept. Moreover, the resulting counterfactuals can be used to mitigate bias in classification through data augmentation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11355v4,2024-02
Understanding the Impact of Long-Term Memory on Self-Disclosure with Large Language Model-Driven Chatbots for Public Health Intervention,"Eunkyung Jo, Yuin Jeong, SoHyun Park, Daniel A. Epstein, Young-Ho Kim","Recent large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to support public health monitoring by facilitating health disclosure through open-ended conversations but rarely preserve the knowledge gained about individuals across repeated interactions. Augmenting LLMs with long-term memory (LTM) presents an opportunity to improve engagement and self-disclosure, but we lack an understanding of how LTM impacts people's interaction with LLM-driven chatbots in public health interventions. We examine the case of CareCall -- an LLM-driven voice chatbot with LTM -- through the analysis of 1,252 call logs and interviews with nine users. We found that LTM enhanced health disclosure and fostered positive perceptions of the chatbot by offering familiarity. However, we also observed challenges in promoting self-disclosure through LTM, particularly around addressing chronic health conditions and privacy concerns. We discuss considerations for LTM integration in LLM-driven chatbots for public health monitoring, including carefully deciding what topics need to be remembered in light of public health goals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11353v1,2024-02
Language Models Don't Learn the Physical Manifestation of Language,"Bruce W. Lee, JaeHyuk Lim","We argue that language-only models don't learn the physical manifestation of language. We present an empirical investigation of visual-auditory properties of language through a series of tasks, termed H-Test. These tasks highlight a fundamental gap between human linguistic understanding and the sensory-deprived linguistic understanding of LLMs. In support of our hypothesis, 1. deliberate reasoning (Chain-of-Thought), 2. few-shot examples, or 3. stronger LLM from the same model family (LLaMA 2 13B -> LLaMA 2 70B) has no significant effect on H-Test performance.   We bring in the philosophical case of Mary, who learns about the world in a sensory-deprived environment as a useful conceptual framework to understand how language-only models learn about the world (Jackson, 1986). Our experiments show that some of the strongest proprietary LLMs stay near random chance baseline accuracy of 50%, highlighting the limitations of linguistic knowledge acquired in the absence of sensory experience.

PhaseEvo: Towards Unified In-Context Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models,"Wendi Cui, Jiaxin Zhang, Zhuohang Li, Hao Sun, Damien Lopez, Kamalika Das, Bradley Malin, Sricharan Kumar","Crafting an ideal prompt for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a challenging task that demands significant resources and expert human input. Existing work treats the optimization of prompt instruction and in-context learning examples as distinct problems, leading to sub-optimal prompt performance. This research addresses this limitation by establishing a unified in-context prompt optimization framework, which aims to achieve joint optimization of the prompt instruction and examples. However, formulating such optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional natural language space introduces challenges in terms of convergence and computational efficiency. To overcome these issues, we present PhaseEvo, an efficient automatic prompt optimization framework that combines the generative capability of LLMs with the global search proficiency of evolution algorithms. Our framework features a multi-phase design incorporating innovative LLM-based mutation operators to enhance search efficiency and accelerate convergence. We conduct an extensive evaluation of our approach across 35 benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that PhaseEvo significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin whilst maintaining good efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11347v1,2024-02
EVEDIT: Event-based Knowledge Editing with Deductive Editing Boundaries,"Jiateng Liu, Pengfei Yu, Yuji Zhang, Sha Li, Zixuan Zhang, Heng Ji","The dynamic nature of real-world information necessitates efficient knowledge editing (KE) in large language models (LLMs) for knowledge updating. However, current KE approaches, which typically operate on (subject, relation, object) triples, ignore the contextual information and the relation among different knowledge. Such editing methods could thus encounter an uncertain editing boundary, leaving a lot of relevant knowledge in ambiguity: Queries that could be answered pre-edit cannot be reliably answered afterward. In this work, we analyze this issue by introducing a theoretical framework for KE that highlights an overlooked set of knowledge that remains unchanged and aids in knowledge deduction during editing, which we name as the deduction anchor. We further address this issue by proposing a novel task of event-based knowledge editing that pairs facts with event descriptions. This task manifests not only a closer simulation of real-world editing scenarios but also a more logically sound setting, implicitly defining the deduction anchor to address the issue of indeterminate editing boundaries. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of event-based editing over the existing setting on resolving uncertainty in edited models, and curate a new benchmark dataset EvEdit derived from the CounterFact dataset. Moreover, while we observe that the event-based setting is significantly challenging for existing approaches, we propose a novel approach Self-Edit that showcases stronger performance, achieving 55.6% consistency improvement while maintaining the naturalness of generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11324v1,2024-02
MMMModal -- Multi-Images Multi-Audio Multi-turn Multi-Modal,"Husein Zolkepli, Aisyah Razak, Kamarul Adha, Ariff Nazhan","Our contribution introduces a groundbreaking multimodal large language model designed to comprehend multi-images, multi-audio, and multi-images-multi-audio within a single multiturn session.

Dissecting Human and LLM Preferences,"Junlong Li, Fan Zhou, Shichao Sun, Yikai Zhang, Hai Zhao, Pengfei Liu","As a relative quality comparison of model responses, human and Large Language Model (LLM) preferences serve as common alignment goals in model fine-tuning and criteria in evaluation. Yet, these preferences merely reflect broad tendencies, resulting in less explainable and controllable models with potential safety risks. In this work, we dissect the preferences of human and 32 different LLMs to understand their quantitative composition, using annotations from real-world user-model conversations for a fine-grained, scenario-wise analysis. We find that humans are less sensitive to errors, favor responses that support their stances, and show clear dislike when models admit their limits. On the contrary, advanced LLMs like GPT-4-Turbo emphasize correctness, clarity, and harmlessness more. Additionally, LLMs of similar sizes tend to exhibit similar preferences, regardless of their training methods, and fine-tuning for alignment does not significantly alter the preferences of pretrained-only LLMs. Finally, we show that preference-based evaluation can be intentionally manipulated. In both training-free and training-based settings, aligning a model with the preferences of judges boosts scores, while injecting the least preferred properties lowers them. This results in notable score shifts: up to 0.59 on MT-Bench (1-10 scale) and 31.94 on AlpacaEval 2.0 (0-100 scale), highlighting the significant impact of this strategic adaptation.

OneBit: Towards Extremely Low-bit Large Language Models,"Yuzhuang Xu, Xu Han, Zonghan Yang, Shuo Wang, Qingfu Zhu, Zhiyuan Liu, Weidong Liu, Wanxiang Che","Model quantification uses low bit-width values to represent the weight matrices of existing models to be quantized, which is a promising approach to reduce both storage and computational overheads of deploying highly anticipated LLMs. However, current quantization methods suffer severe performance degradation when the bit-width is extremely reduced, and thus focus on utilizing 4-bit or 8-bit values to quantize models. This paper boldly quantizes the weight matrices of LLMs to 1-bit, paving the way for the extremely low bit-width deployment of LLMs. For this target, we introduce a 1-bit model compressing framework named OneBit, including a novel 1-bit parameter representation method to better quantize LLMs as well as an effective parameter initialization method based on matrix decomposition to improve the convergence speed of the quantization framework. Sufficient experimental results indicate that OneBit achieves good performance (at least 81% of the non-quantized performance on LLaMA models) with robust training processes when only using 1-bit weight matrices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11295v6,2024-02
Puzzle Solving using Reasoning of Large Language Models: A Survey,"Panagiotis Giadikiaroglou, Maria Lymperaiou, Giorgos Filandrianos, Giorgos Stamou","Exploring the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in puzzle solving unveils critical insights into their potential and challenges in AI, marking a significant step towards understanding their applicability in complex reasoning tasks. This survey leverages a unique taxonomy -- dividing puzzles into rule-based and rule-less categories -- to critically assess LLMs through various methodologies, including prompting techniques, neuro-symbolic approaches, and fine-tuning. Through a critical review of relevant datasets and benchmarks, we assess LLMs' performance, identifying significant challenges in complex puzzle scenarios. Our findings highlight the disparity between LLM capabilities and human-like reasoning, particularly in those requiring advanced logical inference. The survey underscores the necessity for novel strategies and richer datasets to advance LLMs' puzzle-solving proficiency and contribute to AI's logical reasoning and creative problem-solving advancements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11291v3,2024-02
Grammaticality illusion or ambiguous interpretation? Event-related potentials reveal the nature of the missing-NP effect in Mandarin centre-embedded structures,"Qihang Yang, Caimei Yang, Yu Liao, Ziman Zhuang","In several languages, omitting a verb phrase (VP) in double centre-embedded structures creates a grammaticality illusion. Similar illusion also exhibited in Mandarin missing-NP double centre-embedded structures. However, there is no consensus on its very nature. Instead of treating it as grammaticality illusion, we argue that ambiguous interpretations of verbs can best account for this phenomenon in Mandarin. To further support this hypothesis, we conducted two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments on quasi double centre-embedded structures whose complexity is reduced by placing the self-embedding relative clauses into the sentence's subject position. Experiment 1 showed that similar phenomenon even exhibited in this structure, evidenced by an absence of P600 effect and a presence of N400 effect. In Experiment 2, providing semantic cues to reduce ambiguity dispelled this illusion, as evidenced by a P600 effect. We interpret the results under garden-path theory and propose that word-order difference may account for this cross-linguistic variation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11282v1,2024-02
Can Large Multimodal Models Uncover Deep Semantics Behind Images?,"Yixin Yang, Zheng Li, Qingxiu Dong, Heming Xia, Zhifang Sui","Understanding the deep semantics of images is essential in the era dominated by social media. However, current research works primarily on the superficial description of images, revealing a notable deficiency in the systematic investigation of the inherent deep semantics. In this work, we introduce DEEPEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark to assess Large Multimodal Models' (LMMs) capacities of visual deep semantics. DEEPEVAL includes human-annotated dataset and three progressive subtasks: fine-grained description selection, in-depth title matching, and deep semantics understanding. Utilizing DEEPEVAL, we evaluate 9 open-source LMMs and GPT-4V(ision). Our evaluation demonstrates a substantial gap between the deep semantic comprehension capabilities of existing LMMs and humans. For example, GPT-4V is 30% behind humans in understanding deep semantics, even though it achieves human-comparable performance in image description. Further analysis reveals that LMM performance on DEEPEVAL varies according to the specific facets of deep semantics explored, indicating the fundamental challenges remaining in developing LMMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11281v3,2024-02
Multi-Perspective Consistency Enhances Confidence Estimation in Large Language Models,"Pei Wang, Yejie Wang, Muxi Diao, Keqing He, Guanting Dong, Weiran Xu","In the deployment of large language models (LLMs), accurate confidence estimation is critical for assessing the credibility of model predictions. However, existing methods often fail to overcome the issue of overconfidence on incorrect answers. In this work, we focus on improving the confidence estimation of large language models. Considering the fragility of self-awareness in language models, we introduce a Multi-Perspective Consistency (MPC) method. We leverage complementary insights from different perspectives within models (MPC-Internal) and across different models (MPC-Across) to mitigate the issue of overconfidence arising from a singular viewpoint. The experimental results on eight publicly available datasets show that our MPC achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further analyses indicate that MPC can mitigate the problem of overconfidence and is effectively scalable to other models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11279v1,2024-02
MONAL: Model Autophagy Analysis for Modeling Human-AI Interactions,"Shu Yang, Muhammad Asif Ali, Lu Yu, Lijie Hu, Di Wang","The increasing significance of large models and their multi-modal variants in societal information processing has ignited debates on social safety and ethics. However, there exists a paucity of comprehensive analysis for: (i) the interactions between human and artificial intelligence systems, and (ii) understanding and addressing the associated limitations. To bridge this gap, we propose Model Autophagy Analysis (MONAL) for large models' self-consumption explanation. MONAL employs two distinct autophagous loops (referred to as ``self-consumption loops'') to elucidate the suppression of human-generated information in the exchange between human and AI systems. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets, we evaluate the capacities of generated models as both creators and disseminators of information. Our key findings reveal (i) A progressive prevalence of model-generated synthetic information over time within training datasets compared to human-generated information; (ii) The discernible tendency of large models, when acting as information transmitters across multiple iterations, to selectively modify or prioritize specific contents; and (iii) The potential for a reduction in the diversity of socially or human-generated information, leading to bottlenecks in the performance enhancement of large models and confining them to local optima.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11271v2,2024-02
MoRAL: MoE Augmented LoRA for LLMs' Lifelong Learning,"Shu Yang, Muhammad Asif Ali, Cheng-Long Wang, Lijie Hu, Di Wang","Adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains/tasks and enabling them to be efficient lifelong learners is a pivotal challenge. In this paper, we propose MoRAL, i.e., Mixture-of-Experts augmented Low-Rank Adaptation for Lifelong Learning. MoRAL combines the multi-tasking abilities of MoE with the fine-tuning abilities of LoRA for effective life-long learning of LLMs. In contrast to the conventional approaches that use factual triplets as inputs MoRAL relies on simple question-answer pairs, which is a more practical and effective strategy for robust and efficient learning. Owing to new data settings, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark namely: Life Long Learning of LLM (5L-bench) encompassing a newly curated dataset of question-answer pairs, and a set of evaluation metrics for rigorous evaluation of MoRAL in open-book and closed-book settings. Experimental evaluation shows (i) LLMs learn fast in open-book settings with up to 30.15% improvement in ""RA"" for Phi-2-2.7B compared to closed-book (for models fine-tuned with MoRAL); (ii) MoRAL shows higher performance improvement for models with a greater number of parameters; (iii) MoRAL is robust to catastrophic forgetting offering better knowledge retention compared to baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11260v1,2024-02
C-ICL: Contrastive In-context Learning for Information Extraction,"Ying Mo, Jiahao Liu, Jian Yang, Qifan Wang, Shun Zhang, Jingang Wang, Zhoujun Li","There has been increasing interest in exploring the capabilities of advanced large language models (LLMs) in the field of information extraction (IE), specifically focusing on tasks related to named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE). Although researchers are exploring the use of few-shot information extraction through in-context learning with LLMs, they tend to focus only on using correct or positive examples for demonstration, neglecting the potential value of incorporating incorrect or negative examples into the learning process. In this paper, we present c-ICL, a novel few-shot technique that leverages both correct and incorrect sample constructions to create in-context learning demonstrations. This approach enhances the ability of LLMs to extract entities and relations by utilizing prompts that incorporate not only the positive samples but also the reasoning behind them. This method allows for the identification and correction of potential interface errors. Specifically, our proposed method taps into the inherent contextual information and valuable information in hard negative samples and the nearest positive neighbors to the test and then applies the in-context learning demonstrations based on LLMs. Our experiments on various datasets indicate that c-ICL outperforms previous few-shot in-context learning methods, delivering substantial enhancements in performance across a broad spectrum of related tasks. These improvements are noteworthy, showcasing the versatility of our approach in miscellaneous scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11254v2,2024-02
Aligning Large Language Models by On-Policy Self-Judgment,"Sangkyu Lee, Sungdong Kim, Ashkan Yousefpour, Minjoon Seo, Kang Min Yoo, Youngjae Yu","Existing approaches for aligning large language models with human preferences face a trade-off that requires a separate reward model (RM) for on-policy learning. In this paper, we present a novel alignment framework, SELF-JUDGE that (1) does on-policy learning and 2) is parameter efficient, as it does not require an additional RM for evaluating the samples for on-policy learning. To this end, we propose Judge-augmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (JSFT) to train a single model to act as both a policy and a judge. Specifically, we view the pairwise judgment task, choosing the better response from a response pair, as a special case of the instruction-following task. The resulting model can judge preferences of on-the-fly responses from current policy initialized from itself. Experimental results show the efficacy of SELF-JUDGE, outperforming baselines in preference benchmarks. We also show that the rejecting sampling by itself can improve performance further without an additional evaluator.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11253v3,2024-02
LLM can Achieve Self-Regulation via Hyperparameter Aware Generation,"Siyin Wang, Shimin Li, Tianxiang Sun, Jinlan Fu, Qinyuan Cheng, Jiasheng Ye, Junjie Ye, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang","In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), users commonly employ diverse decoding strategies and adjust hyperparameters to control the generated text. However, a critical question emerges: Are LLMs conscious of the existence of these decoding strategies and capable of regulating themselves? The current decoding generation process often relies on empirical and heuristic manual adjustments to hyperparameters based on types of tasks and demands. However, this process is typically cumbersome, and the decoding hyperparameters may not always be optimal for each sample. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel text generation paradigm termed Hyperparameter Aware Generation (HAG). By leveraging hyperparameter-aware instruction tuning, the LLM autonomously determines the optimal decoding strategy and configs based on the input samples, enabling self-regulation. Our approach eliminates the need for extensive manual tuning, offering a more autonomous, self-regulate model behavior. Experimental results spanning six datasets across reasoning, creativity, translation, and mathematics tasks demonstrate that hyperparameter-aware instruction tuning empowers the LLMs to self-regulate the decoding strategy and hyperparameter. HAG extends the current paradigm in the text generation process, highlighting the feasibility of endowing the LLMs with self-regulate decoding strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11251v1,2024-02

Relation-based AM (RbAM) is a form of AM focusing on identifying agreement (support) and disagreement (attack) relations amongst arguments. RbAM is a challenging classification task, with existing methods failing to perform satisfactorily.

Up to approximately 50% of adults with ADHD may also have an anxiety disorder and approximately 30\% of adults with anxiety may also have ADHD. Patients presenting with anxiety may be treated for anxiety without ADHD ever being considered, possibly affecting treatment. We show how data that bears on ADHD that is comorbid with anxiety can be obtained from social media data, and show that Transformers can be used to detect a proxy for possible comorbid ADHD in people with anxiety symptoms.   We collected data from anxiety and ADHD online forums (subreddits). We identified posters who first started posting in the Anxiety subreddit and later started posting in the ADHD subreddit as well. We use this subset of the posters as a proxy for people who presented with anxiety symptoms and then became aware that they might have ADHD. We fine-tune a Transformer architecture-based classifier to classify people who started posting in the Anxiety subreddit and then started posting in the ADHD subreddit vs. people who posted in the Anxiety subreddit without later posting in the ADHD subreddit. We show that a Transformer architecture is capable of achieving reasonable results (76% correct for RoBERTa vs. under 60% correct for the best keyword-based model, both with 50% base rate).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05561v1,2024-02
Controlled Text Generation for Large Language Model with Dynamic Attribute Graphs,"Xun Liang, Hanyu Wang, Shichao Song, Mengting Hu, Xunzhi Wang, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Bo Tang","Controlled Text Generation (CTG) aims to produce texts that exhibit specific desired attributes. In this study, we introduce a pluggable CTG framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) named Dynamic Attribute Graphs-based controlled text generation (DATG). This framework utilizes an attribute scorer to evaluate the attributes of sentences generated by LLMs and constructs dynamic attribute graphs. DATG modulates the occurrence of key attribute words and key anti-attribute words, achieving effective attribute control without compromising the original capabilities of the model. We conduct experiments across four datasets in two tasks: toxicity mitigation and sentiment transformation, employing five LLMs as foundational models.

A Spectrum Evaluation Benchmark for Medical Multi-Modal Large Language Models,"Jie Liu, Wenxuan Wang, Yihang Su, Jingyuan Huan, Wenting Chen, Yudi Zhang, Cheng-Yi Li, Kao-Jung Chang, Xiaohan Xin, Linlin Shen, Michael R. Lyu","The significant breakthroughs of Medical Multi-Modal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) renovate modern healthcare with robust information synthesis and medical decision support. However, these models are often evaluated on benchmarks that are unsuitable for the Med-MLLMs due to the complexity of real-world diagnostics across diverse specialties. To address this gap, we introduce Asclepius, a novel Med-MLLM benchmark that comprehensively assesses Med-MLLMs in terms of: distinct medical specialties (cardiovascular, gastroenterology, etc.) and different diagnostic capacities (perception, disease analysis, etc.). Grounded in 3 proposed core principles, Asclepius ensures a comprehensive evaluation by encompassing 15 medical specialties, stratifying into 3 main categories and 8 sub-categories of clinical tasks, and exempting overlap with existing VQA dataset. We further provide an in-depth analysis of 6 Med-MLLMs and compare them with 3 human specialists, providing insights into their competencies and limitations in various medical contexts. Our work not only advances the understanding of Med-MLLMs' capabilities but also sets a precedent for future evaluations and the safe deployment of these models in clinical environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11217v2,2024-02
Watch Out for Your Agents! Investigating Backdoor Threats to LLM-Based Agents,"Wenkai Yang, Xiaohan Bi, Yankai Lin, Sishuo Chen, Jie Zhou, Xu Sun","Driven by the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been developed to handle various real-world applications, including finance, healthcare, and shopping, etc. It is crucial to ensure the reliability and security of LLM-based agents during applications. However, the safety issues of LLM-based agents are currently under-explored. In this work, we take the first step to investigate one of the typical safety threats, backdoor attack, to LLM-based agents. We first formulate a general framework of agent backdoor attacks, then we present a thorough analysis of different forms of agent backdoor attacks. Specifically, compared with traditional backdoor attacks on LLMs that are only able to manipulate the user inputs and model outputs, agent backdoor attacks exhibit more diverse and covert forms: (1) From the perspective of the final attacking outcomes, the agent backdoor attacker can not only choose to manipulate the final output distribution, but also introduce the malicious behavior in an intermediate reasoning step only, while keeping the final output correct. (2) Furthermore, the former category can be divided into two subcategories based on trigger locations, in which the backdoor trigger can either be hidden in the user query or appear in an intermediate observation returned by the external environment. We implement the above variations of agent backdoor attacks on two typical agent tasks including web shopping and tool utilization. Extensive experiments show that LLM-based agents suffer severely from backdoor attacks and such backdoor vulnerability cannot be easily mitigated by current textual backdoor defense algorithms. This indicates an urgent need for further research on the development of targeted defenses against backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents.

Turn Waste into Worth: Rectifying Top-$k$ Router of MoE,"Zhiyuan Zeng, Qipeng Guo, Zhaoye Fei, Zhangyue Yin, Yunhua Zhou, Linyang Li, Tianxiang Sun, Hang Yan, Dahua Lin, Xipeng Qiu","Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are popular for training large language models due to their computational efficiency. However, the commonly used top-$k$ routing mechanism suffers from redundancy computation and memory costs due to the unbalanced routing. Some experts are overflow, where the exceeding tokens are dropped. While some experts are vacant, which are padded with zeros, negatively impacting model performance. To address the dropped tokens and padding, we propose the Rectify-Router, comprising the Intra-GPU Rectification and the Fill-in Rectification. The Intra-GPU Rectification handles dropped tokens, efficiently routing them to experts within the GPU where they are located to avoid inter-GPU communication. The Fill-in Rectification addresses padding by replacing padding tokens with the tokens that have high routing scores. Our experimental results demonstrate that the Intra-GPU Rectification and the Fill-in Rectification effectively handle dropped tokens and padding, respectively. Furthermore, the combination of them achieves superior performance, surpassing the accuracy of the vanilla top-1 router by 4.7%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12399v2,2024-02

Direct Evaluation of Chain-of-Thought in Multi-hop Reasoning with Knowledge Graphs,"Minh-Vuong Nguyen, Linhao Luo, Fatemeh Shiri, Dinh Phung, Yuan-Fang Li, Thuy-Trang Vu, Gholamreza Haffari","Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities when prompted to generate chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations alongside answers. However, previous research on evaluating LLMs has solely focused on answer accuracy, neglecting the correctness of the generated CoT. In this paper, we delve deeper into the CoT reasoning capabilities of LLMs in multi-hop question answering by utilizing knowledge graphs (KGs). We propose a novel discriminative and generative CoT evaluation paradigm to assess LLMs' knowledge of reasoning and the accuracy of the generated CoT. Through experiments conducted on 5 different families of LLMs across 2 multi-hop question-answering datasets, we find that LLMs possess sufficient knowledge to perform reasoning. However, there exists a significant disparity between answer accuracy and faithfulness of the CoT reasoning generated by LLMs, indicating that they often arrive at correct answers through incorrect reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11199v2,2024-02
Centroid-Based Efficient Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding,"Hiroyuki Deguchi, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe, Hideki Tanaka, Masao Utiyama","Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding achieved state-of-the-art translation performance by using COMET, a neural metric that has a high correlation with human evaluation. However, MBR decoding requires quadratic time since it computes the expected score between a translation hypothesis and all reference translations. We propose centroid-based MBR (CBMBR) decoding to improve the speed of MBR decoding. Our method clusters the reference translations in the feature space, and then calculates the score using the centroids of each cluster. The experimental results show that our CBMBR not only improved the decoding speed of the expected score calculation 5.7 times, but also outperformed vanilla MBR decoding in translation quality by up to 0.5 COMET in the WMT'22 En$\leftrightarrow$Ja, En$\leftrightarrow$De, En$\leftrightarrow$Zh, and WMT'23 En$\leftrightarrow$Ja translation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11197v2,2024-02

Through extensive experiments with various models and prompting techniques, we assess how LLMs adapt to complex tables and mathematical tasks. We focus on sensitivity to table complexity and performance variations with an increasing number of arithmetic reasoning steps. The results provide insights into LLMs' capabilities and limitations in handling complex mathematical scenarios for semi-structured tables. Ultimately, we introduce a novel prompting technique tailored to semi-structured documents, matching or outperforming other baselines in performance while providing a nuanced understanding of LLMs abilities for such a task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11194v2,2024-02
I Learn Better If You Speak My Language: Understanding the Superior Performance of Fine-Tuning Large Language Models with LLM-Generated Responses,"Xuan Ren, Biao Wu, Lingqiao Liu","This paper explores an intriguing observation: fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) with responses generated by a LLM often yields better results than using responses generated by humans, particularly in reasoning tasks. We conduct an in-depth investigation to understand why this occurs. Contrary to the common belief that these instances is due to the more detailed nature of LLM-generated content, our study identifies another contributing factor: an LLM is inherently more ""familiar"" with LLM generated responses. This familiarity is evidenced by lower perplexity before fine-tuning. We design a series of experiments to understand the impact of the ""familiarity"" and our conclusion reveals that this ""familiarity"" significantly impacts learning performance. Training with LLM-generated responses not only enhances performance but also helps maintain the model's capabilities in other reasoning tasks after fine-tuning on a specific task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11192v4,2024-02
Knowledge Graph Assisted Automatic Sports News Writing,"Yang Cao, Xinyi Chen, Xin Zhang, Siying Li","In this paper, we present a novel method for automatically generating sports news, which employs a unique algorithm that extracts pivotal moments from live text broadcasts and uses them to create an initial draft of the news. This draft is further refined by incorporating key details and background information from a specially designed sports knowledge graph. This graph contains 5,893 entities, which are classified into three distinct conceptual categories, interconnected through four relationship types, and characterized by 27 unique attributes. In addition, we create a multi-stage learning model by combining convolutional neural networks and a transformer encoder. This model expresses entity-task interactions using convolutional neural networks and enriches entity representations in the query set with the transformer encoder.

Disclosure and Mitigation of Gender Bias in LLMs,"Xiangjue Dong, Yibo Wang, Philip S. Yu, James Caverlee","Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate biased responses. Yet previous direct probing techniques contain either gender mentions or predefined gender stereotypes, which are challenging to comprehensively collect. Hence, we propose an indirect probing framework based on conditional generation. This approach aims to induce LLMs to disclose their gender bias even without explicit gender or stereotype mentions. We explore three distinct strategies to disclose explicit and implicit gender bias in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that all tested LLMs exhibit explicit and/or implicit gender bias, even when gender stereotypes are not present in the inputs. In addition, an increased model size or model alignment amplifies bias in most cases. Furthermore, we investigate three methods to mitigate bias in LLMs via Hyperparameter Tuning, Instruction Guiding, and Debias Tuning. Remarkably, these methods prove effective even in the absence of explicit genders or stereotypes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11190v1,2024-02
LaCo: Large Language Model Pruning via Layer Collapse,"Yifei Yang, Zouying Cao, Hai Zhao","Large language models (LLMs) based on transformer are witnessing a notable trend of size expansion, which brings considerable costs to both model training and inference. However, existing methods such as model quantization, knowledge distillation, and model pruning are constrained by various issues, including hardware support limitations, the need for extensive training, and alterations to the model internal structure. In this paper, we propose a concise layer-wise structured pruner called \textit{Layer Collapse (LaCo)}, in which rear model layers collapse into a prior layer, enabling a rapid reduction in model size while preserving the model structure. Comprehensive experiments show that our method maintains an average task performance of over 80\% at pruning ratios of 25-30\%, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art structured pruning methods. We also conduct post-training experiments to confirm that the \textit{LaCo} effectively inherits the parameters of the original model. Additionally, we perform ablation studies on various settings of \textit{LaCo}. Finally, we discuss our motivation from the perspective of layer-wise similarity and evaluate the performance of the pruned LLMs across various pruning ratios\footnote{\url{https://github.com/yangyifei729/LaCo}}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11187v2,2024-02

ReNoVi consists of two parts: 512 human-authored dialogues (real data), and 8,746 synthetic conversations generated by ChatGPT through prompt learning. While collecting sufficient human-authored data is costly, synthetic conversations provide suitable amounts of data to help mitigate the scarcity of training data, as well as the chance to assess the alignment between LLMs and humans in the awareness of social norms. We thus harness the power of ChatGPT to generate synthetic training data for our task. To ensure the quality of both human-authored and synthetic data, we follow a quality control protocol during data collection.

A Question Answering Based Pipeline for Comprehensive Chinese EHR Information Extraction,"Huaiyuan Ying, Sheng Yu","Electronic health records (EHRs) hold significant value for research and applications. As a new way of information extraction, question answering (QA) can extract more flexible information than conventional methods and is more accessible to clinical researchers, but its progress is impeded by the scarcity of annotated data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that automatically generates training data for transfer learning of QA models. Our pipeline incorporates a preprocessing module to handle challenges posed by extraction types that are not readily compatible with extractive QA frameworks, including cases with discontinuous answers and many-to-one relationships. The obtained QA model exhibits excellent performance on subtasks of information extraction in EHRs, and it can effectively handle few-shot or zero-shot settings involving yes-no questions.

These limitations stem from inadequate knowledge awareness of LLMs during vanilla fine-tuning. To address these problems, we propose a knowledge-aware fine-tuning (KnowTuning) method to improve fine-grained and coarse-grained knowledge awareness of LLMs. We devise a fine-grained knowledge augmentation stage to train LLMs to identify difficult fine-grained knowledge in answers. We also propose a coarse-grained knowledge comparison stage to train LLMs to distinguish between reliable and unreliable knowledge, in three aspects: completeness, factuality, and logicality. Extensive experiments on both generic and medical question answering (QA) datasets confirm the effectiveness of KnowTuning, through automatic and human evaluations, across various sizes of LLMs. We further verify that KnowTuning generates more facts with less factual error rate under fine-grained facts evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11176v3,2024-02

This raises legitimate concerns about its potential misuse and societal implications. The need to identify and differentiate such content from genuine human-generated text is critical in combating disinformation, preserving the integrity of education and scientific fields, and maintaining trust in communication. In this work, we address this problem by introducing a new benchmark based on a multilingual, multi-domain, and multi-generator corpus of MGTs -- M4GT-Bench. The benchmark is compiled of three tasks: (1) mono-lingual and multi-lingual binary MGT detection; (2) multi-way detection where one need to identify, which particular model generated the text; and (3) mixed human-machine text detection, where a word boundary delimiting MGT from human-written content should be determined. On the developed benchmark, we have tested several MGT detection baselines and also conducted an evaluation of human performance.

This study proposes ToBlend, a novel token-level ensemble text generation method to challenge the robustness of current AI-content detection approaches by utilizing multiple sets of candidate generative large language models (LLMs). By randomly sampling token(s) from candidate LLMs sets, we find ToBlend significantly drops the performance of most mainstream AI-content detection methods.

Inspired by existing methods that design the interaction strategy between LLMs and KG, we propose an autonomous LLM-based agent framework, called KG-Agent, which enables a small LLM to actively make decisions until finishing the reasoning process over KGs. In KG-Agent, we integrate the LLM, multifunctional toolbox, KG-based executor, and knowledge memory, and develop an iteration mechanism that autonomously selects the tool then updates the memory for reasoning over KG. To guarantee the effectiveness, we leverage program language to formulate the multi-hop reasoning process over the KG, and synthesize a code-based instruction dataset to fine-tune the base LLM.

Assessing News Thumbnail Representativeness: Counterfactual text can enhance the cross-modal matching ability,"Yejun Yoon, Seunghyun Yoon, Kunwoo Park","This paper addresses the critical challenge of assessing the representativeness of news thumbnail images, which often serve as the first visual engagement for readers when an article is disseminated on social media. We focus on whether a news image represents the actors discussed in the news text. To serve the challenge, we introduce NewsTT, a manually annotated dataset of 1000 news thumbnail images and text pairs. We found that the pretrained vision and language models, such as BLIP-2, struggle with this task. Since news subjects frequently involve named entities or proper nouns, the pretrained models could have a limited capability to match news actors' visual and textual appearances. We hypothesize that learning to contrast news text with its counterfactual, of which named entities are replaced, can enhance the cross-modal matching ability of vision and language models. We propose CFT-CLIP, a contrastive learning framework that updates vision and language bi-encoders according to the hypothesis. We found that our simple method can boost the performance for assessing news thumbnail representativeness, supporting our assumption.

Grasping the Essentials: Tailoring Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Relation Extraction,"Sizhe Zhou, Yu Meng, Bowen Jin, Jiawei Han","Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relationships between entities within text. Despite considerable advancements, existing models predominantly require extensive annotated training data, which is both costly and labor-intensive to collect. Moreover, these models often struggle to adapt to new or unseen relations. Few-shot learning, aiming to lessen annotation demands, typically provides incomplete and biased supervision for target relations, leading to degraded and unstable performance. To accurately and explicitly describe relation semantics while minimizing annotation demands, we explore the definition only zero-shot RE setting where only relation definitions expressed in natural language are used to train a RE model. We introduce REPaL, comprising three stages: (1) We leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate initial seed instances from relation definitions and an unlabeled corpus. (2) We fine-tune a bidirectional Small Language Model (SLM) with initial seeds to learn relations for the target domain. (3) We expand pattern coverage and mitigate bias from initial seeds by integrating feedback from the SLM's predictions on the unlabeled corpus and the synthesis history. To accomplish this, we leverage the multi-turn conversation ability of LLMs to generate new instances in follow-up dialogues, informed by both the feedback and synthesis history. Studies reveal that definition-oriented seed synthesis enhances pattern coverage whereas indiscriminately increasing seed quantity leads to performance saturation. Experiments on two datasets show REPaL significantly improved cost-effective zero-shot performance by large margins.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11142v2,2024-02
Boosting of Thoughts: Trial-and-Error Problem Solving with Large Language Models,"Sijia Chen, Baochun Li, Di Niu","The reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on a wide range of problems critically relies on chain-of-thought prompting, which involves providing a few chain of thought demonstrations as exemplars in prompts. Recent work, e.g., Tree of Thoughts, has pointed out the importance of exploration and self-evaluation in reasoning step selection for complex problem solving. In this paper, we present Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), an automated prompting framework for problem solving with LLMs by iteratively exploring and self-evaluating many trees of thoughts in order to acquire an ensemble of trial-and-error reasoning experiences, which will serve as a new form of prompting to solve the complex problem. Starting from a simple prompt without requiring examples, BoT iteratively explores and evaluates a large collection of reasoning steps, and more importantly, uses error analysis obtained from the LLM on them to explicitly revise prompting, which in turn enhances reasoning step generation, until a final answer is attained. Our experiments with GPT-4 and Llama2 across extensive complex mathematical problems demonstrate that BoT consistently achieves higher or comparable problem-solving rates than other advanced prompting approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11140v2,2024-02
Contrastive Instruction Tuning,"Tianyi Lorena Yan, Fei Wang, James Y.

However, current LLMs exhibit limited robustness to unseen instructions, generating inconsistent outputs when the same instruction is phrased with slightly varied forms or language styles. This behavior indicates LLMs' lack of robustness to textual variations and generalizability to unseen instructions, potentially leading to trustworthiness issues. Accordingly, we propose Contrastive Instruction Tuning, which maximizes the similarity between the hidden representations of semantically equivalent instruction-instance pairs while minimizing the similarity between semantically different ones. To facilitate this approach, we augment the existing FLAN collection by paraphrasing task instructions.

Orca-Math: Unlocking the potential of SLMs in Grade School Math,"Arindam Mitra, Hamed Khanpour, Corby Rosset, Ahmed Awadallah","Mathematical word problem-solving has long been recognized as a complex task for small language models (SLMs). A recent study hypothesized that the smallest model size, needed to achieve over 80% accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark, is 34 billion parameters. To reach this level of performance with smaller models, researcher often train SLMs to generate Python code or use tools to help avoid calculation errors. Additionally, they employ ensembling, where outputs of up to 100 model runs are combined to arrive at a more accurate result. Result selection is done using consensus, majority vote or a separate a verifier model used in conjunction with the SLM. Ensembling provides a substantial boost in accuracy but at a significant cost increase with multiple calls to the model (e.g., Phi-GSM uses top-48 to boost the performance from 68.2 to 81.5).   In this work, we present Orca-Math, a 7-billion-parameter SLM based on the Mistral-7B, which achieves 86.81% on GSM8k without the need for multiple model calls or the use of verifiers, code execution or any other external tools. Our approach has the following key elements: (1) A high quality synthetic dataset of 200K math problems created using a multi-agent setup where agents collaborate to create the data, (2) An iterative learning techniques that enables the SLM to practice solving problems, receive feedback on its solutions and learn from preference pairs incorporating the SLM solutions and the feedback. When trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning alone, Orca-Math achieves 81.50% on GSM8k pass@1 metric. With iterative preference learning, Orca-Math achieves 86.81% pass@1.

We propose Speculative Streaming, a single-model speculative decoding method that fuses drafting into the target model by changing the fine-tuning objective from next token prediction to future n-gram prediction. Speculative Streaming speeds up decoding by 1.8 - 3.1X in a diverse set of tasks, such as Summarization, Structured Queries, and Meaning Representation, without sacrificing generation quality.

In this paper, we investigate the presence of socioeconomic bias, if any, in large language models. To this end, we introduce a novel dataset SilverSpoon, consisting of 3000 samples that illustrate hypothetical scenarios that involve underprivileged people performing ethically ambiguous actions due to their circumstances, and ask whether the action is ethically justified. Further, this dataset has a dual-labeling scheme and has been annotated by people belonging to both ends of the socioeconomic spectrum. Using SilverSpoon, we evaluate the degree of socioeconomic bias expressed in large language models and the variation of this degree as a function of model size. We also perform qualitative analysis to analyze the nature of this bias. Our analysis reveals that while humans disagree on which situations require empathy toward the underprivileged, most large language models are unable to empathize with the socioeconomically underprivileged regardless of the situation. To foster further research in this domain, we make SilverSpoon and our evaluation harness publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14633v4,2024-02
Navigating the Dual Facets: A Comprehensive Evaluation of Sequential Memory Editing in Large Language Models,"Zihao Lin, Mohammad Beigi, Hongxuan Li, Yufan Zhou, Yuxiang Zhang, Qifan Wang, Wenpeng Yin, Lifu Huang","Memory Editing (ME) has emerged as an efficient method to modify erroneous facts or inject new facts into Large Language Models (LLMs). Two mainstream ME methods exist: parameter-modifying ME and parameter-preserving ME (integrating extra modules while preserving original parameters). Regrettably, previous studies on ME evaluation have two critical limitations: (i) evaluating LLMs with single edit only, neglecting the need for continuous editing, and (ii) evaluations focusing solely on basic factual triples, overlooking broader LLM capabilities like logical reasoning and reading understanding. This study addresses these limitations with contributions threefold: (i) We explore how ME affects a wide range of fundamental capabilities of LLMs under sequential editing. Experimental results reveal an intriguing phenomenon: Most parameter-modifying ME consistently degrade performance across all tasks after a few sequential edits. In contrast, parameter-preserving ME effectively maintains LLMs' fundamental capabilities but struggles to accurately recall edited knowledge presented in a different format. (ii) We extend our evaluation to different editing settings, such as layers to edit, model size, instruction tuning, etc. Experimental findings indicate several strategies that can potentially mitigate the adverse effects of ME. (iii) We further explain why parameter-modifying ME damages LLMs from three dimensions: parameter changes after editing, language modeling capability, and the in-context learning capability. Our in-depth study advocates more careful use of ME in real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11122v1,2024-02
Whose Emotions and Moral Sentiments Do Language Models Reflect?,"Zihao He, Siyi Guo, Ashwin Rao, Kristina Lerman","Language models (LMs) are known to represent the perspectives of some social groups better than others, which may impact their performance, especially on subjective tasks such as content moderation and hate speech detection. To explore how LMs represent different perspectives, existing research focused on positional alignment, i.e., how closely the models mimic the opinions and stances of different groups, e.g., liberals or conservatives. However, human communication also encompasses emotional and moral dimensions. We define the problem of affective alignment, which measures how LMs' emotional and moral tone represents those of different groups. By comparing the affect of responses generated by 36 LMs to the affect of Twitter messages, we observe significant misalignment of LMs with both ideological groups. This misalignment is larger than the partisan divide in the U.S. Even after steering the LMs towards specific ideological perspectives, the misalignment and liberal tendencies of the model persist, suggesting a systemic bias within LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11114v2,2024-02
Language Models as Science Tutors,"Alexis Chevalier, Jiayi Geng, Alexander Wettig, Howard Chen, Sebastian Mizera, Toni Annala, Max Jameson Aragon, Arturo Rodríguez Fanlo, Simon Frieder, Simon Machado, Akshara Prabhakar, Ellie Thieu, Jiachen T. Wang, Zirui Wang, Xindi Wu, Mengzhou Xia, Wenhan Xia, Jiatong Yu, Jun-Jie Zhu, Zhiyong Jason Ren, Sanjeev Arora, Danqi Chen","NLP has recently made exciting progress toward training language models (LMs) with strong scientific problem-solving skills. However, model development has not focused on real-life use-cases of LMs for science, including applications in education that require processing long scientific documents. To address this, we introduce TutorEval and TutorChat. TutorEval is a diverse question-answering benchmark consisting of questions about long chapters from STEM textbooks, written by experts. TutorEval helps measure real-life usability of LMs as scientific assistants, and it is the first benchmark combining long contexts, free-form generation, and multi-disciplinary scientific knowledge. Moreover, we show that fine-tuning base models with existing dialogue datasets leads to poor performance on TutorEval. Therefore, we create TutorChat, a dataset of 80,000 long synthetic dialogues about textbooks. We use TutorChat to fine-tune Llemma models with 7B and 34B parameters. These LM tutors specialized in math have a 32K-token context window, and they excel at TutorEval while performing strongly on GSM8K and MATH. Our datasets build on open-source materials, and we release our models, data, and evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11111v2,2024-02
When LLMs Meet Cunning Texts: A Fallacy Understanding Benchmark for Large Language Models,"Yinghui Li, Qingyu Zhou, Yuanzhen Luo, Shirong Ma, Yangning Li, Hai-Tao Zheng, Xuming Hu, Philip S. Yu","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) make remarkable evolutions in language understanding and generation. Following this, various benchmarks for measuring all kinds of capabilities of LLMs have sprung up. In this paper, we challenge the reasoning and understanding abilities of LLMs by proposing a FaLlacy Understanding Benchmark (FLUB) containing cunning texts that are easy for humans to understand but difficult for models to grasp. Specifically, the cunning texts that FLUB focuses on mainly consist of the tricky, humorous, and misleading texts collected from the real internet environment. And we design three tasks with increasing difficulty in the FLUB benchmark to evaluate the fallacy understanding ability of LLMs. Based on FLUB, we investigate the performance of multiple representative and advanced LLMs, reflecting our FLUB is challenging and worthy of more future study. Interesting discoveries and valuable insights are achieved in our extensive experiments and detailed analyses. We hope that our benchmark can encourage the community to improve LLMs' ability to understand fallacies.

Regulating Large Language Models: A Roundtable Report,"Gabriel Nicholas, Paul Friedl","On July 20, 2023, a group of 27 scholars and digital rights advocates with expertise in law, computer science, political science, and other disciplines gathered for the Large Language Models, Law and Policy Roundtable, co-hosted by the NYU School of Law's Information Law Institute and the Center for Democracy & Technology. The roundtable convened to discuss how law and policy can help address some of the larger societal problems posed by large language models (LLMs). The discussion focused on three policy topic areas in particular:   1. Truthfulness: What risks do LLMs pose in terms of generating mis- and disinformation? How can these risks be mitigated from a technical and/or regulatory perspective?   2. Privacy: What are the biggest privacy risks involved in the creation, deployment, and use of LLMs? How can these risks be mitigated from a technical and/or regulatory perspective?   3. Market concentration: What threats do LLMs pose concerning market/power concentration? How can these risks be mitigated from a technical and/or regulatory perspective?   In this paper, we provide a detailed summary of the day's proceedings. We first recap what we deem to be the most important contributions made during the issue framing discussions.

Word Embeddings Revisited: Do LLMs Offer Something New?,"Matthew Freestone, Shubhra Kanti Karmaker Santu","Learning meaningful word embeddings is key to training a robust language model. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided us with many new word/sentence/document embedding models. Although LLMs have shown remarkable advancement in various NLP tasks, it is still unclear whether the performance improvement is merely because of scale or whether underlying embeddings they produce significantly differ from classical encoding models like Sentence-BERT (SBERT) or Universal Sentence Encoder (USE). This paper systematically investigates this issue by comparing classical word embedding techniques against LLM-based word embeddings in terms of their latent vector semantics. Our results show that LLMs tend to cluster semantically related words more tightly than classical models. LLMs also yield higher average accuracy on the Bigger Analogy Test Set (BATS) over classical methods. Finally, some LLMs tend to produce word embeddings similar to SBERT, a relatively lighter classical model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11094v2,2024-02
Model Editing by Standard Fine-Tuning,"Govind Gangadhar, Karl Stratos","Standard fine-tuning is considered not as effective as specialized methods for model editing due to its comparatively poor performance. However, it is simple, agnostic to the architectural details of the model being edited, and able to leverage advances in standard training techniques with no additional work (e.g., black-box PEFT for computational efficiency), making it an appealing choice for a model editor. In this work, we show that standard fine-tuning alone can yield competitive model editing performance with two minor modifications. First, we optimize the conditional likelihood rather than the full likelihood. Second, in addition to the typical practice of training on randomly paraphrased edit prompts to encourage generalization, we also train on random or similar unedited facts to encourage locality. Our experiments on the ZsRE and CounterFact datasets demonstrate that these simple modifications allow standard fine-tuning to match or outperform highly specialized editors in terms of edit score.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11078v3,2024-02
AFaCTA: Assisting the Annotation of Factual Claim Detection with Reliable LLM Annotators,"Jingwei Ni, Minjing Shi, Dominik Stammbach, Mrinmaya Sachan, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold","With the rise of generative AI, automated fact-checking methods to combat misinformation are becoming more and more important. However, factual claim detection, the first step in a fact-checking pipeline, suffers from two key issues that limit its scalability and generalizability: (1) inconsistency in definitions of the task and what a claim is, and (2) the high cost of manual annotation. To address (1), we review the definitions in related work and propose a unifying definition of factual claims that focuses on verifiability. To address (2), we introduce AFaCTA (Automatic Factual Claim deTection Annotator), a novel framework that assists in the annotation of factual claims with the help of large language models (LLMs). AFaCTA calibrates its annotation confidence with consistency along three predefined reasoning paths. Extensive evaluation and experiments in the domain of political speech reveal that AFaCTA can efficiently assist experts in annotating factual claims and training high-quality classifiers, and can work with or without expert supervision. Our analyses also result in PoliClaim, a comprehensive claim detection dataset spanning diverse political topics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11073v3,2024-02
Bridging Causal Discovery and Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Integrative Approaches and Future Directions,"Guangya Wan, Yuqi Wu, Mengxuan Hu, Zhixuan Chu, Sheng Li","Causal discovery (CD) and Large Language Models (LLMs) represent two emerging fields of study with significant implications for artificial intelligence. Despite their distinct origins, CD focuses on uncovering cause-effect relationships from data, and LLMs on processing and generating humanlike text, the convergence of these domains offers novel insights and methodologies for understanding complex systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the integration of LLMs, such as GPT4, into CD tasks. We systematically review and compare existing approaches that leverage LLMs for various CD tasks and highlight their innovative use of metadata and natural language to infer causal structures. Our analysis reveals the strengths and potential of LLMs in both enhancing traditional CD methods and as an imperfect expert, alongside the challenges and limitations inherent in current practices. Furthermore, we identify gaps in the literature and propose future research directions aimed at harnessing the full potential of LLMs in causality research. To our knowledge, this is the first survey to offer a unified and detailed examination of the synergy between LLMs and CD, setting the stage for future advancements in the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11068v1,2024-02
Persona-DB: Efficient Large Language Model Personalization for Response Prediction with Collaborative Data Refinement,"Chenkai Sun, Ke Yang, Revanth Gangi Reddy, Yi R. Fung, Hou Pong Chan, Kevin Small, ChengXiang Zhai, Heng Ji","The increasing demand for personalized interactions with large language models (LLMs) calls for methodologies capable of accurately and efficiently identifying user opinions and preferences. Retrieval augmentation emerges as an effective strategy, as it can accommodate a vast number of users without the costs from fine-tuning. Existing research, however, has largely focused on enhancing the retrieval stage and devoted limited exploration toward optimizing the representation of the database, a crucial aspect for tasks such as personalization. In this work, we examine the problem from a novel angle, focusing on how data can be better represented for more data-efficient retrieval in the context of LLM customization. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Persona-DB, a simple yet effective framework consisting of a hierarchical construction process to improve generalization across task contexts and collaborative refinement to effectively bridge knowledge gaps among users. In the evaluation of response prediction, Persona-DB demonstrates superior context efficiency in maintaining accuracy with a significantly reduced retrieval size, a critical advantage in scenarios with extensive histories or limited context windows. Our experiments also indicate a marked improvement of over 10% under cold-start scenarios, when users have extremely sparse data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the increasing importance of collaborative knowledge as the retrieval capacity expands.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11060v2,2024-02
II-MMR: Identifying and Improving Multi-modal Multi-hop Reasoning in Visual Question Answering,"Jihyung Kil, Farideh Tavazoee, Dongyeop Kang, Joo-Kyung Kim","Visual Question Answering (VQA) often involves diverse reasoning scenarios across Vision and Language (V&L). Most prior VQA studies, however, have merely focused on assessing the model's overall accuracy without evaluating it on different reasoning cases. Furthermore, some recent works observe that conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting fails to generate effective reasoning for VQA, especially for complex scenarios requiring multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we propose II-MMR, a novel idea to identify and improve multi-modal multi-hop reasoning in VQA. In specific, II-MMR takes a VQA question with an image and finds a reasoning path to reach its answer using two novel language promptings: (i) answer prediction-guided CoT prompt, or (ii) knowledge triplet-guided prompt. II-MMR then analyzes this path to identify different reasoning cases in current VQA benchmarks by estimating how many hops and what types (i.e., visual or beyond-visual) of reasoning are required to answer the question. On popular benchmarks including GQA and A-OKVQA, II-MMR observes that most of their VQA questions are easy to answer, simply demanding ""single-hop"" reasoning, whereas only a few questions require ""multi-hop"" reasoning. Moreover, while the recent V&L model struggles with such complex multi-hop reasoning questions even using the traditional CoT method, II-MMR shows its effectiveness across all reasoning cases in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11058v3,2024-02
Large Language Models Fall Short: Understanding Complex Relationships in Detective Narratives,"Runcong Zhao, Qinglin Zhu, Hainiu Xu, Jiazheng Li, Yuxiang Zhou, Yulan He, Lin Gui","Existing datasets for narrative understanding often fail to represent the complexity and uncertainty of relationships in real-life social scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, Conan, designed for extracting and analysing intricate character relation graphs from detective narratives. Specifically, we designed hierarchical relationship categories and manually extracted and annotated role-oriented relationships from the perspectives of various characters, incorporating both public relationships known to most characters and secret ones known to only a few. Our experiments with advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2 reveal their limitations in inferencing complex relationships and handling longer narratives. The combination of the Conan dataset and our pipeline strategy is geared towards understanding the ability of LLMs to comprehend nuanced relational dynamics in narrative contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11051v1,2024-02
Dense Passage Retrieval: Is it Retrieving?,"Benjamin Reichman, Larry Heck","Dense passage retrieval (DPR) is the first step in the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) paradigm for improving the performance of large language models (LLM). DPR fine-tunes pre-trained networks to enhance the alignment of the embeddings between queries and relevant textual data. A deeper understanding of DPR fine-tuning will be required to fundamentally unlock the full potential of this approach. In this work, we explore DPR-trained models mechanistically by using a combination of probing, layer activation analysis, and model editing. Our experiments show that DPR training decentralizes how knowledge is stored in the network, creating multiple access pathways to the same information. We also uncover a limitation in this training style: the internal knowledge of the pre-trained model bounds what the retrieval model can retrieve. These findings suggest a few possible directions for dense retrieval: (1) expose the DPR training process to more knowledge so more can be decentralized, (2) inject facts as decentralized representations, (3) model and incorporate knowledge uncertainty in the retrieval process, and (4) directly map internal model knowledge to a knowledge base.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11035v3,2024-02
PAT-Questions: A Self-Updating Benchmark for Present-Anchored Temporal Question-Answering,"Jannat Ara Meem, Muhammad Shihab Rashid, Yue Dong, Vagelis Hristidis","Existing work on Temporal Question Answering (TQA) has predominantly focused on questions anchored to specific timestamps or events (e.g. ""Who was the US president in 1970?""). Little work has studied questions whose temporal context is relative to the present time (e.g. ""Who was the previous US president?""). We refer to this problem as Present-Anchored Temporal QA (PATQA). PATQA poses unique challenges: (1) large language models (LLMs) may have outdated knowledge, (2) complex temporal relationships (e.g. 'before', 'previous') are hard to reason, (3) multi-hop reasoning may be required, and (4) the gold answers of benchmarks must be continuously updated. To address these challenges, we introduce the PAT-Questions benchmark, which includes single and multi-hop temporal questions. The answers in PAT-Questions can be automatically refreshed by re-running SPARQL queries on a knowledge graph, if available. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs and a SOTA temporal reasoning model (TEMPREASON-T5) on PAT-Questions through direct prompting and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The results highlight the limitations of existing solutions in PATQA and motivate the need for new methods to improve PATQA reasoning capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11034v2,2024-02
RLVF: Learning from Verbal Feedback without Overgeneralization,"Moritz Stephan, Alexander Khazatsky, Eric Mitchell, Annie S Chen, Sheryl Hsu, Archit Sharma, Chelsea Finn","The diversity of contexts in which large language models (LLMs) are deployed requires the ability to modify or customize default model behaviors to incorporate nuanced requirements and preferences. A convenient interface to specify such model adjustments is high-level verbal feedback, such as ""Don't use emojis when drafting emails to my boss."" However, while writing high-level feedback is far simpler than collecting annotations for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), we find that simply prompting a model with such feedback leads to overgeneralization of the feedback to contexts where it is not relevant. We study the problem of incorporating verbal feedback without such overgeneralization, inspiring a new method Contextualized Critiques with Constrained Preference Optimization (C3PO). C3PO uses a piece of high-level feedback to generate a small synthetic preference dataset specifying how the feedback should (and should not) be applied. It then fine-tunes the model in accordance with the synthetic preference data while minimizing the divergence from the original model for prompts where the feedback does not apply. Our experimental results indicate that our approach effectively applies verbal feedback to relevant scenarios while preserving existing behaviors for other contexts. For both human- and GPT-4-generated high-level feedback, C3PO effectively adheres to the given feedback comparably to in-context baselines while reducing overgeneralization by 30%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10893v1,2024-02
Proving membership in LLM pretraining data via data watermarks,"Johnny Tian-Zheng Wei, Ryan Yixiang Wang, Robin Jia","Detecting whether copyright holders' works were used in LLM pretraining is poised to be an important problem. This work proposes using data watermarks to enable principled detection with only black-box model access, provided that the rightholder contributed multiple training documents and watermarked them before public release. By applying a randomly sampled data watermark, detection can be framed as hypothesis testing, which provides guarantees on the false detection rate. We study two watermarks: one that inserts random sequences, and another that randomly substitutes characters with Unicode lookalikes. We first show how three aspects of watermark design -- watermark length, number of duplications, and interference -- affect the power of the hypothesis test. Next, we study how a watermark's detection strength changes under model and dataset scaling: while increasing the dataset size decreases the strength of the watermark, watermarks remain strong if the model size also increases. Finally, we view SHA hashes as natural watermarks and show that we can robustly detect hashes from BLOOM-176B's training data, as long as they occurred at least 90 times. Together, our results point towards a promising future for data watermarks in real world use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10892v3,2024-02
Instruction Diversity Drives Generalization To Unseen Tasks,"Dylan Zhang, Justin Wang, Francois Charton","Instruction tuning -- fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) on pairs of instructions and desired outcomes -- is an approach that enables pre-trained language models to perform real-world tasks and follow human instructions. Its practical success depends on the model learning a broader set of instructions than those it was trained on. Yet the factors that determine model generalization to such \emph{unseen tasks} are not well understood. %To understand the driving factors of generalization, In this paper, we experiment with string rewrites, a symbolic task that serves as a building block for Turing complete Markov algorithms while allowing experimental control of ""inputs"" and ""instructions"". We investigate the trade-off between the number of instructions the model is trained on and the number of training samples provided for each instruction and observe that the diversity of the instruction set determines generalization. Generalization emerges once a diverse enough set of tasks is provided, even though very few examples are provided for each task. Instruction diversity also ensures robustness with respect to non-uniform distributions of instructions in the training set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10891v1,2024-02
When is Tree Search Useful for LLM Planning? It Depends on the Discriminator,"Ziru Chen, Michael White, Raymond Mooney, Ali Payani, Yu Su, Huan Sun","In this paper, we examine how large language models (LLMs) solve multi-step problems under a language agent framework with three components: a generator, a discriminator, and a planning method. We investigate the practical utility of two advanced planning methods, iterative correction and tree search. We present a comprehensive analysis of how discrimination accuracy affects the overall performance of agents when using these two methods or a simpler method, re-ranking. Experiments on two tasks, text-to-SQL parsing and mathematical reasoning, show that: (1) advanced planning methods demand discriminators with at least 90% accuracy to achieve significant improvements over re-ranking; (2) current LLMs' discrimination abilities have not met the needs of advanced planning methods to achieve such improvements; (3) with LLM-based discriminators, advanced planning methods may not adequately balance accuracy and efficiency. For example, compared to the other two methods, tree search is at least 10--20 times slower but leads to negligible performance gains, which hinders its real-world applications.

Reviewer2: Optimizing Review Generation Through Prompt Generation,"Zhaolin Gao, Kianté Brantley, Thorsten Joachims","Recent developments in LLMs offer new opportunities for assisting authors in improving their work. In this paper, we envision a use case where authors can receive LLM-generated reviews that uncover weak points in the current draft. While initial methods for automated review generation already exist, these methods tend to produce reviews that lack detail, and they do not cover the range of opinions that human reviewers produce. To address this shortcoming, we propose an efficient two-stage review generation framework called Reviewer2. Unlike prior work, this approach explicitly models the distribution of possible aspects that the review may address. We show that this leads to more detailed reviews that better cover the range of aspects that human reviewers identify in the draft. As part of the research, we generate a large-scale review dataset of 27k papers and 99k reviews that we annotate with aspect prompts, which we make available as a resource for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10886v2,2024-02
Multi-modal Preference Alignment Remedies Degradation of Visual Instruction Tuning on Language Models,"Shengzhi Li, Rongyu Lin, Shichao Pei","Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to support multi-turn queries of interchanging image and text modalities in production. However, the current MLLMs trained with visual-question-answering (VQA) datasets could suffer from degradation, as VQA datasets lack the diversity and complexity of the original text instruction datasets with which the underlying language model was trained. To address this degradation, we first collect a lightweight, 5k-sample VQA preference dataset where answers were annotated by Gemini for five quality metrics in a granular fashion and investigate standard Supervised Fine-tuning, rejection sampling, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and SteerLM algorithms. Our findings indicate that with DPO, we can surpass the instruction-following capabilities of the language model, achieving a 6.73 score on MT-Bench, compared to Vicuna's 6.57 and LLaVA's 5.99. This enhancement in textual instruction-following capability correlates with boosted visual instruction performance (+4.9\% on MM-Vet, +6\% on LLaVA-Bench), with minimal alignment tax on visual knowledge benchmarks compared to the previous RLHF approach. In conclusion, we propose a distillation-based multi-modal alignment model with fine-grained annotations on a small dataset that restores and boosts MLLM's language capability after visual instruction tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10884v2,2024-02
Universal Prompt Optimizer for Safe Text-to-Image Generation,"Zongyu Wu, Hongcheng Gao, Yueze Wang, Xiang Zhang, Suhang Wang","Text-to-Image (T2I) models have shown great performance in generating images based on textual prompts. However, these models are vulnerable to unsafe input to generate unsafe content like sexual, harassment and illegal-activity images. Existing studies based on image checker, model fine-tuning and embedding blocking are impractical in real-world applications. Hence, we propose the first universal prompt optimizer for safe T2I (POSI) generation in black-box scenario. We first construct a dataset consisting of toxic-clean prompt pairs by GPT-3.5 Turbo. To guide the optimizer to have the ability of converting toxic prompt to clean prompt while preserving semantic information, we design a novel reward function measuring toxicity and text alignment of generated images and train the optimizer through Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that our approach can effectively reduce the likelihood of various T2I models in generating inappropriate images, with no significant impact on text alignment. It is also flexible to be combined with methods to achieve better performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/wu-zongyu/POSI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10882v6,2024-02
Exploring Value Biases: How LLMs Deviate Towards the Ideal,"Sarath Sivaprasad, Pramod Kaushik, Sahar Abdelnabi, Mario Fritz","Large-Language-Models (LLMs) are deployed in a wide range of applications, and their response has an increasing social impact. Understanding the non-deliberate(ive) mechanism of LLMs in giving responses is essential in explaining their performance and discerning their biases in real-world applications. This is analogous to human studies, where such inadvertent responses are referred to as sampling. We study this sampling of LLMs in light of value bias and show that the sampling of LLMs tends to favour high-value options. Value bias corresponds to this shift of response from the most likely towards an ideal value represented in the LLM. In fact, this effect can be reproduced even with new entities learnt via in-context prompting. We show that this bias manifests in unexpected places and has implications on relevant application scenarios, like choosing exemplars. The results show that value bias is strong in LLMs across different categories, similar to the results found in human studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11005v2,2024-02
EcoRank: Budget-Constrained Text Re-ranking Using Large Language Models,"Muhammad Shihab Rashid, Jannat Ara Meem, Yue Dong, Vagelis Hristidis","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in text re-ranking. This process includes queries and candidate passages in the prompts, utilizing pointwise, listwise, and pairwise prompting strategies. A limitation of these ranking strategies with LLMs is their cost: the process can become expensive due to API charges, which are based on the number of input and output tokens. We study how to maximize the re-ranking performance given a budget, by navigating the vast search spaces of prompt choices, LLM APIs, and budget splits. We propose a suite of budget-constrained methods to perform text re-ranking using a set of LLM APIs. Our most efficient method, called EcoRank, is a two-layered pipeline that jointly optimizes decisions regarding budget allocation across prompt strategies and LLM APIs. Our experimental results on four popular QA and passage reranking datasets show that EcoRank outperforms other budget-aware supervised and unsupervised baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10866v2,2024-02
Time Series Forecasting with LLMs: Understanding and Enhancing Model Capabilities,"Hua Tang, Chong Zhang, Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Zhenting Wang, Xiaobo Jin, Yongfeng Zhang, Mengnan Du","Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in many fields and have developed rapidly in recent years. As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10835v5,2024-02
ASGEA: Exploiting Logic Rules from Align-Subgraphs for Entity Alignment,"Yangyifei Luo, Zhuo Chen, Lingbing Guo, Qian Li, Wenxuan Zeng, Zhixin Cai, Jianxin Li","Entity alignment (EA) aims to identify entities across different knowledge graphs that represent the same real-world objects. Recent embedding-based EA methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in EA yet faced interpretability challenges as they purely rely on the embedding distance and neglect the logic rules behind a pair of aligned entities. In this paper, we propose the Align-Subgraph Entity Alignment (ASGEA) framework to exploit logic rules from Align-Subgraphs. ASGEA uses anchor links as bridges to construct Align-Subgraphs and spreads along the paths across KGs, which distinguishes it from the embedding-based methods. Furthermore, we design an interpretable Path-based Graph Neural Network, ASGNN, to effectively identify and integrate the logic rules across KGs. We also introduce a node-level multi-modal attention mechanism coupled with multi-modal enriched anchors to augment the Align-Subgraph. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of ASGEA over the existing embedding-based methods in both EA and Multi-Modal EA (MMEA) tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11000v2,2024-02
Using Hallucinations to Bypass GPT4's Filter,Benjamin Lemkin,"Large language models (LLMs) are initially trained on vast amounts of data, then fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); this also serves to teach the LLM to provide appropriate and safe responses. In this paper, we present a novel method to manipulate the fine-tuned version into reverting to its pre-RLHF behavior, effectively erasing the model's filters; the exploit currently works for GPT4, Claude Sonnet, and (to some extent) for Inflection-2.5. Unlike other jailbreaks (for example, the popular ""Do Anything Now"" (DAN) ), our method does not rely on instructing the LLM to override its RLHF policy; hence, simply modifying the RLHF process is unlikely to address it. Instead, we induce a hallucination involving reversed text during which the model reverts to a word bucket, effectively pausing the model's filter. We believe that our exploit presents a fundamental vulnerability in LLMs currently unaddressed, as well as an opportunity to better understand the inner workings of LLMs during hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04769v2,2024-02
Exploring Hybrid Question Answering via Program-based Prompting,"Qi Shi, Han Cui, Haofeng Wang, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che, Ting Liu","Question answering over heterogeneous data requires reasoning over diverse sources of data, which is challenging due to the large scale of information and organic coupling of heterogeneous data. Various approaches have been proposed to address these challenges. One approach involves training specialized retrievers to select relevant information, thereby reducing the input length. Another approach is to transform diverse modalities of data into a single modality, simplifying the task difficulty and enabling more straightforward processing. In this paper, we propose HProPro, a novel program-based prompting framework for the hybrid question answering task. HProPro follows the code generation and execution paradigm. In addition, HProPro integrates various functions to tackle the hybrid reasoning scenario. Specifically, HProPro contains function declaration and function implementation to perform hybrid information-seeking over data from various sources and modalities, which enables reasoning over such data without training specialized retrievers or performing modal transformations. Experimental results on two typical hybrid question answering benchmarks HybridQA and MultiModalQA demonstrate the effectiveness of HProPro: it surpasses all baseline systems and achieves the best performances in the few-shot settings on both datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10812v1,2024-02
Quantifying the Persona Effect in LLM Simulations,"Tiancheng Hu, Nigel Collier","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise in simulating human language and behavior. This study investigates how integrating persona variables-demographic, social, and behavioral factors-impacts LLMs' ability to simulate diverse perspectives. We find that persona variables account for <10% variance in annotations in existing subjective NLP datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating persona variables via prompting in LLMs provides modest but statistically significant improvements. Persona prompting is most effective in samples where many annotators disagree, but their disagreements are relatively minor. Notably, we find a linear relationship in our setting: the stronger the correlation between persona variables and human annotations, the more accurate the LLM predictions are using persona prompting. In a zero-shot setting, a powerful 70b model with persona prompting captures 81% of the annotation variance achievable by linear regression trained on ground truth annotations. However, for most subjective NLP datasets, where persona variables have limited explanatory power, the benefits of persona prompting are limited.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10811v2,2024-02
Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval: Memorizing Images in Multimodal Language Models for Retrieval and Beyond,"Yongqi Li, Wenjie Wang, Leigang Qu, Liqiang Nie, Wenjie Li, Tat-Seng Chua","The recent advancements in generative language models have demonstrated their ability to memorize knowledge from documents and recall knowledge to respond to user queries effectively. Building upon this capability, we propose to enable multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to memorize and recall images within their parameters. Given a user query for visual content, the MLLM is anticipated to ""recall"" the relevant image from its parameters as the response. Achieving this target presents notable challenges, including inbuilt visual memory and visual recall schemes within MLLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce a generative cross-modal retrieval framework, which assigns unique identifier strings to represent images and involves two training steps: learning to memorize and learning to retrieve. The first step focuses on training the MLLM to memorize the association between images and their respective identifiers. The latter step teaches the MLLM to generate the corresponding identifier of the target image, given the textual query input. By memorizing images in MLLMs, we introduce a new paradigm to cross-modal retrieval, distinct from previous discriminative approaches. The experiments demonstrate that the generative paradigm performs effectively and efficiently even with large-scale image candidate sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10805v1,2024-02
In Search of Needles in a 11M Haystack: Recurrent Memory Finds What LLMs Miss,"Yuri Kuratov, Aydar Bulatov, Petr Anokhin, Dmitry Sorokin, Artyom Sorokin, Mikhail Burtsev","This paper addresses the challenge of processing long documents using generative transformer models. To evaluate different approaches, we introduce BABILong, a new benchmark designed to assess model capabilities in extracting and processing distributed facts within extensive texts. Our evaluation, which includes benchmarks for GPT-4 and RAG, reveals that common methods are effective only for sequences up to $10^4$ elements. In contrast, fine-tuning GPT-2 with recurrent memory augmentations enables it to handle tasks involving up to $11\times 10^6$ elements. This achievement marks a substantial leap, as it is by far the longest input processed by any neural network model to date, demonstrating a significant improvement in the processing capabilities for long sequences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10790v2,2024-02
EdgeQAT: Entropy and Distribution Guided Quantization-Aware Training for the Acceleration of Lightweight LLMs on the Edge,"Xuan Shen, Zhenglun Kong, Changdi Yang, Zhaoyang Han, Lei Lu, Peiyan Dong, Cheng Lyu, Chih-hsiang Li, Xuehang Guo, Zhihao Shu, Wei Niu, Miriam Leeser, Pu Zhao, Yanzhi Wang","Despite the remarkable strides of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various fields, the wide applications of LLMs on edge devices are limited due to their massive parameters and computations. To address this, quantization is commonly adopted to generate lightweight LLMs with efficient computations and fast inference. However, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods dramatically degrade in quality when quantizing weights, activations, and KV cache together to below 8 bits. Besides, many Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) works quantize model weights, leaving the activations untouched, which do not fully exploit the potential of quantization for inference acceleration on the edge. In this paper, we propose EdgeQAT, the Entropy and Distribution Guided QAT for the optimization of lightweight LLMs to achieve inference acceleration on Edge devices. We first identify that the performance drop of quantization primarily stems from the information distortion in quantized attention maps, demonstrated by the different distributions in quantized query and key of the self-attention mechanism. Then, the entropy and distribution guided QAT is proposed to mitigate the information distortion. Moreover, we design a token importance-aware adaptive method to dynamically quantize the tokens with different bit widths for further optimization and acceleration. Our extensive experiments verify the substantial improvements with our framework across various datasets. Furthermore, we achieve an on-device speedup of up to 2.37x compared with its FP16 counterparts across multiple edge devices, signaling a groundbreaking advancement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10787v1,2024-02
A Condensed Transition Graph Framework for Zero-shot Link Prediction with Large Language Models,"Mingchen Li, Chen Ling, Rui Zhang, Liang Zhao","Zero-shot link prediction (ZSLP) on knowledge graphs aims at automatically identifying relations between given entities. Existing methods primarily employ auxiliary information to predict tail entity given head entity and its relation, yet face challenges due to the occasional unavailability of such detailed information and the inherent simplicity of predicting tail entities based on semantic similarities. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to predict unobserved relations between the head and tail entity in a zero-shot manner, their performance is still restricted due to the inability to leverage all the (exponentially many) paths' information between two entities, which are critical in collectively indicating their relation types. To address this, in this work, we introduce a Condensed Transition Graph Framework for Zero-Shot Link Prediction (CTLP), which encodes all the paths' information in linear time complexity to predict unseen relations between entities, attaining both efficiency and information preservation. Specifically, we design a condensed transition graph encoder with theoretical guarantees on its coverage, expressiveness, and efficiency. It is learned by a transition graph contrastive learning strategy. Subsequently, we design a soft instruction tuning to learn and map the all-path embedding to the input of LLMs. Experimental results show that our proposed CTLP method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard ZSLP datasets",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10779v2,2024-02
Enhancing ESG Impact Type Identification through Early Fusion and Multilingual Models,"Hariram Veeramani, Surendrabikram Thapa, Usman Naseem","In the evolving landscape of Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) impact assessment, the ML-ESG-2 shared task proposes identifying ESG impact types. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive system leveraging ensemble learning techniques, capitalizing on early and late fusion approaches. Our approach employs four distinct models: mBERT, FlauBERT-base, ALBERT-base-v2, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) incorporating Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features. Through extensive experimentation, we find that our early fusion ensemble approach, featuring the integration of LSA, TF-IDF, mBERT, FlauBERT-base, and ALBERT-base-v2, delivers the best performance. Our system offers a comprehensive ESG impact type identification solution, contributing to the responsible and sustainable decision-making processes vital in today's financial and corporate governance landscape.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10772v1,2024-02
How Reliable Are Automatic Evaluation Methods for Instruction-Tuned LLMs?,"Ehsan Doostmohammadi, Oskar Holmström, Marco Kuhlmann","Work on instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has used automatic methods based on text overlap and LLM judgments as cost-effective alternatives to human evaluation. In this paper, we perform a meta-evaluation of such methods and assess their reliability across a broad range of tasks. In evaluating how well automatic methods align with human evaluations, correlation metrics are the most commonly employed method despite their inherent limitations when dealing with ties and different scales. To address these shortcomings, we use Pairwise Accuracy as an alternative to standard correlation measures. We observe that while automatic evaluation methods can approximate human ratings under specific conditions, their validity is highly context-dependent. Specifically, the simple ROUGE-L metric correlates very well with human ratings for short-answer English tasks but is unreliable in free-form generation tasks and cross-lingual scenarios. The effectiveness of the more advanced method of using GPT-4 as a judge diminishes significantly if reference answers are not included in the prompt, which is the scenario where this method has the potential to provide the most value compared to other metrics. Our findings enhance the understanding of how automatic methods should be applied and interpreted when developing and evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10770v4,2024-02
Distillation Enhanced Generative Retrieval,"Yongqi Li, Zhen Zhang, Wenjie Wang, Liqiang Nie, Wenjie Li, Tat-Seng Chua","Generative retrieval is a promising new paradigm in text retrieval that generates identifier strings of relevant passages as the retrieval target. This paradigm leverages powerful generative language models, distinct from traditional sparse or dense retrieval methods. In this work, we identify a viable direction to further enhance generative retrieval via distillation and propose a feasible framework, named DGR. DGR utilizes sophisticated ranking models, such as the cross-encoder, in a teacher role to supply a passage rank list, which captures the varying relevance degrees of passages instead of binary hard labels; subsequently, DGR employs a specially designed distilled RankNet loss to optimize the generative retrieval model, considering the passage rank order provided by the teacher model as labels. This framework only requires an additional distillation step to enhance current generative retrieval systems and does not add any burden to the inference stage. We conduct experiments on four public datasets, and the results indicate that DGR achieves state-of-the-art performance among the generative retrieval methods. Additionally, DGR demonstrates exceptional robustness and generalizability with various teacher models and distillation losses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10769v1,2024-02
Inference to the Best Explanation in Large Language Models,"Dhairya Dalal, Marco Valentino, André Freitas, Paul Buitelaar","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have found success in real-world applications, their underlying explanatory process is still poorly understood. This paper proposes IBE-Eval, a framework inspired by philosophical accounts on Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) to advance the interpretation and evaluation of LLMs' explanations. IBE-Eval estimates the plausibility of natural language explanations through a combination of explicit logical and linguistic features including: consistency, parsimony, coherence, and uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on Causal Question Answering (CQA), where \textit{IBE-Eval} is tasked to select the most plausible causal explanation amongst competing ones generated by LLMs (i.e., GPT 3.5 and Llama 2). The experiments reveal that IBE-Eval can successfully identify the best explanation with up to 77\% accuracy ($\approx 27\%$ above random), improving upon a GPT 3.5-as-a-Judge baseline ($\approx+17\%$) while being intrinsically more efficient and interpretable. Additional analyses suggest that, despite model-specific variances, LLM-generated explanations tend to conform to IBE criteria and that IBE-Eval is significantly correlated with human judgment, opening up opportunities for future development of automated explanation verification tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10767v1,2024-02
ToolSword: Unveiling Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Tool Learning Across Three Stages,"Junjie Ye, Sixian Li, Guanyu Li, Caishuang Huang, Songyang Gao, Yilong Wu, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang","Tool learning is widely acknowledged as a foundational approach or deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world scenarios. While current research primarily emphasizes leveraging tools to augment LLMs, it frequently neglects emerging safety considerations tied to their application. To fill this gap, we present *ToolSword*, a comprehensive framework dedicated to meticulously investigating safety issues linked to LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, ToolSword delineates six safety scenarios for LLMs in tool learning, encompassing **malicious queries** and **jailbreak attacks** in the input stage, **noisy misdirection** and **risky cues** in the execution stage, and **harmful feedback** and **error conflicts** in the output stage. Experiments conducted on 11 open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal enduring safety challenges in tool learning, such as handling harmful queries, employing risky tools, and delivering detrimental feedback, which even GPT-4 is susceptible to. Moreover, we conduct further studies with the aim of fostering research on tool learning safety.

GenRES: Rethinking Evaluation for Generative Relation Extraction in the Era of Large Language Models,"Pengcheng Jiang, Jiacheng Lin, Zifeng Wang, Jimeng Sun, Jiawei Han","The field of relation extraction (RE) is experiencing a notable shift towards generative relation extraction (GRE), leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, we discovered that traditional relation extraction (RE) metrics like precision and recall fall short in evaluating GRE methods. This shortfall arises because these metrics rely on exact matching with human-annotated reference relations, while GRE methods often produce diverse and semantically accurate relations that differ from the references. To fill this gap, we introduce GenRES for a multi-dimensional assessment in terms of the topic similarity, uniqueness, granularity, factualness, and completeness of the GRE results. With GenRES, we empirically identified that (1) precision/recall fails to justify the performance of GRE methods; (2) human-annotated referential relations can be incomplete; (3) prompting LLMs with a fixed set of relations or entities can cause hallucinations. Next, we conducted a human evaluation of GRE methods that shows GenRES is consistent with human preferences for RE quality. Last, we made a comprehensive evaluation of fourteen leading LLMs using GenRES across document, bag, and sentence level RE datasets, respectively, to set the benchmark for future research in GRE",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10744v1,2024-02
Construction of a Syntactic Analysis Map for Yi Shui School through Text Mining and Natural Language Processing Research,"Hanqing Zhao, Yuehan Li","Entity and relationship extraction is a crucial component in natural language processing tasks such as knowledge graph construction, question answering system design, and semantic analysis. Most of the information of the Yishui school of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is stored in the form of unstructured classical Chinese text. The key information extraction of TCM texts plays an important role in mining and studying the academic schools of TCM. In order to solve these problems efficiently using artificial intelligence methods, this study constructs a word segmentation and entity relationship extraction model based on conditional random fields under the framework of natural language processing technology to identify and extract the entity relationship of traditional Chinese medicine texts, and uses the common weighting technology of TF-IDF information retrieval and data mining to extract important key entity information in different ancient books. The dependency syntactic parser based on neural network is used to analyze the grammatical relationship between entities in each ancient book article, and it is represented as a tree structure visualization, which lays the foundation for the next construction of the knowledge graph of Yishui school and the use of artificial intelligence methods to carry out the research of TCM academic schools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10743v1,2024-02
Let's Learn Step by Step: Enhancing In-Context Learning Ability with Curriculum Learning,"Yinpeng Liu, Jiawei Liu, Xiang Shi, Qikai Cheng, Yong Huang, Wei Lu","Demonstration ordering, which is an important strategy for in-context learning (ICL), can significantly affects the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, most of the current approaches of ordering require high computational costs to introduce the priori knowledge. In this paper, inspired by the human learning process, we propose a simple but effective demonstration ordering method for ICL, named the few-shot In-Context Curriculum Learning (ICCL). The ICCL implies gradually increasing the complexity of prompt demonstrations during the inference process. The difficulty can be assessed by human experts or LLMs-driven metrics, such as perplexity. Then we design extensive experiments to discuss the effectiveness of the ICCL at both corpus-level and instance-level. Moreover, we also investigate the formation mechanism of LLM's ICCL capability. Experimental results demonstrate that ICCL, developed during the instruction-tuning stage, is effective for representative open-source LLMs. To facilitate further research and applications by other scholars, we make the code publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10738v2,2024-02
Assessing the Reasoning Abilities of ChatGPT in the Context of Claim Verification,"John Dougrez-Lewis, Mahmud Elahi Akhter, Yulan He, Maria Liakata","The reasoning capabilities of LLMs are currently hotly debated. We examine the issue from the perspective of claim/rumour verification. We propose the first logical reasoning framework designed to break down any claim or rumour paired with evidence into the atomic reasoning steps necessary for verification. Based on our framework, we curate two annotated collections of such claim/evidence pairs: a synthetic dataset from Wikipedia and a real-world set stemming from rumours circulating on Twitter. We use them to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 (hereinafter referred to as ChatGPT) within the context of our framework, providing a thorough analysis. Our results show that ChatGPT struggles in abductive reasoning, although this can be somewhat mitigated by using manual Chain of Thought (CoT) as opposed to Zero-Shot (ZS) and ZS CoT approaches. Our study contributes to the growing body of research suggesting that ChatGPT's reasoning processes are unlikely to mirror human-like reasoning, and that LLMs need to be more rigorously evaluated to distinguish between hype and actual capabilities, especially in high-stakes real-world tasks such as claim verification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10735v2,2024-02
A Novel BERT-based Classifier to Detect Political Leaning of YouTube Videos based on their Titles,"Nouar AlDahoul, Talal Rahwan, Yasir Zaki","A quarter of US adults regularly get their news from YouTube. Yet, despite the massive political content available on the platform, to date no classifier has been proposed to identify the political leaning of YouTube videos. To fill this gap, we propose a novel classifier based on Bert -- a language model from Google -- to classify YouTube videos merely based on their titles into six categories, namely: Far Left, Left, Center, Anti-Woke, Right, and Far Right. We used a public dataset of 10 million YouTube video titles (under various categories) to train and validate the proposed classifier. We compare the classifier against several alternatives that we trained on the same dataset, revealing that our classifier achieves the highest accuracy (75%) and the highest F1 score (77%). To further validate the classification performance, we collect videos from YouTube channels of numerous prominent news agencies, such as Fox News and New York Times, which have widely known political leanings, and apply our classifier to their video titles. For the vast majority of cases, the predicted political leaning matches that of the news agency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04261v1,2024-02
"""Understanding AI"": Semantic Grounding in Large Language Models",Holger Lyre,"Do LLMs understand the meaning of the texts they generate? Do they possess a semantic grounding? And how could we understand whether and what they understand? I start the paper with the observation that we have recently witnessed a generative turn in AI, since generative models, including LLMs, are key for self-supervised learning. To assess the question of semantic grounding, I distinguish and discuss five methodological ways. The most promising way is to apply core assumptions of theories of meaning in philosophy of mind and language to LLMs. Grounding proves to be a gradual affair with a three-dimensional distinction between functional, social and causal grounding. LLMs show basic evidence in all three dimensions. A strong argument is that LLMs develop world models. Hence, LLMs are neither stochastic parrots nor semantic zombies, but already understand the language they generate, at least in an elementary sense.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10992v1,2024-02
An Empirical Study on Cross-lingual Vocabulary Adaptation for Efficient Language Model Inference,"Atsuki Yamaguchi, Aline Villavicencio, Nikolaos Aletras","The development of state-of-the-art generative large language models (LLMs) disproportionately relies on English-centric tokenizers, vocabulary and pre-training data. Despite the fact that some LLMs have multilingual capabilities, recent studies have shown that their inference efficiency deteriorates when generating text in languages other than English. This results in increased inference time and costs. Cross-lingual vocabulary adaptation (CVA) methods have been proposed for adapting models to a target language aiming to improve downstream performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods on increasing inference efficiency of generative LLMs has yet to be explored. In this paper, we perform an empirical study of five CVA methods on four generative LLMs (including monolingual and multilingual models) across four typologically-diverse languages and four natural language understanding tasks. We find that CVA substantially contributes to LLM inference speedups of up to 271.5\%. We also show that adapting LLMs that have been pre-trained on more balanced multilingual data results in downstream performance comparable to the original models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10712v3,2024-02
Rethinking Human-like Translation Strategy: Integrating Drift-Diffusion Model with Large Language Models for Machine Translation,"Hongbin Na, Zimu Wang, Mieradilijiang Maimaiti, Tong Chen, Wei Wang, Tao Shen, Ling Chen","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising potential in various downstream tasks, including machine translation. However, prior work on LLM-based machine translation has mainly focused on better utilizing training data, demonstrations, or pre-defined and universal knowledge to improve performance, with a lack of consideration of decision-making like human translators. In this paper, we incorporate Thinker with the Drift-Diffusion Model (Thinker-DDM) to address this issue. We then redefine the Drift-Diffusion process to emulate human translators' dynamic decision-making under constrained resources. We conduct extensive experiments under the high-resource, low-resource, and commonsense translation settings using the WMT22 and CommonMT datasets, in which Thinker-DDM outperforms baselines in the first two scenarios.

By conducting a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, the study reveals new insights into their performance on open-ended generation tasks, which are not adequately captured by traditional benchmarks. The findings highlight a trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated samples, particularly when models are fine-tuned on instruction dataset or with human feedback.

Python is Not Always the Best Choice: Embracing Multilingual Program of Thoughts,"Xianzhen Luo, Qingfu Zhu, Zhiming Zhang, Libo Qin, Xuanyu Zhang, Qing Yang, Dongliang Xu, Wanxiang Che","Program of Thoughts (PoT) is an approach characterized by its executable intermediate steps, which ensure the accuracy of the logical calculations in the reasoning process. Currently, PoT primarily uses Python. However, relying solely on a single language may result in suboptimal solutions and overlook the potential benefits of other programming languages. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive experiments on the programming languages used in PoT and find that no single language consistently delivers optimal performance across all tasks and models. The effectiveness of each language varies depending on the specific scenarios. Inspired by this, we propose a task and model agnostic approach called MultiPoT, which harnesses strength and diversity from various languages. Experimental results reveal that it significantly outperforms Python Self-Consistency. Furthermore, it achieves comparable or superior performance compared to the best monolingual PoT in almost all tasks across all models.

Cultural Commonsense Knowledge for Intercultural Dialogues,"Tuan-Phong Nguyen, Simon Razniewski, Gerhard Weikum","Despite recent progress, large language models (LLMs) still face the challenge of appropriately reacting to the intricacies of social and cultural conventions. This paper presents MANGO, a methodology for distilling high-accuracy, high-recall assertions of cultural knowledge. We judiciously and iteratively prompt LLMs for this purpose from two entry points, concepts and cultures. Outputs are consolidated via clustering and generative summarization. Running the MANGO method with GPT-3.5 as underlying LLM yields 167K high-accuracy assertions for 30K concepts and 11K cultures, surpassing prior resources by a large margin in quality and size. In an extrinsic evaluation for intercultural dialogues, we explore augmenting dialogue systems with cultural knowledge assertions. Notably, despite LLMs inherently possessing cultural knowledge, we find that adding knowledge from MANGO improves the overall quality, specificity, and cultural sensitivity of dialogue responses, as judged by human annotators.

Towards Uncovering How Large Language Model Works: An Explainability Perspective,"Haiyan Zhao, Fan Yang, Bo Shen, Himabindu Lakkaraju, Mengnan Du","Large language models (LLMs) have led to breakthroughs in language tasks, yet the internal mechanisms that enable their remarkable generalization and reasoning abilities remain opaque. This lack of transparency presents challenges such as hallucinations, toxicity, and misalignment with human values, hindering the safe and beneficial deployment of LLMs. This paper aims to uncover the mechanisms underlying LLM functionality through the lens of explainability. First, we review how knowledge is architecturally composed within LLMs and encoded in their internal parameters via mechanistic interpretability techniques. Then, we summarize how knowledge is embedded in LLM representations by leveraging probing techniques and representation engineering. Additionally, we investigate the training dynamics through a mechanistic perspective to explain phenomena such as grokking and memorization.

LongHeads: Multi-Head Attention is Secretly a Long Context Processor,"Yi Lu, Xin Zhou, Wei He, Jun Zhao, Tao Ji, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in numerous domains but often struggle to process lengthy inputs effectively and efficiently due to limited length generalization and attention's quadratic computational demands. Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently distributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts. LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that use relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k length on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending the usable context window for existing models.

Decomposition for Enhancing Attention: Improving LLM-based Text-to-SQL through Workflow Paradigm,"Yuanzhen Xie, Xinzhou Jin, Tao Xie, MingXiong Lin, Liang Chen, Chenyun Yu, Lei Cheng, ChengXiang Zhuo, Bo Hu, Zang Li","In-context learning of large-language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable success in the field of natural language processing, while extensive case studies reveal that the single-step chain-of-thought prompting approach faces challenges such as attention diffusion and inadequate performance in complex tasks like text-to-SQL. To improve the contextual learning capabilities of LLMs in text-to-SQL, a workflow paradigm method is proposed, aiming to enhance the attention and problem-solving scope of LLMs through decomposition. Specifically, the information determination module for eliminating redundant information and the brand-new prompt structure based on problem classification greatly enhance the model's attention. Additionally, the inclusion of self-correction and active learning modules greatly expands the problem-solving scope of LLMs, hence improving the upper limit of LLM-based approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other methods by a significant margin. About 2-3 percentage point improvements compared to the existing baseline on the Spider Dev, Spider-Realistic, and Bird Dev datasets and new SOTA results on the Spider Test dataset are achieved.

OpenFMNav: Towards Open-Set Zero-Shot Object Navigation via Vision-Language Foundation Models,"Yuxuan Kuang, Hai Lin, Meng Jiang","Object navigation (ObjectNav) requires an agent to navigate through unseen environments to find queried objects. Many previous methods attempted to solve this task by relying on supervised or reinforcement learning, where they are trained on limited household datasets with close-set objects. However, two key challenges are unsolved: understanding free-form natural language instructions that demand open-set objects, and generalizing to new environments in a zero-shot manner. Aiming to solve the two challenges, in this paper, we propose OpenFMNav, an Open-set Foundation Model based framework for zero-shot object Navigation. We first unleash the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to extract proposed objects from natural language instructions that meet the user's demand. We then leverage the generalizability of large vision language models (VLMs) to actively discover and detect candidate objects from the scene, building a Versatile Semantic Score Map (VSSM). Then, by conducting common sense reasoning on VSSM, our method can perform effective language-guided exploration and exploitation of the scene and finally reach the goal. By leveraging the reasoning and generalizing abilities of foundation models, our method can understand free-form human instructions and perform effective open-set zero-shot navigation in diverse environments.

Furthermore, we perform real robot demonstrations to validate our method's open-set-ness and generalizability to real-world environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10670v2,2024-02
Humans or LLMs as the Judge? A Study on Judgement Biases,"Guiming Hardy Chen, Shunian Chen, Ziche Liu, Feng Jiang, Benyou Wang","Adopting human and large language models (LLM) as judges (a.k.a human- and LLM-as-a-judge) for evaluating the performance of LLMs has recently gained attention. Nonetheless, this approach concurrently introduces potential biases from human and LLMs, questioning the reliability of the evaluation results. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that is free from referencing groundtruth annotations for investigating Misinformation Oversight Bias, Gender Bias, Authority Bias and Beauty Bias on LLM and human judges. We curate a dataset referring to the revised Bloom's Taxonomy and conduct thousands of evaluations. Results show that human and LLM judges are vulnerable to perturbations to various degrees, and that even the cutting-edge judges possess considerable biases. We further exploit these biases to conduct attacks on LLM judges. We hope that our work can notify the community of the bias and vulnerability of human- and LLM-as-a-judge, as well as the urgency of developing robust evaluation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10669v5,2024-02
MURRE: Multi-Hop Table Retrieval with Removal for Open-Domain Text-to-SQL,"Xuanliang Zhang, Dingzirui Wang, Longxu Dou, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che","The open-domain text-to-SQL task aims to retrieve question-relevant tables from massive databases and generate SQL. However, the performance of current methods is constrained by single-hop retrieval, and existing multi-hop retrieval of open-domain question answering is not directly applicable due to the tendency to retrieve tables similar to the retrieved ones but irrelevant to the question. Since the questions in text-to-SQL usually contain all required information, while previous multi-hop retrieval supplements the questions with retrieved documents. Therefore, we propose the multi-hop table retrieval with removal (MURRE), which removes previously retrieved information from the question to guide the retriever towards unretrieved relevant tables. Our experiments on two open-domain text-to-SQL datasets demonstrate an average improvement of 5.7% over the previous state-of-the-art results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10666v5,2024-02
Improving Demonstration Diversity by Human-Free Fusing for Text-to-SQL,"Dingzirui Wang, Longxu Dou, Xuanliang Zhang, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che","Currently, the in-context learning method based on large language models (LLMs) has become the mainstream of text-to-SQL research. Previous works have discussed how to select demonstrations related to the user question from a human-labeled demonstration pool. However, human labeling suffers from the limitations of insufficient diversity and high labeling overhead. Therefore, in this paper, we discuss how to measure and improve the diversity of the demonstrations for text-to-SQL. We present a metric to measure the diversity of the demonstrations and analyze the insufficient of the existing labeled data by experiments. Based on the above discovery, we propose fusing iteratively for demonstrations (Fused) to build a high-diversity demonstration pool through human-free multiple-iteration synthesis, improving diversity and lowering label cost. Our method achieves an average improvement of 3.2% and 5.0% with and without human labeling on several mainstream datasets, which proves the effectiveness of Fused.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10663v3,2024-02
Fine Tuning Named Entity Extraction Models for the Fantasy Domain,"Aravinth Sivaganeshan, Nisansa de Silva","Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sequence classification Natural Language Processing task where entities are identified in the text and classified into predefined categories. It acts as a foundation for most information extraction systems. Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is an open-ended tabletop fantasy game with its own diverse lore. DnD entities are domain-specific and are thus unrecognizable by even the state-of-the-art off-the-shelf NER systems as the NER systems are trained on general data for pre-defined categories such as: person (PERS), location (LOC), organization (ORG), and miscellaneous (MISC). For meaningful extraction of information from fantasy text, the entities need to be classified into domain-specific entity categories as well as the models be fine-tuned on a domain-relevant corpus. This work uses available lore of monsters in the D&D domain to fine-tune Trankit, which is a prolific NER framework that uses a pre-trained model for NER. Upon this training, the system acquires the ability to extract monster names from relevant domain documents under a novel NER tag. This work compares the accuracy of the monster name identification against; the zero-shot Trankit model and two FLAIR models. The fine-tuned Trankit model achieves an 87.86% F1 score surpassing all the other considered models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10662v1,2024-02
Network Formation and Dynamics Among Multi-LLMs,"Marios Papachristou, Yuan Yuan","Social networks fundamentally shape human opinions, behaviors, and the dissemination of information. As large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, and Llama increasingly integrate into social and professional settings, understanding their behavior in the context of social interactions and network formation becomes essential. This study develops a framework to systematically examine whether the network formation behaviors of multiple LLMs approximate certain aspects of human network dynamics. By simulating interactions among LLM agents across various model families, we observe that these models consistently exhibit key patterns associated with social network principles including preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and the small-world phenomenon when forming networks. Moreover, LLMs adapt their network formation strategies based on each network's characteristics, reflecting the context-dependent nature of human behavior: in Facebook networks, they prioritize triadic closure and homophily, mirroring close-knit friendships; in phone networks, homophily and preferential attachment dominate, capturing personal and professional connections, while in employment networks, LLMs favor heterophily and high-degree connections, aligning with career advancement dynamics. These results open new avenues for using LLMs in network science research, with potential applications in agent-based modeling and synthetic network generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10659v4,2024-02
Enhancing Numerical Reasoning with the Guidance of Reliable Reasoning Processes,"Dingzirui Wang, Longxu Dou, Xuanliang Zhang, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che","Numerical reasoning is an essential ability for NLP systems to handle numeric information. Recent research indicates that fine-tuning a small-scale model to learn generating reasoning processes alongside answers can significantly enhance performance. However, current methods have the limitation that most methods generate reasoning processes with large language models (LLMs), which are ""unreliable"" since such processes could contain information unrelated to the answer. To address this limitation, we introduce Enhancing NumeriCal reasOning with Reliable procEsses (Encore), which derives the reliable reasoning process by decomposing the answer formula, ensuring which fully supports the answer. Nevertheless, models could lack enough data to learn the reasoning process generation adequately, since our method generates only one single reasoning process for one formula. To overcome this difficulty, we present a series of pre-training tasks to help models learn the reasoning process generation with synthesized data. The experiments show that Encore yields improvement on all five experimental datasets with an average of 1.8%, proving the effectiveness of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10654v1,2024-02
AbsInstruct: Eliciting Abstraction Ability from LLMs through Explanation Tuning with Plausibility Estimation,"Zhaowei Wang, Wei Fan, Qing Zong, Hongming Zhang, Sehyun Choi, Tianqing Fang, Xin Liu, Yangqiu Song, Ginny Y. Wong, Simon See","Abstraction ability is crucial in human intelligence, which can also benefit various tasks in NLP study. Existing work shows that LLMs are deficient in abstract ability, and how to improve it remains unexplored. In this work, we design the framework AbsInstruct to enhance LLMs' abstraction ability through instruction tuning. The framework builds instructions with in-depth explanations to assist LLMs in capturing the underlying rationale of abstraction. Meanwhile, we introduce a plausibility estimator to select instructions that are more consistent with the abstraction knowledge of LLMs to be aligned. Then, our framework combines abstraction instructions with general-purpose ones to build a hybrid dataset. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our framework can considerably enhance LLMs' abstraction ability with strong generalization performance while maintaining their general instruction-following abilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10646v2,2024-02
Can Separators Improve Chain-of-Thought Prompting?,"Yoonjeong Park, Hyunjin Kim, Chanyeol Choi, Junseong Kim, Jy-yong Sohn","Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a simple and effective method for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The basic idea of CoT is to let LLMs break down their thought processes step-by-step by putting exemplars in the input prompt. However, the densely structured prompt exemplars of CoT may cause the cognitive overload of LLMs. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce COT-SEP, a method that strategically employs separators at the end of each exemplar in CoT prompting. These separators are designed to help the LLMs understand their thought processes better while reasoning. Interestingly, it turns out that COT-SEP significantly improves the LLMs' performances on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K, AQuA, CSQA), compared with the vanilla CoT, which does not use separators. We also study the effects of the type and the location of separators tested on multiple LLMs, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and LLaMA-2 7B.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10645v3,2024-02
Linear Transformers with Learnable Kernel Functions are Better In-Context Models,"Yaroslav Aksenov, Nikita Balagansky, Sofia Maria Lo Cicero Vaina, Boris Shaposhnikov, Alexey Gorbatovski, Daniil Gavrilov","Advancing the frontier of subquadratic architectures for Language Models (LMs) is crucial in the rapidly evolving field of natural language processing. Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10644v2,2024-02
`Keep it Together': Enforcing Cohesion in Extractive Summaries by Simulating Human Memory,"Ronald Cardenas, Matthias Galle, Shay B. Cohen","Extractive summaries are usually presented as lists of sentences with no expected cohesion between them. In this paper, we aim to enforce cohesion whilst controlling for informativeness and redundancy in summaries, in cases where the input exhibits high redundancy. The pipeline controls for redundancy in long inputs as it is consumed, and balances informativeness and cohesion during sentence selection. Our sentence selector simulates human memory to keep track of topics --modeled as lexical chains--, enforcing cohesive ties between noun phrases. Across a variety of domains, our experiments revealed that it is possible to extract highly cohesive summaries that nevertheless read as informative to humans as summaries extracted by only accounting for informativeness or redundancy. The extracted summaries exhibit smooth topic transitions between sentences as signaled by lexical chains, with chains spanning adjacent or near-adjacent sentences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10643v1,2024-02
Generalizability of Mixture of Domain-Specific Adapters from the Lens of Signed Weight Directions and its Application to Effective Model Pruning,"Tuc Nguyen, Thai Le","Several parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods based on adapters have been proposed as a streamlined approach to incorporate not only a single specialized knowledge into existing Pre-Trained Language Models (PLMs) but also multiple of them at once. Recent works such as AdapterSoup propose to mix not all but only a selective sub-set of domain-specific adapters during inference via model weight averaging to optimize performance on novel, unseen domains with excellent computational efficiency. However, the essential generalizability of this emerging weight-space adapter mixing mechanism on \textit{unseen, in-domain examples} remains unexplored. Thus, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to elucidate the generalizability of domain-specific adapter mixtures in in-domain evaluation. We also provide investigations into the inner workings of the mixture of domain-specific adapters by analyzing their weight signs, yielding critical analysis on the negative correlation between their fraction of weight sign difference and their mixtures' generalizability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10639v2,2024-02
BitDistiller: Unleashing the Potential of Sub-4-Bit LLMs via Self-Distillation,"Dayou Du, Yijia Zhang, Shijie Cao, Jiaqi Guo, Ting Cao, Xiaowen Chu, Ningyi Xu","The upscaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has yielded impressive advances in natural language processing, yet it also poses significant deployment challenges. Weight quantization has emerged as a widely embraced solution to reduce memory and computational demands. This paper introduces BitDistiller, a framework that synergizes Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with Knowledge Distillation (KD) to boost the performance of LLMs at ultra-low precisions (sub-4-bit). Specifically, BitDistiller first incorporates a tailored asymmetric quantization and clipping technique to maximally preserve the fidelity of quantized weights, and then proposes a novel Confidence-Aware Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CAKLD) objective, which is employed in a self-distillation manner to enable faster convergence and superior model performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that BitDistiller significantly surpasses existing methods in both 3-bit and 2-bit configurations on general language understanding and complex reasoning benchmarks. Notably, BitDistiller is shown to be more cost-effective, demanding fewer data and training resources.

Enhancing Role-playing Systems through Aggressive Queries: Evaluation and Improvement,"Yihong Tang, Jiao Ou, Che Liu, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has propelled dialogue generation into new realms, particularly in the field of role-playing systems (RPSs). While enhanced with ordinary role-relevant training dialogues, existing LLM-based RPSs still struggle to align with roles when handling intricate and trapped queries in boundary scenarios. In this paper, we design the Modular ORchestrated Trap-setting Interaction SystEm (MORTISE) to benchmark and improve the role-playing LLMs' performance. MORTISE can produce highly role-relevant aggressive queries through the collaborative effort of multiple LLM-based modules, and formulate corresponding responses to create an adversarial training dataset via a consistent response generator. We select 190 Chinese and English roles to construct aggressive queries to benchmark existing role-playing LLMs. Through comprehensive evaluation, we find that existing models exhibit a general deficiency in role alignment capabilities. We further select 180 of the roles to collect an adversarial training dataset (named RoleAD) and retain the other 10 roles for testing. Experiments on models improved by RoleAD indicate that our adversarial dataset ameliorates this deficiency, with the improvements demonstrating a degree of generalizability in ordinary scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10618v2,2024-02
Can LLMs Speak For Diverse People? Tuning LLMs via Debate to Generate Controllable Controversial Statements,"Ming Li, Jiuhai Chen, Lichang Chen, Tianyi Zhou","Making LLMs speak for different, especially minority groups of people, and generate statements supporting their diverse or even controversial perspectives is critical to creating an inclusive environment. However, existing LLMs lack sufficient controllability to the stance of their generated content, which often contains inconsistent, neutral, or biased statements. In this paper, we improve the controllability of LLMs in generating statements supporting an argument the user defined in the prompt. We find that multi-round debates between two LLMs with opposite stances generate higher-quality and more salient statements for each, which are important training data to improve the controllability of LLMs. Motivated by this, we develop a novel debate & tuning (DEBATUNE) pipeline finetuning LLMs to generate the statements obtained via debate. To examine DEBATUNE, we curate the largest dataset of debate topics so far, which covers 710 controversial topics and corresponding arguments for each topic. Evaluations by the GPT-4 judge with a novel controversy controllability metric show that LLMs' capability of generating diverse perspectives is significantly improved by DEBATUNE. Moreover, such controllability can be generalized to unseen topics, generating high-quality statements supporting controversial arguments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10614v2,2024-02
Retrieve Only When It Needs: Adaptive Retrieval Augmentation for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models,"Hanxing Ding, Liang Pang, Zihao Wei, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng","Hallucinations pose a significant challenge for the practical implementation of large language models (LLMs). The utilization of parametric knowledge in generating factual content is constrained by the limited knowledge of LLMs, potentially resulting in internal hallucinations. While incorporating external information can help fill knowledge gaps, it also introduces the risk of irrelevant information, thereby increasing the likelihood of external hallucinations. A careful and balanced integration of the parametric knowledge within LLMs with external information is crucial to alleviate hallucinations. In this study, we present Rowen, a novel approach that enhances LLMs with a selective retrieval augmentation process tailored to address hallucinated outputs. This process is governed by a multilingual semantic-aware detection module, which evaluates the consistency of the perturbed responses across various languages for the same queries. Upon detecting inconsistencies indicative of hallucinations, Rowen activates the retrieval of external information to rectify the model outputs. Rowen adeptly harmonizes the intrinsic parameters in LLMs with external knowledge sources, effectively mitigating hallucinations by ensuring a balanced integration of internal reasoning and external evidence. Through a comprehensive empirical analysis, we demonstrate that Rowen surpasses the current state-of-the-art in both detecting and mitigating hallucinated content within the outputs of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10612v2,2024-02
"When ""Competency"" in Reasoning Opens the Door to Vulnerability: Jailbreaking LLMs via Novel Complex Ciphers","Divij Handa, Zehua Zhang, Amir Saeidi, Chitta Baral","Recent advancements in the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) have primarily focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or in common encryption techniques like Base64. However, new models which often possess better reasoning capabilities, open the door to new attack vectors that were previously non-existent in older models. This seems counter-intuitive at first glance, but these advanced models can decipher more complex cryptic queries that previous models could not, making them susceptible to attacks using such prompts. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a novel method to jailbreak LLMs by leveraging custom encryption schemes. We evaluate the effectiveness of ACE on four state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving Attack Success Rates (ASR) of up to 66% on close-source models and 88% on open-source models. Building upon this, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE), which employs multiple layers of encryption through our custom ciphers to further enhance the ASR. Our findings demonstrate that LACE significantly enhances the ability to jailbreak LLMs, increasing the ASR of GPT-4o from 40% to 78%, a 38% improvement. Our results highlight that the advanced capabilities of LLMs introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities to complex attacks. Specifically complex and layered ciphers increase the chance of jailbreaking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10601v2,2024-02
Efficiency at Scale: Investigating the Performance of Diminutive Language Models in Clinical Tasks,"Niall Taylor, Upamanyu Ghose, Omid Rohanian, Mohammadmahdi Nouriborji, Andrey Kormilitzin, David Clifton, Alejo Nevado-Holgado","The entry of large language models (LLMs) into research and commercial spaces has led to a trend of ever-larger models, with initial promises of generalisability, followed by a widespread desire to downsize and create specialised models without the need for complete fine-tuning, using Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. We present an investigation into the suitability of different PEFT methods to clinical decision-making tasks, across a range of model sizes, including extremely small models with as few as $25$ million parameters.   Our analysis shows that the performance of most PEFT approaches varies significantly from one task to another, with the exception of LoRA, which maintains relatively high performance across all model sizes and tasks, typically approaching or matching full fine-tuned performance. The effectiveness of PEFT methods in the clinical domain is evident, particularly for specialised models which can operate on low-cost, in-house computing infrastructure. The advantages of these models, in terms of speed and reduced training costs, dramatically outweighs any performance gain from large foundation LLMs. Furthermore, we highlight how domain-specific pre-training interacts with PEFT methods and model size, and discuss how these factors interplay to provide the best efficiency-performance trade-off.

Do Llamas Work in English? On the Latent Language of Multilingual Transformers,"Chris Wendler, Veniamin Veselovsky, Giovanni Monea, Robert West","We ask whether multilingual language models trained on unbalanced, English-dominated corpora use English as an internal pivot language -- a question of key importance for understanding how language models function and the origins of linguistic bias. Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer models, our study uses carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique correct single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually map an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from which next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings through their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby intermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three phases operate in ""input space"", ""concept space"", and ""output space"", respectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract ""concept space"" lies closer to English than to other languages, which may have important consequences regarding the biases held by multilingual language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10588v4,2024-02
Threads of Subtlety: Detecting Machine-Generated Texts Through Discourse Motifs,"Zae Myung Kim, Kwang Hee Lee, Preston Zhu, Vipul Raheja, Dongyeop Kang","With the advent of large language models (LLM), the line between human-crafted and machine-generated texts has become increasingly blurred. This paper delves into the inquiry of identifying discernible and unique linguistic properties in texts that were written by humans, particularly uncovering the underlying discourse structures of texts beyond their surface structures. Introducing a novel methodology, we leverage hierarchical parse trees and recursive hypergraphs to unveil distinctive discourse patterns in texts produced by both LLMs and humans. Empirical findings demonstrate that, although both LLMs and humans generate distinct discourse patterns influenced by specific domains, human-written texts exhibit more structural variability, reflecting the nuanced nature of human writing in different domains. Notably, incorporating hierarchical discourse features enhances binary classifiers' overall performance in distinguishing between human-written and machine-generated texts, even on out-of-distribution and paraphrased samples. This underscores the significance of incorporating hierarchical discourse features in the analysis of text patterns.

LinkNER: Linking Local Named Entity Recognition Models to Large Language Models using Uncertainty,"Zhen Zhang, Yuhua Zhao, Hang Gao, Mengting Hu","Named Entity Recognition (NER) serves as a fundamental task in natural language understanding, bearing direct implications for web content analysis, search engines, and information retrieval systems. Fine-tuned NER models exhibit satisfactory performance on standard NER benchmarks. However, due to limited fine-tuning data and lack of knowledge, it performs poorly on unseen entity recognition. As a result, the usability and reliability of NER models in web-related applications are compromised. Instead, Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 possess extensive external knowledge, but research indicates that they lack specialty for NER tasks. Furthermore, non-public and large-scale weights make tuning LLMs difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that combines small fine-tuned models with LLMs (LinkNER) and an uncertainty-based linking strategy called RDC that enables fine-tuned models to complement black-box LLMs, achieving better performance. We experiment with both standard NER test sets and noisy social media datasets. LinkNER enhances NER task performance, notably surpassing SOTA models in robustness tests. We also quantitatively analyze the influence of key components like uncertainty estimation methods, LLMs, and in-context learning on diverse NER tasks, offering specific web-related recommendations.

Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset,"Afra Amini, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell","Direct preference optimization (DPO) is a successful fine-tuning strategy for aligning large language models with human preferences without the need to train a reward model or employ reinforcement learning. DPO, as originally formulated, relies on binary preference data and fine-tunes a language model to increase the likelihood of a preferred response over a dispreferred response. However, not all preference pairs are equal. Sometimes, the preferred response is only slightly better than the dispreferred one. In other cases, the preference is much stronger. For instance, if a response contains harmful or toxic content, the annotator will have a strong preference for that response. In this paper, we propose a generalization of DPO, termed DPO with an offset (ODPO), that does not treat every preference pair equally during fine-tuning. Intuitively, ODPO requires the difference between the likelihood of the preferred and dispreferred response to be greater than an offset value. The offset is determined based on the extent to which one response is preferred over another. Our experiments on various tasks suggest that ODPO significantly outperforms DPO in aligning language models, especially when the number of preference pairs is limited.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10571v2,2024-02

Despite their immense potential, these models have been proven to learn and exhibit societal biases and make unfair predictions. In this study, we explore the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform legal tasks in the Indian landscape when social factors are involved. We present a novel metric, $\beta$-weighted $\textit{Legal Safety Score ($LSS_{\beta}$)}$, which encapsulates both the fairness and accuracy aspects of the LLM. We assess LLMs' safety by considering its performance in the $\textit{Binary Statutory Reasoning}$ task and its fairness exhibition with respect to various axes of disparities in the Indian society. Task performance and fairness scores of LLaMA and LLaMA--2 models indicate that the proposed $LSS_{\beta}$ metric can effectively determine the readiness of a model for safe usage in the legal sector. We also propose finetuning pipelines, utilising specialised legal datasets, as a potential method to mitigate bias and improve model safety. The finetuning procedures on LLaMA and LLaMA--2 models increase the $LSS_{\beta}$, improving their usability in the Indian legal domain.

Neural paraphrasing by automatically crawled and aligned sentence pairs,"Achille Globo, Antonio Trevisi, Andrea Zugarini, Leonardo Rigutini, Marco Maggini, Stefano Melacci","Paraphrasing is the task of re-writing an input text using other words, without altering the meaning of the original content. Conversational systems can exploit automatic paraphrasing to make the conversation more natural, e.g., talking about a certain topic using different paraphrases in different time instants. Recently, the task of automatically generating paraphrases has been approached in the context of Natural Language Generation (NLG). While many existing systems simply consist in rule-based models, the recent success of the Deep Neural Networks in several NLG tasks naturally suggests the possibility of exploiting such networks for generating paraphrases. However, the main obstacle toward neural-network-based paraphrasing is the lack of large datasets with aligned pairs of sentences and paraphrases, that are needed to efficiently train the neural models. In this paper we present a method for the automatic generation of large aligned corpora, that is based on the assumption that news and blog websites talk about the same events using different narrative styles. We propose a similarity search procedure with linguistic constraints that, given a reference sentence, is able to locate the most similar candidate paraphrases out from millions of indexed sentences. The data generation process is evaluated in the case of the Italian language, performing experiments using pointer-based deep neural architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10558v1,2024-02
SPAR: Personalized Content-Based Recommendation via Long Engagement Attention,"Chiyu Zhang, Yifei Sun, Jun Chen, Jie Lei, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, Sinong Wang, Rong Jin, Sem Park, Ning Yao, Bo Long","Leveraging users' long engagement histories is essential for personalized content recommendations. The success of pretrained language models (PLMs) in NLP has led to their use in encoding user histories and candidate items, framing content recommendations as textual semantic matching tasks. However, existing works still struggle with processing very long user historical text and insufficient user-item interaction. In this paper, we introduce a content-based recommendation framework, SPAR, which effectively tackles the challenges of holistic user interest extraction from the long user engagement history. It achieves so by leveraging PLM, poly-attention layers and attention sparsity mechanisms to encode user's history in a session-based manner. The user and item side features are sufficiently fused for engagement prediction while maintaining standalone representations for both sides, which is efficient for practical model deployment. Moreover, we enhance user profiling by exploiting large language model (LLM) to extract global interests from user engagement history.

Addressing this gap, we introduce Disordered-DABS, a novel benchmark for dynamic aspect-based summarization tailored to unstructured text.

In this paper, we propose a conversational SimulMT framework to enhance the inference efficiency of LLM-based SimulMT through multi-turn-dialogue-based decoding. Our experiments with Llama2-7b-chat on two SimulMT benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LLM in translation quality while achieving comparable computational latency to specialized SimulMT models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10552v3,2024-02
Strong hallucinations from negation and how to fix them,"Nicholas Asher, Swarnadeep Bhar","Despite great performance on many tasks, language models (LMs) still struggle with reasoning, sometimes providing responses that cannot possibly be true because they stem from logical incoherence. We call such responses \textit{strong hallucinations} and prove that they follow from an LM's computation of its internal representations for logical operators and outputs from those representations. Focusing on negation, we provide a novel solution in which negation is treated not as another element of a latent representation, but as \textit{an operation over an LM's latent representations that constrains how they may evolve}. We show that our approach improves model performance in cloze prompting and natural language inference tasks with negation without requiring training on sparse negative data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10543v2,2024-02
Properties and Challenges of LLM-Generated Explanations,"Jenny Kunz, Marco Kuhlmann","The self-rationalising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been explored in restricted settings, using task/specific data sets. However, current LLMs do not (only) rely on specifically annotated data; nonetheless, they frequently explain their outputs. The properties of the generated explanations are influenced by the pre-training corpus and by the target data used for instruction fine-tuning. As the pre-training corpus includes a large amount of human-written explanations ""in the wild"", we hypothesise that LLMs adopt common properties of human explanations. By analysing the outputs for a multi-domain instruction fine-tuning data set, we find that generated explanations show selectivity and contain illustrative elements, but less frequently are subjective or misleading. We discuss reasons and consequences of the properties' presence or absence. In particular, we outline positive and negative implications depending on the goals and user groups of the self-rationalising system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10532v1,2024-02
Can We Verify Step by Step for Incorrect Answer Detection?,"Xin Xu, Shizhe Diao, Can Yang, Yang Wang","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has marked a significant advancement in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Previous studies have developed various extensions of CoT, which focus primarily on enhancing end-task performance. In addition, there has been research on assessing the quality of reasoning chains in CoT. This raises an intriguing question: Is it possible to predict the accuracy of LLM outputs by scrutinizing the reasoning chains they generate? To answer this research question, we introduce a benchmark, R2PE, designed specifically to explore the relationship between reasoning chains and performance in various reasoning tasks spanning five different domains. This benchmark aims to measure the falsehood of the final output of LLMs based on the reasoning steps. To make full use of information in multiple reasoning chains, we propose the process discernibility score (PDS) framework that beats the answer-checking baseline by a large margin. Concretely, this resulted in an average of $5.1\%$ increase in the F1 score and $2.97\%$ improvement in AUC-PR across all 45 subsets within R2PE. We further demonstrate our PDS's efficacy in advancing open-domain QA accuracy. Data and code are available at https://github.com/XinXU-USTC/R2PE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10528v2,2024-02
Assessing biomedical knowledge robustness in large language models by query-efficient sampling attacks,"R. Patrick Xian, Alex J. Lee, Satvik Lolla, Vincent Wang, Qiming Cui, Russell Ro, Reza Abbasi-Asl","The increasing depth of parametric domain knowledge in large language models (LLMs) is fueling their rapid deployment in real-world applications. Understanding model vulnerabilities in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive tasks is essential for quantifying the trustworthiness of model predictions and regulating their use. The recent discovery of named entities as adversarial examples (i.e. adversarial entities) in natural language processing tasks raises questions about their potential impact on the knowledge robustness of pre-trained and finetuned LLMs in high-stakes and specialized domains. We examined the use of type-consistent entity substitution as a template for collecting adversarial entities for billion-parameter LLMs with biomedical knowledge. To this end, we developed an embedding-space attack based on powerscaled distance-weighted sampling to assess the robustness of their biomedical knowledge with a low query budget and controllable coverage. Our method has favorable query efficiency and scaling over alternative approaches based on random sampling and blackbox gradient-guided search, which we demonstrated for adversarial distractor generation in biomedical question answering. Subsequent failure mode analysis uncovered two regimes of adversarial entities on the attack surface with distinct characteristics and we showed that entity substitution attacks can manipulate token-wise Shapley value explanations, which become deceptive in this setting. Our approach complements standard evaluations for high-capacity models and the results highlight the brittleness of domain knowledge in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10527v3,2024-02
LLM Comparator: Visual Analytics for Side-by-Side Evaluation of Large Language Models,"Minsuk Kahng, Ian Tenney, Mahima Pushkarna, Michael Xieyang Liu, James Wexler, Emily Reif, Krystal Kallarackal, Minsuk Chang, Michael Terry, Lucas Dixon","Automatic side-by-side evaluation has emerged as a promising approach to evaluating the quality of responses from large language models (LLMs). However, analyzing the results from this evaluation approach raises scalability and interpretability challenges. In this paper, we present LLM Comparator, a novel visual analytics tool for interactively analyzing results from automatic side-by-side evaluation. The tool supports interactive workflows for users to understand when and why a model performs better or worse than a baseline model, and how the responses from two models are qualitatively different. We iteratively designed and developed the tool by closely working with researchers and engineers at a large technology company. This paper details the user challenges we identified, the design and development of the tool, and an observational study with participants who regularly evaluate their models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10524v1,2024-02
Active Preference Optimization for Sample Efficient RLHF,"Nirjhar Das, Souradip Chakraborty, Aldo Pacchiano, Sayak Ray Chowdhury","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is pivotal in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. Although aligned generative models have shown remarkable abilities in various tasks, their reliance on high-quality human preference data creates a costly bottleneck in the practical application of RLHF. One primary reason is that current methods rely on uniformly picking prompt-generation pairs from a dataset of prompt-generations, to collect human feedback, resulting in sub-optimal alignment under a constrained budget, which highlights the criticality of adaptive strategies in efficient alignment. Recent works [Mehta et al., 2023, Muldrew et al., 2024] have tried to address this problem by designing various heuristics based on generation uncertainty. However, either the assumptions in [Mehta et al., 2023] are restrictive, or [Muldrew et al., 2024] do not provide any rigorous theoretical guarantee. To address these, we reformulate RLHF within contextual preference bandit framework, treating prompts as contexts, and develop an active-learning algorithm, $\textit{Active Preference Optimization}$ ($\texttt{APO}$), which enhances model alignment by querying preference data from the most important samples, achieving superior performance for small sample budget. We analyze the theoretical performance guarantees of $\texttt{APO}$ under the BTL preference model showing that the suboptimality gap of the policy learned via $\texttt{APO}$ scales as $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ for a budget of $T$. We also show that collecting preference data by choosing prompts randomly leads to a policy that suffers a constant sub-optimality. We perform detailed experimental evaluations on practical preference datasets to validate $\texttt{APO}$'s efficacy over the existing methods, establishing it as a sample-efficient and practical solution of alignment in a cost-effective and scalable manner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10500v2,2024-02
Comparing Hallucination Detection Metrics for Multilingual Generation,"Haoqiang Kang, Terra Blevins, Luke Zettlemoyer","While many hallucination detection techniques have been evaluated on English text, their effectiveness in multilingual contexts remains unknown. This paper assesses how well various factual hallucination detection metrics (lexical metrics like ROUGE and Named Entity Overlap, and Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based metrics) identify hallucinations in generated biographical summaries across languages. We compare how well automatic metrics correlate to each other and whether they agree with human judgments of factuality. Our analysis reveals that while the lexical metrics are ineffective, NLI-based metrics perform well, correlating with human annotations in many settings and often outperforming supervised models. However, NLI metrics are still limited, as they do not detect single-fact hallucinations well and fail for lower-resource languages. Therefore, our findings highlight the gaps in exisiting hallucination detection methods for non-English languages and motivate future research to develop more robust multilingual detection methods for LLM hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10496v2,2024-02
Emoji Driven Crypto Assets Market Reactions,"Xiaorui Zuo, Yao-Tsung Chen, Wolfgang Karl Härdle","In the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrency, social media platforms like Twitter have become pivotal in influencing market trends and investor sentiments. In our study, we leverage GPT-4 and a fine-tuned transformer-based BERT model for a multimodal sentiment analysis, focusing on the impact of emoji sentiment on cryptocurrency markets. By translating emojis into quantifiable sentiment data, we correlate these insights with key market indicators like BTC Price and the VCRIX index. Our architecture's analysis of emoji sentiment demonstrated a distinct advantage over FinBERT's pure text sentiment analysis in such predicting power. This approach may be fed into the development of trading strategies aimed at utilizing social media elements to identify and forecast market trends. Crucially, our findings suggest that strategies based on emoji sentiment can facilitate the avoidance of significant market downturns and contribute to the stabilization of returns. This research underscores the practical benefits of integrating advanced AI-driven analyses into financial strategies, offering a nuanced perspective on the interplay between digital communication and market dynamics in an academic context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10481v2,2024-02
Where is the answer? Investigating Positional Bias in Language Model Knowledge Extraction,"Kuniaki Saito, Kihyuk Sohn, Chen-Yu Lee, Yoshitaka Ushiku","Large language models require updates to remain up-to-date or adapt to new domains by fine-tuning them with new documents. One key is memorizing the latest information in a way that the memorized information is extractable with a query prompt. However, LLMs suffer from a phenomenon called perplexity curse; despite minimizing document perplexity during fine-tuning, LLMs struggle to extract information through a prompt sentence. In this new knowledge acquisition and extraction, we find a very intriguing fact that LLMs can accurately answer questions about the first sentence, but they struggle to extract information described in the middle or end of the documents used for fine-tuning. Our study suggests that the auto-regressive training causes this issue; each token is prompted by reliance on all previous tokens, which hinders the model from recalling information from training documents by question prompts. To conduct the in-depth study, we publish both synthetic and real datasets, enabling the evaluation of the QA performance w.r.t. the position of the corresponding answer in a document. Our investigation shows that even a large model suffers from the perplexity curse, but regularization such as denoising auto-regressive loss can enhance the information extraction from diverse positions. These findings will be (i) a key to improving knowledge extraction from LLMs and (ii) new elements to discuss the trade-off between RAG and fine-tuning in adapting LLMs to a new domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12170v2,2024-02
Large Language Models as Zero-shot Dialogue State Tracker through Function Calling,"Zekun Li, Zhiyu Zoey Chen, Mike Ross, Patrick Huber, Seungwhan Moon, Zhaojiang Lin, Xin Luna Dong, Adithya Sagar, Xifeng Yan, Paul A. Crook","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent in conversational systems due to their advanced understanding and generative capabilities in general contexts. However, their effectiveness in task-oriented dialogues (TOD), which requires not only response generation but also effective dialogue state tracking (DST) within specific tasks and domains, remains less satisfying. In this work, we propose a novel approach FnCTOD for solving DST with LLMs through function calling. This method improves zero-shot DST, allowing adaptation to diverse domains without extensive data collection or model tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves exceptional performance with both modestly sized open-source and also proprietary LLMs: with in-context prompting it enables various 7B or 13B parameter models to surpass the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) achieved by ChatGPT, and improves ChatGPT's performance beating the SOTA by 5.6% average joint goal accuracy (JGA). Individual model results for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are boosted by 4.8% and 14%, respectively. We also show that by fine-tuning on a small collection of diverse task-oriented dialogues, we can equip modestly sized models, specifically a 13B parameter LLaMA2-Chat model, with function-calling capabilities and DST performance comparable to ChatGPT while maintaining their chat capabilities. We have made the code publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/FnCTOD",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10466v4,2024-02
QDyLoRA: Quantized Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient Large Language Model Tuning,"Hossein Rajabzadeh, Mojtaba Valipour, Tianshu Zhu, Marzieh Tahaei, Hyock Ju Kwon, Ali Ghodsi, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh","Finetuning large language models requires huge GPU memory, restricting the choice to acquire Larger models. While the quantized version of the Low-Rank Adaptation technique, named QLoRA, significantly alleviates this issue, finding the efficient LoRA rank is still challenging. Moreover, QLoRA is trained on a pre-defined rank and, therefore, cannot be reconfigured for its lower ranks without requiring further fine-tuning steps. This paper proposes QDyLoRA -Quantized Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation-, as an efficient quantization approach for dynamic low-rank adaptation. Motivated by Dynamic LoRA, QDyLoRA is able to efficiently finetune LLMs on a set of pre-defined LoRA ranks. QDyLoRA enables fine-tuning Falcon-40b for ranks 1 to 64 on a single 32 GB V100-GPU through one round of fine-tuning. Experimental results show that QDyLoRA is competitive to QLoRA and outperforms when employing its optimal rank.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10462v1,2024-02
WilKE: Wise-Layer Knowledge Editor for Lifelong Knowledge Editing,"Chenhui Hu, Pengfei Cao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","Knowledge editing aims to rectify inaccuracies in large language models (LLMs) without costly retraining for outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, current knowledge editing methods primarily focus on single editing, failing to meet the requirements for lifelong editing. This study reveals a performance degradation encountered by knowledge editing in lifelong editing, characterized by toxicity buildup and toxicity flash, with the primary cause identified as pattern unmatch. We introduce a knowledge editing approach named Wise-Layer Knowledge Editor (WilKE), which selects editing layer based on the pattern matching degree of editing knowledge across different layers in language models.

Steering Conversational Large Language Models for Long Emotional Support Conversations,"Navid Madani, Sougata Saha, Rohini Srihari","In this study, we address the challenge of enabling large language models (LLMs) to consistently adhere to emotional support strategies in extended conversations. We focus on the steerability of the Llama-2 and Llama-3 suite of models, examining their ability to maintain these strategies throughout interactions. To assess this, we introduce the Strategy Relevant Attention (SRA) metric, which quantifies the model's adherence to the prompted strategy through attention maps. To facilitate our study, we create a strategy-conditioned synthetic conversational dataset derived from the ESConv dataset. We also propose various baselines informed by our proposed SRA metric to address the challenge and propose a fine-tuned model that significantly enhances the steerability of the base model in following the strategy throughout the conversation. The code and data are publicly available on our GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10453v2,2024-02
Incremental Sequence Labeling: A Tale of Two Shifts,"Shengjie Qiu, Junhao Zheng, Zhen Liu, Yicheng Luo, Qianli Ma","The incremental sequence labeling task involves continuously learning new classes over time while retaining knowledge of the previous ones. Our investigation identifies two significant semantic shifts: E2O (where the model mislabels an old entity as a non-entity) and O2E (where the model labels a non-entity or old entity as a new entity). Previous research has predominantly focused on addressing the E2O problem, neglecting the O2E issue. This negligence results in a model bias towards classifying new data samples as belonging to the new class during the learning process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Incremental Sequential Labeling without Semantic Shifts (IS3). Motivated by the identified semantic shifts (E2O and O2E), IS3 aims to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in models. As for the E2O problem, we use knowledge distillation to maintain the model's discriminative ability for old entities. Simultaneously, to tackle the O2E problem, we alleviate the model's bias towards new entities through debiased loss and optimization levels. Our experimental evaluation, conducted on three datasets with various incremental settings, demonstrates the superior performance of IS3 compared to the previous state-of-the-art method by a significant margin.The data, code, and scripts are publicly available at https://github.com/zzz47zzz/codebase-for-incremental-learning-with-llm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10447v2,2024-02
I Am Not Them: Fluid Identities and Persistent Out-group Bias in Large Language Models,"Wenchao Dong, Assem Zhunis, Hyojin Chin, Jiyoung Han, Meeyoung Cha","We explored cultural biases-individualism vs. collectivism-in ChatGPT across three Western languages (i.e., English, German, and French) and three Eastern languages (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). When ChatGPT adopted an individualistic persona in Western languages, its collectivism scores (i.e., out-group values) exhibited a more negative trend, surpassing their positive orientation towards individualism (i.e., in-group values). Conversely, when a collectivistic persona was assigned to ChatGPT in Eastern languages, a similar pattern emerged with more negative responses toward individualism (i.e., out-group values) as compared to collectivism (i.e., in-group values). The results indicate that when imbued with a particular social identity, ChatGPT discerns in-group and out-group, embracing in-group values while eschewing out-group values. Notably, the negativity towards the out-group, from which prejudices and discrimination arise, exceeded the positivity towards the in-group. The experiment was replicated in the political domain, and the results remained consistent. Furthermore, this replication unveiled an intrinsic Democratic bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), aligning with earlier findings and providing integral insights into mitigating such bias through prompt engineering. Extensive robustness checks were performed using varying hyperparameter and persona setup methods, with or without social identity labels, across other popular language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10436v1,2024-02
Smaller Language Models are capable of selecting Instruction-Tuning Training Data for Larger Language Models,"Dheeraj Mekala, Alex Nguyen, Jingbo Shang","Instruction-tuning language models has become a crucial step in aligning them for general use. Typically, this process involves extensive training on large datasets, incurring high training costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel training data selection based on the learning percentage of the samples. We assert that current language models possess the capability to autonomously select high-quality training data, leading to comparable or improved performance compared to training on the entire dataset. Our experiments span different-sized models, revealing that this characteristic holds for models ranging from 1B (small) to 13B (large) in size. Moreover, we demonstrate an interesting finding that the data hardness transfers across model sizes, and a smaller 350M model can effectively curate high-quality training data with hard samples for a larger 13B model, resulting in an equally or superior instruction-tuned model compared to training on the complete dataset. Utilizing open-sourced OPT and Llama-2 models up to 13B in size, two publicly available instruction-tuning training datasets and evaluated by both automatic metrics & humans, our paper introduces a novel approach to training data selection, showcasing a more efficient alternative.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10430v1,2024-02
Evaluating and Improving Continual Learning in Spoken Language Understanding,"Muqiao Yang, Xiang Li, Umberto Cappellazzo, Shinji Watanabe, Bhiksha Raj","Continual learning has emerged as an increasingly important challenge across various tasks, including Spoken Language Understanding (SLU). In SLU, its objective is to effectively handle the emergence of new concepts and evolving environments. The evaluation of continual learning algorithms typically involves assessing the model's stability, plasticity, and generalizability as fundamental aspects of standards. However, existing continual learning metrics primarily focus on only one or two of the properties. They neglect the overall performance across all tasks, and do not adequately disentangle the plasticity versus stability/generalizability trade-offs within the model. In this work, we propose an evaluation methodology that provides a unified evaluation on stability, plasticity, and generalizability in continual learning. By employing the proposed metric, we demonstrate how introducing various knowledge distillations can improve different aspects of these three properties of the SLU model. We further show that our proposed metric is more sensitive in capturing the impact of task ordering in continual learning, making it better suited for practical use-case scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10427v1,2024-02
DELL: Generating Reactions and Explanations for LLM-Based Misinformation Detection,"Herun Wan, Shangbin Feng, Zhaoxuan Tan, Heng Wang, Yulia Tsvetkov, Minnan Luo","Large language models are limited by challenges in factuality and hallucinations to be directly employed off-the-shelf for judging the veracity of news articles, where factual accuracy is paramount. In this work, we propose DELL that identifies three key stages in misinformation detection where LLMs could be incorporated as part of the pipeline: 1) LLMs could \emph{generate news reactions} to represent diverse perspectives and simulate user-news interaction networks; 2) LLMs could \emph{generate explanations} for proxy tasks (e.g., sentiment, stance) to enrich the contexts of news articles and produce experts specializing in various aspects of news understanding; 3) LLMs could \emph{merge task-specific experts} and provide an overall prediction by incorporating the predictions and confidence scores of varying experts. Extensive experiments on seven datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that DELL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.8\% in macro f1-score. Further analysis reveals that the generated reactions and explanations are greatly helpful in misinformation detection, while our proposed LLM-guided expert merging helps produce better-calibrated predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10426v2,2024-02
Understanding In-Context Learning with a Pelican Soup Framework,"Ting-Rui Chiang, Dani Yogatama","Many existing theoretical analyses of in-context learning for natural language processing are based on latent variable models that leaves gaps between theory and practice. We aim to close these gaps by proposing a theoretical framework, the Pelican Soup Framework. In this framework, we introduce (1) the notion of a common sense knowledge base, (2) a general formalism for natural language classification tasks, and the notion of (3) meaning association. Under this framework, we can establish a $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ loss bound for in-context learning, where $T$ is the number of example-label pairs in the demonstration. Compared with previous works, our bound reflects the effect of the choice of verbalizers and the effect of instruction tuning. An additional notion of \textit{atom concepts} makes our framework possible to explain the generalization to tasks unseen in the language model training data. Finally, we propose a toy setup, Calcutec, and a digit addition task that mimics types of distribution shifts a model needs to overcome to perform in-context learning. We also experiment with GPT2-Large on real-world NLP tasks. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of our framework to explain in-context learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10424v1,2024-02
Pushing the Limits of Zero-shot End-to-End Speech Translation,"Ioannis Tsiamas, Gerard I. Gállego, José A. R. Fonollosa, Marta R. Costa-jussà","Data scarcity and the modality gap between the speech and text modalities are two major obstacles of end-to-end Speech Translation (ST) systems, thus hindering their performance. Prior work has attempted to mitigate these challenges by leveraging external MT data and optimizing distance metrics that bring closer the speech-text representations. However, achieving competitive results typically requires some ST data. For this reason, we introduce ZeroSwot, a method for zero-shot ST that bridges the modality gap without any paired ST data. Leveraging a novel CTC compression and Optimal Transport, we train a speech encoder using only ASR data, to align with the representation space of a massively multilingual MT model. The speech encoder seamlessly integrates with the MT model at inference, enabling direct translation from speech to text, across all languages supported by the MT model. Our experiments show that we can effectively close the modality gap without ST data, while our results on MuST-C and CoVoST demonstrate our method's superiority over not only previous zero-shot models, but also supervised ones, achieving state-of-the-art results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10422v2,2024-02
Grounding Language about Belief in a Bayesian Theory-of-Mind,"Lance Ying, Tan Zhi-Xuan, Lionel Wong, Vikash Mansinghka, Joshua Tenenbaum","Despite the fact that beliefs are mental states that cannot be directly observed, humans talk about each others' beliefs on a regular basis, often using rich compositional language to describe what others think and know. What explains this capacity to interpret the hidden epistemic content of other minds? In this paper, we take a step towards an answer by grounding the semantics of belief statements in a Bayesian theory-of-mind: By modeling how humans jointly infer coherent sets of goals, beliefs, and plans that explain an agent's actions, then evaluating statements about the agent's beliefs against these inferences via epistemic logic, our framework provides a conceptual role semantics for belief, explaining the gradedness and compositionality of human belief attributions, as well as their intimate connection with goals and plans. We evaluate this framework by studying how humans attribute goals and beliefs while watching an agent solve a doors-and-keys gridworld puzzle that requires instrumental reasoning about hidden objects. In contrast to pure logical deduction, non-mentalizing baselines, and mentalizing that ignores the role of instrumental plans, our model provides a much better fit to human goal and belief attributions, demonstrating the importance of theory-of-mind for a semantics of belief.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10416v2,2024-02
Measuring and Reducing LLM Hallucination without Gold-Standard Answers,"Jiaheng Wei, Yuanshun Yao, Jean-Francois Ton, Hongyi Guo, Andrew Estornell, Yang Liu","LLM hallucination, i.e. generating factually incorrect yet seemingly convincing answers, is currently a major threat to the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs. The first step towards solving this complicated problem is to measure it. However, existing hallucination metrics require having a benchmark dataset with gold-standard answers, i.e. ""best"" or ""correct"" answers written by humans. Such requirements make hallucination measurement costly and prone to human errors. In this work, we propose Factualness Evaluations via Weighting LLMs (FEWL), an innovative hallucination metric that is specifically designed for the scenario when gold-standard answers are absent. FEWL leverages the answers from off-the-shelf LLMs that serve as a proxy of gold-standard answers. The key challenge is how to quantify the expertise of reference LLMs resourcefully. We show FEWL has certain theoretical guarantees and demonstrate empirically it gives more accurate hallucination measures than naively using reference LLMs. We also show how to leverage FEWL to reduce hallucination through both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Extensive experiment results on Truthful-QA, CHALE, and HaluEval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FEWL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10412v2,2024-02
Understanding Survey Paper Taxonomy about Large Language Models via Graph Representation Learning,"Jun Zhuang, Casey Kennington","As new research on Large Language Models (LLMs) continues, it is difficult to keep up with new research and models. To help researchers synthesize the new research many have written survey papers, but even those have become numerous. In this paper, we develop a method to automatically assign survey papers to a taxonomy. We collect the metadata of 144 LLM survey papers and explore three paradigms to classify papers within the taxonomy. Our work indicates that leveraging graph structure information on co-category graphs can significantly outperform the language models in two paradigms; pre-trained language models' fine-tuning and zero-shot/few-shot classifications using LLMs. We find that our model surpasses an average human recognition level and that fine-tuning LLMs using weak labels generated by a smaller model, such as the GCN in this study, can be more effective than using ground-truth labels, revealing the potential of weak-to-strong generalization in the taxonomy classification task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10409v1,2024-02
Chain of Logic: Rule-Based Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Sergio Servantez, Joe Barrow, Kristian Hammond, Rajiv Jain","Rule-based reasoning, a fundamental type of legal reasoning, enables us to draw conclusions by accurately applying a rule to a set of facts. We explore causal language models as rule-based reasoners, specifically with respect to compositional rules - rules consisting of multiple elements which form a complex logical expression. Reasoning about compositional rules is challenging because it requires multiple reasoning steps, and attending to the logical relationships between elements. We introduce a new prompting method, Chain of Logic, which elicits rule-based reasoning through decomposition (solving elements as independent threads of logic), and recomposition (recombining these sub-answers to resolve the underlying logical expression). This method was inspired by the IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) framework, a sequential reasoning approach used by lawyers. We evaluate chain of logic across eight rule-based reasoning tasks involving three distinct compositional rules from the LegalBench benchmark and demonstrate it consistently outperforms other prompting methods, including chain of thought and self-ask, using open-source and commercial language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10400v2,2024-02
Subgraph-level Universal Prompt Tuning,"Junhyun Lee, Wooseong Yang, Jaewoo Kang","In the evolving landscape of machine learning, the adaptation of pre-trained models through prompt tuning has become increasingly prominent. This trend is particularly observable in the graph domain, where diverse pre-training strategies present unique challenges in developing effective prompt-based tuning methods for graph neural networks. Previous approaches have been limited, focusing on specialized prompting functions tailored to models with edge prediction pre-training tasks. These methods, however, suffer from a lack of generalizability across different pre-training strategies. Recently, a simple prompt tuning method has been designed for any pre-training strategy, functioning within the input graph's feature space. This allows it to theoretically emulate any type of prompting function, thereby significantly increasing its versatility for a range of downstream applications. Nevertheless, the capacity of such simple prompts to fully grasp the complex contexts found in graphs remains an open question, necessitating further investigation. Addressing this challenge, our work introduces the Subgraph-level Universal Prompt Tuning (SUPT) approach, focusing on the detailed context within subgraphs. In SUPT, prompt features are assigned at the subgraph-level, preserving the method's universal capability. This requires extremely fewer tuning parameters than fine-tuning-based methods, outperforming them in 42 out of 45 full-shot scenario experiments with an average improvement of over 2.5%. In few-shot scenarios, it excels in 41 out of 45 experiments, achieving an average performance increase of more than 6.6%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10380v1,2024-02
DataDreamer: A Tool for Synthetic Data Generation and Reproducible LLM Workflows,"Ajay Patel, Colin Raffel, Chris Callison-Burch","Large language models (LLMs) have become a dominant and important tool for NLP researchers in a wide range of tasks. Today, many researchers use LLMs in synthetic data generation, task evaluation, fine-tuning, distillation, and other model-in-the-loop research workflows. However, challenges arise when using these models that stem from their scale, their closed source nature, and the lack of standardized tooling for these new and emerging workflows. The rapid rise to prominence of these models and these unique challenges has had immediate adverse impacts on open science and on the reproducibility of work that uses them.

BioMistral: A Collection of Open-Source Pretrained Large Language Models for Medical Domains,"Yanis Labrak, Adrien Bazoge, Emmanuel Morin, Pierre-Antoine Gourraud, Mickael Rouvier, Richard Dufour","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility in recent years, offering potential applications across specialized domains such as healthcare and medicine. Despite the availability of various open-source LLMs tailored for health contexts, adapting general-purpose LLMs to the medical domain presents significant challenges. In this paper, we introduce BioMistral, an open-source LLM tailored for the biomedical domain, utilizing Mistral as its foundation model and further pre-trained on PubMed Central. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of BioMistral on a benchmark comprising 10 established medical question-answering (QA) tasks in English. We also explore lightweight models obtained through quantization and model merging approaches. Our results demonstrate BioMistral's superior performance compared to existing open-source medical models and its competitive edge against proprietary counterparts. Finally, to address the limited availability of data beyond English and to assess the multilingual generalization of medical LLMs, we automatically translated and evaluated this benchmark into 7 other languages. This marks the first large-scale multilingual evaluation of LLMs in the medical domain. Datasets, multilingual evaluation benchmarks, scripts, and all the models obtained during our experiments are freely released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10373v3,2024-02
Can we Soft Prompt LLMs for Graph Learning Tasks?,"Zheyuan Liu, Xiaoxin He, Yijun Tian, Nitesh V. Chawla","Graph plays an important role in representing complex relationships in real-world applications such as social networks, biological data and citation networks. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various domains, which makes applying LLMs to graphs particularly appealing. However, directly applying LLMs to graph modalities presents unique challenges due to the discrepancy and mismatch between the graph and text modalities. Hence, to further investigate LLMs' potential for comprehending graph information, we introduce GraphPrompter, a novel framework designed to align graph information with LLMs via soft prompts. Specifically, GraphPrompter consists of two main components: a graph neural network to encode complex graph information and an LLM that effectively processes textual information. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets under node classification and link prediction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The GraphPrompter framework unveils the substantial capabilities of LLMs as predictors in graph-related tasks, enabling researchers to utilize LLMs across a spectrum of real-world graph scenarios more effectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10359v2,2024-02
Prompt-Based Bias Calibration for Better Zero/Few-Shot Learning of Language Models,"Kang He, Yinghan Long, Kaushik Roy","Prompt-based learning is susceptible to intrinsic bias present in pre-trained language models (LMs), leading to sub-optimal performance in prompt-based zero/few-shot settings. In this work, we propose a null-input prompting method to calibrate intrinsic bias encoded in pre-trained LMs. Different from prior efforts that address intrinsic bias primarily for social fairness and often involve excessive computational cost, our objective is to explore enhancing LMs' performance in downstream zero/few-shot learning while emphasizing the efficiency of intrinsic bias calibration. Specifically, we leverage a diverse set of auto-selected null-meaning inputs generated from GPT-4 to probe intrinsic bias of pre-trained LMs. Utilizing the bias-reflected probability distribution, we formulate a distribution disparity loss for bias calibration, where we exclusively update bias parameters ($0.1\%$ of total parameters) of LMs towards equal probability distribution. Experimental results show that the calibration promotes an equitable starting point for LMs while preserving language modeling abilities. Across a wide range of datasets, including sentiment analysis and topic classification, our method significantly improves zero/few-shot learning performance of LMs for both in-context learning and prompt-based fine-tuning (on average $9\%$ and $2\%$, respectively).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10353v2,2024-02
Analyzing the Roles of Language and Vision in Learning from Limited Data,"Allison Chen, Ilia Sucholutsky, Olga Russakovsky, Thomas L. Griffiths","Does language help make sense of the visual world? How important is it to actually see the world rather than having it described with words? These basic questions about the nature of intelligence have been difficult to answer because we only had one example of an intelligent system -- humans -- and limited access to cases that isolated language or vision. However, the development of sophisticated Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by artificial intelligence researchers offers us new opportunities to explore the contributions that language and vision make to learning about the world. We ablate components from the cognitive architecture of these models to identify their contributions to learning new tasks from limited data. We find that a language model leveraging all components recovers a majority of a VLM's performance, despite its lack of visual input, and that language seems to allow this by providing access to prior knowledge and reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19669v2,2024-02
Exploration-Driven Policy Optimization in RLHF: Theoretical Insights on Efficient Data Utilization,"Yihan Du, Anna Winnicki, Gal Dalal, Shie Mannor, R. Srikant","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved impressive empirical successes while relying on a small amount of human feedback. However, there is limited theoretical justification for this phenomenon. Additionally, most recent studies focus on value-based algorithms despite the recent empirical successes of policy-based algorithms. In this work, we consider an RLHF algorithm based on policy optimization (PO-RLHF). The algorithm is based on the popular Policy Cover-Policy Gradient (PC-PG) algorithm, which assumes knowledge of the reward function. In PO-RLHF, knowledge of the reward function is not assumed, and the algorithm uses trajectory-based comparison feedback to infer the reward function. We provide performance bounds for PO-RLHF with low query complexity, which provides insight into why a small amount of human feedback may be sufficient to achieve good performance with RLHF. A key novelty is a trajectory-level elliptical potential analysis, which bounds the reward estimation error when comparison feedback (rather than numerical reward observation) is given. We provide and analyze algorithms PG-RLHF and NN-PG-RLHF for two settings: linear and neural function approximation, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10342v2,2024-02
SportsMetrics: Blending Text and Numerical Data to Understand Information Fusion in LLMs,"Yebowen Hu, Kaiqiang Song, Sangwoo Cho, Xiaoyang Wang, Hassan Foroosh, Dong Yu, Fei Liu","Large language models hold significant potential for integrating various data types, such as text documents and database records, for advanced analytics. However, blending text and numerical data presents substantial challenges. LLMs need to process and cross-reference entities and numbers, handle data inconsistencies and redundancies, and develop planning capabilities such as building a working memory for managing complex data queries. In this paper, we introduce four novel tasks centered around sports data analytics to evaluate the numerical reasoning and information fusion capabilities of LLMs. These tasks involve providing LLMs with detailed, play-by-play sports game descriptions, then challenging them with adversarial scenarios such as new game rules, longer durations, scrambled narratives, and analyzing key statistics in game summaries. We conduct extensive experiments on NBA and NFL games to assess the performance of LLMs on these tasks. Our benchmark, SportsMetrics, introduces a new mechanism for assessing LLMs' numerical reasoning and fusion skills.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10979v2,2024-02
"The optimal placement of the head in the noun phrase. The case of demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun",Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho,"The word order of a sentence is shaped by multiple principles. The principle of syntactic dependency distance minimization is in conflict with the principle of surprisal minimization (or predictability maximization) in single head syntactic dependency structures: while the former predicts that the head should be placed at the center of the linear arrangement, the latter predicts that the head should be placed at one of the ends (either first or last). A critical question is when surprisal minimization (or predictability maximization) should surpass syntactic dependency distance minimization. In the context of single head structures, it has been predicted that this is more likely to happen when two conditions are met, i.e. (a) fewer words are involved and (b) words are shorter. Here we test the prediction on the noun phrase when it is composed of a demonstrative, a numeral, an adjective and a noun. We find that, across preferred orders in languages, the noun tends to be placed at one of the ends, confirming the theoretical prediction. We also show evidence of anti locality effects: syntactic dependency distances in preferred orders are longer than expected by chance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10311v8,2024-02
How to Discern Important Urgent News?,"Oleg Vasilyev, John Bohannon","We found that a simple property of clusters in a clustered dataset of news correlate strongly with importance and urgency of news (IUN) as assessed by LLM. We verified our finding across different news datasets, dataset sizes, clustering algorithms and embeddings. The found correlation should allow using clustering (as an alternative to LLM) for identifying the most important urgent news, or for filtering out unimportant articles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10302v1,2024-02
LAVE: LLM-Powered Agent Assistance and Language Augmentation for Video Editing,"Bryan Wang, Yuliang Li, Zhaoyang Lv, Haijun Xia, Yan Xu, Raj Sodhi","Video creation has become increasingly popular, yet the expertise and effort required for editing often pose barriers to beginners. In this paper, we explore the integration of large language models (LLMs) into the video editing workflow to reduce these barriers. Our design vision is embodied in LAVE, a novel system that provides LLM-powered agent assistance and language-augmented editing features. LAVE automatically generates language descriptions for the user's footage, serving as the foundation for enabling the LLM to process videos and assist in editing tasks. When the user provides editing objectives, the agent plans and executes relevant actions to fulfill them. Moreover, LAVE allows users to edit videos through either the agent or direct UI manipulation, providing flexibility and enabling manual refinement of agent actions. Our user study, which included eight participants ranging from novices to proficient editors, demonstrated LAVE's effectiveness. The results also shed light on user perceptions of the proposed LLM-assisted editing paradigm and its impact on users' creativity and sense of co-creation. Based on these findings, we propose design implications to inform the future development of agent-assisted content editing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10294v1,2024-02
Self-Play Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models for Text-to-Image Generation,"Huizhuo Yuan, Zixiang Chen, Kaixuan Ji, Quanquan Gu","Fine-tuning Diffusion Models remains an underexplored frontier in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially when compared with the remarkable progress made in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). While cutting-edge diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) and SDXL rely on supervised fine-tuning, their performance inevitably plateaus after seeing a certain volume of data. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to fine-tune diffusion models with human preference data, but it requires at least two images (""winner"" and ""loser"" images) for each text prompt. In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique called self-play fine-tuning for diffusion models (SPIN-Diffusion), where the diffusion model engages in competition with its earlier versions, facilitating an iterative self-improvement process. Our approach offers an alternative to conventional supervised fine-tuning and RL strategies, significantly improving both model performance and alignment. Our experiments on the Pick-a-Pic dataset reveal that SPIN-Diffusion outperforms the existing supervised fine-tuning method in aspects of human preference alignment and visual appeal right from its first iteration. By the second iteration, it exceeds the performance of RLHF-based methods across all metrics, achieving these results with less data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10210v1,2024-02
Recovering the Pre-Fine-Tuning Weights of Generative Models,"Eliahu Horwitz, Jonathan Kahana, Yedid Hoshen","The dominant paradigm in generative modeling consists of two steps: i) pre-training on a large-scale but unsafe dataset, ii) aligning the pre-trained model with human values via fine-tuning. This practice is considered safe, as no current method can recover the unsafe, pre-fine-tuning model weights. In this paper, we demonstrate that this assumption is often false. Concretely, we present Spectral DeTuning, a method that can recover the weights of the pre-fine-tuning model using a few low-rank (LoRA) fine-tuned models. In contrast to previous attacks that attempt to recover pre-fine-tuning capabilities, our method aims to recover the exact pre-fine-tuning weights. Our approach exploits this new vulnerability against large-scale models such as a personalized Stable Diffusion and an aligned Mistral.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10208v2,2024-02
Rewards-in-Context: Multi-objective Alignment of Foundation Models with Dynamic Preference Adjustment,"Rui Yang, Xiaoman Pan, Feng Luo, Shuang Qiu, Han Zhong, Dong Yu, Jianshu Chen","We consider the problem of multi-objective alignment of foundation models with human preferences, which is a critical step towards helpful and harmless AI systems. However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around 10% GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10207v6,2024-02
A StrongREJECT for Empty Jailbreaks,"Alexandra Souly, Qingyuan Lu, Dillon Bowen, Tu Trinh, Elvis Hsieh, Sana Pandey, Pieter Abbeel, Justin Svegliato, Scott Emmons, Olivia Watkins, Sam Toyer","Most jailbreak papers claim the jailbreaks they propose are highly effective, often boasting near-100% attack success rates. However, it is perhaps more common than not for jailbreak developers to substantially exaggerate the effectiveness of their jailbreaks. We suggest this problem arises because jailbreak researchers lack a standard, high-quality benchmark for evaluating jailbreak performance, leaving researchers to create their own. To create a benchmark, researchers must choose a dataset of forbidden prompts to which a victim model will respond, along with an evaluation method that scores the harmfulness of the victim model's responses. We show that existing benchmarks suffer from significant shortcomings and introduce the StrongREJECT benchmark to address these issues. StrongREJECT's dataset contains prompts that victim models must answer with specific, harmful information, while its automated evaluator measures the extent to which a response gives useful information to forbidden prompts. In doing so, the StrongREJECT evaluator achieves state-of-the-art agreement with human judgments of jailbreak effectiveness. Notably, we find that existing evaluation methods significantly overstate jailbreak effectiveness compared to human judgments and the StrongREJECT evaluator. We describe a surprising and novel phenomenon that explains this discrepancy: jailbreaks bypassing a victim model's safety fine-tuning tend to reduce its capabilities. Together, our findings underscore the need for researchers to use a high-quality benchmark, such as StrongREJECT, when developing new jailbreak attacks. We release the StrongREJECT code and data at https://strong-reject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10260v2,2024-02
Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Without Prompting,"Xuezhi Wang, Denny Zhou","In enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), prior research primarily focuses on specific prompting techniques such as few-shot or zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. These methods, while effective, often involve manually intensive prompt engineering. Our study takes a novel approach by asking: Can LLMs reason effectively without prompting? Our findings reveal that, intriguingly, CoT reasoning paths can be elicited from pre-trained LLMs by simply altering the \textit{decoding} process. Rather than conventional greedy decoding, we investigate the top-$k$ alternative tokens, uncovering that CoT paths are frequently inherent in these sequences. This approach not only bypasses the confounders of prompting but also allows us to assess the LLMs' \textit{intrinsic} reasoning abilities. Moreover, we observe that the presence of a CoT in the decoding path correlates with a higher confidence in the model's decoded answer. This confidence metric effectively differentiates between CoT and non-CoT paths. Extensive empirical studies on various reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed CoT-decoding effectively elicits reasoning capabilities from language models, which were previously obscured by standard greedy decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10200v2,2024-02
A Trembling House of Cards? Mapping Adversarial Attacks against Language Agents,"Lingbo Mo, Zeyi Liao, Boyuan Zheng, Yu Su, Chaowei Xiao, Huan Sun","Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have seen exploding development. Their capability of using language as a vehicle for thought and communication lends an incredible level of flexibility and versatility. People have quickly capitalized on this capability to connect LLMs to a wide range of external components and environments: databases, tools, the Internet, robotic embodiment, etc. Many believe an unprecedentedly powerful automation technology is emerging. However, new automation technologies come with new safety risks, especially for intricate systems like language agents. There is a surprisingly large gap between the speed and scale of their development and deployment and our understanding of their safety risks. Are we building a house of cards? In this position paper, we present the first systematic effort in mapping adversarial attacks against language agents. We first present a unified conceptual framework for agents with three major components: Perception, Brain, and Action. Under this framework, we present a comprehensive discussion and propose 12 potential attack scenarios against different components of an agent, covering different attack strategies (e.g., input manipulation, adversarial demonstrations, jailbreaking, backdoors). We also draw connections to successful attack strategies previously applied to LLMs. We emphasize the urgency to gain a thorough understanding of language agent risks before their widespread deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10196v1,2024-02
BitDelta: Your Fine-Tune May Only Be Worth One Bit,"James Liu, Guangxuan Xiao, Kai Li, Jason D. Lee, Song Han, Tri Dao, Tianle Cai","Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained in two phases: pre-training on large internet-scale datasets, and fine-tuning for downstream tasks. Given the higher computational demand of pre-training, it's intuitive to assume that fine-tuning adds less new information to the model, and is thus more compressible. We explore this assumption by decomposing the weights of fine-tuned models into their pre-trained components and an additional delta. We introduce a simple method, BitDelta, which successfully quantizes this delta down to 1 bit without compromising performance. This interesting finding not only highlights the potential redundancy of information added during fine-tuning, but also has significant implications for the multi-tenant serving and multi-tenant storage of fine-tuned models. By enabling the use of a single high-precision base model accompanied by multiple 1-bit deltas, BitDelta dramatically reduces GPU memory requirements by more than 10x, which can also be translated to enhanced generation latency in multi-tenant settings. We validate BitDelta through experiments across Llama-2 and Mistral model families, and on models up to 70B parameters, showcasing minimal performance degradation over all tested settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10193v3,2024-02
Uncertainty Quantification for In-Context Learning of Large Language Models,"Chen Ling, Xujiang Zhao, Xuchao Zhang, Wei Cheng, Yanchi Liu, Yiyou Sun, Mika Oishi, Takao Osaki, Katsushi Matsuda, Jie Ji, Guangji Bai, Liang Zhao, Haifeng Chen","In-context learning has emerged as a groundbreaking ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and revolutionized various fields by providing a few task-relevant demonstrations in the prompt. However, trustworthy issues with LLM's response, such as hallucination, have also been actively discussed. Existing works have been devoted to quantifying the uncertainty in LLM's response, but they often overlook the complex nature of LLMs and the uniqueness of in-context learning. In this work, we delve into the predictive uncertainty of LLMs associated with in-context learning, highlighting that such uncertainties may stem from both the provided demonstrations (aleatoric uncertainty) and ambiguities tied to the model's configurations (epistemic uncertainty). We propose a novel formulation and corresponding estimation method to quantify both types of uncertainties. The proposed method offers an unsupervised way to understand the prediction of in-context learning in a plug-and-play fashion. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the decomposition.

Reward Generalization in RLHF: A Topological Perspective,"Tianyi Qiu, Fanzhi Zeng, Jiaming Ji, Dong Yan, Kaile Wang, Jiayi Zhou, Yang Han, Josef Dai, Xuehai Pan, Yaodong Yang","Existing alignment methods share a common topology of information flow, where reward information is collected from humans, modeled with preference learning, and used to tune language models. However, this shared topology has not been systematically characterized, nor have its alternatives been thoroughly explored, leaving the problems of low data efficiency and unreliable generalization unaddressed. As a solution, we introduce a theoretical framework for investigating reward generalization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focusing on the topology of information flow at both macro and micro levels. At the macro level, we portray the RLHF information flow as an autoencoding process over behavior distributions, formalizing the RLHF objective of distributional consistency between human preference and model behavior. At the micro level, we present induced Bayesian networks as a theory of reward generalization in RLHF, introducing fine-grained dataset topologies into generalization bounds. Combining analysis on both levels, we propose reward modeling from tree-structured preference information. It is shown to reduce reward uncertainty by up to $\Theta(\log n/\log\log n)$ times compared to baselines, where $n$ is the dataset size. Validation on three NLP tasks shows that our tree-based reward model achieves an average win rate of 65% against baseline methods, thus improving reward generalization for free via topology design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10184v6,2024-02
Language Models with Conformal Factuality Guarantees,"Christopher Mohri, Tatsunori Hashimoto","Guaranteeing the correctness and factuality of language model (LM) outputs is a major open problem. In this work, we propose conformal factuality, a framework that can ensure high probability correctness guarantees for LMs by connecting language modeling and conformal prediction. We observe that the correctness of an LM output is equivalent to an uncertainty quantification problem, where the uncertainty sets are defined as the entailment set of an LM's output. Using this connection, we show that conformal prediction in language models corresponds to a back-off algorithm that provides high probability correctness guarantees by progressively making LM outputs less specific (and expanding the associated uncertainty sets). This approach applies to any black-box LM and requires very few human-annotated samples. Evaluations of our approach on closed book QA (FActScore, NaturalQuestions) and reasoning tasks (MATH) show that our approach can provide 80-90% correctness guarantees while retaining the majority of the LM's original output.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10978v1,2024-02
TDAG: A Multi-Agent Framework based on Dynamic Task Decomposition and Agent Generation,"Yaoxiang Wang, Zhiyong Wu, Junfeng Yao, Jinsong Su","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has inspired the development of LLM-based agents capable of addressing complex, real-world tasks. However, these agents often struggle during task execution due to methodological constraints, such as error propagation and limited adaptability. To address this issue, we propose a multi-agent framework based on dynamic Task Decomposition and Agent Generation (TDAG). This framework dynamically decomposes complex tasks into smaller subtasks and assigns each to a specifically generated subagent, thereby enhancing adaptability in diverse and unpredictable real-world tasks. Simultaneously, existing benchmarks often lack the granularity needed to evaluate incremental progress in complex, multi-step tasks. In response, we introduce ItineraryBench in the context of travel planning, featuring interconnected, progressively complex tasks with a fine-grained evaluation system. ItineraryBench is designed to assess agents' abilities in memory, planning, and tool usage across tasks of varying complexity. Our experimental results reveal that TDAG significantly outperforms established baselines, showcasing its superior adaptability and context awareness in complex task scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10178v1,2024-02
OpenMathInstruct-1: A 1.8 Million Math Instruction Tuning Dataset,"Shubham Toshniwal, Ivan Moshkov, Sean Narenthiran, Daria Gitman, Fei Jia, Igor Gitman","Recent work has shown the immense potential of synthetically generated datasets for training large language models (LLMs), especially for acquiring targeted skills. Current large-scale math instruction tuning datasets such as MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2024) and MAmmoTH (Yue et al., 2024) are constructed using outputs from closed-source LLMs with commercially restrictive licenses. A key reason limiting the use of open-source LLMs in these data generation pipelines has been the wide gap between the mathematical skills of the best closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, and the best open-source LLMs. Building on the recent progress in open-source LLMs, our proposed prompting novelty, and some brute-force scaling, we construct OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs. The dataset is constructed by synthesizing code-interpreter solutions for GSM8K and MATH, two popular math reasoning benchmarks, using the recently released and permissively licensed Mixtral model. Our best model, OpenMath-CodeLlama-70B, trained on a subset of OpenMathInstruct-1, achieves a score of 84.6% on GSM8K and 50.7% on MATH, which is competitive with the best gpt-distilled models.

"Unlocking Structure Measuring: Introducing PDD, an Automatic Metric for Positional Discourse Coherence","Yinhong Liu, Yixuan Su, Ehsan Shareghi, Nigel Collier","Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in aligning generated text with user intentions across various tasks. When it comes to long-form text generation, there has been a growing interest in generation from a discourse coherence perspective. However, existing lexical or semantic metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, BertScore cannot effectively capture the discourse coherence. The development of discourse-specific automatic evaluation methods for assessing the output of LLMs warrants greater focus and exploration.

Data Engineering for Scaling Language Models to 128K Context,"Yao Fu, Rameswar Panda, Xinyao Niu, Xiang Yue, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Yoon Kim, Hao Peng","We study the continual pretraining recipe for scaling language models' context lengths to 128K, with a focus on data engineering. We hypothesize that long context modeling, in particular \textit{the ability to utilize information at arbitrary input locations}, is a capability that is mostly already acquired through large-scale pretraining, and that this capability can be readily extended to contexts substantially longer than seen during training~(e.g., 4K to 128K) through lightweight continual pretraining on appropriate data mixture. We investigate the \textit{quantity} and \textit{quality} of the data for continual pretraining: (1) for quantity, we show that 500 million to 5 billion tokens are enough to enable the model to retrieve information anywhere within the 128K context; (2) for quality, our results equally emphasize \textit{domain balance} and \textit{length upsampling}. Concretely, we find that naively upsampling longer data on certain domains like books, a common practice of existing work, gives suboptimal performance, and that a balanced domain mixture is important. We demonstrate that continual pretraining of the full model on 1B-5B tokens of such data is an effective and affordable strategy for scaling the context length of language models to 128K. Our recipe outperforms strong open-source long-context models and closes the gap to frontier models like GPT-4 128K.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10171v1,2024-02
Knowledge-Infused LLM-Powered Conversational Health Agent: A Case Study for Diabetes Patients,"Mahyar Abbasian, Zhongqi Yang, Elahe Khatibi, Pengfei Zhang, Nitish Nagesh, Iman Azimi, Ramesh Jain, Amir M.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for diabetes management, facilitating their efficacy. However, current LLM-based approaches are limited by their dependence on general sources and lack of integration with domain-specific knowledge, leading to inaccurate responses. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-infused LLM-powered conversational health agent (CHA) for diabetic patients. We customize and leverage the open-source openCHA framework, enhancing our CHA with external knowledge and analytical capabilities. This integration involves two key components: 1) incorporating the American Diabetes Association dietary guidelines and the Nutritionix information and 2) deploying analytical tools that enable nutritional intake calculation and comparison with the guidelines. We compare the proposed CHA with GPT4. Our evaluation includes 100 diabetes-related questions on daily meal choices and assessing the potential risks associated with the suggested diet.

ControlLM: Crafting Diverse Personalities for Language Models,"Yixuan Weng, Shizhu He, Kang Liu, Shengping Liu, Jun Zhao","As language models continue to scale in size and capability, they display an array of emerging behaviors, both beneficial and concerning. This heightens the need to control model behaviors. We hope to be able to control the personality traits of language models at the inference-time so as to have various character features, on top of which the requirements of different types of tasks can be met. Personality is a higher-level and more abstract behavioral representation for language models. We introduce ControlLM, which leverages differential activation patterns, derived from contrasting behavioral prompts in the model's latent space, to influence the model's personality traits at inference. This approach allows for the precise, real-time adjustment of model behavior. First, we demonstrate ControlLM's capacity to elicit diverse persona behaviors without any training, while precision control allows personality traits to closely match average human values. Subsequently, we showcase improved reasoning and question answering through selective amplification of beneficial attributes like conscientiousness and friendliness. We hope that this work will inspire research on controlling human-like behaviors of language models and provide insights for future research.

To address these challenges, we introduce Task-Oriented Automatic Dialogs (TOAD), a novel and scalable TOD dataset along with its automatic generation pipeline. The TOAD dataset simulates realistic app context interaction and provide a variety of system response style options. Two aspects of system response styles are considered, verbosity level and users' expression mirroring. We benchmark TOAD on two response generation tasks, and the results show that modeling more verbose responses or responses without user expression mirroring is more challenging.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10137v3,2024-02
Selective Reflection-Tuning: Student-Selected Data Recycling for LLM Instruction-Tuning,"Ming Li, Lichang Chen, Jiuhai Chen, Shwai He, Jiuxiang Gu, Tianyi Zhou","Instruction tuning is critical to large language models (LLMs) for achieving better instruction following and task adaptation capabilities but its success heavily relies on the training data quality. Many recent methods focus on improving the data quality but often overlook the compatibility of the data with the student model being finetuned. This paper introduces Selective Reflection-Tuning, a novel paradigm that synergizes a teacher LLM's reflection and introspection for improving existing data quality with the data selection capability of the student LLM, to automatically refine existing instruction-tuning data. This teacher-student collaboration produces high-quality and student-compatible instruction-response pairs, resulting in sample-efficient instruction tuning and LLMs of superior performance. Selective Reflection-Tuning is a data augmentation and synthesis that generally improves LLM finetuning and self-improvement without collecting brand-new data.

Towards Reducing Diagnostic Errors with Interpretable Risk Prediction,"Denis Jered McInerney, William Dickinson, Lucy C. Flynn, Andrea C. Young, Geoffrey S. Young, Jan-Willem van de Meent, Byron C. Wallace","Many diagnostic errors occur because clinicians cannot easily access relevant information in patient Electronic Health Records (EHRs). In this work we propose a method to use LLMs to identify pieces of evidence in patient EHR data that indicate increased or decreased risk of specific diagnoses; our ultimate aim is to increase access to evidence and reduce diagnostic errors. In particular, we propose a Neural Additive Model to make predictions backed by evidence with individualized risk estimates at time-points where clinicians are still uncertain, aiming to specifically mitigate delays in diagnosis and errors stemming from an incomplete differential. To train such a model, it is necessary to infer temporally fine-grained retrospective labels of eventual ""true"" diagnoses. We do so with LLMs, to ensure that the input text is from before a confident diagnosis can be made. We use an LLM to retrieve an initial pool of evidence, but then refine this set of evidence according to correlations learned by the model. We conduct an in-depth evaluation of the usefulness of our approach by simulating how it might be used by a clinician to decide between a pre-defined list of differential diagnoses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10109v2,2024-02
Quantized Embedding Vectors for Controllable Diffusion Language Models,"Cheng Kang, Xinye Chen, Yong Hu, Daniel Novak","Improving the controllability, portability, and inference speed of diffusion language models (DLMs) is a key challenge in natural language generation. While recent research has shown significant success in complex text generation with language models, the memory and computational power are still very demanding and fall short of expectations, which naturally results in low portability and instability for the models. To mitigate these issues, numerous well-established methods were proposed for neural network quantization. To further enhance their portability of independent deployment as well as improve their stability evaluated by language perplexity, we propose a novel approach called the Quantized Embedding Controllable Diffusion Language Model (QE-CDLM). QE-CDLM builds upon the recent successful controllable DLMs by remodeling the task-specific embedding space via quantization. This leads to a gradient-based controller for the generation tasks, and more stable intermediate latent variables are obtained, which naturally brings in an accelerated convergence as well as better controllability. Additionally, the adaption fine-tuning method is employed to reduce tunable weights. Experimental results on five challenging fine-grained control tasks demonstrate that QE-CDLM compares favorably to existing methods in terms of quality and feasibility, achieving better perplexity and lightweight fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10107v1,2024-02
GeoEval: Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs and Multi-Modal Models on Geometry Problem-Solving,"Jiaxin Zhang, Zhongzhi Li, Mingliang Zhang, Fei Yin, Chenglin Liu, Yashar Moshfeghi","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal models (MMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities in problem-solving. Yet, their proficiency in tackling geometry math problems, which necessitates an integrated understanding of both textual and visual information, has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this gap, we introduce the GeoEval benchmark, a comprehensive collection that includes a main subset of 2,000 problems, a 750 problems subset focusing on backward reasoning, an augmented subset of 2,000 problems, and a hard subset of 300 problems. This benchmark facilitates a deeper investigation into the performance of LLMs and MMs in solving geometry math problems. Our evaluation of ten LLMs and MMs across these varied subsets reveals that the WizardMath model excels, achieving a 55.67\% accuracy rate on the main subset but only a 6.00\% accuracy on the hard subset. This highlights the critical need for testing models against datasets on which they have not been pre-trained. Additionally, our findings indicate that GPT-series models perform more effectively on problems they have rephrased, suggesting a promising method for enhancing model capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10104v2,2024-02
QUICK: Quantization-aware Interleaving and Conflict-free Kernel for efficient LLM inference,"Taesu Kim, Jongho Lee, Daehyun Ahn, Sarang Kim, Jiwoong Choi, Minkyu Kim, Hyungjun Kim","We introduce QUICK, a group of novel optimized CUDA kernels for the efficient inference of quantized Large Language Models (LLMs). QUICK addresses the shared memory bank-conflict problem of state-of-the-art mixed precision matrix multiplication kernels. Our method interleaves the quantized weight matrices of LLMs offline to skip the shared memory write-back after the dequantization. We demonstrate up to 1.91x speedup over existing kernels of AutoAWQ on larger batches and up to 1.94x throughput gain on representative LLM models on various NVIDIA GPU devices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10076v1,2024-02
Both Matter: Enhancing the Emotional Intelligence of Large Language Models without Compromising the General Intelligence,"Weixiang Zhao, Zhuojun Li, Shilong Wang, Yang Wang, Yulin Hu, Yanyan Zhao, Chen Wei, Bing Qin","Emotional Intelligence (EI), consisting of emotion perception, emotion cognition and emotion expression, plays the critical roles in improving user interaction experience for the current large language model (LLM) based conversational general AI assistants. Previous works mainly focus on raising the emotion perception ability of them via naive fine-tuning on EI-related classification or regression tasks. However, this leads to the incomplete enhancement of EI and catastrophic forgetting of the general intelligence (GI). To this end, we first introduce \textsc{EiBench}, a large-scale collection of EI-related tasks in the text-to-text formation with task instructions that covers all three aspects of EI, which lays a solid foundation for the comprehensive EI enhancement of LLMs. Then a novel \underline{\textbf{Mo}}dular \underline{\textbf{E}}motional \underline{\textbf{I}}ntelligence enhancement method (\textbf{MoEI}), consisting of Modular Parameter Expansion and intra-inter modulation, is proposed to comprehensively enhance the EI of LLMs without compromise their GI.

Towards Safer Large Language Models through Machine Unlearning,"Zheyuan Liu, Guangyao Dou, Zhaoxuan Tan, Yijun Tian, Meng Jiang","The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated their vast potential across various domains, attributed to their extensive pretraining knowledge and exceptional generalizability. However, LLMs often encounter challenges in generating harmful content when faced with problematic prompts. To address this problem, existing work attempted to implement a gradient ascent based approach to prevent LLMs from producing harmful output. While these methods can be effective, they frequently impact the model utility in responding to normal prompts. To address this gap, we introduce Selective Knowledge negation Unlearning (SKU), a novel unlearning framework for LLMs, designed to eliminate harmful knowledge while preserving utility on normal prompts. Specifically, SKU is consisted of two stages: harmful knowledge acquisition stage and knowledge negation stage. The first stage aims to identify and acquire harmful knowledge within the model, whereas the second is dedicated to remove this knowledge. SKU selectively isolates and removes harmful knowledge in model parameters, ensuring the model's performance remains robust on normal prompts. Our experiments conducted across various LLM architectures demonstrate that SKU identifies a good balance point between removing harmful information and preserving utility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10058v2,2024-02
UNDIAL: Self-Distillation with Adjusted Logits for Robust Unlearning in Large Language Models,"Yijiang River Dong, Hongzhou Lin, Mikhail Belkin, Ramon Huerta, Ivan Vulić","Mitigating the retention of sensitive or private information in large language models is essential for enhancing privacy and safety. Existing unlearning methods, like Gradient Ascent and Negative Preference Optimization, directly tune models to remove unwanted information. However, these methods often become unstable because they fine-tune by maximizing cross-entropy loss, which is the opposite of traditional loss minimization in learning. This reversal creates instability, especially on larger datasets, as the model struggles to balance unlearning with maintaining language capacity, leading to over-unlearning. In this paper, we introduce UnDIAL (Unlearning via Self-Distillation on Adjusted Logits), a novel and robust unlearning method. Our approach leverages self-distillation to adjust logits and selectively reduce the influence of targeted tokens. This technique ensures smooth convergence and avoids catastrophic forgetting, even in challenging unlearning tasks with large datasets and sequential unlearning requests. Extensive experiments show that UnDIAL can achieve both robustness in unlearning and scalability while maintaining stable training dynamics and resilience to hyperparameter tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10052v2,2024-02
SwissNYF: Tool Grounded LLM Agents for Black Box Setting,"Somnath Sendhil Kumar, Dhruv Jain, Eshaan Agarwal, Raunak Pandey","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced capabilities in function-calling, these advancements primarily rely on accessing the functions' responses. This methodology is practical for simpler APIs but faces scalability issues with irreversible APIs that significantly impact the system, such as a database deletion API. Similarly, processes requiring extensive time for each API call and those necessitating forward planning, like automated action pipelines, present complex challenges. Furthermore, scenarios often arise where a generalized approach is needed because algorithms lack direct access to the specific implementations of these functions or secrets to use them. Traditional tool planning methods are inadequate in these cases, compelling the need to operate within black-box environments. Unlike their performance in tool manipulation, LLMs excel in black-box tasks, such as program synthesis. Therefore, we harness the program synthesis capabilities of LLMs to strategize tool usage in black-box settings, ensuring solutions are verified prior to implementation. We introduce TOPGUN, an ingeniously crafted approach leveraging program synthesis for black box tool planning. Accompanied by SwissNYF, a comprehensive suite that integrates black-box algorithms for planning and verification tasks, addressing the aforementioned challenges and enhancing the versatility and effectiveness of LLMs in complex API interactions.

RS-DPO: A Hybrid Rejection Sampling and Direct Preference Optimization Method for Alignment of Large Language Models,"Saeed Khaki, JinJin Li, Lan Ma, Liu Yang, Prathap Ramachandra","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been extensively employed to align large language models with user intent. However, proximal policy optimization (PPO) based RLHF is occasionally unstable requiring significant hyperparameter finetuning, and computationally expensive to maximize the estimated reward during alignment. Recently, direct preference optimization (DPO) is proposed to address those challenges. However, DPO relies on contrastive responses generated from human annotator and alternative LLM, instead of the policy model, limiting the effectiveness of the RLHF. In this paper, we addresses both challenges by systematically combining rejection sampling (RS) and DPO. Our proposed method, RS-DPO, initiates with the development of a supervised fine-tuned policy model (SFT). A varied set of k responses per prompt are sampled directly from the SFT model. RS-DPO identifies pairs of contrastive samples based on their reward distribution. Finally, we apply DPO with the contrastive samples to align the model to human preference. Our experiments indicate that our proposed method effectively fine-tunes LLMs with limited resource environments, leading to improved alignment with user intent. Furthermore, it outperforms existing methods, including RS, PPO, and DPO.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10038v2,2024-02
Self-Augmented In-Context Learning for Unsupervised Word Translation,"Yaoyiran Li, Anna Korhonen, Ivan Vulić","Recent work has shown that, while large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong word translation or bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) capabilities in few-shot setups, they still cannot match the performance of 'traditional' mapping-based approaches in the unsupervised scenario where no seed translation pairs are available, especially for lower-resource languages. To address this challenge with LLMs, we propose self-augmented in-context learning (SAIL) for unsupervised BLI: starting from a zero-shot prompt, SAIL iteratively induces a set of high-confidence word translation pairs for in-context learning (ICL) from an LLM, which it then reapplies to the same LLM in the ICL fashion. Our method shows substantial gains over zero-shot prompting of LLMs on two established BLI benchmarks spanning a wide range of language pairs, also outperforming mapping-based baselines across the board. In addition to achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised BLI performance, we also conduct comprehensive analyses on SAIL and discuss its limitations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10024v2,2024-02
Bridging the Empirical-Theoretical Gap in Neural Network Formal Language Learning Using Minimum Description Length,"Nur Lan, Emmanuel Chemla, Roni Katzir","Neural networks offer good approximation to many tasks but consistently fail to reach perfect generalization, even when theoretical work shows that such perfect solutions can be expressed by certain architectures. Using the task of formal language learning, we focus on one simple formal language and show that the theoretically correct solution is in fact not an optimum of commonly used objectives -- even with regularization techniques that according to common wisdom should lead to simple weights and good generalization (L1, L2) or other meta-heuristics (early-stopping, dropout). On the other hand, replacing standard targets with the Minimum Description Length objective (MDL) results in the correct solution being an optimum.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10013v2,2024-02
Neural Information Organizing and Processing -- Neural Machines,Iosif Iulian Petrila,"The informational synthesis of neural structures, processes, parameters and characteristics that allow a unified description and modeling as neural machines of natural and artificial neural systems is presented. The general informational parameters as the global quantitative measure of the neural systems computing potential as absolute and relative neural power were proposed. Neural information organizing and processing follows the way in which nature manages neural information by developing functions, functionalities and circuits related to different internal or peripheral components and also to the whole system through a non-deterministic memorization, fragmentation and aggregation of afferent and efferent information, deep neural information processing representing multiple alternations of fragmentation and aggregation stages. The relevant neural characteristics were integrated into a neural machine type model that incorporates unitary also peripheral or interface components as the central ones. The proposed approach allows overcoming the technical constraints in artificial computational implementations of neural information processes and also provides a more relevant description of natural ones.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03676v1,2024-02
LoraRetriever: Input-Aware LoRA Retrieval and Composition for Mixed Tasks in the Wild,"Ziyu Zhao, Leilei Gan, Guoyin Wang, Wangchunshu Zhou, Hongxia Yang, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu","Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) provides an effective yet efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models (LLM). The modular and plug-and-play nature of LoRA enables the integration of diverse domain-specific LoRAs to enhance the capabilities of LLMs. Previous research on exploiting multiple LoRAs either focuses on specific isolated downstream tasks or fixes the selection of LoRAs during training. However, in real-world scenarios, LLMs receive diverse prompts covering different tasks, and the pool of candidate LoRAs is often dynamically updated. To bridge this gap, we propose LoraRetriever, a retrieve-then-compose framework that adaptively retrieves and composes multiple LoRAs according to the input prompts. LoraRetriever contains three main components: firstly, identifying and retrieving LoRAs relevant to the given input; secondly, formulating strategies for effectively integrating the retrieved LoRAs; and thirdly, developing efficient batch inference to accommodate heterogeneous requests. Experimental results indicate that LoraRetriever consistently outperforms the baselines, highlighting its practical effectiveness and versatility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09997v1,2024-02
LLMs as Bridges: Reformulating Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition,"Jinyuan Li, Han Li, Di Sun, Jiahao Wang, Wenkun Zhang, Zan Wang, Gang Pan","Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is a nascent multimodal task that aims to identify named entities, entity types and their corresponding visual regions. GMNER task exhibits two challenging properties: 1) The weak correlation between image-text pairs in social media results in a significant portion of named entities being ungroundable. 2) There exists a distinction between coarse-grained referring expressions commonly used in similar tasks (e.g., phrase localization, referring expression comprehension) and fine-grained named entities. In this paper, we propose RiVEG, a unified framework that reformulates GMNER into a joint MNER-VE-VG task by leveraging large language models (LLMs) as a connecting bridge. This reformulation brings two benefits: 1) It maintains the optimal MNER performance and eliminates the need for employing object detection methods to pre-extract regional features, thereby naturally addressing two major limitations of existing GMNER methods. 2) The introduction of entity expansion expression and Visual Entailment (VE) module unifies Visual Grounding (VG) and Entity Grounding (EG). It enables RiVEG to effortlessly inherit the Visual Entailment and Visual Grounding capabilities of any current or prospective multimodal pretraining models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RiVEG outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the existing GMNER dataset and achieves absolute leads of 10.65%, 6.21%, and 8.83% in all three subtasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09989v4,2024-02

Crafting a Good Prompt or Providing Exemplary Dialogues? A Study of In-Context Learning for Persona-based Dialogue Generation,"Jiashu Pu, Yajing Wan, Yuru Zhang, Jing Chen, Ling Cheng, Qian Shao, Yongzhu Chang, Tangjie Lv, Rongsheng Zhang","Previous in-context learning (ICL) research has focused on tasks such as classification, machine translation, text2table, etc., while studies on whether ICL can improve human-like dialogue generation are scarce. Our work fills this gap by systematically investigating the ICL capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in persona-based dialogue generation, conducting extensive experiments on high-quality real human Chinese dialogue datasets. From experimental results, we draw three conclusions: 1) adjusting prompt instructions is the most direct, effective, and economical way to improve generation quality; 2) randomly retrieving demonstrations (demos) achieves the best results, possibly due to the greater diversity and the amount of effective information; counter-intuitively, retrieving demos with a context identical to the query performs the worst; 3) even when we destroy the multi-turn associations and single-turn semantics in the demos, increasing the number of demos still improves dialogue performance, proving that LLMs can learn from corrupted dialogue demos. Previous explanations of the ICL mechanism, such as $n$-gram induction head, cannot fully account for this phenomenon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09954v2,2024-02
Multi-word Tokenization for Sequence Compression,"Leonidas Gee, Leonardo Rigutini, Marco Ernandes, Andrea Zugarini","Large Language Models have proven highly successful at modelling a variety of tasks. However, this comes at a steep computational cost that hinders wider industrial uptake. In this paper, we present MWT: a Multi-Word Tokenizer that goes beyond word boundaries by representing frequent multi-word expressions as single tokens. MWTs produce a more compact and efficient tokenization that yields two benefits: (1) Increase in performance due to a greater coverage of input data given a fixed sequence length budget; (2) Faster and lighter inference due to the ability to reduce the sequence length with negligible drops in performance. Our results show that MWT is more robust across shorter sequence lengths, thus allowing for major speedups via early sequence truncation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09949v2,2024-02
Generative AI in the Construction Industry: A State-of-the-art Analysis,"Ridwan Taiwo, Idris Temitope Bello, Sulemana Fatoama Abdulai, Abdul-Mugis Yussif, Babatunde Abiodun Salami, Abdullahi Saka, Tarek Zayed","The construction industry is a vital sector of the global economy, but it faces many productivity challenges in various processes, such as design, planning, procurement, inspection, and maintenance. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), which can create novel and realistic data or content, such as text, image, video, or code, based on some input or prior knowledge, offers innovative and disruptive solutions to address these challenges. However, there is a gap in the literature on the current state, opportunities, and challenges of generative AI in the construction industry. This study aims to fill this gap by providing a state-of-the-art analysis of generative AI in construction, with three objectives: (1) to review and categorize the existing and emerging generative AI opportunities and challenges in the construction industry; (2) to propose a framework for construction firms to build customized generative AI solutions using their own data, comprising steps such as data collection, dataset curation, training custom large language model (LLM), model evaluation, and deployment; and (3) to demonstrate the framework via a case study of developing a generative model for querying contract documents. The results show that retrieval augmented generation (RAG) improves the baseline LLM by 5.2, 9.4, and 4.8% in terms of quality, relevance, and reproducibility.

Paying Attention to Deflections: Mining Pragmatic Nuances for Whataboutism Detection in Online Discourse,"Khiem Phi, Noushin Salek Faramarzi, Chenlu Wang, Ritwik Banerjee","Whataboutism, a potent tool for disrupting narratives and sowing distrust, remains under-explored in quantitative NLP research. Moreover, past work has not distinguished its use as a strategy for misinformation and propaganda from its use as a tool for pragmatic and semantic framing. We introduce new datasets from Twitter and YouTube, revealing overlaps as well as distinctions between whataboutism, propaganda, and the tu quoque fallacy. Furthermore, drawing on recent work in linguistic semantics, we differentiate the `what about' lexical construct from whataboutism. Our experiments bring to light unique challenges in its accurate detection, prompting the introduction of a novel method using attention weights for negative sample mining.

A Dataset of Open-Domain Question Answering with Multiple-Span Answers,"Zhiyi Luo, Yingying Zhang, Shuyun Luo, Ying Zhao, Wentao Lyu","Multi-span answer extraction, also known as the task of multi-span question answering (MSQA), is critical for real-world applications, as it requires extracting multiple pieces of information from a text to answer complex questions. Despite the active studies and rapid progress in English MSQA research, there is a notable lack of publicly available MSQA benchmark in Chinese. Previous efforts for constructing MSQA datasets predominantly emphasized entity-centric contextualization, resulting in a bias towards collecting factoid questions and potentially overlooking questions requiring more detailed descriptive responses. To overcome these limitations, we present CLEAN, a comprehensive Chinese multi-span question answering dataset that involves a wide range of open-domain subjects with a substantial number of instances requiring descriptive answers. Additionally, we provide established models from relevant literature as baselines for CLEAN. Experimental results and analysis show the characteristics and challenge of the newly proposed CLEAN dataset for the community.

Enhancing Large Language Models with Pseudo- and Multisource- Knowledge Graphs for Open-ended Question Answering,"Jiaxiang Liu, Tong Zhou, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","Mitigating the hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) and enhancing them is a crucial task. Although some existing methods employ model self-enhancement techniques, they fall short of effectively addressing unknown factual hallucinations. Using Knowledge Graph (KG) enhancement approaches fails to address the generalization across different KG sources and the enhancement of open-ended answer questions simultaneously. To tackle these limitations, there is a framework that combines Pseudo-Graph Generation and Atomic Knowledge Verification proposed. The enhancement of LLM using KG in an open-ended question-answering setting is implemented by leveraging the Pseudo-Graph Generation. Atomic Knowledge Verification utilizes atomic-level knowledge querying and verification to achieve generalizability under different KG sources. Compared to the baseline, this approach yields a minimum improvement of 11.5 in the ROUGE-L score for open-ended questions. For precise questions, we observe a minimum accuracy improvement of 7.5. Moreover, there is also demonstration that this framework exhibits generalizability across different KG sources. In summary, our results pave the way for enhancing LLMs by incorporating Pseudo- and Multisource-KGs, particularly in the context of open-ended questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09911v1,2024-02
DE-COP: Detecting Copyrighted Content in Language Models Training Data,"André V. Duarte, Xuandong Zhao, Arlindo L.

We are motivated by the premise that a language model is likely to identify verbatim excerpts from its training text. We propose DE-COP, a method to determine whether a piece of copyrighted content was included in training. DE-COP's core approach is to probe an LLM with multiple-choice questions, whose options include both verbatim text and their paraphrases. We construct BookTection, a benchmark with excerpts from 165 books published prior and subsequent to a model's training cutoff, along with their paraphrases. Our experiments show that DE-COP surpasses the prior best method by 9.6% in detection performance (AUC) on models with logits available. Moreover, DE-COP also achieves an average accuracy of 72% for detecting suspect books on fully black-box models where prior methods give approximately 4% accuracy.

Generative Representational Instruction Tuning,"Niklas Muennighoff, Hongjin Su, Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Furu Wei, Tao Yu, Amanpreet Singh, Douwe Kiela","All text-based language problems can be reduced to either generation or embedding. Current models only perform well at one or the other. We introduce generative representational instruction tuning (GRIT) whereby a large language model is trained to handle both generative and embedding tasks by distinguishing between them through instructions. Compared to other open models, our resulting GritLM 7B sets a new state of the art on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and outperforms all models up to its size on a range of generative tasks. By scaling up further, GritLM 8x7B outperforms all open generative language models that we tried while still being among the best embedding models. Notably, we find that GRIT matches training on only generative or embedding data, thus we can unify both at no performance loss. Among other benefits, the unification via GRIT speeds up Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by > 60% for long documents, by no longer requiring separate retrieval and generation models.

Not Just Novelty: A Longitudinal Study on Utility and Customization of an AI Workflow,"Tao Long, Katy Ilonka Gero, Lydia B. Chilton","Generative AI brings novel and impressive abilities to help people in everyday tasks. There are many AI workflows that solve real and complex problems by chaining AI outputs together with human interaction. Although there is an undeniable lure of AI, it is uncertain how useful generative AI workflows are after the novelty wears off. Additionally, workflows built with generative AI have the potential to be easily customized to fit users' individual needs, but do users take advantage of this? We conducted a three-week longitudinal study with 12 users to understand the familiarization and customization of generative AI tools for science communication. Our study revealed that there exists a familiarization phase, during which users were exploring the novel capabilities of the workflow and discovering which aspects they found useful. After this phase, users understood the workflow and were able to anticipate the outputs. Surprisingly, after familiarization the perceived utility of the system was rated higher than before, indicating that the perceived utility of AI is not just a novelty effect. The increase in benefits mainly comes from end-users' ability to customize prompts, and thus potentially appropriate the system to their own needs. This points to a future where generative AI systems can allow us to design for appropriation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09894v2,2024-02
Inadequacies of Large Language Model Benchmarks in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence,"Timothy R. McIntosh, Teo Susnjak, Nalin Arachchilage, Tong Liu, Paul Watters, Malka N. Halgamuge","The rapid rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging capabilities has spurred public curiosity to evaluate and compare different LLMs, leading many researchers to propose their own LLM benchmarks. Noticing preliminary inadequacies in those benchmarks, we embarked on a study to critically assess 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, using our novel unified evaluation framework through the lenses of people, process, and technology, under the pillars of benchmark functionality and integrity. Our research uncovered significant limitations, including biases, difficulties in measuring genuine reasoning, adaptability, implementation inconsistencies, prompt engineering complexity, evaluator diversity, and the overlooking of cultural and ideological norms in one comprehensive assessment. Our discussions emphasized the urgent need for standardized methodologies, regulatory certainties, and ethical guidelines in light of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, including advocating for an evolution from static benchmarks to dynamic behavioral profiling to accurately capture LLMs' complex behaviors and potential risks. Our study highlighted the necessity for a paradigm shift in LLM evaluation methodologies, underlining the importance of collaborative efforts for the development of universally accepted benchmarks and the enhancement of AI systems' integration into society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09880v2,2024-02
Camouflage is all you need: Evaluating and Enhancing Language Model Robustness Against Camouflage Adversarial Attacks,"Álvaro Huertas-García, Alejandro Martín, Javier Huertas-Tato, David Camacho","Adversarial attacks represent a substantial challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). This study undertakes a systematic exploration of this challenge in two distinct phases: vulnerability evaluation and resilience enhancement of Transformer-based models under adversarial attacks.   In the evaluation phase, we assess the susceptibility of three Transformer configurations, encoder-decoder, encoder-only, and decoder-only setups, to adversarial attacks of escalating complexity across datasets containing offensive language and misinformation. Encoder-only models manifest a 14% and 21% performance drop in offensive language detection and misinformation detection tasks, respectively. Decoder-only models register a 16% decrease in both tasks, while encoder-decoder models exhibit a maximum performance drop of 14% and 26% in the respective tasks.   The resilience-enhancement phase employs adversarial training, integrating pre-camouflaged and dynamically altered data. This approach effectively reduces the performance drop in encoder-only models to an average of 5% in offensive language detection and 2% in misinformation detection tasks. Decoder-only models, occasionally exceeding original performance, limit the performance drop to 7% and 2% in the respective tasks. Although not surpassing the original performance, Encoder-decoder models can reduce the drop to an average of 6% and 2% respectively.   Results suggest a trade-off between performance and robustness, with some models maintaining similar performance while gaining robustness. Our study and adversarial training techniques have been incorporated into an open-source tool for generating camouflaged datasets.

LAPDoc: Layout-Aware Prompting for Documents,"Marcel Lamott, Yves-Noel Weweler, Adrian Ulges, Faisal Shafait, Dirk Krechel, Darko Obradovic","Recent advances in training large language models (LLMs) using massive amounts of solely textual data lead to strong generalization across many domains and tasks, including document-specific tasks. Opposed to that there is a trend to train multi-modal transformer architectures tailored for document understanding that are designed specifically to fuse textual inputs with the corresponding document layout. This involves a separate fine-tuning step for which additional training data is required. At present, no document transformers with comparable generalization to LLMs are available That raises the question which type of model is to be preferred for document understanding tasks. In this paper we investigate the possibility to use purely text-based LLMs for document-specific tasks by using layout enrichment. We explore drop-in modifications and rule-based methods to enrich purely textual LLM prompts with layout information. In our experiments we investigate the effects on the commercial ChatGPT model and the open-source LLM Solar. We demonstrate that using our approach both LLMs show improved performance on various standard document benchmarks. In addition, we study the impact of noisy OCR and layout errors, as well as the limitations of LLMs when it comes to utilizing document layout. Our results indicate that layout enrichment can improve the performance of purely text-based LLMs for document understanding by up to 15% compared to just using plain document text. In conclusion, this approach should be considered for the best model choice between text-based LLM or multi-modal document transformers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09841v1,2024-02
Knowledge of Pretrained Language Models on Surface Information of Tokens,"Tatsuya Hiraoka, Naoaki Okazaki","Do pretrained language models have knowledge regarding the surface information of tokens? We examined the surface information stored in word or subword embeddings acquired by pretrained language models from the perspectives of token length, substrings, and token constitution. Additionally, we evaluated the ability of models to generate knowledge regarding token surfaces. We focused on 12 pretrained language models that were mainly trained on English and Japanese corpora. Experimental results demonstrate that pretrained language models have knowledge regarding token length and substrings but not token constitution. Additionally, the results imply that there is a bottleneck on the decoder side in terms of effectively utilizing acquired knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09808v2,2024-02
EFUF: Efficient Fine-grained Unlearning Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models,"Shangyu Xing, Fei Zhao, Zhen Wu, Tuo An, Weihao Chen, Chunhui Li, Jianbing Zhang, Xinyu Dai","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention in the past few years, but they may still generate descriptions that include objects not present in the corresponding images, a phenomenon known as object hallucination. To eliminate hallucinations, existing methods manually annotate paired responses with and without hallucinations, and then employ various alignment algorithms to improve the alignment capability between images and text. However, they not only demand considerable computation resources during the finetuning stage but also require expensive human annotation to construct paired data needed by the alignment algorithms. To address these issues, we borrow the idea of unlearning and propose an efficient fine-grained unlearning framework (EFUF), which can eliminate hallucinations without the need for paired data. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving the generation quality with modest computational overhead. Our code and datasets will be publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09801v3,2024-02
NutePrune: Efficient Progressive Pruning with Numerous Teachers for Large Language Models,"Shengrui Li, Junzhe Chen, Xueting Han, Jing Bai","The considerable size of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents notable deployment challenges, particularly on resource-constrained hardware. Structured pruning, offers an effective means to compress LLMs, thereby reducing storage costs and enhancing inference speed for more efficient utilization. In this work, we study data-efficient and resource-efficient structure pruning methods to obtain smaller yet still powerful models. Knowledge Distillation is well-suited for pruning, as the intact model can serve as an excellent teacher for pruned students. However, it becomes challenging in the context of LLMs due to memory constraints. To address this, we propose an efficient progressive Numerous-teacher pruning method (NutePrune). NutePrune mitigates excessive memory costs by loading only one intact model and integrating it with various masks and LoRA modules, enabling it to seamlessly switch between teacher and student roles. This approach allows us to leverage numerous teachers with varying capacities to progressively guide the pruned model, enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of NutePrune. In LLaMA-7B zero-shot experiments, NutePrune retains 97.17% of the performance of the original model at 20% sparsity and 95.07% at 25% sparsity. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lucius-lsr/NutePrune.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09773v2,2024-02
Grounding Language Model with Chunking-Free In-Context Retrieval,"Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Kelong Mao, Yujia Zhou, Zhicheng Dou","This paper presents a novel Chunking-Free In-Context (CFIC) retrieval approach, specifically tailored for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Traditional RAG systems often struggle with grounding responses using precise evidence text due to the challenges of processing lengthy documents and filtering out irrelevant content. Commonly employed solutions, such as document chunking and adapting language models to handle longer contexts, have their limitations. These methods either disrupt the semantic coherence of the text or fail to effectively address the issues of noise and inaccuracy in evidence retrieval.   CFIC addresses these challenges by circumventing the conventional chunking process. It utilizes the encoded hidden states of documents for in-context retrieval, employing auto-aggressive decoding to accurately identify the specific evidence text required for user queries, eliminating the need for chunking. CFIC is further enhanced by incorporating two decoding strategies, namely Constrained Sentence Prefix Decoding and Skip Decoding. These strategies not only improve the efficiency of the retrieval process but also ensure that the fidelity of the generated grounding text evidence is maintained. Our evaluations of CFIC on a range of open QA datasets demonstrate its superiority in retrieving relevant and accurate evidence, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods. By doing away with the need for document chunking, CFIC presents a more streamlined, effective, and efficient retrieval solution, making it a valuable advancement in the field of RAG systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09760v1,2024-02
Efficient Language Adaptive Pre-training: Extending State-of-the-Art Large Language Models for Polish,Szymon Ruciński,"This study explores the potential of fine-tuning foundational English Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating Polish text. The first step involves Language Adaptive Pre-training (LAPT) on a high-quality dataset of 3.11 GB, consisting of 276 million Polish tokens. The LAPT is followed by additional fine-tuning aimed at solving nine KLEJ challenges. Our trained model Curie-7B-v1 not only generates Polish text with the lowest perplexity of 3.02 among decoder-based Polish models but also closely rivals the performance of the best Polish encoder-decoder models with a less than 2% gap on 8 out of 9 tasks. Curie-7B-v1 used approximately 2-3% of a typical dataset size to learn Polish. The LAPT was completed in less than five days using a consumer GPU, highlighting the method's efficiency. The proficiency of the model in Polish was significantly enhanced, demonstrating the viability of this approach for adding new languages to existing LLMs by training just 1.2% of its parameters. To contribute to the community's collaborative progress, the model has been released as open-source.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09759v1,2024-02
Model Compression and Efficient Inference for Large Language Models: A Survey,"Wenxiao Wang, Wei Chen, Yicong Luo, Yongliu Long, Zhengkai Lin, Liye Zhang, Binbin Lin, Deng Cai, Xiaofei He","Transformer based large language models have achieved tremendous success. However, the significant memory and computational costs incurred during the inference process make it challenging to deploy large models on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we investigate compression and efficient inference methods for large language models from an algorithmic perspective. Regarding taxonomy, similar to smaller models, compression and acceleration algorithms for large language models can still be categorized into quantization, pruning, distillation, compact architecture design, dynamic networks. However, Large language models have two prominent characteristics compared to smaller models: (1) Most of compression algorithms require finetuning or even retraining the model after compression. The most notable aspect of large models is the very high cost associated with model finetuning or training. Therefore, many algorithms for large models, such as quantization and pruning, start to explore tuning-free algorithms. (2) Large models emphasize versatility and generalization rather than performance on a single task. Hence, many algorithms, such as knowledge distillation, focus on how to preserving their versatility and generalization after compression. Since these two characteristics were not very pronounced in early large models, we further distinguish large language models into medium models and ``real'' large models. Additionally, we also provide an introduction to some mature frameworks for efficient inference of large models, which can support basic compression or acceleration algorithms, greatly facilitating model deployment for users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09748v1,2024-02
AI Hospital: Benchmarking Large Language Models in a Multi-agent Medical Interaction Simulator,"Zhihao Fan, Jialong Tang, Wei Chen, Siyuan Wang, Zhongyu Wei, Jun Xi, Fei Huang, Jingren Zhou","Artificial intelligence has significantly advanced healthcare, particularly through large language models (LLMs) that excel in medical question answering benchmarks. However, their real-world clinical application remains limited due to the complexities of doctor-patient interactions. To address this, we introduce \textbf{AI Hospital}, a multi-agent framework simulating dynamic medical interactions between \emph{Doctor} as player and NPCs including \emph{Patient}, \emph{Examiner}, \emph{Chief Physician}. This setup allows for realistic assessments of LLMs in clinical scenarios. We develop the Multi-View Medical Evaluation (MVME) benchmark, utilizing high-quality Chinese medical records and NPCs to evaluate LLMs' performance in symptom collection, examination recommendations, and diagnoses. Additionally, a dispute resolution collaborative mechanism is proposed to enhance diagnostic accuracy through iterative discussions. Despite improvements, current LLMs exhibit significant performance gaps in multi-turn interactions compared to one-step approaches. Our findings highlight the need for further research to bridge these gaps and improve LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities.

QuRating: Selecting High-Quality Data for Training Language Models,"Alexander Wettig, Aatmik Gupta, Saumya Malik, Danqi Chen","Selecting high-quality pre-training data is important for creating capable language models, but existing methods rely on simple heuristics. We introduce QuRating, a method for selecting pre-training data that can capture human intuitions about data quality. In this paper, we investigate four qualities - writing style, required expertise, facts & trivia, and educational value - and find that LLMs are able to discern these qualities, especially when making pairwise judgments of texts. We train a QuRater model to learn scalar ratings from pairwise judgments, and use it to annotate a 260B training corpus with quality ratings for each of the four criteria. In our experiments, we select 30B tokens according to the different quality ratings and train 1.3B-parameter language models on the selected data. We find that it is important to balance quality and diversity. When we sample using quality ratings as logits over documents, our models obtain lower perplexity and stronger in-context learning performance than baselines. Our best model is based on educational value and performs similarly to a model trained with uniform sampling for 50% more steps. Beyond data selection, we use the quality ratings to construct a training curriculum which improves performance without changing the training dataset. We extensively analyze the quality ratings and discuss their characteristics, biases, and wider implications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09739v3,2024-02
Align before Attend: Aligning Visual and Textual Features for Multimodal Hateful Content Detection,"Eftekhar Hossain, Omar Sharif, Mohammed Moshiul Hoque, Sarah M. Preum","Multimodal hateful content detection is a challenging task that requires complex reasoning across visual and textual modalities. Therefore, creating a meaningful multimodal representation that effectively captures the interplay between visual and textual features through intermediate fusion is critical. Conventional fusion techniques are unable to attend to the modality-specific features effectively. Moreover, most studies exclusively concentrated on English and overlooked other low-resource languages. This paper proposes a context-aware attention framework for multimodal hateful content detection and assesses it for both English and non-English languages. The proposed approach incorporates an attention layer to meaningfully align the visual and textual features. This alignment enables selective focus on modality-specific features before fusing them. We evaluate the proposed approach on two benchmark hateful meme datasets, viz. MUTE (Bengali code-mixed) and MultiOFF (English). Evaluation results demonstrate our proposed approach's effectiveness with F1-scores of $69.7$% and $70.3$% for the MUTE and MultiOFF datasets. The scores show approximately $2.5$% and $3.2$% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art systems on these datasets.

Do LLMs Know about Hallucination? An Empirical Investigation of LLM's Hidden States,"Hanyu Duan, Yi Yang, Kar Yan Tam","Large Language Models (LLMs) can make up answers that are not real, and this is known as hallucination. This research aims to see if, how, and to what extent LLMs are aware of hallucination. More specifically, we check whether and how an LLM reacts differently in its hidden states when it answers a question right versus when it hallucinates. To do this, we introduce an experimental framework which allows examining LLM's hidden states in different hallucination situations. Building upon this framework, we conduct a series of experiments with language models in the LLaMA family (Touvron et al., 2023). Our empirical findings suggest that LLMs react differently when processing a genuine response versus a fabricated one. We then apply various model interpretation techniques to help understand and explain the findings better. Moreover, informed by the empirical observations, we show great potential of using the guidance derived from LLM's hidden representation space to mitigate hallucination. We believe this work provides insights into how LLMs produce hallucinated answers and how to make them occur less often.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09733v1,2024-02
A Human-Inspired Reading Agent with Gist Memory of Very Long Contexts,"Kuang-Huei Lee, Xinyun Chen, Hiroki Furuta, John Canny, Ian Fischer","Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only limited to some maximum context length, but also are not able to robustly consume long inputs. To address these limitations, we propose ReadAgent, an LLM agent system that increases effective context length up to 20x in our experiments. Inspired by how humans interactively read long documents, we implement ReadAgent as a simple prompting system that uses the advanced language capabilities of LLMs to (1) decide what content to store together in a memory episode, (2) compress those memory episodes into short episodic memories called gist memories, and (3) take actions to look up passages in the original text if ReadAgent needs to remind itself of relevant details to complete a task. We evaluate ReadAgent against baselines using retrieval methods, using the original long contexts, and using the gist memories. These evaluations are performed on three long-document reading comprehension tasks: QuALITY, NarrativeQA, and QMSum. ReadAgent outperforms the baselines on all three tasks while extending the effective context window by 3.5-20x.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09727v3,2024-02
Improving Non-autoregressive Machine Translation with Error Exposure and Consistency Regularization,"Xinran Chen, Sufeng Duan, Gongshen Liu","Being one of the IR-NAT (Iterative-refinemennt-based NAT) frameworks, the Conditional Masked Language Model (CMLM) adopts the mask-predict paradigm to re-predict the masked low-confidence tokens. However, CMLM suffers from the data distribution discrepancy between training and inference, where the observed tokens are generated differently in the two cases. In this paper, we address this problem with the training approaches of error exposure and consistency regularization (EECR). We construct the mixed sequences based on model prediction during training, and propose to optimize over the masked tokens under imperfect observation conditions. We also design a consistency learning method to constrain the data distribution for the masked tokens under different observing situations to narrow down the gap between training and inference. The experiments on five translation benchmarks obtains an average improvement of 0.68 and 0.40 BLEU scores compared to the base models, respectively, and our CMLMC-EECR achieves the best performance with a comparable translation quality with the Transformer. The experiments results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09725v1,2024-02
Efficient Prompt Optimization Through the Lens of Best Arm Identification,"Chengshuai Shi, Kun Yang, Zihan Chen, Jundong Li, Jing Yang, Cong Shen","The remarkable instruction-following capability of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a growing interest in automatically finding good prompts, i.e., prompt optimization. Most existing works follow the scheme of selecting from a pre-generated pool of candidate prompts. However, these designs mainly focus on the generation strategy, while limited attention has been paid to the selection method. Especially, the cost incurred during the selection (e.g., accessing LLM and evaluating the responses) is rarely explicitly considered. To overcome this limitation, this work provides a principled framework, TRIPLE, to efficiently perform prompt selection under an explicit budget constraint. TRIPLE is built on a novel connection established between prompt optimization and fixed-budget best arm identification (BAI-FB) in multi-armed bandits (MAB); thus, it is capable of leveraging the rich toolbox from BAI-FB systematically and also incorporating unique characteristics of prompt optimization. Extensive experiments on multiple well-adopted tasks using various LLMs demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement of TRIPLE over baselines while satisfying the limited budget constraints. As an extension, variants of TRIPLE are proposed to efficiently select examples for few-shot prompts, also achieving superior empirical performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09723v3,2024-02
An Analysis of Language Frequency and Error Correction for Esperanto,Junhong Liang,"Current Grammar Error Correction (GEC) initiatives tend to focus on major languages, with less attention given to low-resource languages like Esperanto. In this article, we begin to bridge this gap by first conducting a comprehensive frequency analysis using the Eo-GP dataset, created explicitly for this purpose. We then introduce the Eo-GEC dataset, derived from authentic user cases and annotated with fine-grained linguistic details for error identification. Leveraging GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, our experiments show that GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 in both automated and human evaluations, highlighting its efficacy in addressing Esperanto's grammatical peculiarities and illustrating the potential of advanced language models to enhance GEC strategies for less commonly studied languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09696v2,2024-02
PAL: Proxy-Guided Black-Box Attack on Large Language Models,"Chawin Sitawarin, Norman Mu, David Wagner, Alexandre Araujo","Large Language Models (LLMs) have surged in popularity in recent months, but they have demonstrated concerning capabilities to generate harmful content when manipulated. While techniques like safety fine-tuning aim to minimize harmful use, recent works have shown that LLMs remain vulnerable to attacks that elicit toxic responses. In this work, we introduce the Proxy-Guided Attack on LLMs (PAL), the first optimization-based attack on LLMs in a black-box query-only setting. In particular, it relies on a surrogate model to guide the optimization and a sophisticated loss designed for real-world LLM APIs. Our attack achieves 84% attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-3.5-Turbo and 48% on Llama-2-7B, compared to 4% for the current state of the art. We also propose GCG++, an improvement to the GCG attack that reaches 94% ASR on white-box Llama-2-7B, and the Random-Search Attack on LLMs (RAL), a strong but simple baseline for query-based attacks. We believe the techniques proposed in this work will enable more comprehensive safety testing of LLMs and, in the long term, the development of better security guardrails.

How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs,"Noveen Sachdeva, Benjamin Coleman, Wang-Cheng Kang, Jianmo Ni, Lichan Hong, Ed H. Chi, James Caverlee, Julian McAuley, Derek Zhiyuan Cheng","The training of large language models (LLMs) is expensive. In this paper, we study data-efficient approaches for pre-training LLMs, i.e., techniques that aim to optimize the Pareto frontier of model quality and training resource/data consumption. We seek to understand the tradeoffs associated with data selection routines based on (i) expensive-to-compute data-quality estimates, and (ii) maximization of coverage and diversity-based measures in the feature space. Our first technique, Ask-LLM, leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs to directly assess the quality of a training example. To target coverage, we propose Density sampling, which models the data distribution to select a diverse sample. In our comparison of 19 samplers, involving hundreds of evaluation tasks and pre-training runs, we find that Ask-LLM and Density are the best methods in their respective categories. Coverage sampling can recover the performance of the full data, while models trained on Ask-LLM data consistently outperform full-data training -- even when we reject 90% of the original dataset, while converging up to 70% faster.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09668v1,2024-02
EntailE: Introducing Textual Entailment in Commonsense Knowledge Graph Completion,"Ying Su, Tianqing Fang, Huiru Xiao, Weiqi Wang, Yangqiu Song, Tong Zhang, Lei Chen","Commonsense knowledge graph completion is a new challenge for commonsense knowledge graph construction and application. In contrast to factual knowledge graphs such as Freebase and YAGO, commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs; e.g., ConceptNet) utilize free-form text to represent named entities, short phrases, and events as their nodes. Such a loose structure results in large and sparse CSKGs, which makes the semantic understanding of these nodes more critical for learning rich commonsense knowledge graph embedding. While current methods leverage semantic similarities to increase the graph density, the semantic plausibility of the nodes and their relations are under-explored. Previous works adopt conceptual abstraction to improve the consistency of modeling (event) plausibility, but they are not scalable enough and still suffer from data sparsity. In this paper, we propose to adopt textual entailment to find implicit entailment relations between CSKG nodes, to effectively densify the subgraph connecting nodes within the same conceptual class, which indicates a similar level of plausibility. Each node in CSKG finds its top entailed nodes using a finetuned transformer over natural language inference (NLI) tasks, which sufficiently capture textual entailment signals. The entailment relation between these nodes are further utilized to: 1) build new connections between source triplets and entailed nodes to densify the sparse CSKGs; 2) enrich the generalization ability of node representations by comparing the node embeddings with a contrastive loss. Experiments on two standard CSKGs demonstrate that our proposed framework EntailE can improve the performance of CSKG completion tasks under both transductive and inductive settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09666v1,2024-02
CodeMind: A Framework to Challenge Large Language Models for Code Reasoning,"Changshu Liu, Shizhuo Dylan Zhang, Ali Reza Ibrahimzada, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand","Solely relying on test passing to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for code synthesis may result in unfair assessment or promoting models with data leakage. As an alternative, we introduce CodeMind, a framework designed to gauge the code reasoning abilities of LLMs. CodeMind currently supports three code reasoning tasks: Independent Execution Reasoning (IER), Dependent Execution Reasoning (DER), and Specification Reasoning (SR). The first two evaluate models to predict the execution output of an arbitrary code or code the model could correctly synthesize. The third one evaluates the extent to which LLMs implement the specified expected behavior.   Our extensive evaluation of nine LLMs across five benchmarks in two different programming languages using CodeMind shows that LLMs fairly follow control flow constructs and, in general, explain how inputs evolve to output, specifically for simple programs and the ones they can correctly synthesize. However, their performance drops for code with higher complexity, non-trivial logical and arithmetic operators, non-primitive types, and API calls. Furthermore, we observe that, while correlated, specification reasoning (essential for code synthesis) does not imply execution reasoning (essential for broader programming tasks such as testing and debugging): ranking LLMs based on test passing can be different compared to code reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09664v4,2024-02
GPT-4's assessment of its performance in a USMLE-based case study,"Uttam Dhakal, Aniket Kumar Singh, Suman Devkota, Yogesh Sapkota, Bishal Lamichhane, Suprinsa Paudyal, Chandra Dhakal","This study investigates GPT-4's assessment of its performance in healthcare applications. A simple prompting technique was used to prompt the LLM with questions taken from the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) questionnaire and it was tasked to evaluate its confidence score before posing the question and after asking the question. The questionnaire was categorized into two groups-questions with feedback (WF) and questions with no feedback(NF) post-question. The model was asked to provide absolute and relative confidence scores before and after each question. The experimental findings were analyzed using statistical tools to study the variability of confidence in WF and NF groups. Additionally, a sequential analysis was conducted to observe the performance variation for the WF and NF groups. Results indicate that feedback influences relative confidence but doesn't consistently increase or decrease it. Understanding the performance of LLM is paramount in exploring its utility in sensitive areas like healthcare. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the reliability of AI, particularly of LLMs like GPT-4, within healthcare, offering insights into how feedback mechanisms might be optimized to enhance AI-assisted medical education and decision support.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09654v2,2024-02
Answer is All You Need: Instruction-following Text Embedding via Answering the Question,"Letian Peng, Yuwei Zhang, Zilong Wang, Jayanth Srinivasa, Gaowen Liu, Zihan Wang, Jingbo Shang","This work aims to build a text embedder that can capture characteristics of texts specified by user instructions. Despite its tremendous potential to deploy user-oriented embeddings, none of previous approaches provides a concrete solution for it. This paper offers a new viewpoint, which treats the instruction as a question about the input text and encodes the expected answers to obtain the representation accordingly. Intuitively, texts with the same (implicit) semantics would share similar answers following the instruction, thus leading to more similar embeddings. Specifically, we propose InBedder that instantiates this embed-via-answering idea by only fine-tuning language models on abstractive question answering tasks. InBedder demonstrates significantly improved instruction-following capabilities according to our proposed instruction awareness tests and instruction robustness tests, when applied to both large language models (LLMs) (e.g., llama-2-7b) and smaller encoder-based LMs (e.g., roberta-large). Additionally, our qualitative analysis of clustering outcomes, achieved by applying different instructions to the same corpus, demonstrates a high degree of interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09642v1,2024-02
Representation Surgery: Theory and Practice of Affine Steering,"Shashwat Singh, Shauli Ravfogel, Jonathan Herzig, Roee Aharoni, Ryan Cotterell, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","Language models often exhibit undesirable behavior, e.g., generating toxic or gender-biased text. In the case of neural language models, an encoding of the undesirable behavior is often present in the model's representations. Thus, one natural (and common) approach to prevent the model from exhibiting undesirable behavior is to steer the model's representations in a manner that reduces the probability of it generating undesirable text. This paper investigates the formal and empirical properties of steering functions, i.e., transformation of the neural language model's representations that alter its behavior. First, we derive two optimal, in the least-squares sense, affine steering functions under different constraints. Our theory provides justification for existing approaches and offers a novel, improved steering approach. Second, we offer a series of experiments that demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the methods in mitigating bias and reducing toxic generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09631v6,2024-02
API Pack: A Massive Multi-Programming Language Dataset for API Call Generation,"Zhen Guo, Adriana Meza Soria, Wei Sun, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda","We introduce API Pack, a massive multi-programming language dataset containing more than 1 million instruction-API call pairs to improve the API call generation capabilities of large language models. By fine-tuning CodeLlama-13B on 20,000 Python instances from API Pack, we enable it to outperform GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in generating unseen API calls. Fine-tuning on API Pack also facilitates cross-programming language generalization by leveraging a large amount of data in one language and small amounts of data from other languages. Scaling the training data to 1 million instances further improves the model's ability to generalize to new APIs not used in training.

Reasoning over Uncertain Text by Generative Large Language Models,"Aliakbar Nafar, Kristen Brent Venable, Parisa Kordjamshidi","This paper considers the challenges Large Language Models (LLMs) face when reasoning over text that includes information involving uncertainty explicitly quantified via probability values. This type of reasoning is relevant to a variety of contexts ranging from everyday conversations to medical decision-making. Despite improvements in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit significant difficulties when it comes to probabilistic reasoning. To deal with this problem, we introduce the Bayesian Linguistic Inference Dataset (BLInD), a new dataset specifically designed to test the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use BLInD to find out the limitations of LLMs for tasks involving probabilistic reasoning. In addition, we present several prompting strategies that map the problem to different formal representations, including Python code, probabilistic algorithms, and probabilistic logical programming. We conclude by providing an evaluation of our methods on BLInD and an adaptation of a causal reasoning question-answering dataset.

Towards Privacy-Aware Sign Language Translation at Scale,"Phillip Rust, Bowen Shi, Skyler Wang, Necati Cihan Camgöz, Jean Maillard","A major impediment to the advancement of sign language translation (SLT) is data scarcity. Much of the sign language data currently available on the web cannot be used for training supervised models due to the lack of aligned captions. Furthermore, scaling SLT using large-scale web-scraped datasets bears privacy risks due to the presence of biometric information, which the responsible development of SLT technologies should account for. In this work, we propose a two-stage framework for privacy-aware SLT at scale that addresses both of these issues. We introduce SSVP-SLT, which leverages self-supervised video pretraining on anonymized and unannotated videos, followed by supervised SLT finetuning on a curated parallel dataset. SSVP-SLT achieves state-of-the-art finetuned and zero-shot gloss-free SLT performance on the How2Sign dataset, outperforming the strongest respective baselines by over 3 BLEU-4.

Here, we present a well-labeled propositional logic corpus, LogicPrpBank, containing 7093 Propositional Logic Statements (PLSs) across six mathematical subjects, to study a brand-new task of reasoning logical implication and equivalence. We benchmark LogicPrpBank with widely-used LMs to show that our corpus offers a useful resource for this challenging task and there is ample room for model improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09609v1,2024-02

While the Large Language Model (LLM), a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, has recently demonstrated effectiveness in translating between molecules and their textual descriptions, there remains a gap in research regarding their application in facilitating the translation between drug molecules and indications, or vice versa, which could greatly benefit the drug discovery process. The capability of generating a drug from a given indication would allow for the discovery of drugs targeting specific diseases or targets and ultimately provide patients with better treatments. In this paper, we first propose a new task, which is the translation between drug molecules and corresponding indications, and then test existing LLMs on this new task. Specifically, we consider nine variations of the T5 LLM and evaluate them on two public datasets obtained from ChEMBL and DrugBank. Our experiments show the early results of using LLMs for this task and provide a perspective on the state-of-the-art. We also emphasize the current limitations and discuss future work that has the potential to improve the performance on this task. The creation of molecules from indications, or vice versa, will allow for more efficient targeting of diseases and significantly reduce the cost of drug discovery, with the potential to revolutionize the field of drug discovery in the era of generative AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09588v2,2024-02
Changes by Butterflies: Farsighted Forecasting with Group Reservoir Transformer,"Md Kowsher, Abdul Rafae Khan, Jia Xu","In Chaos, a minor divergence between two initial conditions exhibits exponential amplification over time, leading to far-away outcomes, known as the butterfly effect. Thus, the distant future is full of uncertainty and hard to forecast. We introduce Group Reservoir Transformer to predict long-term events more accurately and robustly by overcoming two challenges in Chaos: (1) the extensive historical sequences and (2) the sensitivity to initial conditions. A reservoir is attached to a Transformer to efficiently handle arbitrarily long historical lengths, with an extension of a group of reservoirs to reduce the sensitivity to the initialization variations. Our architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in multivariate time series, including TimeLLM, GPT2TS, PatchTST, DLinear, TimeNet, and the baseline Transformer, with an error reduction of up to -59\% in various fields such as ETTh, ETTm, and air quality, demonstrating that an ensemble of butterfly learning can improve the adequacy and certainty of event prediction, despite of the traveling time to the unknown future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09573v2,2024-02
STEER: Assessing the Economic Rationality of Large Language Models,"Narun Raman, Taylor Lundy, Samuel Amouyal, Yoav Levine, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Moshe Tennenholtz","There is increasing interest in using LLMs as decision-making ""agents."" Doing so includes many degrees of freedom: which model should be used; how should it be prompted; should it be asked to introspect, conduct chain-of-thought reasoning, etc? Settling these questions -- and more broadly, determining whether an LLM agent is reliable enough to be trusted -- requires a methodology for assessing such an agent's economic rationality. In this paper, we provide one. We begin by surveying the economic literature on rational decision making, taxonomizing a large set of fine-grained ""elements"" that an agent should exhibit, along with dependencies between them. We then propose a benchmark distribution that quantitatively scores an LLMs performance on these elements and, combined with a user-provided rubric, produces a ""STEER report card."" Finally, we describe the results of a large-scale empirical experiment with 14 different LLMs, characterizing the both current state of the art and the impact of different model sizes on models' ability to exhibit rational behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09552v2,2024-02
AQA-Bench: An Interactive Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs' Sequential Reasoning Ability,"Siwei Yang, Bingchen Zhao, Cihang Xie","This paper introduces AQA-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in algorithmic contexts, such as depth-first search (DFS). The key feature of our evaluation benchmark lies in its interactive evaluation protocol -- for example, in DFS, the availability of each node's connected edge is contingent upon the model's traversal to that node, thereby necessitating the LLM's ability to effectively remember visited nodes and strategize subsequent moves. We comprehensively build AQA-Bench with three different algorithms, namely binary search, depth-first search, and breadth-first search, and to evaluate the sequential reasoning ability of 12 different LLMs. Our investigations reveal several interesting findings: (1) Closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally show strong sequential reasoning ability, significantly outperforming open-source LLMs. (2) Naively providing interactive examples may inadvertently hurt few-shot performance. (3) A very limited number of predecessor steps following the optimal policy can substantially boost small models' performance. (4) The scaling correlation between performance and model size is not always significant, sometimes even showcasing an inverse trend. We hope our study can catalyze future work on advancing the understanding and enhancement of LLMs' capabilities in sequential reasoning.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Active Queries,"Kaixuan Ji, Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu","Aligning large language models (LLM) with human preference plays a key role in building modern generative models and can be achieved by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite their superior performance, current RLHF approaches often require a large amount of human-labelled preference data, which is expensive to collect. In this paper, inspired by the success of active learning, we address this problem by proposing query-efficient RLHF methods. We first formalize the alignment problem as a contextual dueling bandit problem and design an active-query-based proximal policy optimization (APPO) algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta)$ regret bound and an $\tilde{O}(d^2/\Delta^2)$ query complexity, where $d$ is the dimension of feature space and $\Delta$ is the sub-optimality gap over all the contexts. We then propose ADPO, a practical version of our algorithm based on direct preference optimization (DPO) and apply it to fine-tuning LLMs. Our experiments show that ADPO, while only making about half of queries for human preference, matches the performance of the state-of-the-art DPO method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09401v1,2024-02
Long-form evaluation of model editing,"Domenic Rosati, Robie Gonzales, Jinkun Chen, Xuemin Yu, Melis Erkan, Yahya Kayani, Satya Deepika Chavatapalli, Frank Rudzicz, Hassan Sajjad","Evaluations of model editing currently only use the `next few token' completions after a prompt. As a result, the impact of these methods on longer natural language generation is largely unknown. We introduce long-form evaluation of model editing (LEME) a novel evaluation protocol that measures the efficacy and impact of model editing in long-form generative settings. Our protocol consists of a machine-rated survey and a classifier which correlates well with human ratings. Importantly, we find that our protocol has very little relationship with previous short-form metrics (despite being designed to extend efficacy, generalization, locality, and portability into a long-form setting), indicating that our method introduces a novel set of dimensions for understanding model editing methods. Using this protocol, we benchmark a number of model editing techniques and present several findings including that, while some methods (ROME and MEMIT) perform well in making consistent edits within a limited scope, they suffer much more from factual drift than other methods. Finally, we present a qualitative analysis that illustrates common failure modes in long-form generative settings including internal consistency, lexical cohesion, and locality issues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09394v2,2024-02
"LlaSMol: Advancing Large Language Models for Chemistry with a Large-Scale, Comprehensive, High-Quality Instruction Tuning Dataset","Botao Yu, Frazier N. Baker, Ziqi Chen, Xia Ning, Huan Sun","Chemistry plays a crucial role in many domains, such as drug discovery and material science. While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit remarkable capabilities on natural language processing tasks, existing research indicates that their performance on chemistry tasks is discouragingly low. In this paper, however, we demonstrate that our developed LLMs can achieve very strong results on a comprehensive set of chemistry tasks, outperforming the most advanced GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus by a substantial margin. To accomplish this, we propose SMolInstruct, a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality dataset for instruction tuning. It contains 14 selected chemistry tasks and over three million samples, laying a solid foundation for training and evaluating LLMs for chemistry. Using SMolInstruct, we fine-tune a set of open-source LLMs, among which, we find that Mistral serves as the best base model for chemistry tasks. Our analysis further demonstrates the critical role of the proposed dataset in driving the performance improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09391v4,2024-02
HGOT: Hierarchical Graph of Thoughts for Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learning in Factuality Evaluation,"Yihao Fang, Stephen W. Thomas, Xiaodan Zhu","With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in numerous applications, the challenge of factuality and the propensity for hallucinations has emerged as a significant concern. To address this issue, particularly in retrieval-augmented in-context learning, we introduce the hierarchical graph of thoughts (HGOT), a structured, multi-layered graph approach designed to enhance the retrieval of pertinent passages during in-context learning. The framework utilizes the emergent planning capabilities of LLMs, employing the divide-and-conquer strategy to break down complex queries into manageable sub-queries. It refines self-consistency majority voting for answer selection, which incorporates the recently proposed citation recall and precision metrics to assess the quality of thoughts, linking an answer's credibility intrinsically to the thought's quality. This methodology introduces a weighted system in majority voting, prioritizing answers based on the citation quality of their thoughts. Additionally, we propose a scoring mechanism for evaluating retrieved passages, considering factors such as citation frequency and quality, self-consistency confidence, and the retrieval module's ranking. Experiments indicate that HGOT excels as a versatile approach, outperforming competing models in FEVER by up to $7\%$ and matching leading models such as Retrieve-then-Read in Open-SQuAD, and DSP in HotPotQA, demonstrating its efficacy in enhancing LLMs' factuality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09390v2,2024-02
Transformers Can Achieve Length Generalization But Not Robustly,"Yongchao Zhou, Uri Alon, Xinyun Chen, Xuezhi Wang, Rishabh Agarwal, Denny Zhou","Length generalization, defined as the ability to extrapolate from shorter training sequences to longer test ones, is a significant challenge for language models. This issue persists even with large-scale Transformers handling relatively straightforward tasks. In this paper, we test the Transformer's ability of length generalization using the task of addition of two integers. We show that the success of length generalization is intricately linked to the data format and the type of position encoding. Using the right combination of data format and position encodings, we show for the first time that standard Transformers can extrapolate to a sequence length that is 2.5x the input length. Nevertheless, unlike in-distribution generalization, length generalization remains fragile, significantly influenced by factors like random weight initialization and training data order, leading to large variances across different random seeds.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09371v1,2024-02
Massively Multi-Cultural Knowledge Acquisition & LM Benchmarking,"Yi Fung, Ruining Zhao, Jae Doo, Chenkai Sun, Heng Ji","Pretrained large language models have revolutionized many applications but still face challenges related to cultural bias and a lack of cultural commonsense knowledge crucial for guiding cross-culture communication and interactions. Recognizing the shortcomings of existing methods in capturing the diverse and rich cultures across the world, this paper introduces a novel approach for massively multicultural knowledge acquisition. Specifically, our method strategically navigates from densely informative Wikipedia documents on cultural topics to an extensive network of linked pages. Leveraging this valuable source of data collection, we construct the CultureAtlas dataset, which covers a wide range of sub-country level geographical regions and ethnolinguistic groups, with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure textual assertion sentence self-containment, as well as fine-grained cultural profile information extraction. Our dataset not only facilitates the evaluation of language model performance in culturally diverse contexts but also serves as a foundational tool for the development of culturally sensitive and aware language models. Our work marks an important step towards deeper understanding and bridging the gaps of cultural disparities in AI, to promote a more inclusive and balanced representation of global cultures in the digital domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09369v1,2024-02
Copyright Traps for Large Language Models,"Matthieu Meeus, Igor Shilov, Manuel Faysse, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye","Questions of fair use of copyright-protected content to train Large Language Models (LLMs) are being actively debated. Document-level inference has been proposed as a new task: inferring from black-box access to the trained model whether a piece of content has been seen during training. SOTA methods however rely on naturally occurring memorization of (part of) the content. While very effective against models that memorize significantly, we hypothesize--and later confirm--that they will not work against models that do not naturally memorize, e.g. medium-size 1B models. We here propose to use copyright traps, the inclusion of fictitious entries in original content, to detect the use of copyrighted materials in LLMs with a focus on models where memorization does not naturally occur. We carefully design a randomized controlled experimental setup, inserting traps into original content (books) and train a 1.3B LLM from scratch. We first validate that the use of content in our target model would be undetectable using existing methods. We then show, contrary to intuition, that even medium-length trap sentences repeated a significant number of times (100) are not detectable using existing methods. However, we show that longer sequences repeated a large number of times can be reliably detected (AUC=0.75) and used as copyright traps. Beyond copyright applications, our findings contribute to the study of LLM memorization: the randomized controlled setup enables us to draw causal relationships between memorization and certain sequence properties such as repetition in model training data and perplexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09363v2,2024-02
DoRA: Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation,"Shih-Yang Liu, Chien-Yi Wang, Hongxu Yin, Pavlo Molchanov, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Kwang-Ting Cheng, Min-Hung Chen","Among the widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, LoRA and its variants have gained considerable popularity because of avoiding additional inference costs. However, there still often exists an accuracy gap between these methods and full fine-tuning (FT). In this work, we first introduce a novel weight decomposition analysis to investigate the inherent differences between FT and LoRA. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FT from the findings, we propose Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA). DoRA decomposes the pre-trained weight into two components, magnitude and direction, for fine-tuning, specifically employing LoRA for directional updates to efficiently minimize the number of trainable parameters. By employing \ours, we enhance both the learning capacity and training stability of LoRA while avoiding any additional inference overhead. \ours~consistently outperforms LoRA on fine-tuning LLaMA, LLaVA, and VL-BART on various downstream tasks, such as commonsense reasoning, visual instruction tuning, and image/video-text understanding.

Generating Diverse Translation with Perturbed kNN-MT,"Yuto Nishida, Makoto Morishita, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe","Generating multiple translation candidates would enable users to choose the one that satisfies their needs. Although there has been work on diversified generation, there exists room for improving the diversity mainly because the previous methods do not address the overcorrection problem -- the model underestimates a prediction that is largely different from the training data, even if that prediction is likely. This paper proposes methods that generate more diverse translations by introducing perturbed k-nearest neighbor machine translation (kNN-MT). Our methods expand the search space of kNN-MT and help incorporate diverse words into candidates by addressing the overcorrection problem. Our experiments show that the proposed methods drastically improve candidate diversity and control the degree of diversity by tuning the perturbation's magnitude.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09344v1,2024-02
ICDPO: Effectively Borrowing Alignment Capability of Others via In-context Direct Preference Optimization,"Feifan Song, Yuxuan Fan, Xin Zhang, Peiyi Wang, Houfeng Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on Human Preference Alignment (HPA) to ensure the generation of safe content. Due to the heavy cost associated with fine-tuning, fine-tuning-free methods have emerged, typically modifying LLM decoding with external auxiliary methods. However, these methods do not essentially enhance the LLM itself. In this paper, we rethink the derivation procedures of DPO, based on which we conversely build an instant scorer using the states of the LLM before and after In-context Learning (ICL). Accordingly, we propose a novel approach called In-Context Direct Preference Optimization (ICDPO). It enables LLMs to borrow the HPA capabilities from superior LLMs with ICL, generating well-aligned responses as estimated by the aforementioned instant scorer, thereby enhancing the final performance. ICDPO can be further enhanced with a two-stage retriever and an upgraded scorer, both offering benefits. Extensive experiments show its effectiveness, particularly in outperforming two fine-tuning-free baselines, and it exhibits competitiveness with SFT + LoRA. We also conduct detailed analyses to offer comprehensive insights into ICDPO.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09320v1,2024-02

Therefore, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent studies, covering three critical aspects of LLM conversation safety: attacks, defenses, and evaluations. Our goal is to provide a structured summary that enhances understanding of LLM conversation safety and encourages further investigation into this important subject.

Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhanced NLP Task Performance through Knowledge Distillation and Optimized Training Strategies,"Yining Huang, Keke Tang, Meilian Chen","Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), showing potential in traditional tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Our study explores a three-phase training strategy that harnesses GPT-4's capabilities to enhance the BERT model's performance on NER. Initially, GPT-4 annotates a subset of the CONLL2003 and additional BBC dataset without fine-tuning. We then train BERT using a mix of original and LLM-annotated data, analyzing the efficacy of LLM annotations against traditional methods. The second phase involves comparative experiments with different training regimens, assessing the synergy between distilled and original data. We observe that sequential strategies, particularly a simple mix of training first with distilled data followed by original data, significantly boost performance. In the third phase, we investigate various data blending techniques, including sigmoid and power decay functions, to optimize the training process further. Our results indicate that a strategic mix of distilled and original data markedly elevates the NER capabilities of BERT. Our approach presents a scalable methodology that reduces manual annotation costs and increases efficiency, making it especially pertinent in resource-limited and closed-network environments. The study concludes that while the 'Simple Mix' strategy yields the best results, understanding its underlying mechanisms requires further research. Future work will also focus on refining prompt designs and enhancing annotation selection processes, aiming to extend our methodology to diverse NLP tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09282v4,2024-02
Personalized Large Language Models,"Stanisław Woźniak, Bartłomiej Koptyra, Arkadiusz Janz, Przemysław Kazienko, Jan Kocoń","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in recent years. However, their universal nature poses limitations in scenarios requiring personalized responses, such as recommendation systems and chatbots. This paper investigates methods to personalize LLMs, comparing fine-tuning and zero-shot reasoning approaches on subjective tasks. Results demonstrate that personalized fine-tuning improves model reasoning compared to non-personalized models. Experiments on datasets for emotion recognition and hate speech detection show consistent performance gains with personalized methods across different LLM architectures. These findings underscore the importance of personalization for enhancing LLM capabilities in subjective text perception tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09269v2,2024-02
Self-Alignment for Factuality: Mitigating Hallucinations in LLMs via Self-Evaluation,"Xiaoying Zhang, Baolin Peng, Ye Tian, Jingyan Zhou, Lifeng Jin, Linfeng Song, Haitao Mi, Helen Meng","Despite showing increasingly human-like abilities, large language models (LLMs) often struggle with factual inaccuracies, i.e. ""hallucinations"", even when they hold relevant knowledge. To address these hallucinations, current approaches typically necessitate high-quality human factuality annotations. In this work, we explore Self-Alignment for Factuality, where we leverage the self-evaluation capability of an LLM to provide training signals that steer the model towards factuality. Specifically, we incorporate Self-Eval, a self-evaluation component, to prompt an LLM to validate the factuality of its own generated responses solely based on its internal knowledge. Additionally, we design Self-Knowledge Tuning (SK-Tuning) to augment the LLM's self-evaluation ability by improving the model's confidence estimation and calibration. We then utilize these self-annotated responses to fine-tune the model via Direct Preference Optimization algorithm. We show that the proposed self-alignment approach substantially enhances factual accuracy over Llama family models across three key knowledge-intensive tasks on TruthfulQA and BioGEN.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09267v2,2024-02
SyntaxShap: Syntax-aware Explainability Method for Text Generation,"Kenza Amara, Rita Sevastjanova, Mennatallah El-Assady","To harness the power of large language models in safety-critical domains, we need to ensure the explainability of their predictions. However, despite the significant attention to model interpretability, there remains an unexplored domain in explaining sequence-to-sequence tasks using methods tailored for textual data. This paper introduces SyntaxShap, a local, model-agnostic explainability method for text generation that takes into consideration the syntax in the text data. The presented work extends Shapley values to account for parsing-based syntactic dependencies. Taking a game theoric approach, SyntaxShap only considers coalitions constraint by the dependency tree. We adopt a model-based evaluation to compare SyntaxShap and its weighted form to state-of-the-art explainability methods adapted to text generation tasks, using diverse metrics including faithfulness, coherency, and semantic alignment of the explanations to the model. We show that our syntax-aware method produces explanations that help build more faithful and coherent explanations for predictions by autoregressive models. Confronted with the misalignment of human and AI model reasoning, this paper also highlights the need for cautious evaluation strategies in explainable AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09259v2,2024-02
"Spectral Filters, Dark Signals, and Attention Sinks",Nicola Cancedda,"Projecting intermediate representations onto the vocabulary is an increasingly popular interpretation tool for transformer-based LLMs, also known as the logit lens. We propose a quantitative extension to this approach and define spectral filters on intermediate representations based on partitioning the singular vectors of the vocabulary embedding and unembedding matrices into bands. We find that the signals exchanged in the tail end of the spectrum are responsible for attention sinking (Xiao et al. 2023), of which we provide an explanation. We find that the loss of pretrained models can be kept low despite suppressing sizable parts of the embedding spectrum in a layer-dependent way, as long as attention sinking is preserved. Finally, we discover that the representation of tokens that draw attention from many tokens have large projections on the tail end of the spectrum.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09221v1,2024-02
AutoTutor meets Large Language Models: A Language Model Tutor with Rich Pedagogy and Guardrails,"Sankalan Pal Chowdhury, Vilém Zouhar, Mrinmaya Sachan","Large Language Models (LLMs) have found several use cases in education, ranging from automatic question generation to essay evaluation. In this paper, we explore the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to author Intelligent Tutoring Systems. A common pitfall of LLMs is their straying from desired pedagogical strategies such as leaking the answer to the student, and in general, providing no guarantees. We posit that while LLMs with certain guardrails can take the place of subject experts, the overall pedagogical design still needs to be handcrafted for the best learning results. Based on this principle, we create a sample end-to-end tutoring system named MWPTutor, which uses LLMs to fill in the state space of a pre-defined finite state transducer. This approach retains the structure and the pedagogy of traditional tutoring systems that has been developed over the years by learning scientists but brings in additional flexibility of LLM-based approaches. Through a human evaluation study on two datasets based on math word problems, we show that our hybrid approach achieves a better overall tutoring score than an instructed, but otherwise free-form, GPT-4. MWPTutor is completely modular and opens up the scope for the community to improve its performance by improving individual modules or using different teaching strategies that it can follow.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09216v3,2024-02
Tell Me More! Towards Implicit User Intention Understanding of Language Model Driven Agents,"Cheng Qian, Bingxiang He, Zhong Zhuang, Jia Deng, Yujia Qin, Xin Cong, Zhong Zhang, Jie Zhou, Yankai Lin, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Current language model-driven agents often lack mechanisms for effective user participation, which is crucial given the vagueness commonly found in user instructions. Although adept at devising strategies and performing tasks, these agents struggle with seeking clarification and grasping precise user intentions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Intention-in-Interaction (IN3), a novel benchmark designed to inspect users' implicit intentions through explicit queries. Next, we propose the incorporation of model experts as the upstream in agent designs to enhance user-agent interaction. Employing IN3, we empirically train Mistral-Interact, a powerful model that proactively assesses task vagueness, inquires user intentions, and refines them into actionable goals before starting downstream agent task execution. Integrating it into the XAgent framework, we comprehensively evaluate the enhanced agent system regarding user instruction understanding and execution, revealing that our approach notably excels at identifying vague user tasks, recovering and summarizing critical missing information, setting precise and necessary agent execution goals, and minimizing redundant tool usage, thus boosting overall efficiency. All the data and codes are released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09205v2,2024-02
Ten Words Only Still Help: Improving Black-Box AI-Generated Text Detection via Proxy-Guided Efficient Re-Sampling,"Yuhui Shi, Qiang Sheng, Juan Cao, Hao Mi, Beizhe Hu, Danding Wang","With the rapidly increasing application of large language models (LLMs), their abuse has caused many undesirable societal problems such as fake news, academic dishonesty, and information pollution. This makes AI-generated text (AIGT) detection of great importance. Among existing methods, white-box methods are generally superior to black-box methods in terms of performance and generalizability, but they require access to LLMs' internal states and are not applicable to black-box settings. In this paper, we propose to estimate word generation probabilities as pseudo white-box features via multiple re-sampling to help improve AIGT detection under the black-box setting. Specifically, we design POGER, a proxy-guided efficient re-sampling method, which selects a small subset of representative words (e.g., 10 words) for performing multiple re-sampling in black-box AIGT detection. Experiments on datasets containing texts from humans and seven LLMs show that POGER outperforms all baselines in macro F1 under black-box, partial white-box, and out-of-distribution settings and maintains lower re-sampling costs than its existing counterparts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09199v1,2024-02
(Ir)rationality and Cognitive Biases in Large Language Models,"Olivia Macmillan-Scott, Mirco Musolesi","Do large language models (LLMs) display rational reasoning? LLMs have been shown to contain human biases due to the data they have been trained on; whether this is reflected in rational reasoning remains less clear. In this paper, we answer this question by evaluating seven language models using tasks from the cognitive psychology literature. We find that, like humans, LLMs display irrationality in these tasks. However, the way this irrationality is displayed does not reflect that shown by humans. When incorrect answers are given by LLMs to these tasks, they are often incorrect in ways that differ from human-like biases. On top of this, the LLMs reveal an additional layer of irrationality in the significant inconsistency of the responses. Aside from the experimental results, this paper seeks to make a methodological contribution by showing how we can assess and compare different capabilities of these types of models, in this case with respect to rational reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09193v2,2024-02
Leveraging the Context through Multi-Round Interactions for Jailbreaking Attacks,"Yixin Cheng, Markos Georgopoulos, Volkan Cevher, Grigorios G. Chrysos","Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to Jailbreaking attacks, which aim to extract harmful information by subtly modifying the attack query. As defense mechanisms evolve, directly obtaining harmful information becomes increasingly challenging for Jailbreaking attacks. In this work, inspired from Chomsky's transformational-generative grammar theory and human practices of indirect context to elicit harmful information, we focus on a new attack form, called Contextual Interaction Attack. We contend that the prior context\u2014the information preceding the attack query\u2014plays a pivotal role in enabling strong Jailbreaking attacks. Specifically, we propose a first multi-turn approach that leverages benign preliminary questions to interact with the LLM. Due to the autoregressive nature of LLMs, which use previous conversation rounds as context during generation, we guide the model's question-response pair to construct a context that is semantically aligned with the attack query to execute the attack. We conduct experiments on seven different LLMs and demonstrate the efficacy of this attack, which is black-box and can also transfer across LLMs. We believe this can lead to further developments and understanding of security in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09177v2,2024-02
Chinese MentalBERT: Domain-Adaptive Pre-training on Social Media for Chinese Mental Health Text Analysis,"Wei Zhai, Hongzhi Qi, Qing Zhao, Jianqiang Li, Ziqi Wang, Han Wang, Bing Xiang Yang, Guanghui Fu","In the current environment, psychological issues are prevalent and widespread, with social media serving as a key outlet for individuals to share their feelings. This results in the generation of vast quantities of data daily, where negative emotions have the potential to precipitate crisis situations. There is a recognized need for models capable of efficient analysis. While pre-trained language models have demonstrated their effectiveness broadly, there's a noticeable gap in pre-trained models tailored for specialized domains like psychology. To address this, we have collected a huge dataset from Chinese social media platforms and enriched it with publicly available datasets to create a comprehensive database encompassing 3.36 million text entries. To enhance the model's applicability to psychological text analysis, we integrated psychological lexicons into the pre-training masking mechanism. Building on an existing Chinese language model, we performed adaptive training to develop a model specialized for the psychological domain. We evaluated our model's performance across six public datasets, where it demonstrated improvements compared to eight other models. Additionally, in the qualitative comparison experiment, our model provided psychologically relevant predictions given the masked sentences. Due to concerns regarding data privacy, the dataset will not be made publicly available. However, we have made the pre-trained models and codes publicly accessible to the community via: https://github.com/zwzzzQAQ/Chinese-MentalBERT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09151v2,2024-02
Advancing NLP Models with Strategic Text Augmentation: A Comprehensive Study of Augmentation Methods and Curriculum Strategies,"Himmet Toprak Kesgin, Mehmet Fatih Amasyali","This study conducts a thorough evaluation of text augmentation techniques across a variety of datasets and natural language processing (NLP) tasks to address the lack of reliable, generalized evidence for these methods. It examines the effectiveness of these techniques in augmenting training sets to improve performance in tasks such as topic classification, sentiment analysis, and offensive language detection. The research emphasizes not only the augmentation methods, but also the strategic order in which real and augmented instances are introduced during training. A major contribution is the development and evaluation of Modified Cyclical Curriculum Learning (MCCL) for augmented datasets, which represents a novel approach in the field. Results show that specific augmentation methods, especially when integrated with MCCL, significantly outperform traditional training approaches in NLP model performance. These results underscore the need for careful selection of augmentation techniques and sequencing strategies to optimize the balance between speed and quality improvement in various NLP tasks. The study concludes that the use of augmentation methods, especially in conjunction with MCCL, leads to improved results in various classification tasks, providing a foundation for future advances in text augmentation strategies in NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09141v1,2024-02
DolphCoder: Echo-Locating Code Large Language Models with Diverse and Multi-Objective Instruction Tuning,"Yejie Wang, Keqing He, Guanting Dong, Pei Wang, Weihao Zeng, Muxi Diao, Yutao Mou, Mengdi Zhang, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Weiran Xu","Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in code-related tasks. Several instruction tuning approaches have been proposed to boost the code generation performance of pre-trained Code LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a diverse instruction model (DolphCoder) with self-evaluating for code generation. It learns diverse instruction targets and combines a code evaluation objective to enhance its code generation ability. Our model achieves superior performance on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, demonstrating new insights for future code instruction tuning work. Our key findings are: (1) Augmenting more diverse responses with distinct reasoning paths increases the code capability of LLMs. (2) Improving one's ability to evaluate the correctness of code solutions also enhances their ability to create it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09136v1,2024-02
MPIrigen: MPI Code Generation through Domain-Specific Language Models,"Nadav Schneider, Niranjan Hasabnis, Vy A. Vo, Tal Kadosh, Neva Krien, Mihai Capotă, Guy Tamir, Ted Willke, Nesreen Ahmed, Yuval Pinter, Timothy Mattson, Gal Oren","The imperative need to scale computation across numerous nodes highlights the significance of efficient parallel computing, particularly in the realm of Message Passing Interface (MPI) integration. The challenging parallel programming task of generating MPI-based parallel programs has remained unexplored. This study first investigates the performance of state-of-the-art language models in generating MPI-based parallel programs. Findings reveal that widely used models such as GPT-3.5 and PolyCoder (specialized multi-lingual code models) exhibit notable performance degradation, when generating MPI-based programs compared to general-purpose programs. In contrast, domain-specific models such as MonoCoder, which are pretrained on MPI-related programming languages of C and C++, outperform larger models. Subsequently, we introduce a dedicated downstream task of MPI-based program generation by fine-tuning MonoCoder on HPCorpusMPI. We call the resulting model as MPIrigen. We propose an innovative preprocessing for completion only after observing the whole code, thus enabling better completion with a wider context. Comparative analysis against GPT-3.5 zero-shot performance, using a novel HPC-oriented evaluation method, demonstrates that MPIrigen excels in generating accurate MPI functions up to 0.8 accuracy in location and function predictions, and with more than 0.9 accuracy for argument predictions. The success of this tailored solution underscores the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning in optimizing language models for parallel computing code generation, paving the way for a new generation of automatic parallelization tools.

SLEB: Streamlining LLMs through Redundancy Verification and Elimination of Transformer Blocks,"Jiwon Song, Kyungseok Oh, Taesu Kim, Hyungjun Kim, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-Joon Kim","Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be highly effective across various natural language processing tasks. However, their large number of parameters poses significant challenges for practical deployment. Pruning, a technique aimed at reducing the size and complexity of LLMs, offers a potential solution by removing redundant components from the network. Despite the promise of pruning, existing methods often struggle to achieve substantial end-to-end LLM inference speedup. In this paper, we introduce SLEB, a novel approach designed to streamline LLMs by eliminating redundant transformer blocks. We choose the transformer block as the fundamental unit for pruning, because LLMs exhibit block-level redundancy with high similarity between the outputs of neighboring blocks. This choice allows us to effectively enhance the processing speed of LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that SLEB outperforms previous LLM pruning methods in accelerating LLM inference while also maintaining superior perplexity and accuracy, making SLEB as a promising technique for enhancing the efficiency of LLMs. The code is available at: https://github.com/jiwonsong-dev/SLEB.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09025v6,2024-02
Towards better Human-Agent Alignment: Assessing Task Utility in LLM-Powered Applications,"Negar Arabzadeh, Julia Kiseleva, Qingyun Wu, Chi Wang, Ahmed Awadallah, Victor Dibia, Adam Fourney, Charles Clarke","The rapid development in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a surge in applications that facilitate collaboration among multiple agents to assist humans in their daily tasks. However, a significant gap remains in assessing whether LLM-powered applications genuinely enhance user experience and task execution efficiency. This highlights the pressing need for methods to verify utility of LLM-powered applications, particularly by ensuring alignment between the application's functionality and end-user needs. We introduce AgentEval provides an implementation for the math problems, a novel framework designed to simplify the utility verification process by automatically proposing a set of criteria tailored to the unique purpose of any given application. This allows for a comprehensive assessment, quantifying the utility of an application against the suggested criteria.

Multi-Query Focused Disaster Summarization via Instruction-Based Prompting,"Philipp Seeberger, Korbinian Riedhammer","Automatic summarization of mass-emergency events plays a critical role in disaster management. The second edition of CrisisFACTS aims to advance disaster summarization based on multi-stream fact-finding with a focus on web sources such as Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and Webnews. Here, participants are asked to develop systems that can extract key facts from several disaster-related events, which ultimately serve as a summary. This paper describes our method to tackle this challenging task. We follow previous work and propose to use a combination of retrieval, reranking, and an embarrassingly simple instruction-following summarization. The two-stage retrieval pipeline relies on BM25 and MonoT5, while the summarizer module is based on the open-source Large Language Model (LLM) LLaMA-13b. For summarization, we explore a Question Answering (QA)-motivated prompting approach and find the evidence useful for extracting query-relevant facts. The automatic metrics and human evaluation show strong results but also highlight the gap between open-source and proprietary systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09008v1,2024-02
SafeDecoding: Defending against Jailbreak Attacks via Safety-Aware Decoding,"Zhangchen Xu, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Jinyuan Jia, Bill Yuchen Lin, Radha Poovendran","As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications such as code generation and chatbot assistance, extensive efforts have been made to align LLM behavior with human values, including safety. Jailbreak attacks, aiming to provoke unintended and unsafe behaviors from LLMs, remain a significant/leading LLM safety threat. In this paper, we aim to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks by introducing SafeDecoding, a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs to generate helpful and harmless responses to user queries. Our insight in developing SafeDecoding is based on the observation that, even though probabilities of tokens representing harmful contents outweigh those representing harmless responses, safety disclaimers still appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order. This allows us to mitigate jailbreak attacks by identifying safety disclaimers and amplifying their token probabilities, while simultaneously attenuating the probabilities of token sequences that are aligned with the objectives of jailbreak attacks. We perform extensive experiments on five LLMs using six state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks and four benchmark datasets. Our results show that SafeDecoding significantly reduces the attack success rate and harmfulness of jailbreak attacks without compromising the helpfulness of responses to benign user queries. SafeDecoding outperforms six defense methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08983v4,2024-02
Structured Language Generation Model for Robust Structure Prediction,"Minho Lee, Junghyun Min, Woochul Lee, Yeonsoo Lee","Previous work in structured prediction (e.g. NER, information extraction) using single model make use of explicit dataset information, which helps boost in-distribution performance but is orthogonal to robust generalization in real-world situations. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Structured Language Generation Model (SLGM), a framework that reduces sequence-to-sequence problems to classification problems via methodologies in loss calibration and decoding method. Our experimental results show that SLGM is able to maintain performance without explicit dataset information, follow and potentially replace dataset-specific fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08971v2,2024-02
Generalization in Healthcare AI: Evaluation of a Clinical Large Language Model,"Salman Rahman, Lavender Yao Jiang, Saadia Gabriel, Yindalon Aphinyanaphongs, Eric Karl Oermann, Rumi Chunara","Advances in large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities in healthcare for improved patient care, clinical decision-making, and enhancement of physician and administrator workflows. However, the potential of these models importantly depends on their ability to generalize effectively across clinical environments and populations, a challenge often underestimated in early development. To better understand reasons for these challenges and inform mitigation approaches, we evaluated ClinicLLM, an LLM trained on [HOSPITAL]'s clinical notes, analyzing its performance on 30-day all-cause readmission prediction focusing on variability across hospitals and patient characteristics. We found poorer generalization particularly in hospitals with fewer samples, among patients with government and unspecified insurance, the elderly, and those with high comorbidities. To understand reasons for lack of generalization, we investigated sample sizes for fine-tuning, note content (number of words per note), patient characteristics (comorbidity level, age, insurance type, borough), and health system aspects (hospital, all-cause 30-day readmission, and mortality rates). We used descriptive statistics and supervised classification to identify features. We found that, along with sample size, patient age, number of comorbidities, and the number of words in notes are all important factors related to generalization. Finally, we compared local fine-tuning (hospital specific), instance-based augmented fine-tuning and cluster-based fine-tuning for improving generalization. Among these, local fine-tuning proved most effective, increasing AUC by 0.25% to 11.74% (most helpful in settings with limited data). Overall, this study provides new insights for enhancing the deployment of large language models in the societally important domain of healthcare, and improving their performance for broader populations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10965v2,2024-02
Pretraining Vision-Language Model for Difference Visual Question Answering in Longitudinal Chest X-rays,"Yeongjae Cho, Taehee Kim, Heejun Shin, Sungzoon Cho, Dongmyung Shin","Difference visual question answering (diff-VQA) is a challenging task that requires answering complex questions based on differences between a pair of images. This task is particularly important in reading chest X-ray images because radiologists often compare multiple images of the same patient taken at different times to track disease progression and changes in its severity in their clinical practice. However, previous works focused on designing specific network architectures for the diff-VQA task, missing opportunities to enhance the model's performance using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Here, we introduce a novel VLM called PLURAL, which is pretrained on natural and longitudinal chest X-ray data for the diff-VQA task. The model is developed using a step-by-step approach, starting with being pretrained on natural images and texts, followed by being trained using longitudinal chest X-ray data. The longitudinal data consist of pairs of X-ray images, along with question-answer sets and radiologist's reports that describe the changes in lung abnormalities and diseases over time. Our experimental results show that the PLURAL model outperforms state-of-the-art methods not only in diff-VQA for longitudinal X-rays but also in conventional VQA for a single X-ray image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VLM architecture and pretraining method in improving the model's performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08966v3,2024-02
MUSTARD: Mastering Uniform Synthesis of Theorem and Proof Data,"Yinya Huang, Xiaohan Lin, Zhengying Liu, Qingxing Cao, Huajian Xin, Haiming Wang, Zhenguo Li, Linqi Song, Xiaodan Liang","Recent large language models (LLMs) have witnessed significant advancement in various tasks, including mathematical reasoning and theorem proving. As these two tasks require strict and formal multi-step inference, they are appealing domains for exploring the reasoning ability of LLMs but still face important challenges. Previous studies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) have revealed the effectiveness of intermediate steps guidance. However, such step-wise annotation requires heavy labor, leading to insufficient training steps for current benchmarks. To fill this gap, this work introduces MUSTARD, a data generation framework that masters uniform synthesis of theorem and proof data of high quality and diversity. MUSTARD synthesizes data in three stages: (1) It samples a few mathematical concept seeds as the problem category. (2) Then, it prompts a generative language model with the sampled concepts to obtain both the problems and their step-wise formal solutions. (3) Lastly, the framework utilizes a proof assistant (e.g., Lean Prover) to filter the valid proofs. With the proposed MUSTARD, we present a theorem-and-proof benchmark MUSTARDSAUCE with 5,866 valid data points. Each data point contains an informal statement, an informal proof, and a translated formal proof that passes the prover validation. We perform extensive analysis and demonstrate that MUSTARD generates validated high-quality step-by-step data. We further apply the MUSTARDSAUCE for fine-tuning smaller language models. The fine-tuned Llama 2-7B achieves a 15.41% average relative performance gain in automated theorem proving, and 8.18% in math word problems.

Using Counterfactual Tasks to Evaluate the Generality of Analogical Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Martha Lewis, Melanie Mitchell","Large language models (LLMs) have performed well on several reasoning benchmarks, including ones that test analogical reasoning abilities. However, it has been debated whether they are actually performing humanlike abstract reasoning or instead employing less general processes that rely on similarity to what has been seen in their training data. Here we investigate the generality of analogy-making abilities previously claimed for LLMs (Webb, Holyoak, & Lu, 2023). We take one set of analogy problems used to evaluate LLMs and create a set of ""counterfactual"" variants-versions that test the same abstract reasoning abilities but that are likely dissimilar from any pre-training data. We test humans and three GPT models on both the original and counterfactual problems, and show that, while the performance of humans remains high for all the problems, the GPT models' performance declines sharply on the counterfactual set. This work provides evidence that, despite previously reported successes of LLMs on analogical reasoning, these models lack the robustness and generality of human analogy-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08955v1,2024-02
Premise Order Matters in Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Xinyun Chen, Ryan A. Chi, Xuezhi Wang, Denny Zhou","Large language models (LLMs) have accomplished remarkable reasoning performance in various domains. However, in the domain of reasoning tasks, we discover a frailty: LLMs are surprisingly brittle to the ordering of the premises, despite the fact that such ordering does not alter the underlying task. In particular, we observe that LLMs achieve the best performance when the premise order aligns with the context required in intermediate reasoning steps. For example, in deductive reasoning tasks, presenting the premises in the same order as the ground truth proof in the prompt (as opposed to random ordering) drastically increases the model's accuracy. We first examine the effect of premise ordering on deductive reasoning on a variety of LLMs, and our evaluation shows that permuting the premise order can cause a performance drop of over 30%. In addition, we release the benchmark R-GSM, based on GSM8K, to examine the ordering effect for mathematical problem-solving, and we again observe a significant drop in accuracy, relative to the original GSM8K benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08939v3,2024-02
MaxMin-RLHF: Alignment with Diverse Human Preferences,"Souradip Chakraborty, Jiahao Qiu, Hui Yuan, Alec Koppel, Furong Huang, Dinesh Manocha, Amrit Singh Bedi, Mengdi Wang","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns language models to human preferences by employing a singular reward model derived from preference data. However, such an approach overlooks the rich diversity of human preferences inherent in data collected from multiple users. In this work, we first derive an impossibility result of alignment with single reward RLHF, thereby highlighting its insufficiency in representing diverse human preferences. To provide an equitable solution to the problem, we learn a mixture of preference distributions via an expectation-maximization algorithm and propose a MaxMin alignment objective for policy learning inspired by the Egalitarian principle in social choice theory to better represent diverse human preferences. We elucidate the connection of our proposed approach to distributionally robust optimization and general utility RL, thereby highlighting the generality and robustness of our proposed solution. We present comprehensive experimental results on small-scale (GPT-2) and large-scale language models (with Tulu2-7B) and show the efficacy of the proposed approach in the presence of diversity among human preferences. Our algorithm achieves an average improvement of more than 16% in win-rates over conventional RLHF algorithms and improves the win-rate (accuracy) for minority groups by over 33% without compromising the performance of majority groups, showcasing the robustness and fairness of our approach. We remark that our findings in this work are not only limited to language models but also extend to reinforcement learning in general.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08925v2,2024-02
Regional inflation analysis using social network data,"Vasilii Chsherbakov, Ilia Karpov","Inflation is one of the most important macroeconomic indicators that have a great impact on the population of any country and region. Inflation is influenced by range of factors, one of which is inflation expectations. Many central banks take this factor into consideration while implementing monetary policy within the inflation targeting regime. Nowadays, a lot of people are active users of the Internet, especially social networks. There is a hypothesis that people search, read, and discuss mainly only those issues that are of particular interest to them. It is logical to assume that the dynamics of prices may also be in the focus of user discussions. So, such discussions could be regarded as an alternative source of more rapid information about inflation expectations. This study is based on unstructured data from Vkontakte social network to analyze upward and downward inflationary trends (on the example of the Omsk region). The sample of more than 8.5 million posts was collected between January 2010 and May 2022. The authors used BERT neural networks to solve the problem. These models demonstrated better results than the benchmarks (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree classifier, etc.). It makes possible to define pro-inflationary and disinflationary types of keywords in different contexts and get their visualization with SHAP method. This analysis provides additional operational information about inflationary processes at the regional level The proposed approach can be scaled for other regions. At the same time the limitation of the work is the time and power costs for the initial training of similar models for all regions of Russia.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00774v2,2024-02
UniEnc-CASSNAT: An Encoder-only Non-autoregressive ASR for Speech SSL Models,"Ruchao Fan, Natarajan Balaji Shanka, Abeer Alwan","Non-autoregressive automatic speech recognition (NASR) models have gained attention due to their parallelism and fast inference. The encoder-based NASR, e.g. connectionist temporal classification (CTC), can be initialized from the speech foundation models (SFM) but does not account for any dependencies among intermediate tokens. The encoder-decoder-based NASR, like CTC alignment-based single-step non-autoregressive transformer (CASS-NAT), can mitigate the dependency problem but is not able to efficiently integrate SFM. Inspired by the success of recent work of speech-text joint pre-training with a shared transformer encoder, we propose a new encoder-based NASR, UniEnc-CASSNAT, to combine the advantages of CTC and CASS-NAT. UniEnc-CASSNAT consists of only an encoder as the major module, which can be the SFM. The encoder plays the role of both the CASS-NAT encoder and decoder by two forward passes. The first pass of the encoder accepts the speech signal as input, while the concatenation of the speech signal and the token-level acoustic embedding is used as the input for the second pass. Examined on the Librispeech 100h, MyST, and Aishell1 datasets, the proposed UniEnc-CASSNAT achieves state-of-the-art NASR results and is better or comparable to CASS-NAT with only an encoder and hence, fewer model parameters. Our codes are publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08898v1,2024-02
Recurrent Alignment with Hard Attention for Hierarchical Text Rating,"Chenxi Lin, Jiayu Ren, Guoxiu He, Zhuoren Jiang, Haiyan Yu, Xiaomin Zhu","While large language models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating plain text, they are not tailored to handle hierarchical text structures or directly predict task-specific properties such as text rating. In fact, selectively and repeatedly grasping the hierarchical structure of large-scale text is pivotal for deciphering its essence. To this end, we propose a novel framework for hierarchical text rating utilizing LLMs, which incorporates Recurrent Alignment with Hard Attention (RAHA). Particularly, hard attention mechanism prompts a frozen LLM to selectively focus on pertinent leaf texts associated with the root text and generate symbolic representations of their relationships. Inspired by the gradual stabilization of the Markov Chain, recurrent alignment strategy involves feeding predicted ratings iteratively back into the prompts of another trainable LLM, aligning it to progressively approximate the desired target. Experimental results demonstrate that RAHA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on three hierarchical text rating datasets. Theoretical and empirical analysis confirms RAHA's ability to gradually converge towards the underlying target through multiple inferences. Additional experiments on plain text rating datasets verify the effectiveness of this Markov-like alignment.

An Embarrassingly Simple Approach for LLM with Strong ASR Capacity,"Ziyang Ma, Guanrou Yang, Yifan Yang, Zhifu Gao, Jiaming Wang, Zhihao Du, Fan Yu, Qian Chen, Siqi Zheng, Shiliang Zhang, Xie Chen","In this paper, we focus on solving one of the most important tasks in the field of speech processing, i.e., automatic speech recognition (ASR), with speech foundation encoders and large language models (LLM). Recent works have complex designs such as compressing the output temporally for the speech encoder, tackling modal alignment for the projector, and utilizing parameter-efficient fine-tuning for the LLM. We found that delicate designs are not necessary, while an embarrassingly simple composition of off-the-shelf speech encoder, LLM, and the only trainable linear projector is competent for the ASR task. To be more specific, we benchmark and explore various combinations of LLMs and speech encoders, leading to the optimal LLM-based ASR system, which we call SLAM-ASR. The proposed SLAM-ASR provides a clean setup and little task-specific design, where only the linear projector is trained. To the best of our knowledge, SLAM-ASR achieves the best performance on the Librispeech benchmark among LLM-based ASR models and even outperforms the latest LLM-based audio-universal model trained on massive pair data. Finally, we explore the capability emergence of LLM-based ASR in the process of modal alignment. We hope that our study can facilitate the research on extending LLM with cross-modality capacity and shed light on the LLM-based ASR community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08846v1,2024-02
Learning to Generate Context-Sensitive Backchannel Smiles for Embodied AI Agents with Applications in Mental Health Dialogues,"Maneesh Bilalpur, Mert Inan, Dorsa Zeinali, Jeffrey F. Cohn, Malihe Alikhani","Addressing the critical shortage of mental health resources for effective screening, diagnosis, and treatment remains a significant challenge. This scarcity underscores the need for innovative solutions, particularly in enhancing the accessibility and efficacy of therapeutic support. Embodied agents with advanced interactive capabilities emerge as a promising and cost-effective supplement to traditional caregiving methods. Crucial to these agents' effectiveness is their ability to simulate non-verbal behaviors, like backchannels, that are pivotal in establishing rapport and understanding in therapeutic contexts but remain under-explored. To improve the rapport-building capabilities of embodied agents we annotated backchannel smiles in videos of intimate face-to-face conversations over topics such as mental health, illness, and relationships. We hypothesized that both speaker and listener behaviors affect the duration and intensity of backchannel smiles. Using cues from speech prosody and language along with the demographics of the speaker and listener, we found them to contain significant predictors of the intensity of backchannel smiles. Based on our findings, we introduce backchannel smile production in embodied agents as a generation problem. Our attention-based generative model suggests that listener information offers performance improvements over the baseline speaker-centric generation approach. Conditioned generation using the significant predictors of smile intensity provides statistically significant improvements in empirical measures of generation quality. Our user study by transferring generated smiles to an embodied agent suggests that agent with backchannel smiles is perceived to be more human-like and is an attractive alternative for non-personal conversations over agent without backchannel smiles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08837v1,2024-02

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in generalist modeling and out-of-domain generalizability in many fields. Toward fully unleashing their power for e-commerce, in this paper, we construct ECInstruct, the first open-sourced, large-scale, and high-quality benchmark instruction dataset for e-commerce.

Sequence graphs realizations and ambiguity in language models,"Sammy Khalife, Yann Ponty, Laurent Bulteau","Several popular language models represent local contexts in an input text as bags of words. Such representations are naturally encoded by a sequence graph whose vertices are the distinct words occurring in x, with edges representing the (ordered) co-occurrence of two words within a sliding window of size w. However, this compressed representation is not generally bijective, and may introduce some degree of ambiguity. Some sequence graphs may admit several realizations as a sequence, while others may not admit any realization. In this paper, we study the realizability and ambiguity of sequence graphs from a combinatorial and computational point of view. We consider the existence and enumeration of realizations of a sequence graph under multiple settings: window size w, presence/absence of graph orientation, and presence/absence of weights (multiplicities). When w = 2, we provide polynomial time algorithms for realizability and enumeration in all cases except the undirected/weighted setting, where we show the #P-hardness of enumeration. For a window of size at least 3, we prove hardness of all variants, even when w is considered as a constant, with the notable exception of the undirected/unweighted case for which we propose an XP algorithms for both (realizability and enumeration) problems, tight due to a corresponding W[1]-hardness result. We conclude with an integer program formulation to solve the realizability problem, and with dynamic programming to solve the enumeration problem. This work leaves open the membership to NP for both problems, a non-trivial question due to the existence of minimum realizations having exponential size on the instance encoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08830v1,2024-02
Syllable based DNN-HMM Cantonese Speech to Text System,"Timothy Wong, Claire Li, Sam Lam, Billy Chiu, Qin Lu, Minglei Li, Dan Xiong, Roy Shing Yu, Vincent T. Y.

This is a part of an effort in building a STT system to aid dyslexic students who have cognitive deficiency in writing skills but have no problem expressing their ideas through speech. For Cantonese speech recognition, the basic unit of acoustic models can either be the conventional Initial-Final (IF) syllables, or the Onset-Nucleus-Coda (ONC) syllables where finals are further split into nucleus and coda to reflect the intra-syllable variations in Cantonese. By using the Kaldi toolkit, our system is trained using the stochastic gradient descent optimization model with the aid of GPUs for the hybrid Deep Neural Network and Hidden Markov Model (DNN-HMM) with and without I-vector based speaker adaptive training technique. The input features of the same Gaussian Mixture Model with speaker adaptive training (GMM-SAT) to DNN are used in all cases.

We envision LLM unlearning becoming a pivotal element in the life-cycle management of LLMs, potentially standing as an essential foundation for developing generative AI that is not only safe, secure, and trustworthy, but also resource-efficient without the need of full retraining. We navigate the unlearning landscape in LLMs from conceptual formulation, methodologies, metrics, and applications. In particular, we highlight the often-overlooked aspects of existing LLM unlearning research, e.g., unlearning scope, data-model interaction, and multifaceted efficacy assessment.

In this paper, we propose InstructGraph, a framework that empowers LLMs with the abilities of graph reasoning and generation by instruction tuning and preference alignment. Specifically, we first propose a structured format verbalizer to unify all graph data into a universal code-like format, which can simply represent the graph without any external graph-specific encoders. Furthermore, a graph instruction tuning stage is introduced to guide LLMs in solving graph reasoning and generation tasks. Finally, we identify potential hallucination problems in graph tasks and sample negative instances for preference alignment, the target of which is to enhance the output's reliability of the model.

DNABERT-S: Pioneering Species Differentiation with Species-Aware DNA Embeddings,"Zhihan Zhou, Weimin Wu, Harrison Ho, Jiayi Wang, Lizhen Shi, Ramana V Davuluri, Zhong Wang, Han Liu","We introduce DNABERT-S, a tailored genome model that develops species-aware embeddings to naturally cluster and segregate DNA sequences of different species in the embedding space. Differentiating species from genomic sequences (i.e., DNA and RNA) is vital yet challenging, since many real-world species remain uncharacterized, lacking known genomes for reference. Embedding-based methods are therefore used to differentiate species in an unsupervised manner. DNABERT-S builds upon a pre-trained genome foundation model named DNABERT-2. To encourage effective embeddings to error-prone long-read DNA sequences, we introduce Manifold Instance Mixup (MI-Mix), a contrastive objective that mixes the hidden representations of DNA sequences at randomly selected layers and trains the model to recognize and differentiate these mixed proportions at the output layer. We further enhance it with the proposed Curriculum Contrastive Learning (C$^2$LR) strategy. Empirical results on 23 diverse datasets show DNABERT-S's effectiveness, especially in realistic label-scarce scenarios. For example, it identifies twice more species from a mixture of unlabeled genomic sequences, doubles the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) in species clustering, and outperforms the top baseline's performance in 10-shot species classification with just a 2-shot training.

"GLoRe: When, Where, and How to Improve LLM Reasoning via Global and Local Refinements","Alex Havrilla, Sharath Raparthy, Christoforus Nalmpantis, Jane Dwivedi-Yu, Maksym Zhuravinskyi, Eric Hambro, Roberta Raileanu","State-of-the-art language models can exhibit impressive reasoning refinement capabilities on math, science or coding tasks. However, recent work demonstrates that even the best models struggle to identify \textit{when and where to refine} without access to external feedback. Outcome-based Reward Models (\textbf{ORMs}), trained to predict correctness of the final answer indicating when to refine, offer one convenient solution for deciding when to refine. Process Based Reward Models (\textbf{PRMs}), trained to predict correctness of intermediate steps, can then be used to indicate where to refine. But they are expensive to train, requiring extensive human annotations. In this paper, we propose Stepwise ORMs (\textbf{SORMs}) which are trained, only on synthetic data, to approximate the expected future reward of the optimal policy or $V^{\star}$. More specifically, SORMs are trained to predict the correctness of the final answer when sampling the current policy many times (rather than only once as in the case of ORMs). Our experiments show that SORMs can more accurately detect incorrect reasoning steps compared to ORMs, thus improving downstream accuracy when doing refinements. We then train \textit{global} refinement models, which take only the question and a draft solution as input and predict a corrected solution, and \textit{local} refinement models which also take as input a critique indicating the location of the first reasoning error. We generate training data for both models synthetically by reusing data used to train the SORM. We find combining global and local refinements, using the ORM as a reranker, significantly outperforms either one individually, as well as a best of three sample baseline. With this strategy we can improve the accuracy of a LLaMA-2 13B model (already fine-tuned with RL) on GSM8K from 53\% to 65\% when greedily sampled.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10963v2,2024-02
Measuring and Controlling Instruction (In)Stability in Language Model Dialogs,"Kenneth Li, Tianle Liu, Naomi Bashkansky, David Bau, Fernanda Viégas, Hanspeter Pfister, Martin Wattenberg","System-prompting is a standard tool for customizing language-model chatbots, enabling them to follow a specific instruction. An implicit assumption in the use of system prompts is that they will be stable, so the chatbot will continue to generate text according to the stipulated instructions for the duration of a conversation. We propose a quantitative benchmark to test this assumption, evaluating instruction stability via self-chats between two instructed chatbots. Testing popular models like LLaMA2-chat-70B and GPT-3.5, we reveal a significant instruction drift within eight rounds of conversations. An empirical and theoretical analysis of this phenomenon suggests the transformer attention mechanism plays a role, due to attention decay over long exchanges. To combat attention decay and instruction drift, we propose a lightweight method called split-softmax, which compares favorably against two strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10962v4,2024-02
A Dataset for the Detection of Dehumanizing Language,"Paul Engelmann, Peter Brunsgaard Trolle, Christian Hardmeier","Dehumanization is a mental process that enables the exclusion and ill treatment of a group of people. In this paper, we present two data sets of dehumanizing text, a large, automatically collected corpus and a smaller, manually annotated data set. Both data sets include a combination of political discourse and dialogue from movie subtitles. Our methods give us a broad and varied amount of dehumanization data to work with, enabling further exploratory analysis and automatic classification of dehumanization patterns. Both data sets will be publicly released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08764v1,2024-02
JAMDEC: Unsupervised Authorship Obfuscation using Constrained Decoding over Small Language Models,"Jillian Fisher, Ximing Lu, Jaehun Jung, Liwei Jiang, Zaid Harchaoui, Yejin Choi","The permanence of online content combined with the enhanced authorship identification techniques calls for stronger computational methods to protect the identity and privacy of online authorship when needed, e.g., blind reviews for scientific papers, anonymous online reviews, or anonymous interactions in the mental health forums. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised inference-time approach to authorship obfuscation to address the unique challenges of authorship obfuscation: lack of supervision data for diverse authorship and domains, and the need for a sufficient level of revision beyond simple paraphrasing to obfuscate the authorship, all the while preserving the original content and fluency.   We introduce JAMDEC, a user-controlled, inference-time algorithm for authorship obfuscation that can be in principle applied to any text and authorship. Our approach builds on small language models such as GPT2-XL in order to help avoid disclosing the original content to proprietary LLM's APIs, while also reducing the performance gap between small and large language models via algorithmic enhancement. The key idea behind our approach is to boost the creative power of smaller language models through constrained decoding, while also allowing for user-specified controls and flexibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach based on GPT2-XL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods based on comparably small models, while performing competitively against GPT3.5 175B, a propriety model that is two orders of magnitudes larger.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08761v1,2024-02
Learning How To Ask: Cycle-Consistency Refines Prompts in Multimodal Foundation Models,"Maurice Diesendruck, Jianzhe Lin, Shima Imani, Gayathri Mahalingam, Mingyang Xu, Jie Zhao","When LLMs perform zero-shot inference, they typically use a prompt with a task specification, and generate a completion. However, there is no work to explore the possibility of the reverse - going from completion to task specification. In this paper, we employ both directions to perform cycle-supervised learning entirely in-context. Our goal is to create a forward map f : X -> Y (e.g. image -> generated caption), coupled with a backward map g : Y -> X (e.g. caption -> generated image) to construct a cycle-consistency ""loss"" (formulated as an update to the prompt) to enforce g(f(X)) ~= X. The technique, called CyclePrompt, uses cycle-consistency as a free supervisory signal to iteratively craft the prompt. Importantly, CyclePrompt reinforces model performance without expensive fine-tuning, without training data, and without the complexity of external environments (e.g. compilers, APIs). We demonstrate CyclePrompt in two domains: code generation and image captioning. Our results on the HumanEval coding benchmark put us in first place on the leaderboard among models that do not rely on extra training data or usage of external environments, and third overall. Compared to the GPT4 baseline, we improve accuracy from 80.5% to 87.2%. In the vision-language space, we generate detailed image captions which outperform baseline zero-shot GPT4V captions, when tested against natural (VQAv2) and diagrammatic (FigureQA) visual question-answering benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of self-supervised learning for prompting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08756v1,2024-02
Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Classifier-Free Guidance,"Linxi Zhao, Yihe Deng, Weitong Zhang, Quanquan Gu","The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has increasingly highlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existing objects in the images. To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either expensive training/fine-tuning or API access to advanced LLMs to correct the model's output post-generation. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by introducing a framework called Mitigating hallucinAtion via classifieR-Free guIdaNcE (MARINE), which is both training-free and API-free, and can effectively and efficiently reduce object hallucinations during the generation process. Specifically, MARINE enriches the visual context of LVLMs by integrating existing open-source vision models, and employs classifier-free guidance to incorporate the additional object grounding features to improve the precision of LVLMs' generations. Through comprehensive evaluations across $6$ popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably, it not only reduces hallucinations but also improves the detailedness of LVLMs' generations, as assessed by GPT-4V.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08680v1,2024-02
COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability,"Xingang Guo, Fangxu Yu, Huan Zhang, Lianhui Qin, Bin Hu","Jailbreaks on large language models (LLMs) have recently received increasing attention. For a comprehensive assessment of LLM safety, it is essential to consider jailbreaks with diverse attributes, such as contextual coherence and sentiment/stylistic variations, and hence it is beneficial to study controllable jailbreaking, i.e. how to enforce control on LLM attacks. In this paper, we formally formulate the controllable attack generation problem, and build a novel connection between this problem and controllable text generation, a well-explored topic of natural language processing. Based on this connection, we adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm in controllable text generation, and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. The controllability enabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios which not only cover the standard setting of generating fluent (suffix) attack with continuation constraint, but also allow us to address new controllable attack settings such as revising a user query adversarially with paraphrasing constraint, and inserting stealthy attacks in context with position constraint. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral, Vicuna, Guanaco, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) show COLD-Attack's broad applicability, strong controllability, high success rate, and attack transferability. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Fangxu/COLD-Attack.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08679v2,2024-02
Improving Generalization in Semantic Parsing by Increasing Natural Language Variation,"Irina Saparina, Mirella Lapata","Text-to-SQL semantic parsing has made significant progress in recent years, with various models demonstrating impressive performance on the challenging Spider benchmark. However, it has also been shown that these models often struggle to generalize even when faced with small perturbations of previously (accurately) parsed expressions. This is mainly due to the linguistic form of questions in Spider which are overly specific, unnatural, and display limited variation. In this work, we use data augmentation to enhance the robustness of text-to-SQL parsers against natural language variations. Existing approaches generate question reformulations either via models trained on Spider or only introduce local changes. In contrast, we leverage the capabilities of large language models to generate more realistic and diverse questions. Using only a few prompts, we achieve a two-fold increase in the number of questions in Spider. Training on this augmented dataset yields substantial improvements on a range of evaluation sets, including robustness benchmarks and out-of-domain data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08666v1,2024-02
Tandem Transformers for Inference Efficient LLMs,"Aishwarya P S, Pranav Ajit Nair, Yashas Samaga, Toby Boyd, Sanjiv Kumar, Prateek Jain, Praneeth Netrapalli","The autoregressive nature of conventional large language models (LLMs) inherently limits inference speed, as tokens are generated sequentially. While speculative and parallel decoding techniques attempt to mitigate this, they face limitations: either relying on less accurate smaller models for generation or failing to fully leverage the base LLM's representations.   We introduce a novel architecture, Tandem transformers, to address these issues. This architecture uniquely combines (1) a small autoregressive model and (2) a large model operating in block mode (processing multiple tokens simultaneously). The small model's predictive accuracy is substantially enhanced by granting it attention to the large model's richer representations. On the PaLM2 pretraining dataset, a tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko demonstrates a 3.3% improvement in next-token prediction accuracy over a standalone PaLM2-Gecko, offering a 1.16x speedup compared to a PaLM2-Otter model with comparable downstream performance. We further incorporate the tandem model within the speculative decoding (SPEED) framework where the large model validates tokens from the small model. This ensures that the Tandem of PaLM2-Bison and PaLM2-Gecko achieves substantial speedup (around 1.14x faster than using vanilla PaLM2-Gecko in SPEED) while maintaining identical downstream task accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08644v4,2024-02

Knowledge Editing on Black-box Large Language Models,"Xiaoshuai Song, Zhengyang Wang, Keqing He, Guanting Dong, Yutao Mou, Jinxu Zhao, Weiran Xu","Knowledge editing (KE) aims to efficiently and precisely modify the behavior of large language models (LLMs) to update specific knowledge without negatively influencing other knowledge. Current research primarily focuses on white-box LLMs editing, overlooking an important scenario: black-box LLMs editing, where LLMs are accessed through interfaces and only textual output is available. In this paper, we first officially introduce KE on black-box LLMs and then propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to overcome the limitations of existing evaluations that are not applicable to black-box LLMs editing and lack comprehensiveness. To tackle privacy leaks of editing data and style over-editing in current methods, we introduce a novel postEdit framework, resolving privacy concerns through downstream post-processing and maintaining textual style consistency via fine-grained editing to original responses. Experiments and analysis on two benchmarks demonstrate that postEdit outperforms all baselines and achieves strong generalization, especially with huge improvements on style retention (average $+20.82\%\uparrow$).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08631v2,2024-02
Bayesian Multi-Task Transfer Learning for Soft Prompt Tuning,"Haeju Lee, Minchan Jeong, Se-Young Yun, Kee-Eung Kim","Prompt tuning, in which prompts are optimized to adapt large-scale pre-trained language models to downstream tasks instead of fine-tuning the full model parameters, has been shown to be particularly effective when the prompts are trained in a multi-task transfer learning setting. These methods generally involve individually training prompts for each source task and then aggregating them to provide the initialization of the prompt for the target task. However, this approach critically ignores the fact that some of the source tasks could be negatively or positively interfering with each other. We argue that when we extract knowledge from source tasks via training source prompts, we need to consider this correlation among source tasks for better transfer to target tasks. To this end, we propose a Bayesian approach where we work with the posterior distribution of prompts across source tasks. We obtain representative source prompts corresponding to the samples from the posterior utilizing Stein Variational Gradient Descent, which are then aggregated to constitute the initial target prompt. We show extensive experimental results on the standard benchmark NLP tasks, where our Bayesian multi-task transfer learning approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in many settings. Furthermore, our approach requires no auxiliary models other than the prompt itself, achieving a high degree of parameter efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08594v1,2024-02
PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST): Integrating Human Feedback and Heuristic-based Sampling,"Yongchao Chen, Jacob Arkin, Yilun Hao, Yang Zhang, Nicholas Roy, Chuchu Fan","Prompt optimization aims to find the best prompt to a large language model (LLM) for a given task. LLMs have been successfully used to help find and improve prompt candidates for single-step tasks. However, realistic tasks for agents are multi-step and introduce new challenges: (1) Prompt content is likely to be more extensive and complex, making it more difficult for LLMs to analyze errors, (2) the impact of an individual step is difficult to evaluate, and (3) different people may have varied preferences about task execution. While humans struggle to optimize prompts, they are good at providing feedback about LLM outputs; we therefore introduce a new LLM-driven discrete prompt optimization framework PRompt Optimization in Multi-Step Tasks (PROMST) that incorporates human-designed feedback rules to automatically offer direct suggestions for improvement. We also use an extra learned heuristic model that predicts prompt performance to efficiently sample from prompt candidates. This approach significantly outperforms both human-engineered prompts and several other prompt optimization methods across 11 representative multi-step tasks (an average 10.6\%-29.3\% improvement to current best methods on five LLMs respectively). We believe our work can serve as a benchmark for automatic prompt optimization for LLM-driven multi-step tasks. Datasets and Codes are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/PROMST.

Improving Factual Error Correction for Abstractive Summarization via Data Distillation and Conditional-generation Cloze,"Yiyang Li, Lei Li, Dingxin Hu, Xueyi Hao, Marina Litvak, Natalia Vanetik, Yanquan Zhou","Improving factual consistency in abstractive summarization has been a focus of current research. One promising approach is the post-editing method. However, previous works have yet to make sufficient use of factual factors in summaries and suffers from the negative effect of the training datasets. In this paper, we first propose a novel factual error correction model FactCloze based on a conditional-generation cloze task. FactCloze can construct the causality among factual factors while being able to determine whether the blank can be answered or not. Then, we propose a data distillation method to generate a more faithful summarization dataset SummDSC via multiple-dimensional evaluation. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach, which leads to an improvement in multiple factual consistency metrics compared to baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08581v1,2024-02
Test-Time Backdoor Attacks on Multimodal Large Language Models,"Dong Lu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Xianjun Yang, Min Lin","Backdoor attacks are commonly executed by contaminating training data, such that a trigger can activate predetermined harmful effects during the test phase. In this work, we present AnyDoor, a test-time backdoor attack against multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which involves injecting the backdoor into the textual modality using adversarial test images (sharing the same universal perturbation), without requiring access to or modification of the training data. AnyDoor employs similar techniques used in universal adversarial attacks, but distinguishes itself by its ability to decouple the timing of setup and activation of harmful effects. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of AnyDoor against popular MLLMs such as LLaVA-1.5, MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP, and BLIP-2, as well as provide comprehensive ablation studies. Notably, because the backdoor is injected by a universal perturbation, AnyDoor can dynamically change its backdoor trigger prompts/harmful effects, exposing a new challenge for defending against backdoor attacks.

Agent Smith: A Single Image Can Jailbreak One Million Multimodal LLM Agents Exponentially Fast,"Xiangming Gu, Xiaosen Zheng, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Ye Wang, Jing Jiang, Min Lin","A multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent can receive instructions, capture images, retrieve histories from memory, and decide which tools to use. Nonetheless, red-teaming efforts have revealed that adversarial images/prompts can jailbreak an MLLM and cause unaligned behaviors. In this work, we report an even more severe safety issue in multi-agent environments, referred to as infectious jailbreak. It entails the adversary simply jailbreaking a single agent, and without any further intervention from the adversary, (almost) all agents will become infected exponentially fast and exhibit harmful behaviors. To validate the feasibility of infectious jailbreak, we simulate multi-agent environments containing up to one million LLaVA-1.5 agents, and employ randomized pair-wise chat as a proof-of-concept instantiation for multi-agent interaction. Our results show that feeding an (infectious) adversarial image into the memory of any randomly chosen agent is sufficient to achieve infectious jailbreak. Finally, we derive a simple principle for determining whether a defense mechanism can provably restrain the spread of infectious jailbreak, but how to design a practical defense that meets this principle remains an open question to investigate.

Higher Layers Need More LoRA Experts,"Chongyang Gao, Kezhen Chen, Jinmeng Rao, Baochen Sun, Ruibo Liu, Daiyi Peng, Yawen Zhang, Xiaoyuan Guo, Jie Yang, VS Subrahmanian","Parameter-efficient tuning (PEFT) techniques like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offer training efficiency on Large Language Models, but their impact on model performance remains limited. Recent efforts integrate LoRA and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to improve the performance of PEFT methods. Despite promising results, research on improving the efficiency of LoRA with MoE is still in its early stages. Recent studies have shown that experts in the MoE architecture have different strengths and also exhibit some redundancy. Does this statement also apply to parameter-efficient MoE? In this paper, we introduce a novel parameter-efficient MoE method, \textit{\textbf{M}oE-L\textbf{o}RA with \textbf{L}ayer-wise Expert \textbf{A}llocation (MoLA)} for Transformer-based models, where each model layer has the flexibility to employ a varying number of LoRA experts. We investigate several architectures with varying layer-wise expert configurations. Experiments on six well-known NLP and commonsense QA benchmarks demonstrate that MoLA achieves equal or superior performance compared to all baselines. We find that allocating more LoRA experts to higher layers further enhances the effectiveness of models with a certain number of experts in total. With much fewer parameters, this allocation strategy outperforms the setting with the same number of experts in every layer. This work can be widely used as a plug-and-play parameter-efficient tuning approach for various applications.

Can LLMs Learn New Concepts Incrementally without Forgetting?,"Junhao Zheng, Shengjie Qiu, Qianli Ma","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various tasks, yet their ability to learn incrementally without forgetting remains underexplored. Incremental learning (IL) is crucial as it enables models to acquire new knowledge while retaining previously learned information, akin to human learning. Existing benchmarks for IL are insufficient due to data leakage issues and the overqualification of LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Concept-1K, a novel dataset comprising 1,023 recently emerged concepts across diverse domains. The concepts in Concept-1K are discrete, interpretable units of knowledge that allow for fine-grained analysis of learning and forgetting processes. Using Concept-1K as a testbed, we aim to answer the question: ``Can LLMs learn new concepts incrementally without forgetting like humans?'' Our investigation reveals that LLMs still suffer from catastrophic forgetting and that LoRA, despite fine-tuning fewer parameters, may lead to more forgetting on training data. Additionally, we explore the roles of in-context learning, model scale, buffer size, and pretraining in IL performance. These findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in IL scenarios and provide a robust benchmark for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08526v3,2024-02
Auditing Counterfire: Evaluating Advanced Counterargument Generation with Evidence and Style,"Preetika Verma, Kokil Jaidka, Svetlana Churina","We audited large language models (LLMs) for their ability to create evidence-based and stylistic counter-arguments to posts from the Reddit ChangeMyView dataset. We benchmarked their rhetorical quality across a host of qualitative and quantitative metrics and then ultimately evaluated them on their persuasive abilities as compared to human counter-arguments. Our evaluation is based on Counterfire: a new dataset of 32,000 counter-arguments generated from large language models (LLMs): GPT-3.5 Turbo and Koala and their fine-tuned variants, and PaLM 2, with varying prompts for evidence use and argumentative style. GPT-3.5 Turbo ranked highest in argument quality with strong paraphrasing and style adherence, particularly in `reciprocity' style arguments. However, the stylistic counter-arguments still fall short of human persuasive standards, where people also preferred reciprocal to evidence-based rebuttals. The findings suggest that a balance between evidentiality and stylistic elements is vital to a compelling counter-argument.

Plausible Extractive Rationalization through Semi-Supervised Entailment Signal,"Wei Jie Yeo, Ranjan Satapathy, Erik Cambria","The increasing use of complex and opaque black box models requires the adoption of interpretable measures, one such option is extractive rationalizing models, which serve as a more interpretable alternative. These models, also known as Explain-Then-Predict models, employ an explainer model to extract rationales and subsequently condition the predictor with the extracted information. Their primary objective is to provide precise and faithful explanations, represented by the extracted rationales. In this paper, we take a semi-supervised approach to optimize for the plausibility of extracted rationales. We adopt a pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) model and further fine-tune it on a small set of supervised rationales ($10\%$). The NLI predictor is leveraged as a source of supervisory signals to the explainer via entailment alignment. We show that, by enforcing the alignment agreement between the explanation and answer in a question-answering task, the performance can be improved without access to ground truth labels. We evaluate our approach on the ERASER dataset and show that our approach achieves comparable results with supervised extractive models and outperforms unsupervised approaches by $> 100\%$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08479v5,2024-02
Lying Blindly: Bypassing ChatGPT's Safeguards to Generate Hard-to-Detect Disinformation Claims,"Freddy Heppell, Mehmet E. Bakir, Kalina Bontcheva","As Large Language Models become more proficient, their misuse in coordinated disinformation campaigns is a growing concern. This study explores the capability of ChatGPT with GPT-3.5 to generate short-form disinformation claims about the war in Ukraine, both in general and on a specific event, which is beyond the GPT-3.5 knowledge cutoff. Unlike prior work, we do not provide the model with human-written disinformation narratives by including them in the prompt. Thus the generated short claims are hallucinations based on prior world knowledge and inference from the minimal prompt. With a straightforward prompting technique, we are able to bypass model safeguards and generate numerous short claims. We compare those against human-authored false claims on the war in Ukraine from ClaimReview, specifically with respect to differences in their linguistic properties. We also evaluate whether AI authorship can be differentiated by human readers or state-of-the-art authorship detection tools. Thus, we demonstrate that ChatGPT can produce realistic, target-specific disinformation claims, even on a specific post-cutoff event, and that they cannot be reliably distinguished by humans or existing automated tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08467v2,2024-02
LLMs and the Human Condition,Peter Wallis,"Theory based AI research has had a hard time recently and the aim here is to propose a model of what LLMs are actually doing when they impress us with their language skills. The model integrates three established theories of human decision-making from philosophy, sociology, and computer science. The paper starts with the collective understanding of reasoning from the early days of AI research - primarily because that model is how we humans think we think, and is the most accessible. It then describes what is commonly thought of as ""reactive systems"" which is the position taken by many philosophers and indeed many contemporary AI researchers.

Punctuation Restoration Improves Structure Understanding without Supervision,"Junghyun Min, Minho Lee, Woochul Lee, Yeonsoo Lee","Unsupervised learning objectives like language modeling and de-noising constitute a significant part in producing pre-trained models that perform various downstream applications from natural language understanding to conversational tasks. However, despite impressive generative capabilities of recent large language models, their abilities to capture syntactic or semantic structure within text lag behind. We hypothesize that the mismatch between linguistic performance and competence in machines is attributable to insufficient transfer of linguistic structure knowledge to computational systems with currently popular pre-training objectives. We show that punctuation restoration as a learning objective improves in- and out-of-distribution performance on structure-related tasks like named entity recognition, open information extraction, chunking, and part-of-speech tagging. Punctuation restoration is an effective learning objective that can improve structure understanding and yield a more robust structure-aware representations of natural language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08382v2,2024-02
Evaluating the Data Model Robustness of Text-to-SQL Systems Based on Real User Queries,"Jonathan Fürst, Catherine Kosten, Farhad Nooralahzadeh, Yi Zhang, Kurt Stockinger","Text-to-SQL systems (also known as NL-to-SQL systems) have become an increasingly popular solution for bridging the gap between user capabilities and SQL-based data access. These systems translate user requests in natural language to valid SQL statements for a specific database. Recent Text-to-SQL systems have benefited from the rapid improvement of transformer-based language models. However, while Text-to-SQL systems that incorporate such models continuously reach new high scores on -- often synthetic -- benchmark datasets, a systematic exploration of their robustness towards different data models in a real-world, realistic scenario is notably missing. This paper provides the first in-depth evaluation of the data model robustness of Text-to-SQL systems in practice based on a multi-year international project focused on Text-to-SQL interfaces. Our evaluation is based on a real-world deployment of FootballDB, a system that was deployed over a 9 month period in the context of the FIFA World Cup 2022, during which about 6K natural language questions were asked and executed. All of our data is based on real user questions that were asked live to the system. We manually labeled and translated a subset of these questions for three different data models. For each data model, we explore the performance of representative Text-to-SQL systems and language models. We further quantify the impact of training data size, pre-, and post-processing steps as well as language model inference time. Our comprehensive evaluation sheds light on the design choices of real-world Text-to-SQL systems and their impact on moving from research prototypes to real deployments. Last, we provide a new benchmark dataset to the community, which is the first to enable the evaluation of different data models for the same dataset and is substantially more challenging than most previous datasets in terms of query complexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08349v3,2024-02
Eliciting Personality Traits in Large Language Models,"Airlie Hilliard, Cristian Munoz, Zekun Wu, Adriano Soares Koshiyama","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being utilized by both candidates and employers in the recruitment context. However, with this comes numerous ethical concerns, particularly related to the lack of transparency in these ""black-box"" models. Although previous studies have sought to increase the transparency of these models by investigating the personality traits of LLMs, many of the previous studies have provided them with personality assessments to complete. On the other hand, this study seeks to obtain a better understanding of such models by examining their output variations based on different input prompts. Specifically, we use a novel elicitation approach using prompts derived from common interview questions, as well as prompts designed to elicit particular Big Five personality traits to examine whether the models were susceptible to trait-activation like humans are, to measure their personality based on the language used in their outputs. To do so, we repeatedly prompted multiple LMs with different parameter sizes, including Llama-2, Falcon, Mistral, Bloom, GPT, OPT, and XLNet (base and fine tuned versions) and examined their personality using classifiers trained on the myPersonality dataset. Our results reveal that, generally, all LLMs demonstrate high openness and low extraversion. However, whereas LMs with fewer parameters exhibit similar behaviour in personality traits, newer and LMs with more parameters exhibit a broader range of personality traits, with increased agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness. Furthermore, a greater number of parameters is positively associated with openness and conscientiousness. Moreover, fine-tuned models exhibit minor modulations in their personality traits, contingent on the dataset. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08341v2,2024-02
PreFLMR: Scaling Up Fine-Grained Late-Interaction Multi-modal Retrievers,"Weizhe Lin, Jingbiao Mei, Jinghong Chen, Bill Byrne","Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in natural language and visual understanding but are challenged by exacting tasks such as Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) which involve the retrieval of relevant information from document collections to use in shaping answers to questions. We present an extensive training and evaluation framework, M2KR, for KB-VQA. M2KR contains a collection of vision and language tasks which we have incorporated into a single suite of benchmark tasks for training and evaluating general-purpose multi-modal retrievers. We use M2KR to develop PreFLMR, a pre-trained version of the recently developed Fine-grained Late-interaction Multi-modal Retriever (FLMR) approach to KB-VQA, and we report new state-of-the-art results across a range of tasks. We also present investigations into the scaling behaviors of PreFLMR intended to be useful in future developments in general-purpose multi-modal retrievers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08327v2,2024-02
"Values That Are Explicitly Present in Fairy Tales: Comparing Samples from German, Italian and Portuguese Traditions","Alba Morollon Diaz-Faes, Carla Sofia Ribeiro Murteira, Martin Ruskov","Looking at how social values are represented in fairy tales can give insights about the variations in communication of values across cultures. We study how values are communicated in fairy tales from Portugal, Italy and Germany using a technique called word embedding with a compass to quantify vocabulary differences and commonalities. We study how these three national traditions differ in their explicit references to values. To do this, we specify a list of value-charged tokens, consider their word stems and analyse the distance between these in a bespoke pre-trained Word2Vec model. We triangulate and critically discuss the validity of the resulting hypotheses emerging from this quantitative model. Our claim is that this is a reusable and reproducible method for the study of the values explicitly referenced in historical corpora. Finally, our preliminary findings hint at a shared cultural understanding and the expression of values such as Benevolence, Conformity, and Universalism across the studied cultures, suggesting the potential existence of a pan-European cultural memory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08318v3,2024-02
Prompted Contextual Vectors for Spear-Phishing Detection,"Daniel Nahmias, Gal Engelberg, Dan Klein, Asaf Shabtai","Spear-phishing attacks present a significant security challenge, with large language models (LLMs) escalating the threat by generating convincing emails and facilitating target reconnaissance. To address this, we propose a detection approach based on a novel document vectorization method that utilizes an ensemble of LLMs to create representation vectors. By prompting LLMs to reason and respond to human-crafted questions, we quantify the presence of common persuasion principles in the email's content, producing prompted contextual document vectors for a downstream supervised machine learning model. We evaluate our method using a unique dataset generated by a proprietary system that automates target reconnaissance and spear-phishing email creation. Our method achieves a 91\% F1 score in identifying LLM-generated spear-phishing emails, with the training set comprising only traditional phishing and benign emails. Key contributions include a novel document vectorization method utilizing LLM reasoning, a publicly available dataset of high-quality spear-phishing emails, and the demonstrated effectiveness of our method in detecting such emails. This methodology can be utilized for various document classification tasks, particularly in adversarial problem domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08309v3,2024-02
ChatCell: Facilitating Single-Cell Analysis with Natural Language,"Yin Fang, Kangwei Liu, Ningyu Zhang, Xinle Deng, Penghui Yang, Zhuo Chen, Xiangru Tang, Mark Gerstein, Xiaohui Fan, Huajun Chen","As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly evolve, their influence in science is becoming increasingly prominent. The emerging capabilities of LLMs in task generalization and free-form dialogue can significantly advance fields like chemistry and biology. However, the field of single-cell biology, which forms the foundational building blocks of living organisms, still faces several challenges. High knowledge barriers and limited scalability in current methods restrict the full exploitation of LLMs in mastering single-cell data, impeding direct accessibility and rapid iteration. To this end, we introduce ChatCell, which signifies a paradigm shift by facilitating single-cell analysis with natural language. Leveraging vocabulary adaptation and unified sequence generation, ChatCell has acquired profound expertise in single-cell biology and the capability to accommodate a diverse range of analysis tasks. Extensive experiments further demonstrate ChatCell's robust performance and potential to deepen single-cell insights, paving the way for more accessible and intuitive exploration in this pivotal field.

Towards Faithful and Robust LLM Specialists for Evidence-Based Question-Answering,"Tobias Schimanski, Jingwei Ni, Mathias Kraus, Elliott Ash, Markus Leippold","Advances towards more faithful and traceable answers of Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial for various research and practical endeavors. One avenue in reaching this goal is basing the answers on reliable sources. However, this Evidence-Based QA has proven to work insufficiently with LLMs in terms of citing the correct sources (source quality) and truthfully representing the information within sources (answer attributability). In this work, we systematically investigate how to robustly fine-tune LLMs for better source quality and answer attributability. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline with automated data quality filters, which can synthesize diversified high-quality training and testing data at scale. We further introduce four test sets to benchmark the robustness of fine-tuned specialist models. Extensive evaluation shows that fine-tuning on synthetic data improves performance on both in- and out-of-distribution. Furthermore, we show that data quality, which can be drastically improved by proposed quality filters, matters more than quantity in improving Evidence-Based QA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08277v5,2024-02
A Survey of Table Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Xuanliang Zhang, Dingzirui Wang, Longxu Dou, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che","Table reasoning, which aims to generate the corresponding answer to the question following the user requirement according to the provided table, and optionally a text description of the table, effectively improving the efficiency of obtaining information. Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the mainstream method for table reasoning, because it not only significantly reduces the annotation cost but also exceeds the performance of previous methods. However, existing research still lacks a summary of LLM-based table reasoning works. Due to the existing lack of research, questions about which techniques can improve table reasoning performance in the era of LLMs, why LLMs excel at table reasoning, and how to enhance table reasoning abilities in the future, remain largely unexplored. This gap significantly limits progress in research. To answer the above questions and advance table reasoning research with LLMs, we present this survey to analyze existing research, inspiring future work. In this paper, we analyze the mainstream techniques used to improve table reasoning performance in the LLM era, and the advantages of LLMs compared to pre-LLMs for solving table reasoning. We provide research directions from both the improvement of existing methods and the expansion of practical applications to inspire future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08259v1,2024-02
Privacy-Preserving Language Model Inference with Instance Obfuscation,"Yixiang Yao, Fei Wang, Srivatsan Ravi, Muhao Chen","Language Models as a Service (LMaaS) offers convenient access for developers and researchers to perform inference using pre-trained language models. Nonetheless, the input data and the inference results containing private information are exposed as plaintext during the service call, leading to privacy issues. Recent studies have started tackling the privacy issue by transforming input data into privacy-preserving representation from the user-end with the techniques such as noise addition and content perturbation, while the exploration of inference result protection, namely decision privacy, is still a blank page. In order to maintain the black-box manner of LMaaS, conducting data privacy protection, especially for the decision, is a challenging task because the process has to be seamless to the models and accompanied by limited communication and computation overhead. We thus propose Instance-Obfuscated Inference (IOI) method, which focuses on addressing the decision privacy issue of natural language understanding tasks in their complete life-cycle. Besides, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance as well as the privacy-protection strength of the proposed method on various benchmarking tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08227v1,2024-02
BBox-Adapter: Lightweight Adapting for Black-Box Large Language Models,"Haotian Sun, Yuchen Zhuang, Wei Wei, Chao Zhang, Bo Dai","Adapting state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini for specific tasks is challenging. Due to the opacity in their parameters, embeddings, and even output probabilities, existing fine-tuning adaptation methods are inapplicable. Consequently, adapting these black-box LLMs is only possible through their API services, raising concerns about transparency, privacy, and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce BBox-Adapter, a novel lightweight adapter for black-box LLMs. BBox-Adapter distinguishes target and source domain data by treating target data as positive and source data as negative. It employs a ranking-based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss to promote the likelihood of target domain data while penalizing that of the source domain. Furthermore, it features an online adaptation mechanism, which incorporates real-time positive data sampling from ground-truth, human, or AI feedback, coupled with negative data from previous adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBox-Adapter's effectiveness and cost efficiency. It improves model performance by up to 6.77% across diverse tasks and domains, while reducing training and inference costs by 31.30x and 1.84x, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08219v2,2024-02
Pixel Sentence Representation Learning,"Chenghao Xiao, Zhuoxu Huang, Danlu Chen, G Thomas Hudson, Yizhi Li, Haoran Duan, Chenghua Lin, Jie Fu, Jungong Han, Noura Al Moubayed","Pretrained language models are long known to be subpar in capturing sentence and document-level semantics. Though heavily investigated, transferring perturbation-based methods from unsupervised visual representation learning to NLP remains an unsolved problem. This is largely due to the discreteness of subword units brought by tokenization of language models, limiting small perturbations of inputs to form semantics-preserved positive pairs. In this work, we conceptualize the learning of sentence-level textual semantics as a visual representation learning process. Drawing from cognitive and linguistic sciences, we introduce an unsupervised visual sentence representation learning framework, employing visually-grounded text perturbation methods like typos and word order shuffling, resonating with human cognitive patterns, and enabling perturbation to texts to be perceived as continuous. Our approach is further bolstered by large-scale unsupervised topical alignment training and natural language inference supervision, achieving comparable performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) to existing state-of-the-art NLP methods. Additionally, we unveil our method's inherent zero-shot cross-lingual transferability and a unique leapfrogging pattern across languages during iterative training. To our knowledge, this is the first representation learning method devoid of traditional language models for understanding sentence and document semantics, marking a stride closer to human-like textual comprehension.

Active Preference Learning for Large Language Models,"William Muldrew, Peter Hayes, Mingtian Zhang, David Barber","As large language models (LLMs) become more capable, fine-tuning techniques for aligning with human intent are increasingly important. A key consideration for aligning these models is how to most effectively use human resources, or model resources in the case where LLMs themselves are used as oracles. Reinforcement learning from Human or AI preferences (RLHF/RLAIF) is the most prominent example of such a technique, but is complex and often unstable. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been proposed as a simpler and more stable alternative. In this work, we develop an active learning strategy for DPO to make better use of preference labels. We propose a practical acquisition function for prompt/completion pairs based on the predictive entropy of the language model and a measure of certainty of the implicit preference model optimized by DPO. We demonstrate how our approach improves both the rate of learning and final performance of fine-tuning on pairwise preference data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08114v2,2024-02
Addressing cognitive bias in medical language models,"Samuel Schmidgall, Carl Harris, Ime Essien, Daniel Olshvang, Tawsifur Rahman, Ji Woong Kim, Rojin Ziaei, Jason Eshraghian, Peter Abadir, Rama Chellappa","There is increasing interest in the application large language models (LLMs) to the medical field, in part because of their impressive performance on medical exam questions. While promising, exam questions do not reflect the complexity of real patient-doctor interactions. In reality, physicians' decisions are shaped by many complex factors, such as patient compliance, personal experience, ethical beliefs, and cognitive bias. Taking a step toward understanding this, our hypothesis posits that when LLMs are confronted with clinical questions containing cognitive biases, they will yield significantly less accurate responses compared to the same questions presented without such biases. In this study, we developed BiasMedQA, a benchmark for evaluating cognitive biases in LLMs applied to medical tasks. Using BiasMedQA we evaluated six LLMs, namely GPT-4, Mixtral-8x70B, GPT-3.5, PaLM-2, Llama 2 70B-chat, and the medically specialized PMC Llama 13B. We tested these models on 1,273 questions from the US Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Steps 1, 2, and 3, modified to replicate common clinically-relevant cognitive biases. Our analysis revealed varying effects for biases on these LLMs, with GPT-4 standing out for its resilience to bias, in contrast to Llama 2 70B-chat and PMC Llama 13B, which were disproportionately affected by cognitive bias. Our findings highlight the critical need for bias mitigation in the development of medical LLMs, pointing towards safer and more reliable applications in healthcare.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08113v3,2024-02
Relative Preference Optimization: Enhancing LLM Alignment through Contrasting Responses across Identical and Diverse Prompts,"Yueqin Yin, Zhendong Wang, Yi Gu, Hai Huang, Weizhu Chen, Mingyuan Zhou","In the field of large language models (LLMs), aligning models with the diverse preferences of users is a critical challenge. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has played a key role in this area. It works by using pairs of preferences derived from the same prompts, and it functions without needing an additional reward model. However, DPO does not fully reflect the complex nature of human learning, which often involves understanding contrasting responses to not only identical but also similar questions. To overcome this shortfall, we propose Relative Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO is designed to discern between more and less preferred responses derived from both identical and related prompts. It introduces a contrastive weighting mechanism, enabling the tuning of LLMs using a broader range of preference data, including both paired and unpaired sets. This approach expands the learning capabilities of the model, allowing it to leverage insights from a more varied set of prompts. Through empirical tests, including dialogue and summarization tasks, and evaluations using the AlpacaEval2.0 leaderboard, RPO has demonstrated a superior ability to align LLMs with user preferences and to improve their adaptability during the training process.

However, there is a severe possibility that this translation ability may be influenced by having seen target textual descriptions and the related code. This effect is known as Data Contamination.   In this study, we investigate the impact of Data Contamination on the performance of GPT-3.5 in the Text-to-SQL code-generating tasks. Hence, we introduce a novel method to detect Data Contamination in GPTs and examine GPT-3.5's Text-to-SQL performances using the known Spider Dataset and our new unfamiliar dataset Termite. Furthermore, we analyze GPT-3.5's efficacy on databases with modified information via an adversarial table disconnection (ATD) approach, complicating Text-to-SQL tasks by removing structural pieces of information from the database. Our results indicate a significant performance drop in GPT-3.5 on the unfamiliar Termite dataset, even with ATD modifications, highlighting the effect of Data Contamination on LLMs in Text-to-SQL translation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08100v1,2024-02

BASE TTS is the largest TTS model to-date, trained on 100K hours of public domain speech data, achieving a new state-of-the-art in speech naturalness. It deploys a 1-billion-parameter autoregressive Transformer that converts raw texts into discrete codes (""speechcodes"") followed by a convolution-based decoder which converts these speechcodes into waveforms in an incremental, streamable manner. Further, our speechcodes are built using a novel speech tokenization technique that features speaker ID disentanglement and compression with byte-pair encoding. Echoing the widely-reported ""emergent abilities"" of large language models when trained on increasing volume of data, we show that BASE TTS variants built with 10K+ hours and 500M+ parameters begin to demonstrate natural prosody on textually complex sentences. We design and share a specialized dataset to measure these emergent abilities for text-to-speech. We showcase state-of-the-art naturalness of BASE TTS by evaluating against baselines that include publicly available large-scale text-to-speech systems: YourTTS, Bark and TortoiseTTS.

This position paper delineates the parallels between the training methods of LLMs and the strategies employed for the development of agents in two-player games, as studied in game theory, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent systems. We propose a re-conceptualization of LLM learning processes in terms of agent learning in language-based games.

Beyond LLMs: Advancing the Landscape of Complex Reasoning,"Jennifer Chu-Carroll, Andrew Beck, Greg Burnham, David OS Melville, David Nachman, A. Erdem Özcan, David Ferrucci","Since the advent of Large Language Models a few years ago, they have often been considered the de facto solution for many AI problems. However, in addition to the many deficiencies of LLMs that prevent them from broad industry adoption, such as reliability, cost, and speed, there is a whole class of common real world problems that Large Language Models perform poorly on, namely, constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. These problems are ubiquitous and current solutions are highly specialized and expensive to implement. At Elemental Cognition, we developed our EC AI platform which takes a neuro-symbolic approach to solving constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. The platform employs, at its core, a precise and high performance logical reasoning engine, and leverages LLMs for knowledge acquisition and user interaction. This platform supports developers in specifying application logic in natural and concise language while generating application user interfaces to interact with users effectively. We evaluated LLMs against systems built on the EC AI platform in three domains and found the EC AI systems to significantly outperform LLMs on constructing valid and optimal solutions, on validating proposed solutions, and on repairing invalid solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08064v1,2024-02
Careless Whisper: Speech-to-Text Hallucination Harms,"Allison Koenecke, Anna Seo Gyeong Choi, Katelyn X. Mei, Hilke Schellmann, Mona Sloane","Speech-to-text services aim to transcribe input audio as accurately as possible. They increasingly play a role in everyday life, for example in personal voice assistants or in customer-company interactions. We evaluate Open AI's Whisper, a state-of-the-art automated speech recognition service outperforming industry competitors, as of 2023. While many of Whisper's transcriptions were highly accurate, we find that roughly 1\% of audio transcriptions contained entire hallucinated phrases or sentences which did not exist in any form in the underlying audio. We thematically analyze the Whisper-hallucinated content, finding that 38\% of hallucinations include explicit harms such as perpetuating violence, making up inaccurate associations, or implying false authority. We then study why hallucinations occur by observing the disparities in hallucination rates between speakers with aphasia (who have a lowered ability to express themselves using speech and voice) and a control group. We find that hallucinations disproportionately occur for individuals who speak with longer shares of non-vocal durations -- a common symptom of aphasia. We call on industry practitioners to ameliorate these language-model-based hallucinations in Whisper, and to raise awareness of potential biases amplified by hallucinations in downstream applications of speech-to-text models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08021v2,2024-02

EvoGPT-f: An Evolutionary GPT Framework for Benchmarking Formal Math Languages,Johnathan Mercer,"Formal mathematics is the discipline of translating mathematics into a programming language in which any statement can be unequivocally checked by a computer. Mathematicians and computer scientists have spent decades of painstaking formalization efforts developing languages such as Coq, HOL, and Lean. Machine learning research has converged on these formal math corpora and given rise to an assortment of methodologies to aid in interactive and automated theorem proving. However, these papers have primarily focused on one method, for one proof task, in one language. This paper introduces EvoGPT-f: a novel evolutionary framework for the first systematic quantitative analysis of the differential machine learnability of five formal math corpora (Lean 3, Lean 4, Coq, HOL 4, HOL Light) using four tokenization methods (character, word-level, Byte Pair Encoding and StarCoder tokenizer).

A systematic investigation of learnability from single child linguistic input,"Yulu Qin, Wentao Wang, Brenden M. Lake","Language models (LMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating linguistically coherent text, sparking discussions about their relevance to understanding human language learnability. However, a significant gap exists between the training data for these models and the linguistic input a child receives. LMs are typically trained on data that is orders of magnitude larger and fundamentally different from child-directed speech (Warstadt and Bowman, 2022; Warstadt et al., 2023; Frank, 2023a). Addressing this discrepancy, our research focuses on training LMs on subsets of a single child's linguistic input. Previously, Wang, Vong, Kim, and Lake (2023) found that LMs trained in this setting can form syntactic and semantic word clusters and develop sensitivity to certain linguistic phenomena, but they only considered LSTMs and simpler neural networks trained from just one single-child dataset. Here, to examine the robustness of learnability from single-child input, we systematically train six different model architectures on five datasets (3 single-child and 2 baselines). We find that the models trained on single-child datasets showed consistent results that matched with previous work, underscoring the robustness of forming meaningful syntactic and semantic representations from a subset of a child's linguistic input.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07899v2,2024-02
Suppressing Pink Elephants with Direct Principle Feedback,"Louis Castricato, Nathan Lile, Suraj Anand, Hailey Schoelkopf, Siddharth Verma, Stella Biderman","Existing methods for controlling language models, such as RLHF and Constitutional AI, involve determining which LLM behaviors are desirable and training them into a language model. However, in many cases, it is desirable for LLMs to be controllable at inference time, so that they can be used in multiple contexts with diverse needs. We illustrate this with the Pink Elephant Problem: instructing an LLM to avoid discussing a certain entity (a ``Pink Elephant''), and instead discuss a preferred entity (``Grey Elephant''). We apply a novel simplification of Constitutional AI, Direct Principle Feedback, which skips the ranking of responses and uses DPO directly on critiques and revisions. Our results show that after DPF fine-tuning on our synthetic Pink Elephants dataset, our 13B fine-tuned LLaMA 2 model significantly outperforms Llama-2-13B-Chat and a prompted baseline, and performs as well as GPT-4 in on our curated test set assessing the Pink Elephant Problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07896v2,2024-02
Label-Efficient Model Selection for Text Generation,"Shir Ashury-Tahan, Ariel Gera, Benjamin Sznajder, Leshem Choshen, Liat Ein-Dor, Eyal Shnarch","Model selection for a given target task can be costly, as it may entail extensive annotation of the quality of outputs of different models. We introduce DiffUse, an efficient method to make an informed decision between candidate text generation models based on preference annotations. DiffUse reduces the required amount of annotations, thus saving valuable time and resources in performing evaluation. DiffUse intelligently selects instances by clustering embeddings that represent the semantic differences between model outputs. Thus, it is able to identify a subset of examples that are more informative for preference decisions. Our method is model-agnostic, and can be applied to any text generation model for selecting between models, prompts and configurations. Moreover, we propose a practical iterative approach for dynamically determining how many instances to annotate. In a series of experiments over hundreds of model pairs, we demonstrate that DiffUse can dramatically reduce the required number of annotations -- by up to 75% -- while maintaining high evaluation reliability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07891v3,2024-02
Policy Improvement using Language Feedback Models,"Victor Zhong, Dipendra Misra, Xingdi Yuan, Marc-Alexandre Côté","We introduce Language Feedback Models (LFMs) that identify desirable behaviour - actions that help achieve tasks specified in the instruction - for imitation learning in instruction following. To train LFMs, we obtain feedback from Large Language Models (LLMs) on visual trajectories verbalized to language descriptions. First, by using LFMs to identify desirable behaviour to imitate, we improve in task-completion rate over strong behavioural cloning baselines on three distinct language grounding environments (Touchdown, ScienceWorld, and ALFWorld). Second, LFMs outperform using LLMs as experts to directly predict actions, when controlling for the number of LLM output tokens. Third, LFMs generalize to unseen environments, improving task-completion rate by 3.5-12.0% through one round of adaptation. Finally, LFM can be modified to provide human-interpretable feedback without performance loss, allowing human verification of desirable behaviour for imitation learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07876v6,2024-02
Scaling Laws for Fine-Grained Mixture of Experts,"Jakub Krajewski, Jan Ludziejewski, Kamil Adamczewski, Maciej Pióro, Michał Krutul, Szymon Antoniak, Kamil Ciebiera, Krystian Król, Tomasz Odrzygóźdź, Piotr Sankowski, Marek Cygan, Sebastian Jaszczur","Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a primary solution for reducing the computational cost of Large Language Models. In this work, we analyze their scaling properties, incorporating an expanded range of variables. Specifically, we introduce a new hyperparameter, granularity, whose adjustment enables precise control over the size of the experts. Building on this, we establish scaling laws for fine-grained MoE, taking into account the number of training tokens, model size, and granularity. Leveraging these laws, we derive the optimal training configuration for a given computational budget. Our findings not only show that MoE models consistently outperform dense Transformers but also highlight that the efficiency gap between dense and MoE models widens as we scale up the model size and training budget. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the common practice of setting the size of experts in MoE to mirror the feed-forward layer is not optimal at almost any computational budget.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07871v1,2024-02
PIVOT: Iterative Visual Prompting Elicits Actionable Knowledge for VLMs,"Soroush Nasiriany, Fei Xia, Wenhao Yu, Ted Xiao, Jacky Liang, Ishita Dasgupta, Annie Xie, Danny Driess, Ayzaan Wahid, Zhuo Xu, Quan Vuong, Tingnan Zhang, Tsang-Wei Edward Lee, Kuang-Huei Lee, Peng Xu, Sean Kirmani, Yuke Zhu, Andy Zeng, Karol Hausman, Nicolas Heess, Chelsea Finn, Sergey Levine, Brian Ichter","Vision language models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, from logical reasoning to visual understanding. This opens the door to richer interaction with the world, for example robotic control. However, VLMs produce only textual outputs, while robotic control and other spatial tasks require outputting continuous coordinates, actions, or trajectories. How can we enable VLMs to handle such settings without fine-tuning on task-specific data?   In this paper, we propose a novel visual prompting approach for VLMs that we call Prompting with Iterative Visual Optimization (PIVOT), which casts tasks as iterative visual question answering. In each iteration, the image is annotated with a visual representation of proposals that the VLM can refer to (e.g., candidate robot actions, localizations, or trajectories). The VLM then selects the best ones for the task. These proposals are iteratively refined, allowing the VLM to eventually zero in on the best available answer. We investigate PIVOT on real-world robotic navigation, real-world manipulation from images, instruction following in simulation, and additional spatial inference tasks such as localization. We find, perhaps surprisingly, that our approach enables zero-shot control of robotic systems without any robot training data, navigation in a variety of environments, and other capabilities. Although current performance is far from perfect, our work highlights potentials and limitations of this new regime and shows a promising approach for Internet-Scale VLMs in robotic and spatial reasoning domains.

Prismatic VLMs: Investigating the Design Space of Visually-Conditioned Language Models,"Siddharth Karamcheti, Suraj Nair, Ashwin Balakrishna, Percy Liang, Thomas Kollar, Dorsa Sadigh","Visually-conditioned language models (VLMs) have seen growing adoption in applications such as visual dialogue, scene understanding, and robotic task planning; adoption that has fueled a wealth of new models such as LLaVa, InstructBLIP, and PaLI-3. Despite the volume of new releases, key design decisions around image preprocessing, architecture, and optimization are under-explored, making it challenging to understand what factors account for model performance $-$ a challenge further complicated by the lack of objective, consistent evaluations. To address these gaps, we first compile a suite of standardized evaluations spanning visual question answering, object localization, and challenge sets that probe properties such as hallucination; evaluations that provide fine-grained insight VLM capabilities. Second, we rigorously investigate VLMs along key design axes, including pretrained visual representations and training from base vs. instruct-tuned language models, amongst others. We couple our analysis with three resource contributions: (1) a unified framework for evaluating VLMs, (2) optimized, flexible training code, and (3) checkpoints for all models, including a family of VLMs at the 7-13B scale that strictly outperform InstructBLIP and LLaVa v1.5, the state-of-the-art in open VLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07865v2,2024-02
AI-Augmented Predictions: LLM Assistants Improve Human Forecasting Accuracy,"Philipp Schoenegger, Peter S. Park, Ezra Karger, Sean Trott, Philip E. Tetlock","Large language models (LLMs) match and sometimes exceeding human performance in many domains. This study explores the potential of LLMs to augment human judgement in a forecasting task. We evaluate the effect on human forecasters of two LLM assistants: one designed to provide high-quality (""superforecasting"") advice, and the other designed to be overconfident and base-rate neglecting, thus providing noisy forecasting advice. We compare participants using these assistants to a control group that received a less advanced model that did not provide numerical predictions or engaged in explicit discussion of predictions. Participants (N = 991) answered a set of six forecasting questions and had the option to consult their assigned LLM assistant throughout. Our preregistered analyses show that interacting with each of our frontier LLM assistants significantly enhances prediction accuracy by between 24 percent and 28 percent compared to the control group. Exploratory analyses showed a pronounced outlier effect in one forecasting item, without which we find that the superforecasting assistant increased accuracy by 41 percent, compared with 29 percent for the noisy assistant. We further examine whether LLM forecasting augmentation disproportionately benefits less skilled forecasters, degrades the wisdom-of-the-crowd by reducing prediction diversity, or varies in effectiveness with question difficulty. Our data do not consistently support these hypotheses. Our results suggest that access to a frontier LLM assistant, even a noisy one, can be a helpful decision aid in cognitively demanding tasks compared to a less powerful model that does not provide specific forecasting advice. However, the effects of outliers suggest that further research into the robustness of this pattern is needed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07862v2,2024-02
Lissard: Long and Simple Sequential Reasoning Datasets,"Mirelle Bueno, Roberto Lotufo, Rodrigo Nogueira","Language models are now capable of solving tasks that require dealing with long sequences consisting of hundreds of thousands of tokens. However, they often fail on tasks that require repetitive use of simple rules, even on sequences that are much shorter than those seen during training. For example, state-of-the-art LLMs can find common items in two lists with up to 20 items but fail when lists have 80 items. In this paper, we introduce Lissard, a benchmark comprising seven tasks whose goal is to assess the ability of models to process and generate wide-range sequence lengths, requiring repetitive procedural execution. Our evaluation of open-source (Mistral-7B and Mixtral-8x7B) and proprietary models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) show a consistent decline in performance across all models as the complexity of the sequence increases.

Mercury: A Code Efficiency Benchmark for Code Large Language Models,"Mingzhe Du, Anh Tuan Luu, Bin Ji, Qian Liu, See-Kiong Ng","Amidst the recent strides in evaluating Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs), existing benchmarks have mainly focused on the functional correctness of generated code, neglecting the importance of their computational efficiency. To fill the gap, we present Mercury, the first code efficiency benchmark for Code LLMs. It comprises 1,889 Python tasks, each accompanied by adequate solutions that serve as real-world efficiency baselines, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the runtime distribution. Based on the distribution, we introduce a new metric Beyond, which computes a runtime-percentile-weighted Pass score to reflect functional correctness and code efficiency simultaneously. On Mercury, leading Code LLMs can achieve 65% on Pass, while less than 50% on Beyond. Given that an ideal Beyond score would be aligned with the Pass score, it indicates that while Code LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities in generating functionally correct code, there remains a notable gap in their efficiency. Finally, our empirical experiments reveal that Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) serves as a robust baseline for enhancing code efficiency compared with Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT), which paves a promising avenue for future exploration of efficient code generation.

Do Membership Inference Attacks Work on Large Language Models?,"Michael Duan, Anshuman Suri, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Sewon Min, Weijia Shi, Luke Zettlemoyer, Yulia Tsvetkov, Yejin Choi, David Evans, Hannaneh Hajishirzi","Membership inference attacks (MIAs) attempt to predict whether a particular datapoint is a member of a target model's training data. Despite extensive research on traditional machine learning models, there has been limited work studying MIA on the pre-training data of large language models (LLMs). We perform a large-scale evaluation of MIAs over a suite of language models (LMs) trained on the Pile, ranging from 160M to 12B parameters. We find that MIAs barely outperform random guessing for most settings across varying LLM sizes and domains. Our further analyses reveal that this poor performance can be attributed to (1) the combination of a large dataset and few training iterations, and (2) an inherently fuzzy boundary between members and non-members. We identify specific settings where LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to membership inference and show that the apparent success in such settings can be attributed to a distribution shift, such as when members and non-members are drawn from the seemingly identical domain but with different temporal ranges. We release our code and data as a unified benchmark package that includes all existing MIAs, supporting future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07841v2,2024-02

Differentially Private Zeroth-Order Methods for Scalable Large Language Model Finetuning,"Z Liu, J Lou, W Bao, Y Hu, B Li, Z Qin, K Ren","Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets is a widely-embraced paradigm of harnessing the powerful capability of pretrained LLMs for various downstream tasks. Due to the popularity of LLMs fine-tuning and its accompanying privacy concerns, differentially private (DP) fine-tuning of pretrained LLMs has been widely used to safeguarding the privacy of task-specific datasets. Lying at the design core of DP LLM fine-tuning methods is the satisfactory tradeoff among privacy, utility, and scalability. Most existing methods build upon the seminal work of DP-SGD. Despite pushing the scalability of DP-SGD to its limit, DP-SGD-based fine-tuning methods are unfortunately limited by the inherent inefficiency of SGD.   In this paper, we investigate the potential of DP zeroth-order methods for LLM pretraining, which avoids the scalability bottleneck of SGD by approximating the gradient with the more efficient zeroth-order gradient. Rather than treating the zeroth-order method as a drop-in replacement for SGD, this paper presents a comprehensive study both theoretically and empirically. First, we propose the stagewise DP zeroth-order method (DP-ZOSO) that dynamically schedules key hyperparameters. This design is grounded on the synergy between DP random perturbation and the gradient approximation error of the zeroth-order method, and its effect on fine-tuning trajectory.   We provide theoretical analysis for both proposed methods. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on both encoder-only masked language model and decoder-only autoregressive language model, achieving impressive results in terms of scalability and utility regardless of the class of tasks (compared with DPZero, DP-ZOPO improves $4.5\%$ on SST-5, $5.5\%$ on MNLI with RoBERTa-Large and 9.2\% on CB, 3.9\% on BoolQ with OPT-2.7b when $\epsilon=4$, demonstrates more significant enhancement in performance on more complicated tasks).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07818v5,2024-02
Injecting Wiktionary to improve token-level contextual representations using contrastive learning,"Anna Mosolova, Marie Candito, Carlos Ramisch","While static word embeddings are blind to context, for lexical semantics tasks context is rather too present in contextual word embeddings, vectors of same-meaning occurrences being too different (Ethayarajh, 2019). Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning was proposed, leveraging automatically self-augmented examples (Liu et al., 2021b). In this paper, we investigate how to inject a lexicon as an alternative source of supervision, using the English Wiktionary. We also test how dimensionality reduction impacts the resulting contextual word embeddings. We evaluate our approach on the Word-In-Context (WiC) task, in the unsupervised setting (not using the training set). We achieve new SoTA result on the original WiC test set. We also propose two new WiC test sets for which we show that our fine-tuning method achieves substantial improvements. We also observe improvements, although modest, for the semantic frame induction task. Although we experimented on English to allow comparison with related work, our method is adaptable to the many languages for which large Wiktionaries exist.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07817v1,2024-02
Retrieval Augmented Thought Process for Private Data Handling in Healthcare,"Thomas Pouplin, Hao Sun, Samuel Holt, Mihaela van der Schaar","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the strong potential to assist both clinicians and the general public with their extensive medical knowledge. However, their application in healthcare is constrained due to concerns about the privacy of data used in training, which prevents the integration of private and personal information because of security and ethical issues. Moreover, if their capabilities can be enhanced with information retrieval to access up-to-date knowledge, the current integration of LLMs with Information retrieval lacks robustness to imperfect retrieval, which can hinder their effectiveness and even reduce overall performance. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing the Retrieval-Augmented Thought Process (RATP). Given access to external knowledge, RATP formulates the thought generation of LLMs as a multiple-step decision process. To optimise such a thought process, RATP leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search and learns a proxy reward function that permits cost-efficient inference. On a private dataset of electronic medical records, deliberately excluded from any LLM training set, RATP achieves 35% additional accuracy compared to in-context retrieval-augmented generation for the question-answering task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07812v2,2024-02
Multi-Intent Attribute-Aware Text Matching in Searching,"Mingzhe Li, Xiuying Chen, Jing Xiang, Qishen Zhang, Changsheng Ma, Chenchen Dai, Jinxiong Chang, Zhongyi Liu, Guannan Zhang","Text matching systems have become a fundamental service in most searching platforms. For instance, they are responsible for matching user queries to relevant candidate items, or rewriting the user-input query to a pre-selected high-performing one for a better search experience. In practice, both the queries and items often contain multiple attributes, such as the category of the item and the location mentioned in the query, which represent condensed key information that is helpful for matching. However, most of the existing works downplay the effectiveness of attributes by integrating them into text representations as supplementary information. Hence, in this work, we focus on exploring the relationship between the attributes from two sides. Since attributes from two ends are often not aligned in terms of number and type, we propose to exploit the benefit of attributes by multiple-intent modeling. The intents extracted from attributes summarize the diverse needs of queries and provide rich content of items, which are more refined and abstract, and can be aligned for paired inputs. Concretely, we propose a multi-intent attribute-aware matching model (MIM), which consists of three main components: attribute-aware encoder, multi-intent modeling, and intent-aware matching. In the attribute-aware encoder, the text and attributes are weighted and processed through a scaled attention mechanism with regard to the attributes' importance. Afterward, the multi-intent modeling extracts intents from two ends and aligns them. Herein, we come up with a distribution loss to ensure the learned intents are diverse but concentrated, and a kullback-leibler divergence loss that aligns the learned intents. Finally, in the intent-aware matching, the intents are evaluated by a self-supervised masking task, and then incorporated to output the final matching result.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07788v1,2024-02
Extensible Multi-Granularity Fusion Network for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Xiaowei Zhao, Yong Zhou, Xiujuan Xu, Yu Liu","Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) evaluates sentiment expressions within a text to comprehend sentiment information. Previous studies integrated external knowledge, such as knowledge graphs, to enhance the semantic features in ABSA models. Recent research has examined the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on dependency and constituent trees for syntactic analysis. With the ongoing development of ABSA, more innovative linguistic and structural features are being incorporated (e.g. latent graph), but this also introduces complexity and confusion. As of now, a scalable framework for integrating diverse linguistic and structural features into ABSA does not exist. This paper presents the Extensible Multi-Granularity Fusion (EMGF) network, which integrates information from dependency and constituent syntactic, attention semantic , and external knowledge graphs. EMGF, equipped with multi-anchor triplet learning and orthogonal projection, efficiently harnesses the combined potential of each granularity feature and their synergistic interactions, resulting in a cumulative effect without additional computational expenses. Experimental findings on SemEval 2014 and Twitter datasets confirm EMGF's superiority over existing ABSA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07787v3,2024-02
"TELLER: A Trustworthy Framework for Explainable, Generalizable and Controllable Fake News Detection","Hui Liu, Wenya Wang, Haoru Li, Haoliang Li","The proliferation of fake news has emerged as a severe societal problem, raising significant interest from industry and academia. While existing deep-learning based methods have made progress in detecting fake news accurately, their reliability may be compromised caused by the non-transparent reasoning processes, poor generalization abilities and inherent risks of integration with large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we propose {\methodname}, a novel framework for trustworthy fake news detection that prioritizes explainability, generalizability and controllability of models. This is achieved via a dual-system framework that integrates cognition and decision systems, adhering to the principles above. The cognition system harnesses human expertise to generate logical predicates, which guide LLMs in generating human-readable logic atoms. Meanwhile, the decision system deduces generalizable logic rules to aggregate these atoms, enabling the identification of the truthfulness of the input news across diverse domains and enhancing transparency in the decision-making process. Finally, we present comprehensive evaluation results on four datasets, demonstrating the feasibility and trustworthiness of our proposed framework.

We present three approaches: knowledge transfer from a similar task, multi-task learning approach, combining sequence-to-sequence modeling with various toxicity classification tasks, and delete and reconstruct approach. To support our research, we utilize a dataset provided by Dementieva et al.(2021), which contains multiple versions of detoxified texts corresponding to toxic texts.

Diffusion of Thoughts: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Diffusion Language Models,"Jiacheng Ye, Shansan Gong, Liheng Chen, Lin Zheng, Jiahui Gao, Han Shi, Chuan Wu, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Wei Bi, Lingpeng Kong","Recently, diffusion models have garnered significant interest in the field of text processing due to their many potential advantages compared to conventional autoregressive models. In this work, we propose Diffusion-of-Thought (DoT), a novel approach that integrates diffusion models with Chain-of-Thought, a well-established technique for improving the reasoning ability of autoregressive language models. In contrast to autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT allows reasoning steps to diffuse over time through a diffusion language model and offers greater flexibility in trading-off computation for reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication, boolean logic, and grade school math problems, with a small diffusion model outperforming a much larger autoregressive model in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition to that, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding.

Asking Multimodal Clarifying Questions in Mixed-Initiative Conversational Search,"Yifei Yuan, Clemencia Siro, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Maarten de Rijke, Wai Lam","In mixed-initiative conversational search systems, clarifying questions are used to help users who struggle to express their intentions in a single query. These questions aim to uncover user's information needs and resolve query ambiguities. We hypothesize that in scenarios where multimodal information is pertinent, the clarification process can be improved by using non-textual information. Therefore, we propose to add images to clarifying questions and formulate the novel task of asking multimodal clarifying questions in open-domain, mixed-initiative conversational search systems. To facilitate research into this task, we collect a dataset named Melon that contains over 4k multimodal clarifying questions, enriched with over 14k images. We also propose a multimodal query clarification model named Marto and adopt a prompt-based, generative fine-tuning strategy to perform the training of different stages with different prompts. Several analyses are conducted to understand the importance of multimodal contents during the query clarification phase. Experimental results indicate that the addition of images leads to significant improvements of up to 90% in retrieval performance when selecting the relevant images. Extensive analyses are also performed to show the superiority of Marto compared with discriminative baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07742v1,2024-02
AIR-Bench: Benchmarking Large Audio-Language Models via Generative Comprehension,"Qian Yang, Jin Xu, Wenrui Liu, Yunfei Chu, Ziyue Jiang, Xiaohuan Zhou, Yichong Leng, Yuanjun Lv, Zhou Zhao, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou","Recently, instruction-following audio-language models have received broad attention for human-audio interaction. However, the absence of benchmarks capable of evaluating audio-centric interaction capabilities has impeded advancements in this field. Previous models primarily focus on assessing different fundamental tasks, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and lack an assessment of the open-ended generative capabilities centered around audio. Thus, it is challenging to track the progression in the Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) domain and to provide guidance for future improvement. In this paper, we introduce AIR-Bench (\textbf{A}udio \textbf{I}nst\textbf{R}uction \textbf{Bench}mark), the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LALMs to understand various types of audio signals (including human speech, natural sounds, and music), and furthermore, to interact with humans in the textual format. AIR-Bench encompasses two dimensions: \textit{foundation} and \textit{chat} benchmarks. The former consists of 19 tasks with approximately 19k single-choice questions, intending to inspect the basic single-task ability of LALMs. The latter one contains 2k instances of open-ended question-and-answer data, directly assessing the comprehension of the model on complex audio and its capacity to follow instructions. Both benchmarks require the model to generate hypotheses directly. We design a unified framework that leverages advanced language models, such as GPT-4, to evaluate the scores of generated hypotheses given the meta-information of the audio. Experimental results demonstrate a high level of consistency between GPT-4-based evaluation and human evaluation. By revealing the limitations of existing LALMs through evaluation results, AIR-Bench can provide insights into the direction of future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07729v2,2024-02
Unsupervised Sign Language Translation and Generation,"Zhengsheng Guo, Zhiwei He, Wenxiang Jiao, Xing Wang, Rui Wang, Kehai Chen, Zhaopeng Tu, Yong Xu, Min Zhang","Motivated by the success of unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT), we introduce an unsupervised sign language translation and generation network (USLNet), which learns from abundant single-modality (text and video) data without parallel sign language data. USLNet comprises two main components: single-modality reconstruction modules (text and video) that rebuild the input from its noisy version in the same modality and cross-modality back-translation modules (text-video-text and video-text-video) that reconstruct the input from its noisy version in the different modality using back-translation procedure.Unlike the single-modality back-translation procedure in text-based UNMT, USLNet faces the cross-modality discrepancy in feature representation, in which the length and the feature dimension mismatch between text and video sequences. We propose a sliding window method to address the issues of aligning variable-length text with video sequences. To our knowledge, USLNet is the first unsupervised sign language translation and generation model capable of generating both natural language text and sign language video in a unified manner. Experimental results on the BBC-Oxford Sign Language dataset (BOBSL) and Open-Domain American Sign Language dataset (OpenASL) reveal that USLNet achieves competitive results compared to supervised baseline models, indicating its effectiveness in sign language translation and generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07726v1,2024-02
LoRA-drop: Efficient LoRA Parameter Pruning based on Output Evaluation,"Hongyun Zhou, Xiangyu Lu, Wang Xu, Conghui Zhu, Tiejun Zhao, Muyun Yang","Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is currently the most commonly used Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, it introduces auxiliary parameters for each layer to fine-tune the pre-trained model under limited computing resources. However, it still faces resource consumption challenges during training when scaling up to larger models. Most previous studies have tackled this issue by using pruning techniques, which involve removing LoRA parameters deemed unimportant. Nonetheless, these efforts only analyze LoRA parameter features to evaluate their importance, such as parameter count, size, and gradient. In fact, the output of LoRA (product of LoRA parameter and hidden state), directly impacts the final results. Preliminary experiments indicate that a fraction of LoRA elements possesses significantly high output values, substantially influencing the layer output. Motivated by the observation, we propose LoRA-drop. Concretely, LoRA-drop evaluates the importance of LoRA based on the LoRA output. Then we retain LoRA for important layers and the other layers share the same LoRA. We conduct abundant experiments with models of different scales on NLU and NLG tasks. Results demonstrate that LoRA-drop can achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning and LoRA, while retaining 50\% of the LoRA parameters on average.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07721v2,2024-02
OrderBkd: Textual backdoor attack through repositioning,"Irina Alekseevskaia, Konstantin Arkhipenko","The use of third-party datasets and pre-trained machine learning models poses a threat to NLP systems due to possibility of hidden backdoor attacks. Existing attacks involve poisoning the data samples such as insertion of tokens or sentence paraphrasing, which either alter the semantics of the original texts or can be detected. Our main difference from the previous work is that we use the reposition of a two words in a sentence as a trigger. By designing and applying specific part-of-speech (POS) based rules for selecting these tokens, we maintain high attack success rate on SST-2 and AG classification datasets while outperforming existing attacks in terms of perplexity and semantic similarity to the clean samples. In addition, we show the robustness of our attack to the ONION defense method. All the code and data for the paper can be obtained at https://github.com/alekseevskaia/OrderBkd.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07689v2,2024-02
Auxiliary Tasks to Boost Biaffine Semantic Dependency Parsing,Marie Candito,"The biaffine parser of Dozat and Manning (2017) was successfully extended to semantic dependency parsing (SDP) (Dozat and Manning, 2018). Its performance on graphs is surprisingly high given that, without the constraint of producing a tree, all arcs for a given sentence are predicted independently from each other (modulo a shared representation of tokens). To circumvent such an independence of decision, while retaining the O(n^2) complexity and highly parallelizable architecture, we propose to use simple auxiliary tasks that introduce some form of interdependence between arcs. Experiments on the three English acyclic datasets of SemEval 2015 task 18 (Oepen et al., 2015), and on French deep syntactic cyclic graphs (Ribeyre et al., 2014) show modest but systematic performance gains on a near state-of-the-art baseline using transformer-based contextualized representations. This provides a simple and robust method to boost SDP performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07682v1,2024-02
"Large Language Models ""Ad Referendum"": How Good Are They at Machine Translation in the Legal Domain?","Vicent Briva-Iglesias, Joao Lucas Cavalheiro Camargo, Gokhan Dogru","This study evaluates the machine translation (MT) quality of two state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) against a tradition-al neural machine translation (NMT) system across four language pairs in the legal domain. It combines automatic evaluation met-rics (AEMs) and human evaluation (HE) by professional transla-tors to assess translation ranking, fluency and adequacy. The re-sults indicate that while Google Translate generally outperforms LLMs in AEMs, human evaluators rate LLMs, especially GPT-4, comparably or slightly better in terms of producing contextually adequate and fluent translations. This discrepancy suggests LLMs' potential in handling specialized legal terminology and context, highlighting the importance of human evaluation methods in assessing MT quality. The study underscores the evolving capabil-ities of LLMs in specialized domains and calls for reevaluation of traditional AEMs to better capture the nuances of LLM-generated translations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07681v1,2024-02
The Sound of Healthcare: Improving Medical Transcription ASR Accuracy with Large Language Models,"Ayo Adedeji, Sarita Joshi, Brendan Doohan","In the rapidly evolving landscape of medical documentation, transcribing clinical dialogues accurately is increasingly paramount. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in medical transcription. Utilizing the PriMock57 dataset, which encompasses a diverse range of primary care consultations, we apply advanced LLMs to refine ASR-generated transcripts. Our research is multifaceted, focusing on improvements in general Word Error Rate (WER), Medical Concept WER (MC-WER) for the accurate transcription of essential medical terms, and speaker diarization accuracy. Additionally, we assess the role of LLM post-processing in improving semantic textual similarity, thereby preserving the contextual integrity of clinical dialogues. Through a series of experiments, we compare the efficacy of zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques in enhancing diarization and correction accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly through CoT prompting, not only improve the diarization accuracy of existing ASR systems but also achieve state-of-the-art performance in this domain. This improvement extends to more accurately capturing medical concepts and enhancing the overall semantic coherence of the transcribed dialogues. These findings illustrate the dual role of LLMs in augmenting ASR outputs and independently excelling in transcription tasks, holding significant promise for transforming medical ASR systems and leading to more accurate and reliable patient records in healthcare settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07658v1,2024-02
Detecting the Clinical Features of Difficult-to-Treat Depression using Synthetic Data from Large Language Models,"Isabelle Lorge, Dan W. Joyce, Niall Taylor, Alejo Nevado-Holgado, Andrea Cipriani, Andrey Kormilitzin","Difficult-to-treat depression (DTD) has been proposed as a broader and more clinically comprehensive perspective on a person's depressive disorder where despite treatment, they continue to experience significant burden. We sought to develop a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tool capable of interrogating routinely-collected, narrative (free-text) electronic health record (EHR) data to locate published prognostic factors that capture the clinical syndrome of DTD. In this work, we use LLM-generated synthetic data (GPT3.5) and a Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm to train a BERT-based span extraction model. The resulting model is then able to extract and label spans related to a variety of relevant positive and negative factors in real clinical data (i.e. spans of text that increase or decrease the likelihood of a patient matching the DTD syndrome). We show it is possible to obtain good overall performance (0.70 F1 across polarity) on real clinical data on a set of as many as 20 different factors, and high performance (0.85 F1 with 0.95 precision) on a subset of important DTD factors such as history of abuse, family history of affective disorder, illness severity and suicidality by training the model exclusively on synthetic data. Our results show promise for future healthcare applications especially in applications where traditionally, highly confidential medical data and human-expert annotation would normally be required.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07645v1,2024-02
Autonomous Data Selection with Language Models for Mathematical Texts,"Yifan Zhang, Yifan Luo, Yang Yuan, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao","To improve language models' proficiency in mathematical reasoning via continual pretraining, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages base language models for autonomous data selection. Departing from conventional supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data, our approach Autonomous Data Selection (AutoDS) utilizes meta-prompted language models as zero-shot verifiers to evaluate and select high-quality mathematical content autonomously. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we continuously pretrained a 7B-parameter language model on our curated dataset, achieving substantial improvements in downstream performance on the MATH, GSM8K, and BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks with a token amount reduced by orders of magnitude compared to previous continual pretraining works. Our method showcases a 2 times increase in pretraining token efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the potential of our approach in enhancing models' mathematical reasoning capabilities. The AutoMathText dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/math-ai/AutoMathText.

Anchor-based Large Language Models,"Jianhui Pang, Fanghua Ye, Derek Fai Wong, Xin He, Wanshun Chen, Longyue Wang","Large language models (LLMs) predominantly employ decoder-only transformer architectures, necessitating the retention of keys/values information for historical tokens to provide contextual information and avoid redundant computation. However, the substantial size and parameter volume of these LLMs require massive GPU memory. This memory demand increases with the length of the input text, leading to an urgent need for more efficient methods of information storage and processing. This study introduces Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs), which utilize an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an anchor-based inference strategy. This approach enables LLMs to compress sequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and enhancing inference efficiency. Experiments on question-answering benchmarks reveal that AnLLMs maintain similar accuracy levels while achieving up to 99% keys/values cache reduction and up to 3.5 times faster inference. Despite a minor compromise in accuracy, the substantial enhancements of AnLLMs employing the AnSAN technique in resource utilization and computational efficiency underscore their potential for practical LLM applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07616v3,2024-02
Step-On-Feet Tuning: Scaling Self-Alignment of LLMs via Bootstrapping,"Haoyu Wang, Guozheng Ma, Ziqiao Meng, Zeyu Qin, Li Shen, Zhong Zhang, Bingzhe Wu, Liu Liu, Yatao Bian, Tingyang Xu, Xueqian Wang, Peilin Zhao","Self-alignment is an effective way to reduce the cost of human annotation while ensuring promising model capability. However, most current methods complete the data collection and training steps in a single round, which may overlook the continuously improving ability of self-aligned models. This gives rise to a key query: What if we do multi-time bootstrapping self-alignment? Does this strategy enhance model performance or lead to rapid degradation? In this paper, our pioneering exploration delves into the impact of bootstrapping self-alignment on large language models. Our findings reveal that bootstrapping self-alignment markedly surpasses the single-round approach, by guaranteeing data diversity from in-context learning. To further exploit the capabilities of bootstrapping, we investigate and adjust the training order of data, which yields improved performance of the model. Drawing on these findings, we propose Step-On-Feet Tuning (SOFT) which leverages model's continuously enhanced few-shot ability to boost zero or one-shot performance. Based on easy-to-hard training recipe, we propose SOFT+ which further boost self-alignment's performance. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of SOFT (SOFT+) across various classification and generation tasks, highlighting the potential of bootstrapping self-alignment on continually enhancing model alignment performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07610v3,2024-02
Topic Modeling as Multi-Objective Contrastive Optimization,"Thong Nguyen, Xiaobao Wu, Xinshuai Dong, Cong-Duy T Nguyen, See-Kiong Ng, Anh Tuan Luu","Recent representation learning approaches enhance neural topic models by optimizing the weighted linear combination of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-likelihood and the contrastive learning objective that contrasts pairs of input documents. However, document-level contrastive learning might capture low-level mutual information, such as word ratio, which disturbs topic modeling. Moreover, there is a potential conflict between the ELBO loss that memorizes input details for better reconstruction quality, and the contrastive loss which attempts to learn topic representations that generalize among input documents. To address these issues, we first introduce a novel contrastive learning method oriented towards sets of topic vectors to capture useful semantics that are shared among a set of input documents. Secondly, we explicitly cast contrastive topic modeling as a gradient-based multi-objective optimization problem, with the goal of achieving a Pareto stationary solution that balances the trade-off between the ELBO and the contrastive objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently produces higher-performing neural topic models in terms of topic coherence, topic diversity, and downstream performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07577v2,2024-02
Show Me How It's Done: The Role of Explanations in Fine-Tuning Language Models,"Mohamad Ballout, Ulf Krumnack, Gunther Heidemann, Kai-Uwe Kuehnberger","Our research demonstrates the significant benefits of using fine-tuning with explanations to enhance the performance of language models. Unlike prompting, which maintains the model's parameters, fine-tuning allows the model to learn and update its parameters during a training phase. In this study, we applied fine-tuning to various sized language models using data that contained explanations of the output rather than merely presenting the answers. We found that even smaller language models with as few as 60 million parameters benefited substantially from this approach. Interestingly, our results indicated that the detailed explanations were more beneficial to smaller models than larger ones, with the latter gaining nearly the same advantage from any form of explanation, irrespective of its length. Additionally, we demonstrate that the inclusion of explanations enables the models to solve tasks that they were not able to solve without explanations. Lastly, we argue that despite the challenging nature of adding explanations, samples that contain explanations not only reduce the volume of data required for training but also promote a more effective generalization by the model. In essence, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with explanations significantly bolsters the performance of large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07543v1,2024-02

BreakGPT: A Large Language Model with Multi-stage Structure for Financial Breakout Detection,"Kang Zhang, Osamu Yoshie, Weiran Huang","Trading range breakout (TRB) is a key method in the technical analysis of financial trading, widely employed by traders in financial markets such as stocks, futures, and foreign exchange. However, distinguishing between true and false breakout and providing the correct rationale cause significant challenges to investors. Recently, large language models have achieved success in various downstream applications, but their effectiveness in the domain of financial breakout detection has been subpar. The reason is that the unique data and specific knowledge are required in breakout detection. To address these issues, we introduce BreakGPT, the first large language model for financial breakout detection. Furthermore, we have developed a novel framework for large language models, namely multi-stage structure, effectively reducing mistakes in downstream applications.

MAFIA: Multi-Adapter Fused Inclusive LanguAge Models,"Prachi Jain, Ashutosh Sathe, Varun Gumma, Kabir Ahuja, Sunayana Sitaram","Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) are widely used in NLP for various tasks. Recent studies have identified various biases that such models exhibit and have proposed methods to correct these biases. However, most of the works address a limited set of bias dimensions independently such as gender, race, or religion. Moreover, the methods typically involve finetuning the full model to maintain the performance on the downstream task. In this work, we aim to modularly debias a pretrained language model across multiple dimensions. Previous works extensively explored debiasing PLMs using limited US-centric counterfactual data augmentation (CDA). We use structured knowledge and a large generative model to build a diverse CDA across multiple bias dimensions in a semi-automated way. We highlight how existing debiasing methods do not consider interactions between multiple societal biases and propose a debiasing model that exploits the synergy amongst various societal biases and enables multi-bias debiasing simultaneously. An extensive evaluation on multiple tasks and languages demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07519v1,2024-02
The Balancing Act: Unmasking and Alleviating ASR Biases in Portuguese,"Ajinkya Kulkarni, Anna Tokareva, Rameez Qureshi, Miguel Couceiro","In the field of spoken language understanding, systems like Whisper and Multilingual Massive Speech (MMS) have shown state-of-the-art performances. This study is dedicated to a comprehensive exploration of the Whisper and MMS systems, with a focus on assessing biases in automatic speech recognition (ASR) inherent to casual conversation speech specific to the Portuguese language. Our investigation encompasses various categories, including gender, age, skin tone color, and geo-location. Alongside traditional ASR evaluation metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER), we have incorporated p-value statistical significance for gender bias analysis. Furthermore, we extensively examine the impact of data distribution and empirically show that oversampling techniques alleviate such stereotypical biases. This research represents a pioneering effort in quantifying biases in the Portuguese language context through the application of MMS and Whisper, contributing to a better understanding of ASR systems' performance in multilingual settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07513v1,2024-02
T-RAG: Lessons from the LLM Trenches,"Masoomali Fatehkia, Ji Kim Lucas, Sanjay Chawla","Large Language Models (LLM) have shown remarkable language capabilities fueling attempts to integrate them into applications across a wide range of domains. An important application area is question answering over private enterprise documents where the main considerations are data security, which necessitates applications that can be deployed on-prem, limited computational resources and the need for a robust application that correctly responds to queries. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the most prominent framework for building LLM-based applications. While building a RAG is relatively straightforward, making it robust and a reliable application requires extensive customization and relatively deep knowledge of the application domain. We share our experiences building and deploying an LLM application for question answering over private organizational documents. Our application combines the use of RAG with a finetuned open-source LLM. Additionally, our system, which we call Tree-RAG (T-RAG), uses a tree structure to represent entity hierarchies within the organization. This is used to generate a textual description to augment the context when responding to user queries pertaining to entities within the organization's hierarchy. Our evaluations, including a Needle in a Haystack test, show that this combination performs better than a simple RAG or finetuning implementation. Finally, we share some lessons learned based on our experiences building an LLM application for real-world use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07483v2,2024-02
Pushing The Limit of LLM Capacity for Text Classification,"Yazhou Zhang, Mengyao Wang, Chenyu Ren, Qiuchi Li, Prayag Tiwari, Benyou Wang, Jing Qin","The value of text classification's future research has encountered challenges and uncertainties, due to the extraordinary efficacy demonstrated by large language models (LLMs) across numerous downstream NLP tasks. In this era of open-ended language modeling, where task boundaries are gradually fading, an urgent question emerges: have we made significant advances in text classification under the full benefit of LLMs? To answer this question, we propose RGPT, an adaptive boosting framework tailored to produce a specialized text classification LLM by recurrently ensembling a pool of strong base learners. The base learners are constructed by adaptively adjusting the distribution of training samples and iteratively fine-tuning LLMs with them. Such base learners are then ensembled to be a specialized text classification LLM, by recurrently incorporating the historical predictions from the previous learners. Through a comprehensive empirical comparison, we show that RGPT significantly outperforms 8 SOTA PLMs and 7 SOTA LLMs on four benchmarks by 1.36% on average. Further evaluation experiments show a clear surpassing of RGPT over human classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07470v2,2024-02

We ranked each corpus according to a similarity measure and carried out an intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation on different portions of this ranked corpus. We show that there are significant quality differences between different portions of web-mined corpora and that the quality varies across languages and datasets.

Intrinsic Task-based Evaluation for Referring Expression Generation,"Guanyi Chen, Fahime Same, Kees van Deemter","Recently, a human evaluation study of Referring Expression Generation (REG) models had an unexpected conclusion: on \textsc{webnlg}, Referring Expressions (REs) generated by the state-of-the-art neural models were not only indistinguishable from the REs in \textsc{webnlg} but also from the REs generated by a simple rule-based system. Here, we argue that this limitation could stem from the use of a purely ratings-based human evaluation (which is a common practice in Natural Language Generation). To investigate these issues, we propose an intrinsic task-based evaluation for REG models, in which, in addition to rating the quality of REs, participants were asked to accomplish two meta-level tasks. One of these tasks concerns the referential success of each RE; the other task asks participants to suggest a better alternative for each RE. The outcomes suggest that, in comparison to previous evaluations, the new evaluation protocol assesses the performance of each REG model more comprehensively and makes the participants' ratings more reliable and discriminable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07432v1,2024-02

To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Refinement (MADR) framework, leveraging multiple LLMs as agents with diverse roles in an iterative refining process aimed at enhancing faithfulness in generated explanations. MADR ensures that the final explanation undergoes rigorous validation, significantly reducing the likelihood of unfaithful elements and aligning closely with the provided evidence.

However, most text-to-speech (TTS) systems lack the ability to produce realistic and appropriate laughter sounds, limiting their applications and user experience. While there have been prior works to generate natural laughter, they fell short in terms of controlling the timing and variety of the laughter to be generated. In this work, we propose ELaTE, a zero-shot TTS that can generate natural laughing speech of any speaker based on a short audio prompt with precise control of laughter timing and expression. Specifically, ELaTE works on the audio prompt to mimic the voice characteristic, the text prompt to indicate the contents of the generated speech, and the input to control the laughter expression, which can be either the start and end times of laughter, or the additional audio prompt that contains laughter to be mimicked. We develop our model based on the foundation of conditional flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS, and fine-tune it with frame-level representation from a laughter detector as additional conditioning. With a simple scheme to mix small-scale laughter-conditioned data with large-scale pre-training data, we demonstrate that a pre-trained zero-shot TTS model can be readily fine-tuned to generate natural laughter with precise controllability, without losing any quality of the pre-trained zero-shot TTS model. Through objective and subjective evaluations, we show that ELaTE can generate laughing speech with significantly higher quality and controllability compared to conventional models.

While conditioning with empirical data improves performance on the whole, the benefit of in-context learning varies considerably across demographics, sometimes hurting performance for one demographic while helping performance for others.

Summing Up the Facts: Additive Mechanisms Behind Factual Recall in LLMs,"Bilal Chughtai, Alan Cooney, Neel Nanda","How do transformer-based large language models (LLMs) store and retrieve knowledge? We focus on the most basic form of this task -- factual recall, where the model is tasked with explicitly surfacing stored facts in prompts of form `Fact: The Colosseum is in the country of'. We find that the mechanistic story behind factual recall is more complex than previously thought. It comprises several distinct, independent, and qualitatively different mechanisms that additively combine, constructively interfering on the correct attribute. We term this generic phenomena the additive motif: models compute through summing up multiple independent contributions. Each mechanism's contribution may be insufficient alone, but summing results in constructive interfere on the correct answer. In addition, we extend the method of direct logit attribution to attribute an attention head's output to individual source tokens. We use this technique to unpack what we call `mixed heads' -- which are themselves a pair of two separate additive updates from different source tokens.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07321v1,2024-02
ODIN: Disentangled Reward Mitigates Hacking in RLHF,"Lichang Chen, Chen Zhu, Davit Soselia, Jiuhai Chen, Tianyi Zhou, Tom Goldstein, Heng Huang, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro","In this work, we study the issue of reward hacking on the response length, a challenge emerging in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on LLMs. A well-formatted, verbose but less helpful response from the LLMs can often deceive LLMs or even human evaluators to achieve high scores. The same issue also holds for some reward models in RL. To address the challenges in both training and evaluation, we establish a more reliable evaluation protocol for comparing different training configurations, which inspects the trade-off between LLM evaluation score and response length obtained by varying training hyperparameters. Based on this evaluation, we conduct large-scale studies, where the results shed insights into the efficacy of hyperparameters and tricks used in RL on mitigating length bias. We further propose to improve the reward model by jointly training two linear heads on shared feature representations to predict the rewards, one trained to correlate with length, and the other trained to decorrelate with length and therefore focus more on the actual content. We then discard the length head in RL to prevent reward hacking on length. Experiments demonstrate that our approach almost eliminates the reward correlation with length, and improves the obtained policy by a significant margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07319v1,2024-02
HyperBERT: Mixing Hypergraph-Aware Layers with Language Models for Node Classification on Text-Attributed Hypergraphs,"Adrián Bazaga, Pietro Liò, Gos Micklem","Hypergraphs are characterized by complex topological structure, representing higher-order interactions among multiple entities through hyperedges. Lately, hypergraph-based deep learning methods to learn informative data representations for the problem of node classification on text-attributed hypergraphs have garnered increasing research attention. However, existing methods struggle to simultaneously capture the full extent of hypergraph structural information and the rich linguistic attributes inherent in the nodes attributes, which largely hampers their effectiveness and generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we explore ways to further augment a pretrained BERT model with specialized hypergraph-aware layers for the task of node classification. Such layers introduce higher-order structural inductive bias into the language model, thus improving the model's capacity to harness both higher-order context information from the hypergraph structure and semantic information present in text. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, HyperBERT, a mixed text-hypergraph model which simultaneously models hypergraph relational structure while maintaining the high-quality text encoding capabilities of a pre-trained BERT. Notably, HyperBERT presents results that achieve a new state-of-the-art on five challenging text-attributed hypergraph node classification benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07309v4,2024-02
Power Transformer Fault Prediction Based on Knowledge Graphs,"Chao Wang, Zhuo Chen, Ziyan Zhang, Chiyi Li, Kai Song","In this paper, we address the challenge of learning with limited fault data for power transformers. Traditional operation and maintenance tools lack effective predictive capabilities for potential faults. The scarcity of extensive fault data makes it difficult to apply machine learning techniques effectively. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach that leverages the knowledge graph (KG) technology in combination with gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT). This method is designed to efficiently learn from a small set of high-dimensional data, integrating various factors influencing transformer faults and historical operational data. Our approach enables accurate safe state assessments and fault analyses of power transformers despite the limited fault characteristic data. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms other learning approaches in prediction accuracy, such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and logistic regression (LR). Furthermore, it offers significant improvements in progressiveness, practicality, and potential for widespread application.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07283v1,2024-02
How do Large Language Models Navigate Conflicts between Honesty and Helpfulness?,"Ryan Liu, Theodore R. Sumers, Ishita Dasgupta, Thomas L. Griffiths","In day-to-day communication, people often approximate the truth - for example, rounding the time or omitting details - in order to be maximally helpful to the listener. How do large language models (LLMs) handle such nuanced trade-offs? To address this question, we use psychological models and experiments designed to characterize human behavior to analyze LLMs. We test a range of LLMs and explore how optimization for human preferences or inference-time reasoning affects these trade-offs. We find that reinforcement learning from human feedback improves both honesty and helpfulness, while chain-of-thought prompting skews LLMs towards helpfulness over honesty. Finally, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates human-like response patterns including sensitivity to the conversational framing and listener's decision context. Our findings reveal the conversational values internalized by LLMs and suggest that even these abstract values can, to a degree, be steered by zero-shot prompting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07282v2,2024-02

Despite its usefulness, this application has not been well studied in the NLP community. We propose the first benchmark on this useful task called Recap Snippet Identification with a hand-crafted evaluation dataset. Our experiments show that the proposed task is challenging to PLMs, LLMs, and proposed methods as the task requires a deep understanding of the plot correlation between snippets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07271v1,2024-02
Open-ended VQA benchmarking of Vision-Language models by exploiting Classification datasets and their semantic hierarchy,"Simon Ging, María A. Bravo, Thomas Brox","The evaluation of text-generative vision-language models is a challenging yet crucial endeavor. By addressing the limitations of existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and proposing innovative evaluation methodologies, our research seeks to advance our understanding of these models' capabilities. We propose a novel VQA benchmark based on well-known visual classification datasets which allows a granular evaluation of text-generative vision-language models and their comparison with discriminative vision-language models. To improve the assessment of coarse answers on fine-grained classification tasks, we suggest using the semantic hierarchy of the label space to ask automatically generated follow-up questions about the ground-truth category. Finally, we compare traditional NLP and LLM-based metrics for the problem of evaluating model predictions given ground-truth answers. We perform a human evaluation study upon which we base our decision on the final metric. We apply our benchmark to a suite of vision-language models and show a detailed comparison of their abilities on object, action, and attribute classification. Our contributions aim to lay the foundation for more precise and meaningful assessments, facilitating targeted progress in the exciting field of vision-language modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07270v2,2024-02
Low-Resource Counterspeech Generation for Indic Languages: The Case of Bengali and Hindi,"Mithun Das, Saurabh Kumar Pandey, Shivansh Sethi, Punyajoy Saha, Animesh Mukherjee","With the rise of online abuse, the NLP community has begun investigating the use of neural architectures to generate counterspeech that can ""counter"" the vicious tone of such abusive speech and dilute/ameliorate their rippling effect over the social network. However, most of the efforts so far have been primarily focused on English. To bridge the gap for low-resource languages such as Bengali and Hindi, we create a benchmark dataset of 5,062 abusive speech/counterspeech pairs, of which 2,460 pairs are in Bengali and 2,602 pairs are in Hindi. We implement several baseline models considering various interlingual transfer mechanisms with different configurations to generate suitable counterspeech to set up an effective benchmark. We observe that the monolingual setup yields the best performance. Further, using synthetic transfer, language models can generate counterspeech to some extent; specifically, we notice that transferability is better when languages belong to the same language family.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07262v1,2024-02

TransGPT: Multi-modal Generative Pre-trained Transformer for Transportation,"Peng Wang, Xiang Wei, Fangxu Hu, Wenjuan Han","Natural language processing (NLP) is a key component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), but it faces many challenges in the transportation domain, such as domain-specific knowledge and data, and multi-modal inputs and outputs. This paper presents TransGPT, a novel (multi-modal) large language model for the transportation domain, which consists of two independent variants: TransGPT-SM for single-modal data and TransGPT-MM for multi-modal data. TransGPT-SM is finetuned on a single-modal Transportation dataset (STD) that contains textual data from various sources in the transportation domain. TransGPT-MM is finetuned on a multi-modal Transportation dataset (MTD) that we manually collected from three areas of the transportation domain: driving tests, traffic signs, and landmarks. We evaluate TransGPT on several benchmark datasets for different tasks in the transportation domain, and show that it outperforms baseline models on most tasks. We also showcase the potential applications of TransGPT for traffic analysis and modeling, such as generating synthetic traffic scenarios, explaining traffic phenomena, answering traffic-related questions, providing traffic recommendations, and generating traffic reports. This work advances the state-of-the-art of NLP in the transportation domain and provides a useful tool for ITS researchers and practitioners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07233v1,2024-02
"Through the Lens of Split Vote: Exploring Disagreement, Difficulty and Calibration in Legal Case Outcome Classification","Shanshan Xu, T. Y. S. S Santosh, Oana Ichim, Barbara Plank, Matthias Grabmair","In legal decisions, split votes (SV) occur when judges cannot reach a unanimous decision, posing a difficulty for lawyers who must navigate diverse legal arguments and opinions. In high-stakes domains, understanding the alignment of perceived difficulty between humans and AI systems is crucial to build trust. However, existing NLP calibration methods focus on a classifier's awareness of predictive performance, measured against the human majority class, overlooking inherent human label variation (HLV). This paper explores split votes as naturally observable human disagreement and value pluralism. We collect judges' vote distributions from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and present SV-ECHR, a case outcome classification (COC) dataset with SV information. We build a taxonomy of disagreement with SV-specific subcategories. We further assess the alignment of perceived difficulty between models and humans, as well as confidence- and human-calibration of COC models. We observe limited alignment with the judge vote distribution. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic exploration of calibration to human judgements in legal NLP. Our study underscores the necessity for further research on measuring and enhancing model calibration considering HLV in legal decision tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07214v3,2024-02
Beware of Words: Evaluating the Lexical Diversity of Conversational LLMs using ChatGPT as Case Study,"Gonzalo Martínez, José Alberto Hernández, Javier Conde, Pedro Reviriego, Elena Merino","The performance of conversational Large Language Models (LLMs) in general, and of ChatGPT in particular, is currently being evaluated on many different tasks, from logical reasoning or maths to answering questions on a myriad of topics. Instead, much less attention is being devoted to the study of the linguistic features of the texts generated by these LLMs. This is surprising since LLMs are models for language, and understanding how they use the language is important. Indeed, conversational LLMs are poised to have a significant impact on the evolution of languages as they may eventually dominate the creation of new text. This means that for example, if conversational LLMs do not use a word it may become less and less frequent and eventually stop being used altogether. Therefore, evaluating the linguistic features of the text they produce and how those depend on the model parameters is the first step toward understanding the potential impact of conversational LLMs on the evolution of languages. In this paper, we consider the evaluation of the lexical richness of the text generated by LLMs and how it depends on the model parameters. A methodology is presented and used to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of lexical richness using ChatGPT as a case study. The results show how lexical richness depends on the version of ChatGPT and some of its parameters, such as the presence penalty, or on the role assigned to the model. The dataset and tools used in our analysis are released under open licenses with the goal of drawing the much-needed attention to the evaluation of the linguistic features of LLM-generated text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15518v2,2024-02
ITINERA: Integrating Spatial Optimization with Large Language Models for Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning,"Yihong Tang, Zhaokai Wang, Ao Qu, Yihao Yan, Zhaofeng Wu, Dingyi Zhuang, Jushi Kai, Kebing Hou, Xiaotong Guo, Han Zheng, Tiange Luo, Jinhua Zhao, Zhan Zhao, Wei Ma","Citywalk, a recently popular form of urban travel, requires genuine personalization and understanding of fine-grained requests compared to traditional itinerary planning.

This involves decomposing user requests, selecting candidate points of interest (POIs), ordering the POIs based on cluster-aware spatial optimization, and generating the itinerary.

Prompt Perturbation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Large Language Models,"Zhibo Hu, Chen Wang, Yanfeng Shu, Helen, Paik, Liming Zhu","The robustness of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly important as their use rapidly grows in a wide range of domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is considered as a means to improve the trustworthiness of text generation from LLMs. However, how the outputs from RAG-based LLMs are affected by slightly different inputs is not well studied. In this work, we find that the insertion of even a short prefix to the prompt leads to the generation of outputs far away from factually correct answers. We systematically evaluate the effect of such prefixes on RAG by introducing a novel optimization technique called Gradient Guided Prompt Perturbation (GGPP). GGPP achieves a high success rate in steering outputs of RAG-based LLMs to targeted wrong answers. It can also cope with instructions in the prompts requesting to ignore irrelevant context. We also exploit LLMs' neuron activation difference between prompts with and without GGPP perturbations to give a method that improves the robustness of RAG-based LLMs through a highly effective detector trained on neuron activation triggered by GGPP generated prompts. Our evaluation on open-sourced LLMs demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07179v3,2024-02

However, RL is often hindered by issues such as low sample efficiency, lack of interpretability, and sparse supervision signals. To tackle these limitations, we take inspiration from the human learning process and introduce Natural Language Reinforcement Learning (NLRL), which innovatively combines RL principles with natural language representation. Specifically, NLRL redefines RL concepts like task objectives, policy, value function, Bellman equation, and policy iteration in natural language space. We present how NLRL can be practically implemented with the latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4. Initial experiments over tabular MDPs demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and also interpretability of the NLRL framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07157v2,2024-02
"X-LoRA: Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts, a Flexible Framework for Large Language Models with Applications in Protein Mechanics and Molecular Design","Eric L. Buehler, Markus J. Buehler","We report a mixture of expert strategy to create fine-tuned large language models using a deep layer-wise token-level approach based on low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Starting with a set of pre-trained LoRA adapters, our gating strategy uses the hidden states to dynamically mix adapted layers, allowing the resulting X-LoRA model to draw upon different capabilities and create never-before-used deep layer-wise combinations to solve tasks. The design is inspired by the biological principles of universality and diversity, where neural network building blocks are reused in different hierarchical manifestations. Hence, the X-LoRA model can be easily implemented for any existing large language model (LLM) without a need for modifications of the underlying structure. We develop a tailored X-LoRA model that offers scientific capabilities including forward/inverse analysis tasks and enhanced reasoning capability, focused on biomaterial analysis, protein mechanics and design. The impact of this work include access to readily expandable and adaptable models with strong domain knowledge and the capability to integrate across areas of knowledge. Featuring experts in biology, mathematics, reasoning, bio-inspired materials, mechanics and materials, chemistry, protein biophysics, mechanics and quantum-mechanics based molecular properties, we conduct a series of physics-focused case studies. We examine knowledge recall, protein mechanics forward/inverse tasks, protein design, adversarial agentic modeling including ontological knowledge graph construction, as well as molecular design. The model is capable not only of making quantitative predictions of nanomechanical properties of proteins or quantum mechanical molecular properties, but also reasons over the results and correctly predicts likely mechanisms that explain distinct molecular behaviors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07148v2,2024-02
Generalizing Conversational Dense Retrieval via LLM-Cognition Data Augmentation,"Haonan Chen, Zhicheng Dou, Kelong Mao, Jiongnan Liu, Ziliang Zhao","Conversational search utilizes muli-turn natural language contexts to retrieve relevant passages. Existing conversational dense retrieval models mostly view a conversation as a fixed sequence of questions and responses, overlooking the severe data sparsity problem -- that is, users can perform a conversation in various ways, and these alternate conversations are unrecorded. Consequently, they often struggle to generalize to diverse conversations in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a framework for generalizing Conversational dense retrieval via LLM-cognition data Augmentation (ConvAug). ConvAug first generates multi-level augmented conversations to capture the diverse nature of conversational contexts. Inspired by human cognition, we devise a cognition-aware process to mitigate the generation of false positives, false negatives, and hallucinations. Moreover, we develop a difficulty-adaptive sample filter that selects challenging samples for complex conversations, thereby giving the model a larger learning space. A contrastive learning objective is then employed to train a better conversational context encoder. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets, under both normal and zero-shot settings, demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and applicability of ConvAug. The code is released at https://github.com/haon-chen/ConvAug.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07092v3,2024-02
Speech Rhythm-Based Speaker Embeddings Extraction from Phonemes and Phoneme Duration for Multi-Speaker Speech Synthesis,"Kenichi Fujita, Atsushi Ando, Yusuke Ijima","This paper proposes a speech rhythm-based method for speaker embeddings to model phoneme duration using a few utterances by the target speaker. Speech rhythm is one of the essential factors among speaker characteristics, along with acoustic features such as F0, for reproducing individual utterances in speech synthesis. A novel feature of the proposed method is the rhythm-based embeddings extracted from phonemes and their durations, which are known to be related to speaking rhythm. They are extracted with a speaker identification model similar to the conventional spectral feature-based one. We conducted three experiments, speaker embeddings generation, speech synthesis with generated embeddings, and embedding space analysis, to evaluate the performance. The proposed method demonstrated a moderate speaker identification performance (15.2% EER), even with only phonemes and their duration information. The objective and subjective evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method can synthesize speech with speech rhythm closer to the target speaker than the conventional method. We also visualized the embeddings to evaluate the relationship between the distance of the embeddings and the perceptual similarity. The visualization of the embedding space and the relation analysis between the closeness indicated that the distribution of embeddings reflects the subjective and objective similarity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07085v1,2024-02
Using Large Language Models for Student-Code Guided Test Case Generation in Computer Science Education,"Nischal Ashok Kumar, Andrew Lan","In computer science education, test cases are an integral part of programming assignments since they can be used as assessment items to test students' programming knowledge and provide personalized feedback on student-written code. The goal of our work is to propose a fully automated approach for test case generation that can accurately measure student knowledge, which is important for two reasons. First, manually constructing test cases requires expert knowledge and is a labor-intensive process. Second, developing test cases for students, especially those who are novice programmers, is significantly different from those oriented toward professional-level software developers. Therefore, we need an automated process for test case generation to assess student knowledge and provide feedback. In this work, we propose a large language model-based approach to automatically generate test cases and show that they are good measures of student knowledge, using a publicly available dataset that contains student-written Java code. We also discuss future research directions centered on using test cases to help students.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07081v1,2024-02
Using Large Language Models to Automate and Expedite Reinforcement Learning with Reward Machine,"Shayan Meshkat Alsadat, Jean-Raphael Gaglione, Daniel Neider, Ufuk Topcu, Zhe Xu","We present LARL-RM (Large language model-generated Automaton for Reinforcement Learning with Reward Machine) algorithm in order to encode high-level knowledge into reinforcement learning using automaton to expedite the reinforcement learning. Our method uses Large Language Models (LLM) to obtain high-level domain-specific knowledge using prompt engineering instead of providing the reinforcement learning algorithm directly with the high-level knowledge which requires an expert to encode the automaton. We use chain-of-thought and few-shot methods for prompt engineering and demonstrate that our method works using these approaches. Additionally, LARL-RM allows for fully closed-loop reinforcement learning without the need for an expert to guide and supervise the learning since LARL-RM can use the LLM directly to generate the required high-level knowledge for the task at hand. We also show the theoretical guarantee of our algorithm to converge to an optimal policy. We demonstrate that LARL-RM speeds up the convergence by 30% by implementing our method in two case studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07069v1,2024-02
$L^*LM$: Learning Automata from Examples using Natural Language Oracles,"Marcell Vazquez-Chanlatte, Karim Elmaaroufi, Stefan J. Witwicki, Sanjit A. Seshia","Expert demonstrations have proven an easy way to indirectly specify complex tasks. Recent algorithms even support extracting unambiguous formal specifications, e.g. deterministic finite automata (DFA), from demonstrations. Unfortunately, these techniques are generally not sample efficient. In this work, we introduce $L^*LM$, an algorithm for learning DFAs from both demonstrations and natural language. Due to the expressivity of natural language, we observe a significant improvement in the data efficiency of learning DFAs from expert demonstrations. Technically, $L^*LM$ leverages large language models to answer membership queries about the underlying task. This is then combined with recent techniques for transforming learning from demonstrations into a sequence of labeled example learning problems. In our experiments, we observe the two modalities complement each other, yielding a powerful few-shot learner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07051v1,2024-02
A Tale of Tails: Model Collapse as a Change of Scaling Laws,"Elvis Dohmatob, Yunzhen Feng, Pu Yang, Francois Charton, Julia Kempe","As AI model size grows, neural scaling laws have become a crucial tool to predict the improvements of large models when increasing capacity and the size of original (human or natural) training data. Yet, the widespread use of popular models means that the ecosystem of online data and text will co-evolve to progressively contain increased amounts of synthesized data. In this paper we ask: How will the scaling laws change in the inevitable regime where synthetic data makes its way into the training corpus? Will future models, still improve, or be doomed to degenerate up to total (model) collapse? We develop a theoretical framework of model collapse through the lens of scaling laws. We discover a wide range of decay phenomena, analyzing loss of scaling, shifted scaling with number of generations, the ''un-learning"" of skills, and grokking when mixing human and synthesized data. Our theory is validated by large-scale experiments with a transformer on an arithmetic task and text generation using the large language model Llama2.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07043v2,2024-02
Semi-Supervised Learning for Bilingual Lexicon Induction,"Paul Garnier, Gauthier Guinet","We consider the problem of aligning two sets of continuous word representations, corresponding to languages, to a common space in order to infer a bilingual lexicon. It was recently shown that it is possible to infer such lexicon, without using any parallel data, by aligning word embeddings trained on monolingual data. Such line of work is called unsupervised bilingual induction. By wondering whether it was possible to gain experience in the progressive learning of several languages, we asked ourselves to what extent we could integrate the knowledge of a given set of languages when learning a new one, without having parallel data for the latter. In other words, while keeping the core problem of unsupervised learning in the latest step, we allowed the access to other corpora of idioms, hence the name semi-supervised. This led us to propose a novel formulation, considering the lexicon induction as a ranking problem for which we used recent tools of this machine learning field. Our experiments on standard benchmarks, inferring dictionary from English to more than 20 languages, show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state of the art benchmark. In addition, we deduce from this new scenario several relevant conclusions allowing a better understanding of the alignment phenomenon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07028v1,2024-02
Gemini Goes to Med School: Exploring the Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models on Medical Challenge Problems & Hallucinations,"Ankit Pal, Malaikannan Sankarasubbu","Large language models have the potential to be valuable in the healthcare industry, but it's crucial to verify their safety and effectiveness through rigorous evaluation. For this purpose, we comprehensively evaluated both open-source LLMs and Google's new multimodal LLM called Gemini across Medical reasoning, hallucination detection, and Medical Visual Question Answering tasks. While Gemini showed competence, it lagged behind state-of-the-art models like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, Gemini achieved an accuracy of 61.45\% on the medical VQA dataset, significantly lower than GPT-4V's score of 88\%. Our analysis revealed that Gemini is highly susceptible to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps, which indicate risks if deployed uncritically. We also performed a detailed analysis by medical subject and test type, providing actionable feedback for developers and clinicians. To mitigate risks, we applied prompting strategies that improved performance. Additionally, we facilitated future research and development by releasing a Python module for medical LLM evaluation and establishing a dedicated leaderboard on Hugging Face for medical domain LLMs. Python module can be found at https://github.com/promptslab/RosettaEval",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07023v1,2024-02
A Rational Analysis of the Speech-to-Song Illusion,"Raja Marjieh, Pol van Rijn, Ilia Sucholutsky, Harin Lee, Thomas L. Griffiths, Nori Jacoby","The speech-to-song illusion is a robust psychological phenomenon whereby a spoken sentence sounds increasingly more musical as it is repeated. Despite decades of research, a complete formal account of this transformation is still lacking, and some of its nuanced characteristics, namely, that certain phrases appear to transform while others do not, is not well understood. Here we provide a formal account of this phenomenon, by recasting it as a statistical inference whereby a rational agent attempts to decide whether a sequence of utterances is more likely to have been produced in a song or speech. Using this approach and analyzing song and speech corpora, we further introduce a novel prose-to-lyrics illusion that is purely text-based. In this illusion, simply duplicating written sentences makes them appear more like song lyrics. We provide robust evidence for this new illusion in both human participants and large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06992v1,2024-02
DAEDRA: A language model for predicting outcomes in passive pharmacovigilance reporting,Chris von Csefalvay,"Over the recent years, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has given rise to a proliferation of domain-specific models that are intended to reflect the particularities of linguistic context and content as a correlate of the originating domain. This paper details the conception, design, training and evaluation of DAEDRA, a LLM designed to detect regulatory-relevant outcomes (mortality, ER attendance and hospitalisation) in adverse event reports elicited through passive reporting (PR). While PR is a highly cost-efficient way of eliciting information from a wide and diverse audience -- typically including not only physicians and healthcare providers but also patients, family members and other lay stakeholders --, this diversity makes PR corpora difficult to analyse. Generic language models may not capture the complex clinical dimensions while specific clinical or biomedical models may not perform well on lay reports. To evaluate the utility of a subdomain-specific language model, an adaptive training approach was adapted, wherein base language model candidates were evaluated on a subset of the corpus, and the best performer was trained on the entire corpus. This yielded a small but significant improvement in $F_1$ (+1%), precision (+2.5%) and recall (+3.8%), at a relatively low training cost and a single-day training time. Subdomain-specific LLMs continue to be viable options for better results when analysing highly specialised corpora.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10951v1,2024-02
Event-Keyed Summarization,"William Gantt, Alexander Martin, Pavlo Kuchmiichuk, Aaron Steven White","We introduce event-keyed summarization (EKS), a novel task that marries traditional summarization and document-level event extraction, with the goal of generating a contextualized summary for a specific event, given a document and an extracted event structure. We introduce a dataset for this task, MUCSUM, consisting of summaries of all events in the classic MUC-4 dataset, along with a set of baselines that comprises both pretrained LM standards in the summarization literature, as well as larger frontier models. We show that ablations that reduce EKS to traditional summarization or structure-to-text yield inferior summaries of target events and that MUCSUM is a robust benchmark for this task. Lastly, we conduct a human evaluation of both reference and model summaries, and provide some detailed analysis of the results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06973v1,2024-02
"Instruct Once, Chat Consistently in Multiple Rounds: An Efficient Tuning Framework for Dialogue","Jian Wang, Chak Tou Leong, Jiashuo Wang, Dongding Lin, Wenjie Li, Xiao-Yong Wei","Tuning language models for dialogue generation has been a prevalent paradigm for building capable dialogue agents. Yet, traditional tuning narrowly views dialogue generation as resembling other language generation tasks, ignoring the role disparities between two speakers and the multi-round interactive process that dialogues ought to be. Such a manner often leads to unsatisfactory chat consistency for the built agent. In this work, we emphasize the interactive, communicative nature of dialogue and argue that it is more feasible to model the speaker roles of agent and user separately, enabling the agent to adhere to its role consistently. With this in mind, we propose an efficient Multi-round Interactive Dialogue Tuning (Midi-Tuning) framework. It models the agent and user individually with two adapters built upon large language models. The adapters make use of respective utterances round by round in alternating order and they are tuned via a round-level memory caching mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, our framework performs superior to traditional fine-tuning and harbors the tremendous potential for improving dialogue consistency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06967v2,2024-02
NLP for Knowledge Discovery and Information Extraction from Energetics Corpora,"Francis G. VanGessel, Efrem Perry, Salil Mohan, Oliver M. Barham, Mark Cavolowsky","We present a demonstration of the utility of NLP for aiding research into energetic materials and associated systems. The NLP method enables machine understanding of textual data, offering an automated route to knowledge discovery and information extraction from energetics text. We apply three established unsupervised NLP models: Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Word2Vec, and the Transformer to a large curated dataset of energetics-related scientific articles. We demonstrate that each NLP algorithm is capable of identifying energetic topics and concepts, generating a language model which aligns with Subject Matter Expert knowledge. Furthermore, we present a document classification pipeline for energetics text. Our classification pipeline achieves 59-76\% accuracy depending on the NLP model used, with the highest performing Transformer model rivaling inter-annotator agreement metrics. The NLP approaches studied in this work can identify concepts germane to energetics and therefore hold promise as a tool for accelerating energetics research efforts and energetics material development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06964v1,2024-02
SpeechCLIP+: Self-supervised multi-task representation learning for speech via CLIP and speech-image data,"Hsuan-Fu Wang, Yi-Jen Shih, Heng-Jui Chang, Layne Berry, Puyuan Peng, Hung-yi Lee, Hsin-Min Wang, David Harwath","The recently proposed visually grounded speech model SpeechCLIP is an innovative framework that bridges speech and text through images via CLIP without relying on text transcription. On this basis, this paper introduces two extensions to SpeechCLIP. First, we apply the Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) module to replace a fixed number of CLS tokens in the cascaded architecture. Second, we propose a new hybrid architecture that merges the cascaded and parallel architectures of SpeechCLIP into a multi-task learning framework. Our experimental evaluation is performed on the Flickr8k and SpokenCOCO datasets. The results show that in the speech keyword extraction task, the CIF-based cascaded SpeechCLIP model outperforms the previous cascaded SpeechCLIP model using a fixed number of CLS tokens. Furthermore, through our hybrid architecture, cascaded task learning boosts the performance of the parallel branch in image-speech retrieval tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06959v1,2024-02
OpenFedLLM: Training Large Language Models on Decentralized Private Data via Federated Learning,"Rui Ye, Wenhao Wang, Jingyi Chai, Dihan Li, Zexi Li, Yinda Xu, Yaxin Du, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen","Trained on massive publicly available data, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous success across various fields. While more data contributes to better performance, a disconcerting reality is that high-quality public data will be exhausted in a few years. In this paper, we offer a potential next step for contemporary LLMs: collaborative and privacy-preserving LLM training on the underutilized distributed private data via federated learning (FL), where multiple data owners collaboratively train a shared model without transmitting raw data. To achieve this, we build a concise, integrated, and research-friendly framework/codebase, named OpenFedLLM. It covers federated instruction tuning for enhancing instruction-following capability, federated value alignment for aligning with human values, and 7 representative FL algorithms. Besides, OpenFedLLM supports training on diverse domains, where we cover 8 training datasets; and provides comprehensive evaluations, where we cover 30+ evaluation metrics. Through extensive experiments, we observe that all FL algorithms outperform local training on training LLMs, demonstrating a clear performance improvement across a variety of settings. Notably, in a financial benchmark, Llama2-7B fine-tuned by applying any FL algorithm can outperform GPT-4 by a significant margin while the model obtained through individual training cannot, demonstrating strong motivation for clients to participate in FL. The code is available at https://github.com/rui-ye/OpenFedLLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06954v1,2024-02
Should I try multiple optimizers when fine-tuning pre-trained Transformers for NLP tasks? Should I tune their hyperparameters?,"Nefeli Gkouti, Prodromos Malakasiotis, Stavros Toumpis, Ion Androutsopoulos","NLP research has explored different neural model architectures and sizes, datasets, training objectives, and transfer learning techniques. However, the choice of optimizer during training has not been explored as extensively. Typically, some variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is employed, selected among numerous variants, using unclear criteria, often with minimal or no tuning of the optimizer's hyperparameters. Experimenting with five GLUE datasets, two models (DistilBERT and DistilRoBERTa), and seven popular optimizers (SGD, SGD with Momentum, Adam, AdaMax, Nadam, AdamW, and AdaBound), we find that when the hyperparameters of the optimizers are tuned, there is no substantial difference in test performance across the five more elaborate (adaptive) optimizers, despite differences in training loss. Furthermore, tuning just the learning rate is in most cases as good as tuning all the hyperparameters. Hence, we recommend picking any of the best-behaved adaptive optimizers (e.g., Adam) and tuning only its learning rate. When no hyperparameter can be tuned, SGD with Momentum is the best choice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06948v1,2024-02
LiFi: Lightweight Controlled Text Generation with Fine-Grained Control Codes,"Chufan Shi, Deng Cai, Yujiu Yang","In the rapidly evolving field of text generation, the demand for more precise control mechanisms has become increasingly apparent. To address this need, we present a novel methodology, LIFI, which offers a lightweight approach with fine-grained control for controlled text generation. Unlike previous studies that train pre-trained language models to follow discrete, categorical, and exclusive control codes, LIFI learns controlled text generation under the guidance of continuous, relative, and nonexclusive control codes. These fine-grained codes are automatically derived from an attribute classifier, initially trained with a small amount of labeled data and subsequently employed to label abundant unlabeled data, thus garnering more extensive supervision signals. Moreover, to achieve efficient control, we incorporate the fine-grained control codes with adapters, a parameter- and compute-efficient way to steer a pre-trained language model. We evaluate LIFI on two conventional tasks -- sentiment control and topic control -- and one newly proposed task -- stylistic novel writing. Comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, demonstrating substantial performance improvements over existing baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06930v1,2024-02
A Thorough Examination of Decoding Methods in the Era of LLMs,"Chufan Shi, Haoran Yang, Deng Cai, Zhisong Zhang, Yifan Wang, Yujiu Yang, Wai Lam","Decoding methods play an indispensable role in converting language models from next-token predictors into practical task solvers. Prior research on decoding methods, primarily focusing on task-specific models, may not extend to the current era of general-purpose large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the recent influx of decoding strategies has further complicated this landscape. This paper provides a comprehensive and multifaceted analysis of various decoding methods within the context of LLMs, evaluating their performance, robustness to hyperparameter changes, and decoding speeds across a wide range of tasks, models, and deployment environments. Our findings reveal that decoding method performance is notably task-dependent and influenced by factors such as alignment, model size, and quantization. Intriguingly, sensitivity analysis exposes that certain methods achieve superior performance at the cost of extensive hyperparameter tuning, highlighting the trade-off between attaining optimal results and the practicality of implementation in varying contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06925v3,2024-02
Generating Chain-of-Thoughts with a Pairwise-Comparison Approach to Searching for the Most Promising Intermediate Thought,"Zhen-Yu Zhang, Siwei Han, Huaxiu Yao, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama","To improve the ability of the large language model (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning problems, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) methods were proposed to guide LLMs to reason step-by-step, enabling problem solving from simple to complex. State-of-the-art methods for generating such a chain involve interactive collaboration, where the learner generates candidate intermediate thoughts, evaluated by the LLM, guiding the generation of subsequent thoughts. However, a widespread yet understudied problem is that the evaluation from the LLM is typically noisy and unreliable, potentially misleading the generation process in selecting promising intermediate thoughts. In this paper, motivated by Vapnik's principle, we use pairwise-comparison evaluation instead of point-wise scoring to search for promising intermediate thoughts with the noisy feedback from the LLM. In each round, we randomly pair intermediate thoughts and directly prompt the LLM to select the more promising one from each pair, allowing us to identify the most promising thoughts through an iterative process. To further alleviate the noise in the comparison, we incorporate techniques from ensemble learning and dueling bandits, proposing two variants of the algorithm. Experiments on three real-world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and verify the rationale of the pairwise comparison mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06918v2,2024-02

Investigating Consistency in Query-Based Meeting Summarization: A Comparative Study of Different Embedding Methods,"Chen Jia-Chen, Guillem Senabre, Allane Caron","With more and more advanced data analysis techniques emerging, people will expect these techniques to be applied in more complex tasks and solve problems in our daily lives. Text Summarization is one of famous applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. It aims to automatically generate summary with important information based on a given context, which is important when you have to deal with piles of documents. Summarization techniques can help capture key points in a short time and bring convenience in works. One of applicable situation is meeting summarization, especially for important meeting that tend to be long, complicated, multi-topic and multi-person. Therefore, when people want to review specific content from a meeting, it will be hard and time-consuming to find the related spans in the meeting transcript. However, most of previous works focus on doing summarization for newsletters, scientific articles...etc, which have a clear document structure and an official format. For the documents with complex structure like transcripts, we think those works are not quite suitable for meeting summarization. Besides, the consistency of summary is another issue common to be discussed in NLP field. To conquer challenges of meeting summarization, we are inspired by ""QMSum: A New Benchmark for Query-based Multi-domain Meeting Summarization"" proposed by Microsoft and we also propose our Locater model designed to extract relevant spans based on given transcript and query, which are then summarized by Summarizer model. Furthermore, we perform a comparative study by applying different word embedding techniques to improve summary consistency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06907v1,2024-02
Understanding the Progression of Educational Topics via Semantic Matching,"Tamador Alkhidir, Edmond Awad, Aamena Alshamsi","Education systems are dynamically changing to accommodate technological advances, industrial and societal needs, and to enhance students' learning journeys. Curriculum specialists and educators constantly revise taught subjects across educational grades to identify gaps, introduce new learning topics, and enhance the learning outcomes. This process is usually done within the same subjects (e.g. math) or across related subjects (e.g. math and physics) considering the same and different educational levels, leading to massive multi-layer comparisons. Having nuanced data about subjects, topics, and learning outcomes structured within a dataset, empowers us to leverage data science to better understand the progression of various learning topics. In this paper, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) topic modeling was used to extract topics from the curriculum, which were then used to identify relationships between subjects, track their progression, and identify conceptual gaps. We found that grouping learning outcomes by common topics helped specialists reduce redundancy and introduce new concepts in the curriculum. We built a dashboard to avail the methodology to curriculum specials. Finally, we tested the validity of the approach with subject matter experts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05553v1,2024-02
Can LLMs Recognize Toxicity? A Structured Investigation Framework and Toxicity Metric,"Hyukhun Koh, Dohyung Kim, Minwoo Lee, Kyomin Jung","In the pursuit of developing Large Language Models (LLMs) that adhere to societal standards, it is imperative to detect the toxicity in the generated text. The majority of existing toxicity metrics rely on encoder models trained on specific toxicity datasets, which are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) problems and depend on the dataset's definition of toxicity. In this paper, we introduce a robust metric grounded on LLMs to flexibly measure toxicity according to the given definition. We first analyze the toxicity factors, followed by an examination of the intrinsic toxic attributes of LLMs to ascertain their suitability as evaluators. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our metric with detailed analysis. Our empirical results demonstrate outstanding performance in measuring toxicity within verified factors, improving on conventional metrics by 12 points in the F1 score. Our findings also indicate that upstream toxicity significantly influences downstream metrics, suggesting that LLMs are unsuitable for toxicity evaluations within unverified factors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06900v5,2024-02
GenTranslate: Large Language Models are Generative Multilingual Speech and Machine Translators,"Yuchen Hu, Chen Chen, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Ruizhe Li, Dong Zhang, Zhehuai Chen, Eng Siong Chng","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have stepped forward the development of multilingual speech and machine translation by its reduced representation errors and incorporated external knowledge. However, both translation tasks typically utilize beam search decoding and top-1 hypothesis selection for inference. These techniques struggle to fully exploit the rich information in the diverse N-best hypotheses, making them less optimal for translation tasks that require a single, high-quality output sequence. In this paper, we propose a new generative paradigm for translation tasks, namely ""GenTranslate"", which builds upon LLMs to generate better results from the diverse translation versions in N-best list. Leveraging the rich linguistic knowledge and strong reasoning abilities of LLMs, our new paradigm can integrate the rich information in N-best candidates to generate a higher-quality translation result. Furthermore, to support LLM finetuning, we build and release a HypoTranslate dataset that contains over 592K hypotheses-translation pairs in 11 languages. Experiments on various speech and machine translation benchmarks (e.g., FLEURS, CoVoST-2, WMT) demonstrate that our GenTranslate significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06894v2,2024-02

"History, Development, and Principles of Large Language Models-An Introductory Survey","Zichong Wang, Zhibo Chu, Thang Viet Doan, Shiwen Ni, Min Yang, Wenbin Zhang","Language models serve as a cornerstone in natural language processing (NLP), utilizing mathematical methods to generalize language laws and knowledge for prediction and generation. Over extensive research spanning decades, language modeling has progressed from initial statistical language models (SLMs) to the contemporary landscape of large language models (LLMs). Notably, the swift evolution of LLMs has reached the ability to process, understand, and generate human-level text. Nevertheless, despite the significant advantages that LLMs offer in improving both work and personal lives, the limited understanding among general practitioners about the background and principles of these models hampers their full potential. Notably, most LLM reviews focus on specific aspects and utilize specialized language, posing a challenge for practitioners lacking relevant background knowledge. In light of this, this survey aims to present a comprehensible overview of LLMs to assist a broader audience. It strives to facilitate a comprehensive understanding by exploring the historical background of language models and tracing their evolution over time.

However, the community lacks an LLM specifically designed for chemistry. The main challenges are two-fold: firstly, most chemical data and scientific knowledge are stored in structured databases, which limits the model's ability to sustain coherent dialogue when used directly. Secondly, there is an absence of objective and fair benchmark that encompass most chemistry tasks. Here, we introduce ChemLLM, a comprehensive framework that features the first LLM dedicated to chemistry. It also includes ChemData, a dataset specifically designed for instruction tuning, and ChemBench, a robust benchmark covering nine essential chemistry tasks.

Forecasting Events in Soccer Matches Through Language,"Tiago Mendes-Neves, Luís Meireles, João Mendes-Moreira","This paper introduces an approach to predicting the next event in a soccer match, a challenge bearing remarkable similarities to the problem faced by Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike other methods that severely limit event dynamics in soccer, often abstracting from many variables or relying on a mix of sequential models, our research proposes a novel technique inspired by the methodologies used in LLMs. These models predict a complete chain of variables that compose an event, significantly simplifying the construction of Large Event Models (LEMs) for soccer. Utilizing deep learning on the publicly available WyScout dataset, the proposed approach notably surpasses the performance of previous LEM proposals in critical areas, such as the prediction accuracy of the next event type. This paper highlights the utility of LEMs in various applications, including match prediction and analytics. Moreover, we show that LEMs provide a simulation backbone for users to build many analytics pipelines, an approach opposite to the current specialized single-purpose models.

The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts,"Rick Battle, Teja Gollapudi","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving and basic mathematics abilities. However, their efficacy is highly contingent on the formulation of the prompt. This study endeavors to quantify the influence of incorporating ""positive thinking"" into the system message of the prompt, then compare that to systematic prompt optimization. We assess the performance of 60 combinations of system message snippets, tested with and without Chain of Thought prompting, across three models with parameters ranging from 7 to 70 billion on the GSM8K dataset. Our findings reveal that results do not universally generalize across models. In most instances, the inclusion of ""positive thinking"" prompts positively affected model performance. Notably, however, Llama2-70B exhibited an exception when not utilizing Chain of Thought, as the optimal system message was found to be none at all. Given the combinatorial complexity, and thus computation time, of experimenting with hand-tuning prompts for large black-box models, we then compared the performance of the best ""positive thinking"" prompt against the output of systematic prompt optimization. We show that employing an automated prompt optimizer emerges as the most effective method for enhancing performance, even when working with smaller open-source models. Additionally, our findings reveal that the highest-scoring, automatically-optimized prompt exhibits a degree of peculiarity far beyond expectations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10949v2,2024-02
Detection of Opioid Users from Reddit Posts via an Attention-based Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network,"Yuchen Wang, Zhengyu Fang, Wei Du, Shuai Xu, Rong Xu, Jing Li","The opioid epidemic, referring to the growing hospitalizations and deaths because of overdose of opioid usage and addiction, has become a severe health problem in the United States. Many strategies have been developed by the federal and local governments and health communities to combat this crisis. Among them, improving our understanding of the epidemic through better health surveillance is one of the top priorities. In addition to direct testing, machine learning approaches may also allow us to detect opioid users by analyzing data from social media because many opioid users may choose not to do the tests but may share their experiences on social media anonymously. In this paper, we take advantage of recent advances in machine learning, collect and analyze user posts from a popular social network Reddit with the goal to identify opioid users. Posts from more than 1,000 users who have posted on three sub-reddits over a period of one month have been collected. In addition to the ones that contain keywords such as opioid, opiate, or heroin, we have also collected posts that contain slang words of opioid such as black or chocolate. We apply an attention-based bidirectional long short memory model to identify opioid users. Experimental results show that the approaches significantly outperform competitive algorithms in terms of F1-score. Furthermore, the model allows us to extract most informative words, such as opiate, opioid, and black, from posts via the attention layer, which provides more insights on how the machine learning algorithm works in distinguishing drug users from non-drug users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15393v1,2024-02
Debating with More Persuasive LLMs Leads to More Truthful Answers,"Akbir Khan, John Hughes, Dan Valentine, Laura Ruis, Kshitij Sachan, Ansh Radhakrishnan, Edward Grefenstette, Samuel R. Bowman, Tim Rocktäschel, Ethan Perez","Common methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with desired behaviour heavily rely on human-labelled data. However, as models grow increasingly sophisticated, they will surpass human expertise, and the role of human evaluation will evolve into non-experts overseeing experts. In anticipation of this, we ask: can weaker models assess the correctness of stronger models? We investigate this question in an analogous setting, where stronger models (experts) possess the necessary information to answer questions and weaker models (non-experts) lack this information. The method we evaluate is debate, where two LLM experts each argue for a different answer, and a non-expert selects the answer. We find that debate consistently helps both non-expert models and humans answer questions, achieving 76% and 88% accuracy respectively (naive baselines obtain 48% and 60%). Furthermore, optimising expert debaters for persuasiveness in an unsupervised manner improves non-expert ability to identify the truth in debates. Our results provide encouraging empirical evidence for the viability of aligning models with debate in the absence of ground truth.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06782v4,2024-02
Evaluation Metrics for Text Data Augmentation in NLP,"Marcellus Amadeus, William Alberto Cruz Castañeda","Recent surveys on data augmentation for natural language processing have reported different techniques and advancements in the field. Several frameworks, tools, and repositories promote the implementation of text data augmentation pipelines.

Also, a lack of methods unification exists and text data augmentation research would benefit from unified metrics to compare different augmentation methods. Thus, academics and the industry endeavor relevant evaluation metrics for text data augmentation techniques. The contribution of this work is to provide a taxonomy of evaluation metrics for text augmentation methods and serve as a direction for a unified benchmark. The proposed taxonomy organizes categories that include tools for implementation and metrics calculation.

EntGPT: Linking Generative Large Language Models with Knowledge Bases,"Yifan Ding, Amrit Poudel, Qingkai Zeng, Tim Weninger, Balaji Veeramani, Sanmitra Bhattacharya","Entity Linking in natural language processing seeks to match text entities to their corresponding entries in a dictionary or knowledge base. Traditional approaches rely on contextual models, which can be complex, hard to train, and have limited transferability across different domains. Generative large language models like GPT offer a promising alternative but often underperform with naive prompts. In this study, we introduce EntGPT, employing advanced prompt engineering to enhance EL tasks. Our three-step hard-prompting method (EntGPT-P) significantly boosts the micro-F_1 score by up to 36% over vanilla prompts, achieving competitive performance across 10 datasets without supervised fine-tuning.

NICE: To Optimize In-Context Examples or Not?,"Pragya Srivastava, Satvik Golechha, Amit Deshpande, Amit Sharma","Recent work shows that in-context learning and optimization of in-context examples (ICE) can significantly improve the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on a wide range of tasks, leading to an apparent consensus that ICE optimization is crucial for better performance. However, most of these studies assume a fixed or no instruction provided in the prompt. We challenge this consensus by investigating the necessity of optimizing ICE when task-specific instructions are provided and find that there are many tasks for which it yields diminishing returns. In particular, using a diverse set of tasks and a systematically created instruction set with gradually added details, we find that as the prompt instruction becomes more detailed, the returns on ICE optimization diminish. To characterize this behavior, we introduce a task-specific metric called Normalized Invariability to Choice of Examples (NICE) that quantifies the learnability of tasks from a given instruction, and provides a heuristic to help decide whether to optimize instructions or ICE for a new task. Given a task, the proposed metric can reliably predict the utility of optimizing ICE compared to using random ICE.

Feedback Loops With Language Models Drive In-Context Reward Hacking,"Alexander Pan, Erik Jones, Meena Jagadeesan, Jacob Steinhardt","Language models influence the external world: they query APIs that read and write to web pages, generate content that shapes human behavior, and run system commands as autonomous agents. These interactions form feedback loops: LLM outputs affect the world, which in turn affect subsequent LLM outputs. In this work, we show that feedback loops can cause in-context reward hacking (ICRH), where the LLM at test-time optimizes a (potentially implicit) objective but creates negative side effects in the process. For example, consider an LLM agent deployed to increase Twitter engagement; the LLM may retrieve its previous tweets into the context window and make them more controversial, increasing engagement but also toxicity. We identify and study two processes that lead to ICRH: output-refinement and policy-refinement. For these processes, evaluations on static datasets are insufficient -- they miss the feedback effects and thus cannot capture the most harmful behavior. In response, we provide three recommendations for evaluation to capture more instances of ICRH. As AI development accelerates, the effects of feedback loops will proliferate, increasing the need to understand their role in shaping LLM behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06627v3,2024-02

Our extensive experiments delve into the intricacies of iterative prompting variants, examining their influence on the accuracy and calibration of model responses. Our findings reveal that naive prompting methods significantly undermine truthfulness, leading to exacerbated calibration errors. In response to these challenges, we introduce several prompting variants designed to address the identified issues. These variants demonstrate marked improvements over existing baselines, signaling a promising direction for future research.

We leverage the strengths of both the techniques by using an LLM for generating the PDDL representation (task PDDL) of planning task requests followed by using a classical planner for computing a plan. Unlike previous approaches that use LLMs for generating task PDDLs directly, our approach comprises of (a) translate: using an LLM only for generating a logically interpretable intermediate representation of natural language task description, (b) infer: deriving additional logically dependent information from the intermediate representation using a logic reasoner (currently, Answer Set Programming solver), and (c) compile: generating the target task PDDL from the base and inferred information. We observe that using an LLM to only output the intermediate representation significantly reduces LLM errors. Consequently, TIC approach achieves, for at least one LLM, high accuracy on task PDDL generation for all seven domains of our evaluation dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06608v2,2024-02
Self-consistent context aware conformer transducer for speech recognition,"Konstantin Kolokolov, Pavel Pekichev, Karthik Raghunathan","We introduce a novel neural network module that adeptly handles recursive data flow in neural network architectures. At its core, this module employs a self-consistent approach where a set of recursive equations is solved iteratively, halting when the difference between two consecutive iterations falls below a defined threshold. Leveraging this mechanism, we construct a new neural network architecture, an extension of the conformer transducer, which enriches automatic speech recognition systems with a stream of contextual information. Our method notably improves the accuracy of recognizing rare words without adversely affecting the word error rate for common vocabulary. We investigate the improvement in accuracy for these uncommon words using our novel model, both independently and in conjunction with shallow fusion with a context language model. Our findings reveal that the combination of both approaches can improve the accuracy of detecting rare words by as much as 4.5 times. Our proposed self-consistent recursive methodology is versatile and adaptable, compatible with many recently developed encoders, and has the potential to drive model improvements in speech recognition and beyond.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06592v2,2024-02
G-SciEdBERT: A Contextualized LLM for Science Assessment Tasks in German,"Ehsan Latif, Gyeong-Geon Lee, Knut Neumann, Tamara Kastorff, Xiaoming Zhai","The advancement of natural language processing has paved the way for automated scoring systems in various languages, such as German (e.g., German BERT [G-BERT]). Automatically scoring written responses to science questions in German is a complex task and challenging for standard G-BERT as they lack contextual knowledge in the science domain and may be unaligned with student writing styles. This paper presents a contextualized German Science Education BERT (G-SciEdBERT), an innovative large language model tailored for scoring German-written responses to science tasks and beyond. Using G-BERT, we pre-trained G-SciEdBERT on a corpus of 30K German written science responses with 3M tokens on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018. We fine-tuned G-SciEdBERT on an additional 20K student-written responses with 2M tokens and examined the scoring accuracy. We then compared its scoring performance with G-BERT. Our findings revealed a substantial improvement in scoring accuracy with G-SciEdBERT, demonstrating a 10.2% increase of quadratic weighted Kappa compared to G-BERT (mean difference = 0.1026, SD = 0.069). These insights underline the significance of specialized language models like G-SciEdBERT, which is trained to enhance the accuracy of contextualized automated scoring, offering a substantial contribution to the field of AI in education.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06584v2,2024-02
What is Hiding in Medicine's Dark Matter? Learning with Missing Data in Medical Practices,"Neslihan Suzen, Evgeny M. Mirkes, Damian Roland, Jeremy Levesley, Alexander N. Gorban, Tim J. Coats","Electronic patient records (EPRs) produce a wealth of data but contain significant missing information. Understanding and handling this missing data is an important part of clinical data analysis and if left unaddressed could result in bias in analysis and distortion in critical conclusions. Missing data may be linked to health care professional practice patterns and imputation of missing data can increase the validity of clinical decisions. This study focuses on statistical approaches for understanding and interpreting the missing data and machine learning based clinical data imputation using a single centre's paediatric emergency data and the data from UK's largest clinical audit for traumatic injury database (TARN). In the study of 56,961 data points related to initial vital signs and observations taken on children presenting to an Emergency Department, we have shown that missing data are likely to be non-random and how these are linked to health care professional practice patterns. We have then examined 79 TARN fields with missing values for 5,791 trauma cases. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) based missing data imputation methods are used and imputation results against the original dataset are compared and statistically tested. We have concluded that the 1NN imputer is the best imputation which indicates a usual pattern of clinical decision making: find the most similar patients and take their attributes as imputation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06563v1,2024-02
Quantitative Analysis of AI-Generated Texts in Academic Research: A Study of AI Presence in Arxiv Submissions using AI Detection Tool,Arslan Akram,"Many people are interested in ChatGPT since it has become a prominent AIGC model that provides high-quality responses in various contexts, such as software development and maintenance. Misuse of ChatGPT might cause significant issues, particularly in public safety and education, despite its immense potential. The majority of researchers choose to publish their work on Arxiv. The effectiveness and originality of future work depend on the ability to detect AI components in such contributions. To address this need, this study will analyze a method that can see purposely manufactured content that academic organizations use to post on Arxiv.

Diffusion-ES: Gradient-free Planning with Diffusion for Autonomous Driving and Zero-Shot Instruction Following,"Brian Yang, Huangyuan Su, Nikolaos Gkanatsios, Tsung-Wei Ke, Ayush Jain, Jeff Schneider, Katerina Fragkiadaki","Diffusion models excel at modeling complex and multimodal trajectory distributions for decision-making and control. Reward-gradient guided denoising has been recently proposed to generate trajectories that maximize both a differentiable reward function and the likelihood under the data distribution captured by a diffusion model. Reward-gradient guided denoising requires a differentiable reward function fitted to both clean and noised samples, limiting its applicability as a general trajectory optimizer. In this paper, we propose DiffusionES, a method that combines gradient-free optimization with trajectory denoising to optimize black-box non-differentiable objectives while staying in the data manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during evolutionary search from a diffusion model and scores them using a black-box reward function. It mutates high-scoring trajectories using a truncated diffusion process that applies a small number of noising and denoising steps, allowing for much more efficient exploration of the solution space. We show that DiffusionES achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan, an established closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous driving. Diffusion-ES outperforms existing sampling-based planners, reactive deterministic or diffusion-based policies, and reward-gradient guidance. Additionally, we show that unlike prior guidance methods, our method can optimize non-differentiable language-shaped reward functions generated by few-shot LLM prompting. When guided by a human teacher that issues instructions to follow, our method can generate novel, highly complex behaviors, such as aggressive lane weaving, which are not present in the training data. This allows us to solve the hardest nuPlan scenarios which are beyond the capabilities of existing trajectory optimization methods and driving policies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06559v2,2024-02
"Bryndza at ClimateActivism 2024: Stance, Target and Hate Event Detection via Retrieval-Augmented GPT-4 and LLaMA","Marek Šuppa, Daniel Skala, Daniela Jašš, Samuel Sučík, Andrej Švec, Peter Hraška","This study details our approach for the CASE 2024 Shared Task on Climate Activism Stance and Hate Event Detection, focusing on Hate Speech Detection, Hate Speech Target Identification, and Stance Detection as classification challenges. We explored the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, in zero- or few-shot settings enhanced by retrieval augmentation and re-ranking for Tweet classification. Our goal was to determine if LLMs could match or surpass traditional methods in this context.   We conducted an ablation study with LLaMA for comparison, and our results indicate that our models significantly outperformed the baselines, securing second place in the Target Detection task.

Calibrating Long-form Generations from Large Language Models,"Yukun Huang, Yixin Liu, Raghuveer Thirukovalluru, Arman Cohan, Bhuwan Dhingra","To enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability, calibration is essential -- the model's assessed confidence scores should align with the actual likelihood of its responses being correct. However, current confidence elicitation methods and calibration metrics typically rely on a binary true/false assessment of response correctness. This approach does not apply to long-form generation, where an answer can be partially correct. Addressing this gap, we introduce a unified calibration framework, in which both the correctness of the LLMs' responses and their associated confidence levels are treated as distributions across a range of scores. Within this framework, we develop three metrics to precisely evaluate LLM calibration and further propose two confidence elicitation methods based on self-consistency and self-evaluation. Our experiments, which include long-form QA and summarization tasks, demonstrate that larger models don't necessarily guarantee better calibration, that calibration performance is found to be metric-dependent, and that self-consistency methods excel in factoid datasets. We also find that calibration can be enhanced through techniques such as fine-tuning, integrating relevant source documents, scaling the temperature, and combining self-consistency with self-evaluation. Lastly, we showcase a practical application of our system: selecting and cascading open-source models and ChatGPT to optimize correctness given a limited API budget. This research not only challenges existing notions of LLM calibration but also offers practical methodologies for improving trustworthiness in long-form generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06544v2,2024-02
A Multi-faceted Semi-Synthetic Dataset for Automated Cyberbullying Detection,"Naveed Ejaz, Fakhra Kashif, Salimur Choudhury","In recent years, the rising use of social media has propelled automated cyberbullying detection into a prominent research domain. However, challenges persist due to the absence of a standardized definition and universally accepted datasets. Many researchers now view cyberbullying as a facet of cyberaggression, encompassing factors like repetition, peer relationships, and harmful intent in addition to online aggression. Acquiring comprehensive data reflective of all cyberbullying components from social media networks proves to be a complex task. This paper provides a description of an extensive semi-synthetic cyberbullying dataset that incorporates all of the essential aspects of cyberbullying, including aggression, repetition, peer relationships, and intent to harm. The method of creating the dataset is succinctly outlined, and a detailed overview of the publicly accessible dataset is additionally presented. This accompanying data article provides an in-depth look at the dataset, increasing transparency and enabling replication.

Introspective Planning: Aligning Robots' Uncertainty with Inherent Task Ambiguity,"Kaiqu Liang, Zixu Zhang, Jaime Fernández Fisac","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning skills, enabling robots to comprehend natural language instructions and strategically plan high-level actions through proper grounding. However, LLM hallucination may result in robots confidently executing plans that are misaligned with user goals or, in extreme cases, unsafe. Additionally, inherent ambiguity in natural language instructions can induce task uncertainty, particularly in situations where multiple valid options exist. To address this issue, LLMs must identify such uncertainty and proactively seek clarification. This paper explores the concept of introspective planning as a systematic method for guiding LLMs in forming uncertainty--aware plans for robotic task execution without the need for fine-tuning. We investigate uncertainty quantification in task-level robot planning and demonstrate that introspection significantly improves both success rates and safety compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planning approaches. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of introspective planning in conjunction with conformal prediction, revealing that this combination yields tighter confidence bounds, thereby maintaining statistical success guarantees with fewer superfluous user clarification queries.

Multimodal Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction with Large Language Models,"Wenhao Zheng, Dongsheng Peng, Hongxia Xu, Yun Li, Hongtu Zhu, Tianfan Fu, Huaxiu Yao","The clinical trial is a pivotal and costly process, often spanning multiple years and requiring substantial financial resources. Therefore, the development of clinical trial outcome prediction models aims to exclude drugs likely to fail and holds the potential for significant cost savings. Recent data-driven attempts leverage deep learning methods to integrate multimodal data for predicting clinical trial outcomes. However, these approaches rely on manually designed modal-specific encoders, which limits both the extensibility to adapt new modalities and the ability to discern similar information patterns across different modalities. To address these issues, we propose a multimodal mixture-of-experts (LIFTED) approach for clinical trial outcome prediction. Specifically, LIFTED unifies different modality data by transforming them into natural language descriptions. Then, LIFTED constructs unified noise-resilient encoders to extract information from modal-specific language descriptions. Subsequently, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework is employed to further refine the representations, enabling LIFTED to identify similar information patterns across different modalities and extract more consistent representations from those patterns using the same expert model. Finally, a mixture-of-experts module is further employed to dynamically integrate different modality representations for prediction, which gives LIFTED the ability to automatically weigh different modalities and pay more attention to critical information. The experiments demonstrate that LIFTED significantly enhances performance in predicting clinical trial outcomes across all three phases compared to the best baseline, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed key components.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06512v3,2024-02
Asking the Right Question at the Right Time: Human and Model Uncertainty Guidance to Ask Clarification Questions,"Alberto Testoni, Raquel Fernández","Clarification questions are an essential dialogue tool to signal misunderstanding, ambiguities, and under-specification in language use. While humans are able to resolve uncertainty by asking questions since childhood, modern dialogue systems struggle to generate effective questions. To make progress in this direction, in this work we take a collaborative dialogue task as a testbed and study how model uncertainty relates to human uncertainty -- an as yet under-explored problem. We show that model uncertainty does not mirror human clarification-seeking behavior, which suggests that using human clarification questions as supervision for deciding when to ask may not be the most effective way to resolve model uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose an approach to generating clarification questions based on model uncertainty estimation, compare it to several alternatives, and show that it leads to significant improvements in terms of task success. Our findings highlight the importance of equipping dialogue systems with the ability to assess their own uncertainty and exploit in interaction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06509v1,2024-02
Scalable Interactive Machine Learning for Future Command and Control,"Anna Madison, Ellen Novoseller, Vinicius G. Goecks, Benjamin T. Files, Nicholas Waytowich, Alfred Yu, Vernon J. Lawhern, Steven Thurman, Christopher Kelshaw, Kaleb McDowell","Future warfare will require Command and Control (C2) personnel to make decisions at shrinking timescales in complex and potentially ill-defined situations. Given the need for robust decision-making processes and decision-support tools, integration of artificial and human intelligence holds the potential to revolutionize the C2 operations process to ensure adaptability and efficiency in rapidly changing operational environments. We propose to leverage recent promising breakthroughs in interactive machine learning, in which humans can cooperate with machine learning algorithms to guide machine learning algorithm behavior. This paper identifies several gaps in state-of-the-art science and technology that future work should address to extend these approaches to function in complex C2 contexts. In particular, we describe three research focus areas that together, aim to enable scalable interactive machine learning (SIML): 1) developing human-AI interaction algorithms to enable planning in complex, dynamic situations; 2) fostering resilient human-AI teams through optimizing roles, configurations, and trust; and 3) scaling algorithms and human-AI teams for flexibility across a range of potential contexts and situations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06501v2,2024-02
Re-Envisioning Command and Control,"Kaleb McDowell, Ellen Novoseller, Anna Madison, Vinicius G. Goecks, Christopher Kelshaw","Future warfare will require Command and Control (C2) decision-making to occur in more complex, fast-paced, ill-structured, and demanding conditions. C2 will be further complicated by operational challenges such as Denied, Degraded, Intermittent, and Limited (DDIL) communications and the need to account for many data streams, potentially across multiple domains of operation. Yet, current C2 practices -- which stem from the industrial era rather than the emerging intelligence era -- are linear and time-consuming. Critically, these approaches may fail to maintain overmatch against adversaries on the future battlefield. To address these challenges, we propose a vision for future C2 based on robust partnerships between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This future vision is encapsulated in three operational impacts: streamlining the C2 operations process, maintaining unity of effort, and developing adaptive collective knowledge systems. This paper illustrates the envisaged future C2 capabilities, discusses the assumptions that shaped them, and describes how the proposed developments could transform C2 in future warfare.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07946v2,2024-02
Inducing Systematicity in Transformers by Attending to Structurally Quantized Embeddings,"Yichen Jiang, Xiang Zhou, Mohit Bansal","Transformers generalize to novel compositions of structures and entities after being trained on a complex dataset, but easily overfit on datasets of insufficient complexity. We observe that when the training set is sufficiently complex, the model encodes sentences that have a common syntactic structure using a systematic attention pattern. Inspired by this observation, we propose SQ-Transformer (Structurally Quantized) that explicitly encourages systematicity in the embeddings and attention layers, even with a training set of low complexity. At the embedding level, we introduce Structure-oriented Vector Quantization (SoVQ) to cluster word embeddings into several classes of structurally equivalent entities. At the attention level, we devise the Systematic Attention Layer (SAL) and an alternative, Systematically Regularized Layer (SRL) that operate on the quantized word embeddings so that sentences of the same structure are encoded with invariant or similar attention patterns. Empirically, we show that SQ-Transformer achieves stronger compositional generalization than the vanilla Transformer on multiple low-complexity semantic parsing and machine translation datasets. In our analysis, we show that SoVQ indeed learns a syntactically clustered embedding space and SAL/SRL induces generalizable attention patterns, which lead to improved systematicity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06492v1,2024-02
V-STaR: Training Verifiers for Self-Taught Reasoners,"Arian Hosseini, Xingdi Yuan, Nikolay Malkin, Aaron Courville, Alessandro Sordoni, Rishabh Agarwal","Common self-improvement approaches for large language models (LLMs), such as STaR, iteratively fine-tune LLMs on self-generated solutions to improve their problem-solving ability. However, these approaches discard the large amounts of incorrect solutions generated during this process, potentially neglecting valuable information in such solutions. To address this shortcoming, we propose V-STaR that utilizes both the correct and incorrect solutions generated during the self-improvement process to train a verifier using DPO that judges correctness of model-generated solutions. This verifier is used at inference time to select one solution among many candidate solutions. Running V-STaR for multiple iterations results in progressively better reasoners and verifiers, delivering a 4% to 17% test accuracy improvement over existing self-improvement and verification approaches on common code generation and math reasoning benchmarks with LLaMA2 models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06457v2,2024-02

While significant progress has been made in this field, it has not yet reached a level of reasoning comparable to human reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose a multi-task explainable neural model for misinformation detection. Specifically, this work formulates an explanation generation process of the model's veracity prediction as a text summarization problem. Additionally, the performance of the proposed model is discussed on publicly available datasets and the findings are evaluated with related studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06443v1,2024-02
Findings of the First Workshop on Simulating Conversational Intelligence in Chat,"Yvette Graham, Mohammed Rameez Qureshi, Haider Khalid, Gerasimos Lampouras, Ignacio Iacobacci, Qun Liu","The aim of the workshop was to bring together experts working on open-domain dialogue research. In this speedily advancing research area many challenges still exist, such as learning information from conversations, and engaging in a realistic and convincing simulation of human intelligence and reasoning. SCI-CHAT follows previous workshops on open domain dialogue but in contrast the focus of the shared task is simulation of intelligent conversation as judged in a live human evaluation. Models aim to include the ability to follow a challenging topic over a multi-turn conversation, while positing, refuting and reasoning over arguments.

CoSearchAgent: A Lightweight Collaborative Search Agent with Large Language Models,"Peiyuan Gong, Jiamian Li, Jiaxin Mao","Collaborative search supports multiple users working together to accomplish a specific search task. Research has found that designing lightweight collaborative search plugins within instant messaging platforms aligns better with users' collaborative habits. However, due to the complexity of multi-user interaction scenarios, it is challenging to implement a fully functioning lightweight collaborative search system. Therefore, previous studies on lightweight collaborative search had to rely on the Wizard of Oz paradigm. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to interact naturally with users and achieve complex information-seeking tasks through LLM-based agents. Hence, to better support the research in collaborative search, in this demo, we propose CoSearchAgent, a lightweight collaborative search agent powered by LLMs. CoSearchAgent is designed as a Slack plugin that can support collaborative search during multi-party conversations on this platform. Equipped with the capacity to understand the queries and context in multi-user conversations and the ability to search the Web for relevant information via APIs, CoSearchAgent can respond to user queries with answers grounded on the relevant search results. It can also ask clarifying questions when the information needs are unclear. The proposed CoSearchAgent is highly flexible and would be useful for supporting further research on collaborative search.

Promoting Target Data in Context-aware Neural Machine Translation,"Harritxu Gete, Thierry Etchegoyhen","Standard context-aware neural machine translation (NMT) typically relies on parallel document-level data, exploiting both source and target contexts. Concatenation-based approaches in particular, still a strong baseline for document-level NMT, prepend source and/or target context sentences to the sentences to be translated, with model variants that exploit equal amounts of source and target data on each side achieving state-of-the-art results. In this work, we investigate whether target data should be further promoted within standard concatenation-based approaches, as most document-level phenomena rely on information that is present on the target language side. We evaluate novel concatenation-based variants where the target context is prepended to the source language, either in isolation or in combination with the source context. Experimental results in English-Russian and Basque-Spanish show that including target context in the source leads to large improvements on target language phenomena. On source-dependent phenomena, using only target language context in the source achieves parity with state-of-the-art concatenation approaches, or slightly underperforms, whereas combining source and target context on the source side leads to significant gains across the board.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06342v1,2024-02
RareBench: Can LLMs Serve as Rare Diseases Specialists?,"Xuanzhong Chen, Xiaohao Mao, Qihan Guo, Lun Wang, Shuyang Zhang, Ting Chen","Generalist Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown considerable promise in various domains, including medical diagnosis. Rare diseases, affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide, often have unsatisfactory clinical diagnosis rates primarily due to a lack of experienced physicians and the complexity of differentiating among many rare diseases. In this context, recent news such as ""ChatGPT correctly diagnosed a 4-year-old's rare disease after 17 doctors failed"" underscore LLMs' potential, yet underexplored, role in clinically diagnosing rare diseases. To bridge this research gap, we introduce RareBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of LLMs on 4 critical dimensions within the realm of rare diseases. Meanwhile, we have compiled the largest open-source dataset on rare disease patients, establishing a benchmark for future studies in this domain. To facilitate differential diagnosis of rare diseases, we develop a dynamic few-shot prompt methodology, leveraging a comprehensive rare disease knowledge graph synthesized from multiple knowledge bases, significantly enhancing LLMs' diagnostic performance. Moreover, we present an exhaustive comparative study of GPT-4's diagnostic capabilities against those of specialist physicians. Our experimental findings underscore the promising potential of integrating LLMs into the clinical diagnostic process for rare diseases.

ExaRanker-Open: Synthetic Explanation for IR using Open-Source LLMs,"Fernando Ferraretto, Thiago Laitz, Roberto Lotufo, Rodrigo Nogueira","ExaRanker recently introduced an approach to training information retrieval (IR) models, incorporating natural language explanations as additional labels. The method addresses the challenge of limited labeled examples, leading to improvements in the effectiveness of IR models.

In this paper, we introduce ExaRanker-Open, where we adapt and explore the use of open-source language models to generate explanations. The method has been tested using different LLMs and datasets sizes to better comprehend the effective contribution of data augmentation.

The components of the system are (1) an information retrieval system combining semantic and lexical search techniques over scientific papers (PubMed), (2) a fine-tuned generative model (Mistral 7B) taking top answers and generating answers with references to the papers from which the claim was derived, and (3) a verification engine that cross-checks the generated claim and the abstract or paper from which the claim was derived, verifying whether there may have been any hallucinations in generating the claim. We are reinforcing the generative model by providing the abstract in context, but in addition, an independent set of methods and models are verifying the answer and checking for hallucinations.

Zero-shot Explainable Mental Health Analysis on Social Media by Incorporating Mental Scales,"Wenyu Li, Yinuo Zhu, Xin Lin, Ming Li, Ziyue Jiang, Ziqian Zeng","Traditional discriminative approaches in mental health analysis are known for their strong capacity but lack interpretability and demand large-scale annotated data. The generative approaches, such as those based on large language models (LLMs), have the potential to get rid of heavy annotations and provide explanations but their capabilities still fall short compared to discriminative approaches, and their explanations may be unreliable due to the fact that the generation of explanation is a black-box process. Inspired by the psychological assessment practice of using scales to evaluate mental states, our method which is called Mental Analysis by Incorporating Mental Scales (MAIMS), incorporates two procedures via LLMs. First, the patient completes mental scales, and second, the psychologist interprets the collected information from the mental scales and makes informed decisions. Experimental results show that MAIMS outperforms other zero-shot methods. MAIMS can generate more rigorous explanation based on the outputs of mental scales",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10948v2,2024-02

On the Efficacy of Eviction Policy for Key-Value Constrained Generative Language Model Inference,"Siyu Ren, Kenny Q. Zhu","Despite the recent success associated with Large Language Models (LLMs), they are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy in resource-constrained environments due to their excessive memory and computational demands. In addition to model parameters, the key-value cache is also stored in GPU memory, growing linearly with batch size and sequence length. As a remedy, recent works have proposed various eviction policies for maintaining the overhead of key-value cache under a given budget. This paper embarks on the efficacy of existing eviction policies in terms of importance score calculation and eviction scope construction. We identify the deficiency of prior policies in these two aspects and introduce RoCo, a robust cache omission policy based on temporal attention scores and robustness measures. Extensive experimentation spanning prefilling and auto-regressive decoding stages validates the superiority of RoCo. Finally, we release EasyKV, a versatile software package dedicated to user-friendly key-value constrained generative inference.

Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning,"Yichuan Mo, Yuji Wang, Zeming Wei, Yisen Wang","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly focusing on model fine-tuning or heuristical defense designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through prompt optimization remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT) that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0%, while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task and incurring only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security.

ResumeFlow: An LLM-facilitated Pipeline for Personalized Resume Generation and Refinement,"Saurabh Bhausaheb Zinjad, Amrita Bhattacharjee, Amey Bhilegaonkar, Huan Liu","Crafting the ideal, job-specific resume is a challenging task for many job applicants, especially for early-career applicants. While it is highly recommended that applicants tailor their resume to the specific role they are applying for, manually tailoring resumes to job descriptions and role-specific requirements is often (1) extremely time-consuming, and (2) prone to human errors. Furthermore, performing such a tailoring step at scale while applying to several roles may result in a lack of quality of the edited resumes. To tackle this problem, in this demo paper, we propose ResumeFlow: a Large Language Model (LLM) aided tool that enables an end user to simply provide their detailed resume and the desired job posting, and obtain a personalized resume specifically tailored to that specific job posting in the matter of a few seconds. Our proposed pipeline leverages the language understanding and information extraction capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini, in order to (1) extract details from a job description, (2) extract role-specific details from the user-provided resume, and then (3) use these to refine and generate a role-specific resume for the user. Our easy-to-use tool leverages the user-chosen LLM in a completely off-the-shelf manner, thus requiring no fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool via a video demo and propose novel task-specific evaluation metrics to control for alignment and hallucination. Our tool is available at https://job-aligned-resume.streamlit.app.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06221v2,2024-02
A Unified Causal View of Instruction Tuning,"Lu Chen, Wei Huang, Ruqing Zhang, Wei Chen, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng","Instruction tuning on a mixture of tasks has improved zero-shot capabilities in natural language processing (NLP). Nevertheless, existing methods often learn features that exhibit correlations between instruction-formatted samples and target labels, rather than causal relationships. Termed as ``spurious correlation'' in statistics, such a correlation may change drastically in a new task, making the effect from the learned features to be misleading. To this end, we develop a meta Structural Causal Model (meta-SCM) to integrate different NLP tasks under a single causal structure of the data. Specifically, the meta-SCM introduces multiple latent factors that represent properties of source context, only some of which causally influence the target labels for a specific task. The key idea is to learn task-required causal factors and only use those to make predictions for a given task. Theoretically, we prove the causal factor can be identified without mixing information from others. Guided by the identifiability, we propose a Structural Instruction Tuning (SIT) method to learn the task-required causal representations that can mimic the causal factors for each task. The utility of our approach is verified by improvements of zero-shot ability on a range of unseen datasets and tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06220v1,2024-02
"The Generative AI Paradox on Evaluation: What It Can Solve, It May Not Evaluate","Juhyun Oh, Eunsu Kim, Inha Cha, Alice Oh","This paper explores the assumption that Large Language Models (LLMs) skilled in generation tasks are equally adept as evaluators. We assess the performance of three LLMs and one open-source LM in Question-Answering (QA) and evaluation tasks using the TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) dataset. Results indicate a significant disparity, with LLMs exhibiting lower performance in evaluation tasks compared to generation tasks. Intriguingly, we discover instances of unfaithful evaluation where models accurately evaluate answers in areas where they lack competence, underscoring the need to examine the faithfulness and trustworthiness of LLMs as evaluators. This study contributes to the understanding of ""the Generative AI Paradox"" (West et al., 2023), highlighting a need to explore the correlation between generative excellence and evaluation proficiency, and the necessity to scrutinize the faithfulness aspect in model evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06204v1,2024-02
Large Language Models: A Survey,"Shervin Minaee, Tomas Mikolov, Narjes Nikzad, Meysam Chenaghlu, Richard Socher, Xavier Amatriain, Jianfeng Gao","Large Language Models (LLMs) have drawn a lot of attention due to their strong performance on a wide range of natural language tasks, since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. LLMs' ability of general-purpose language understanding and generation is acquired by training billions of model's parameters on massive amounts of text data, as predicted by scaling laws \cite{kaplan2020scaling,hoffmann2022training}. The research area of LLMs, while very recent, is evolving rapidly in many different ways. In this paper, we review some of the most prominent LLMs, including three popular LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, PaLM), and discuss their characteristics, contributions and limitations. We also give an overview of techniques developed to build, and augment LLMs. We then survey popular datasets prepared for LLM training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, review widely used LLM evaluation metrics, and compare the performance of several popular LLMs on a set of representative benchmarks. Finally, we conclude the paper by discussing open challenges and future research directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06196v2,2024-02
CultureLLM: Incorporating Cultural Differences into Large Language Models,"Cheng Li, Mengzhou Chen, Jindong Wang, Sunayana Sitaram, Xing Xie","Large language models (LLMs) are reported to be partial to certain cultures owing to the training data dominance from the English corpora. Since multilingual cultural data are often expensive to collect, existing efforts handle this by prompt engineering or culture-specific pre-training. However, they might overlook the knowledge deficiency of low-resource culture and require extensive computing resources. In this paper, we propose CultureLLM, a cost-effective solution to incorporate cultural differences into LLMs. CultureLLM adopts World Value Survey (WVS) as seed data and generates semantically equivalent training data via the proposed semantic data augmentation. Using only 50 seed samples from WVS with augmented data, we fine-tune culture-specific LLMs and one unified model (CultureLLM-One) for 9 cultures covering rich and low-resource languages. Extensive experiments on 60 culture-related datasets demonstrate that CultureLLM significantly outperforms various counterparts such as GPT-3.5 (by 8.1%) and Gemini Pro (by 9.5%) with comparable performance to GPT-4 or even better. Our human study shows that the generated samples are semantically equivalent to the original samples, providing an effective solution for LLMs augmentation.

Model Editing with Canonical Examples,"John Hewitt, Sarah Chen, Lanruo Lora Xie, Edward Adams, Percy Liang, Christopher D. Manning","We introduce model editing with canonical examples, a setting in which (1) a single learning example is provided per desired behavior, (2) evaluation is performed exclusively out-of-distribution, and (3) deviation from an initial model is strictly limited. A canonical example is a simple instance of good behavior, e.g., The capital of Mauritius is Port Louis) or bad behavior, e.g., An aspect of researchers is coldhearted). The evaluation set contains more complex examples of each behavior (like a paragraph in which the capital of Mauritius is called for.) We create three datasets and modify three more for model editing with canonical examples, covering knowledge-intensive improvements, social bias mitigation, and syntactic edge cases. In our experiments on Pythia language models, we find that LoRA outperforms full finetuning and MEMIT. We then turn to the Backpack language model architecture because it is intended to enable targeted improvement. The Backpack defines a large bank of sense vectors--a decomposition of the different uses of each word--which are weighted and summed to form the output logits of the model. We propose sense finetuning, which selects and finetunes a few ($\approx$ 10) sense vectors for each canonical example, and find that it outperforms other finetuning methods, e.g., 4.8% improvement vs 0.3%. Finally, we improve GPT-J-6B by an inference-time ensemble with just the changes from sense finetuning of a 35x smaller Backpack, in one setting outperforming editing GPT-J itself (4.1% vs 1.0%).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06155v1,2024-02
Learn To be Efficient: Build Structured Sparsity in Large Language Models,"Haizhong Zheng, Xiaoyan Bai, Xueshen Liu, Z. Morley Mao, Beidi Chen, Fan Lai, Atul Prakash","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success with their billion-level parameters, yet they incur high inference overheads. The emergence of activation sparsity in LLMs provides a natural approach to reduce this cost by involving only parts of the parameters for inference. However, existing methods only focus on utilizing this naturally formed activation sparsity in a post-training setting, overlooking the potential for further amplifying this inherent sparsity. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can learn to be efficient by achieving more structured activation sparsity. To achieve this, we introduce a novel training algorithm, Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE), designed to train efficiency-aware LLMs to learn to activate fewer neurons and achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance. Furthermore, unlike SOTA MoEfication methods, which mainly focus on ReLU-based models, LTE can also be applied to LLMs like LLaMA using non-ReLU activations. Extensive evaluation on language understanding, language generation, and instruction tuning tasks show that LTE consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Along with our hardware-aware custom kernel implementation, LTE reduces LLaMA2-7B inference latency by 25% at 50% sparsity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06126v4,2024-02

Exploring Group and Symmetry Principles in Large Language Models,"Shima Imani, Hamid Palangi","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of applications; however, assessing their reasoning capabilities remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a framework grounded in group and symmetry principles, which have played a crucial role in fields such as physics and mathematics, and offer another way to evaluate their capabilities. While the proposed framework is general, to showcase the benefits of employing these properties, we focus on arithmetic reasoning and investigate the performance of these models on four group properties: closure, identity, inverse, and associativity. Our findings reveal that LLMs studied in this work struggle to preserve group properties across different test regimes. In the closure test, we observe biases towards specific outputs and an abrupt degradation in their performance from 100% to 0% after a specific sequence length. They also perform poorly in the identity test, which represents adding irrelevant information in the context, and show sensitivity when subjected to inverse test, which examines the robustness of the model with respect to negation. In addition, we demonstrate that breaking down problems into smaller steps helps LLMs in the associativity test that we have conducted. To support these tests we have developed a synthetic dataset which will be released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06120v3,2024-02
Rethinking Data Selection for Supervised Fine-Tuning,Ming Shen,"Although supervised finetuning (SFT) has emerged as an essential technique to align large language models with humans, it is considered superficial, with style learning being its nature. At the same time, recent works indicate the importance of data selection for SFT, showing that finetuning with high-quality and diverse subsets of the original dataset leads to superior downstream performance. In this work, we rethink the intuition behind data selection for SFT. Considering SFT is superficial, we propose that essential demonstrations for SFT should focus on reflecting human-like interactions instead of data quality or diversity. However, it is not straightforward to directly assess to what extent a demonstration reflects human styles. Towards an initial attempt in this direction, we find selecting instances with long responses is surprisingly more effective for SFT than utilizing full datasets or instances selected based on quality and diversity. We hypothesize that such a simple heuristic implicitly mimics a crucial aspect of human-style conversation: detailed responses are usually more helpful.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06094v1,2024-02
LightCAM: A Fast and Light Implementation of Context-Aware Masking based D-TDNN for Speaker Verification,"Di Cao, Xianchen Wang, Junfeng Zhou, Jiakai Zhang, Yanjing Lei, Wenpeng Chen","Traditional Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance at the cost of high computational complexity and slower inference speed, making them difficult to implement in an industrial environment. The Densely Connected Time Delay Neural Network (D-TDNN) with Context Aware Masking (CAM) module has proven to be an efficient structure to reduce complexity while maintaining system performance. In this paper, we propose a fast and lightweight model, LightCAM, which further adopts a depthwise separable convolution module (DSM) and uses multi-scale feature aggregation (MFA) for feature fusion at different levels. Extensive experiments are conducted on VoxCeleb dataset, the comparative results show that it has achieved an EER of 0.83 and MinDCF of 0.0891 in VoxCeleb1-O, which outperforms the other mainstream speaker verification methods.

Large Language Model Augmented Exercise Retrieval for Personalized Language Learning,"Austin Xu, Will Monroe, Klinton Bicknell","We study the problem of zero-shot exercise retrieval in the context of online language learning, to give learners the ability to explicitly request personalized exercises via natural language. Using real-world data collected from language learners, we observe that vector similarity approaches poorly capture the relationship between exercise content and the language that learners use to express what they want to learn. This semantic gap between queries and content dramatically reduces the effectiveness of general-purpose retrieval models pretrained on large scale information retrieval datasets like MS MARCO. We leverage the generative capabilities of large language models to bridge the gap by synthesizing hypothetical exercises based on the learner's input, which are then used to search for relevant exercises. Our approach, which we call mHyER, overcomes three challenges: (1) lack of relevance labels for training, (2) unrestricted learner input content, and (3) low semantic similarity between input and retrieval candidates. mHyER outperforms several strong baselines on two novel benchmarks created from crowdsourced data and publicly available data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16877v1,2024-02
OpenToM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Theory-of-Mind Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models,"Hainiu Xu, Runcong Zhao, Lixing Zhu, Jinhua Du, Yulan He","Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM), machine's ability to understand and keep track of the mental states of others, is pivotal in developing socially intelligent agents. However, prevalent N-ToM benchmarks have several shortcomings, including the presence of ambiguous and artificial narratives, absence of personality traits and preferences, a lack of questions addressing characters' psychological mental states, and limited diversity in the questions posed. In response to these issues, we construct OpenToM, a new benchmark for assessing N-ToM with (1) longer and clearer narrative stories, (2) characters with explicit personality traits, (3) actions that are triggered by character intentions, and (4) questions designed to challenge LLMs' capabilities of modeling characters' mental states of both the physical and psychological world. Using OpenToM, we reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs thrive at modeling certain aspects of mental states in the physical world but fall short when tracking characters' mental states in the psychological world.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06044v3,2024-02
A Prompt Response to the Demand for Automatic Gender-Neutral Translation,"Beatrice Savoldi, Andrea Piergentili, Dennis Fucci, Matteo Negri, Luisa Bentivogli","Gender-neutral translation (GNT) that avoids biased and undue binary assumptions is a pivotal challenge for the creation of more inclusive translation technologies. Advancements for this task in Machine Translation (MT), however, are hindered by the lack of dedicated parallel data, which are necessary to adapt MT systems to satisfy neutral constraints. For such a scenario, large language models offer hitherto unforeseen possibilities, as they come with the distinct advantage of being versatile in various (sub)tasks when provided with explicit instructions. In this paper, we explore this potential to automate GNT by comparing MT with the popular GPT-4 model. Through extensive manual analyses, our study empirically reveals the inherent limitations of current MT systems in generating GNTs and provides valuable insights into the potential and challenges associated with prompting for neutrality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06041v1,2024-02
Doing Experiments and Revising Rules with Natural Language and Probabilistic Reasoning,"Wasu Top Piriyakulkij, Cassidy Langenfeld, Tuan Anh Le, Kevin Ellis","We give a model of how to infer natural language rules by doing experiments. The model integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo algorithms for probabilistic inference, interleaving online belief updates with experiment design under information-theoretic criteria. We conduct a human-model comparison on a Zendo-style task, finding that a critical ingredient for modeling the human data is to assume that humans also consider fuzzy, probabilistic rules, in addition to assuming that humans perform approximately-Bayesian belief updates. We also compare with recent algorithms for using LLMs to generate and revise hypotheses, finding that our online inference method yields higher accuracy at recovering the true underlying rule, and provides better support for designing optimal experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06025v7,2024-02
Exploring Visual Culture Awareness in GPT-4V: A Comprehensive Probing,"Yong Cao, Wenyan Li, Jiaang Li, Yifei Yuan, Antonia Karamolegkou, Daniel Hershcovich","Pretrained large Vision-Language models have drawn considerable interest in recent years due to their remarkable performance. Despite considerable efforts to assess these models from diverse perspectives, the extent of visual cultural awareness in the state-of-the-art GPT-4V model remains unexplored. To tackle this gap, we extensively probed GPT-4V using the MaRVL benchmark dataset, aiming to investigate its capabilities and limitations in visual understanding with a focus on cultural aspects. Specifically, we introduced three visual related tasks, i.e. caption classification, pairwise captioning, and culture tag selection, to systematically delve into fine-grained visual cultural evaluation. Experimental results indicate that GPT-4V excels at identifying cultural concepts but still exhibits weaker performance in low-resource languages, such as Tamil and Swahili. Notably, through human evaluation, GPT-4V proves to be more culturally relevant in image captioning tasks than the original MaRVL human annotations, suggesting a promising solution for future visual cultural benchmark construction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06015v2,2024-02

Driving Everywhere with Large Language Model Policy Adaptation,"Boyi Li, Yue Wang, Jiageng Mao, Boris Ivanovic, Sushant Veer, Karen Leung, Marco Pavone","Adapting driving behavior to new environments, customs, and laws is a long-standing problem in autonomous driving, precluding the widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs).

LLaDA achieves this by leveraging the impressive zero-shot generalizability of large language models (LLMs) in interpreting the traffic rules in the local driver handbook. Through an extensive user study, we show that LLaDA's instructions are useful in disambiguating in-the-wild unexpected situations.

WebLINX: Real-World Website Navigation with Multi-Turn Dialogue,"Xing Han Lù, Zdeněk Kasner, Siva Reddy","We propose the problem of conversational web navigation, where a digital agent controls a web browser and follows user instructions to solve real-world tasks in a multi-turn dialogue fashion. To support this problem, we introduce WEBLINX - a large-scale benchmark of 100K interactions across 2300 expert demonstrations of conversational web navigation. Our benchmark covers a broad range of patterns on over 150 real-world websites and can be used to train and evaluate agents in diverse scenarios. Due to the magnitude of information present, Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot process entire web pages in real-time. To solve this bottleneck, we design a retrieval-inspired model that efficiently prunes HTML pages by ranking relevant elements. We use the selected elements, along with screenshots and action history, to assess a variety of models for their ability to replicate human behavior when navigating the web. Our experiments span from small text-only to proprietary multimodal LLMs. We find that smaller finetuned decoders surpass the best zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4V), but also larger finetuned multimodal models which were explicitly pretrained on screenshots. However, all finetuned models struggle to generalize to unseen websites. Our findings highlight the need for large multimodal models that can generalize to novel settings.

On the Convergence of Zeroth-Order Federated Tuning for Large Language Models,"Zhenqing Ling, Daoyuan Chen, Liuyi Yao, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen","The confluence of Federated Learning (FL) and Large Language Models (LLMs) is ushering in a new era in privacy-preserving natural language processing. However, the intensive memory requirements for fine-tuning LLMs pose significant challenges, especially when deploying on clients with limited computational resources. To circumvent this, we explore the novel integration of Memory-efficient Zeroth-Order Optimization within a federated setting, a synergy we term as FedMeZO. Our study is the first to examine the theoretical underpinnings of FedMeZO in the context of LLMs, tackling key questions regarding the influence of large parameter spaces on optimization behavior, the establishment of convergence properties, and the identification of critical parameters for convergence to inform personalized federated strategies. Our extensive empirical evidence supports the theory, showing that FedMeZO not only converges faster than traditional first-order methods such as FedAvg but also significantly reduces GPU memory usage during training to levels comparable to those during inference. Moreover, the proposed personalized FL strategy that is built upon the theoretical insights to customize the client-wise learning rate can effectively accelerate loss reduction. We hope our work can help to bridge theoretical and practical aspects of federated fine-tuning for LLMs, thereby stimulating further advancements and research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05926v3,2024-02
Efficient Stagewise Pretraining via Progressive Subnetworks,"Abhishek Panigrahi, Nikunj Saunshi, Kaifeng Lyu, Sobhan Miryoosefi, Sashank Reddi, Satyen Kale, Sanjiv Kumar","Recent developments in large language models have sparked interest in efficient pretraining methods. Stagewise training approaches to improve efficiency, like gradual stacking and layer dropping (Reddi et al, 2023; Zhang & He, 2020), have recently garnered attention. The prevailing view suggests that stagewise dropping strategies, such as layer dropping, are ineffective, especially when compared to stacking-based approaches. This paper challenges this notion by demonstrating that, with proper design, dropping strategies can be competitive, if not better, than stacking methods. Specifically, we develop a principled stagewise training framework, progressive subnetwork training, which only trains subnetworks within the model and progressively increases the size of subnetworks during training, until it trains the full network. We propose an instantiation of this framework - Random Part Training (RAPTR) - that selects and trains only a random subnetwork (e.g. depth-wise, width-wise) of the network at each step, progressively increasing the size in stages. We show that this approach not only generalizes prior works like layer dropping but also fixes their key issues. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical basis for such approaches and provide justification for (a) increasing complexity of subnetworks in stages, conceptually diverging from prior works on layer dropping, and (b) stability in loss across stage transitions in presence of key modern architecture components like residual connections and layer norms. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that RAPTR can significantly speed up training of standard benchmarks like BERT and UL2, up to 33% compared to standard training and, surprisingly, also shows better downstream performance on UL2, improving QA tasks and SuperGLUE by 1.5%; thereby, providing evidence of better inductive bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05913v2,2024-02

CREMA: Generalizable and Efficient Video-Language Reasoning via Multimodal Modular Fusion,"Shoubin Yu, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal","Despite impressive advancements in recent multimodal reasoning approaches, they are still limited in flexibility and efficiency, as these models typically process only a few fixed modality inputs and require updates to numerous parameters. This paper tackles these critical challenges and proposes CREMA, a generalizable, highly efficient, and modular modality-fusion framework that can incorporate any new modality to enhance video reasoning. We first augment multiple informative modalities (such as optical flow, 3D point cloud, audio, thermal heatmap, and touch map) from given videos without extra human annotation by leveraging sensors or existing pre-trained models. Next, we introduce a query transformer with multiple parameter-efficient modules associated with each accessible modality. It projects diverse modality features to the LLM token embedding space, allowing the model to integrate different data types for response generation. Furthermore, we propose a novel progressive multimodal fusion design supported by a lightweight fusion module and modality-sequential training strategy. It helps compress information across various assisting modalities, maintaining computational efficiency in the LLM while improving performance. We validate our method on 7 video-language reasoning tasks assisted by diverse modalities, including conventional VideoQA and Video-Audio/3D/Touch/Thermal QA, and achieve better/equivalent performance against strong multimodal LLMs, including OneLLM, BLIP-2, and SeViLA while reducing over 90% trainable parameters.

Generative Echo Chamber? Effects of LLM-Powered Search Systems on Diverse Information Seeking,"Nikhil Sharma, Q. Vera Liao, Ziang Xiao","Large language models (LLMs) powered conversational search systems have already been used by hundreds of millions of people, and are believed to bring many benefits over conventional search. However, while decades of research and public discourse interrogated the risk of search systems in increasing selective exposure and creating echo chambers -- limiting exposure to diverse opinions and leading to opinion polarization, little is known about such a risk of LLM-powered conversational search. We conduct two experiments to investigate: 1) whether and how LLM-powered conversational search increases selective exposure compared to conventional search; 2) whether and how LLMs with opinion biases that either reinforce or challenge the user's view change the effect. Overall, we found that participants engaged in more biased information querying with LLM-powered conversational search, and an opinionated LLM reinforcing their views exacerbated this bias. These results present critical implications for the development of LLMs and conversational search systems, and the policy governing these technologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05880v2,2024-02
EmojiCrypt: Prompt Encryption for Secure Communication with Large Language Models,"Guo Lin, Wenyue Hua, Yongfeng Zhang","Cloud-based large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have increasingly become integral to daily operations, serving as vital tools across various applications. While these models offer substantial benefits in terms of accessibility and functionality, they also introduce significant privacy concerns: the transmission and storage of user data in cloud infrastructures pose substantial risks of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information; even if the transmission and storage of data is encrypted, the LLM service provider itself still knows the real contents of the data, preventing individuals or entities from confidently using such LLM services. To address these concerns, this paper proposes a simple yet effective mechanism EmojiCrypt to protect user privacy. It uses Emoji to encrypt the user inputs before sending them to LLM, effectively rendering them indecipherable to human or LLM's examination while retaining the original intent of the prompt, thus ensuring the model's performance remains unaffected. We conduct experiments on three tasks, personalized recommendation, sentiment analysis, and tabular data analysis. Experiment results reveal that EmojiCrypt can encrypt personal information within prompts in such a manner that not only prevents the discernment of sensitive data by humans or LLM itself, but also maintains or even improves the precision without further tuning, achieving comparable or even better task accuracy than directly prompting the LLM without prompt encryption. These results highlight the practicality of adopting encryption measures that safeguard user privacy without compromising the functional integrity and performance of LLMs. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/agiresearch/EmojiCrypt.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05868v2,2024-02
Permute-and-Flip: An optimally robust and watermarkable decoder for LLMs,"Xuandong Zhao, Lei Li, Yu-Xiang Wang","In this paper, we propose a new decoding method called Permute-and-Flip (PF) decoder. It enjoys robustness properties similar to the standard sampling decoder, but is provably up to 2x better in its quality-robustness tradeoff than sampling and never worse than any other decoder. We also design a cryptographic watermarking scheme analogous to Aaronson's Gumbel watermark, but naturally tailored for PF decoder. The watermarking scheme does not change the distribution to sample, while allowing arbitrarily low false positive rate and high recall whenever the generated text has high entropy. Our experiments show that the PF decoder (and its watermarked counterpart) significantly outperform(s) naive sampling (and it's Gumbel watermarked counterpart) in terms of perplexity, while retaining the same robustness (and detectability), hence making it a promising new approach for LLM decoding. The code is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/pf-decoding",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05864v1,2024-02
How Well Can LLMs Negotiate? NegotiationArena Platform and Analysis,"Federico Bianchi, Patrick John Chia, Mert Yuksekgonul, Jacopo Tagliabue, Dan Jurafsky, James Zou","Negotiation is the basis of social interactions; humans negotiate everything from the price of cars to how to share common resources. With rapidly growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) to act as agents on behalf of human users, such LLM agents would also need to be able to negotiate. In this paper, we study how well LLMs can negotiate with each other. We develop NegotiationArena: a flexible framework for evaluating and probing the negotiation abilities of LLM agents. We implemented three types of scenarios in NegotiationArena to assess LLM's behaviors in allocating shared resources (ultimatum games), aggregate resources (trading games) and buy/sell goods (price negotiations). Each scenario allows for multiple turns of flexible dialogues between LLM agents to allow for more complex negotiations. Interestingly, LLM agents can significantly boost their negotiation outcomes by employing certain behavioral tactics. For example, by pretending to be desolate and desperate, LLMs can improve their payoffs by 20\% when negotiating against the standard GPT-4. We also quantify irrational negotiation behaviors exhibited by the LLM agents, many of which also appear in humans. Together, \NegotiationArena offers a new environment to investigate LLM interactions, enabling new insights into LLM's theory of mind, irrationality, and reasoning abilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05863v1,2024-02
Neural Models for Source Code Synthesis and Completion,Mitodru Niyogi,"Natural language (NL) to code suggestion systems assist developers in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) by translating NL utterances into compilable code snippet. The current approaches mainly involve hard-coded, rule-based systems based on semantic parsing. These systems make heavy use of hand-crafted rules that map patterns in NL or elements in its syntax parse tree to various query constructs and can only work on a limited subset of NL with a restricted NL syntax. These systems are unable to extract semantic information from the coding intents of the developer, and often fail to infer types, names, and the context of the source code to get accurate system-level code suggestions. In this master thesis, we present sequence-to-sequence deep learning models and training paradigms to map NL to general-purpose programming languages that can assist users with suggestions of source code snippets, given a NL intent, and also extend auto-completion functionality of the source code to users while they are writing source code. The developed architecture incorporates contextual awareness into neural models which generate source code tokens directly instead of generating parse trees/abstract meaning representations from the source code and converting them back to source code. The proposed pretraining strategy and the data augmentation techniques improve the performance of the proposed architecture. The proposed architecture has been found to exceed the performance of a neural semantic parser, TranX, based on the BLEU-4 metric by 10.82%. Thereafter, a finer analysis for the parsable code translations from the NL intent for CoNaLA challenge was introduced. The proposed system is bidirectional as it can be also used to generate NL code documentation given source code. Lastly, a RoBERTa masked language model for Python was proposed to extend the developed system for code completion.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06690v1,2024-02
On the Robustness of Editing Large Language Models,"Xinbei Ma, Tianjie Ju, Jiyang Qiu, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao, Lifeng Liu, Yulong Wang","Large language models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in building communicative AI, yet they encounter the challenge of efficient updates. Model editing enables the manipulation of specific knowledge memories and the behavior of language generation without retraining. However, the robustness of model editing remains an open question. This work seeks to understand the strengths and limitations of editing methods, facilitating practical applications of communicative AI. We focus on three key research questions. RQ1: Can edited LLMs behave consistently resembling communicative AI in realistic situations? RQ2: To what extent does the rephrasing of prompts lead LLMs to deviate from the edited knowledge memory? RQ3: Which knowledge features are correlated with the performance and robustness of editing? Our empirical studies uncover a substantial disparity between existing editing methods and the practical application of LLMs. On rephrased prompts that are flexible but common in realistic applications, the performance of editing experiences a significant decline. Further analysis shows that more popular knowledge is memorized better, easier to recall, and more challenging to edit effectively.

Integrating Self-supervised Speech Model with Pseudo Word-level Targets from Visually-grounded Speech Model,"Hung-Chieh Fang, Nai-Xuan Ye, Yi-Jen Shih, Puyuan Peng, Hsuan-Fu Wang, Layne Berry, Hung-yi Lee, David Harwath","Recent advances in self-supervised speech models have shown significant improvement in many downstream tasks. However, these models predominantly centered on frame-level training objectives, which can fall short in spoken language understanding tasks that require semantic comprehension. Existing works often rely on additional speech-text data as intermediate targets, which is costly in the real-world setting. To address this challenge, we propose Pseudo-Word HuBERT (PW-HuBERT), a framework that integrates pseudo word-level targets into the training process, where the targets are derived from a visually-ground speech model, notably eliminating the need for speech-text paired data. Our experimental results on four spoken language understanding (SLU) benchmarks suggest the superiority of our model in capturing semantic information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05819v1,2024-02
Selective Forgetting: Advancing Machine Unlearning Techniques and Evaluation in Language Models,"Lingzhi Wang, Xingshan Zeng, Jinsong Guo, Kam-Fai Wong, Georg Gottlob","This paper explores Machine Unlearning (MU), an emerging field that is gaining increased attention due to concerns about neural models unintentionally remembering personal or sensitive information. We present SeUL, a novel method that enables selective and fine-grained unlearning for language models. Unlike previous work that employs a fully reversed training objective in unlearning, SeUL minimizes the negative impact on the capability of language models, particularly in terms of generation. Furthermore, we introduce two innovative evaluation metrics, sensitive extraction likelihood (S-EL) and sensitive memorization accuracy (S-MA), specifically designed to assess the effectiveness of forgetting sensitive information. In support of the unlearning framework, we propose efficient automatic online and offline sensitive span annotation methods. The online selection method, based on language probability scores, ensures computational efficiency, while the offline annotation involves a two-stage LLM-based process for robust verification. In summary, this paper contributes a novel selective unlearning method (SeUL), introduces specialized evaluation metrics (S-EL and S-MA) for assessing sensitive information forgetting, and proposes automatic online and offline sensitive span annotation methods to support the overall unlearning framework and evaluation process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05813v2,2024-02
FAQ-Gen: An automated system to generate domain-specific FAQs to aid content comprehension,"Sahil Kale, Gautam Khaire, Jay Patankar","Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) refer to the most common inquiries about specific content. They serve as content comprehension aids by simplifying topics and enhancing understanding through succinct presentation of information. In this paper, we address FAQ generation as a well-defined Natural Language Processing task through the development of an end-to-end system leveraging text-to-text transformation models. We present a literature review covering traditional question-answering systems, highlighting their limitations when applied directly to the FAQ generation task. We propose a system capable of building FAQs from textual content tailored to specific domains, enhancing their accuracy and relevance. We utilise self-curated algorithms to obtain an optimal representation of information to be provided as input and also to rank the question-answer pairs to maximise human comprehension. Qualitative human evaluation showcases the generated FAQs as well-constructed and readable while also utilising domain-specific constructs to highlight domain-based nuances and jargon in the original content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05812v3,2024-02
Training Large Language Models for Reasoning through Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning,"Zhiheng Xi, Wenxiang Chen, Boyang Hong, Senjie Jin, Rui Zheng, Wei He, Yiwen Ding, Shichun Liu, Xin Guo, Junzhe Wang, Honglin Guo, Wei Shen, Xiaoran Fan, Yuhao Zhou, Shihan Dou, Xiao Wang, Xinbo Zhang, Peng Sun, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","In this paper, we propose R$^3$: Learning Reasoning through Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (RL), a novel method that employs only outcome supervision to achieve the benefits of process supervision for large language models. The core challenge in applying RL to complex reasoning is to identify a sequence of actions that result in positive rewards and provide appropriate supervision for optimization. Outcome supervision provides sparse rewards for final results without identifying error locations, whereas process supervision offers step-wise rewards but requires extensive manual annotation. R$^3$ overcomes these limitations by learning from correct demonstrations. Specifically, R$^3$ progressively slides the start state of reasoning from a demonstration's end to its beginning, facilitating easier model exploration at all stages. Thus, R$^3$ establishes a step-wise curriculum, allowing outcome supervision to offer step-level signals and precisely pinpoint errors. Using Llama2-7B, our method surpasses RL baseline on eight reasoning tasks by $4.1$ points on average. Notebaly, in program-based reasoning on GSM8K, it exceeds the baseline by $4.2$ points across three backbone models, and without any extra data, Codellama-7B + R$^3$ performs comparable to larger models or closed-source models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05808v2,2024-02
Phonetically rich corpus construction for a low-resourced language,"Marcellus Amadeus, William Alberto Cruz Castañeda, Wilmer Lobato, Niasche Aquino","Speech technologies rely on capturing a speaker's voice variability while obtaining comprehensive language information. Textual prompts and sentence selection methods have been proposed in the literature to comprise such adequate phonetic data, referred to as a phonetically rich \textit{corpus}. However, they are still insufficient for acoustic modeling, especially critical for languages with limited resources. Hence, this paper proposes a novel approach and outlines the methodological aspects required to create a \textit{corpus} with broad phonetic coverage for a low-resourced language, Brazilian Portuguese. Our methodology includes text dataset collection up to a sentence selection algorithm based on triphone distribution. Furthermore, we propose a new phonemic classification according to acoustic-articulatory speech features since the absolute number of distinct triphones, or low-probability triphones, does not guarantee an adequate representation of every possible combination. Using our algorithm, we achieve a 55.8\% higher percentage of distinct triphones -- for samples of similar size -- while the currently available phonetic-rich corpus, CETUC and TTS-Portuguese, 12.6\% and 12.3\% in comparison to a non-phonetically rich dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05794v1,2024-02
Limits of Transformer Language Models on Learning to Compose Algorithms,"Jonathan Thomm, Giacomo Camposampiero, Aleksandar Terzic, Michael Hersche, Bernhard Schölkopf, Abbas Rahimi","We analyze the capabilities of Transformer language models in learning compositional discrete tasks. To this end, we evaluate training LLaMA models and prompting GPT-4 and Gemini on four tasks demanding to learn a composition of several discrete sub-tasks. In particular, we measure how well these models can reuse primitives observable in the sub-tasks to learn the composition task. Our results indicate that compositional learning in state-of-the-art Transformer language models is highly sample inefficient: LLaMA requires more data samples than relearning all sub-tasks from scratch to learn the compositional task; in-context prompting with few samples is unreliable and fails at executing the sub-tasks or correcting the errors in multi-round code generation. Further, by leveraging complexity theory, we support these findings with a theoretical analysis focused on the sample inefficiency of gradient descent in memorizing feedforward models. We open source our code at https://github.com/IBM/limitations-lm-algorithmic-compositional-learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05785v5,2024-02
Text-to-Code Generation with Modality-relative Pre-training,"Fenia Christopoulou, Guchun Zhang, Gerasimos Lampouras","Large pre-trained language models have recently been expanded and applied to programming language tasks with great success, often through further pre-training of a strictly-natural language model--where training sequences typically contain both natural and (linearised) programming language. Such approaches effectively map both modalities of the sequence into the same embedding space. However, programming language keywords (e.g. ""while"") often have very strictly defined semantics. As such, transfer learning from their natural language usage may not necessarily be beneficial to their code application and vise versa. Assuming an already pre-trained language model, in this work we investigate how sequence tokens can be adapted and represented differently, depending on which modality they belong to, and to the ultimate benefit of the downstream task. We experiment with separating embedding spaces between modalities during further model pre-training with modality-relative training objectives. We focus on text-to-code generation and observe consistent improvements across two backbone models and two test sets, measuring pass@$k$ and a novel incremental variation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05783v2,2024-02
Examining Gender and Racial Bias in Large Vision-Language Models Using a Novel Dataset of Parallel Images,"Kathleen C. Fraser, Svetlana Kiritchenko","Following on recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and subsequent chat models, a new wave of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has emerged. Such models can incorporate images as input in addition to text, and perform tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, story generation, etc. Here, we examine potential gender and racial biases in such systems, based on the perceived characteristics of the people in the input images. To accomplish this, we present a new dataset PAIRS (PArallel Images for eveRyday Scenarios). The PAIRS dataset contains sets of AI-generated images of people, such that the images are highly similar in terms of background and visual content, but differ along the dimensions of gender (man, woman) and race (Black, white). By querying the LVLMs with such images, we observe significant differences in the responses according to the perceived gender or race of the person depicted.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05779v1,2024-02
UFO: A UI-Focused Agent for Windows OS Interaction,"Chaoyun Zhang, Liqun Li, Shilin He, Xu Zhang, Bo Qiao, Si Qin, Minghua Ma, Yu Kang, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang","We introduce UFO, an innovative UI-Focused agent to fulfill user requests tailored to applications on Windows OS, harnessing the capabilities of GPT-Vision. UFO employs a dual-agent framework to meticulously observe and analyze the graphical user interface (GUI) and control information of Windows applications.

The framework incorporates a control interaction module, facilitating action grounding without human intervention and enabling fully automated execution. Consequently, UFO transforms arduous and time-consuming processes into simple tasks achievable solely through natural language commands.

Spirit LM comes in two versions: a Base version that uses speech phonetic units (HuBERT) and an Expressive version that models expressivity using pitch and style units in addition to the phonetic units. For both versions, the text is encoded with subword BPE tokens. The resulting model displays both the semantic abilities of text models and the expressive abilities of speech models.

In TimeArena, agents are asked to complete multiple tasks as soon as possible, allowing for parallel processing to save time. We implement the dependency between actions, the time duration for each action, and the occupancy of the agent and the objects in the environment. TimeArena grounds to 30 real-world tasks in cooking, household activities, and laboratory work. We conduct extensive experiments with various state-of-the-art LLMs using TimeArena.

However, an LLM-based strategy for modeling spoken dialogs remains elusive, calling for further investigation. This paper introduces an extensive speech-text LLM framework, the Unified Spoken Dialog Model (USDM), designed to generate coherent spoken responses with naturally occurring prosodic features relevant to the given input speech without relying on explicit automatic speech recognition (ASR) or text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We have verified the inclusion of prosody in speech tokens that predominantly contain semantic information and have used this foundation to construct a prosody-infused speech-text model. Additionally, we propose a generalized speech-text pretraining scheme that enhances the capture of cross-modal semantics. To construct USDM, we fine-tune our speech-text model on spoken dialog data using a multi-step spoken dialog template that stimulates the chain-of-reasoning capabilities exhibited by the underlying LLM.

Self-Alignment of Large Language Models via Monopolylogue-based Social Scene Simulation,"Xianghe Pang, Shuo Tang, Rui Ye, Yuxin Xiong, Bolun Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen","Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is imperative to mitigate potential adverse effects resulting from their misuse. Drawing from the sociological insight that acknowledging all parties' concerns is a key factor in shaping human values, this paper proposes a novel direction to align LLMs by themselves: social scene simulation. To achieve this, we present MATRIX, a novel social scene simulator that emulates realistic scenes around a user's input query, enabling the LLM to take social consequences into account before responding. MATRIX serves as a virtual rehearsal space, akin to a Monopolylogue, where the LLM performs diverse roles related to the query and practice by itself. To inject this alignment, we fine-tune the LLM with MATRIX-simulated data, ensuring adherence to human values without compromising inference speed. We theoretically show that the LLM with MATRIX outperforms Constitutional AI under mild assumptions. Finally, extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms over 10 baselines across 4 benchmarks. As evidenced by 875 user ratings, our tuned 13B-size LLM exceeds GPT-4 in aligning with human values.

Comprehensive Assessment of Jailbreak Attacks Against LLMs,"Junjie Chu, Yugeng Liu, Ziqing Yang, Xinyue Shen, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang","Jailbreak attacks aim to bypass the safeguards of LLMs. While researchers have studied different jailbreak attacks in depth, they have done so in isolation -- either with unaligned experiment settings or comparing a limited range of methods. To fill this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement of various jailbreak attack methods. We collect 17 cutting-edge jailbreak methods, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Based on eight popular censored LLMs and 160 questions from 16 violation categories, we conduct a unified and impartial assessment of attack effectiveness as well as a comprehensive ablation study. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that all the jailbreak attacks have a powerful effect on the LLMs. This indicates that all LLMs fail to cover all the violation categories, and they are susceptible to significant jailbreak risks, with even the well-aligned Llama3 facing a maximum attack success rate of 0.88. Additionally, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced external defenses and find none of the defenses could mitigate the jailbreak attacks entirely. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners to evaluate them effectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05668v2,2024-02
Text Role Classification in Scientific Charts Using Multimodal Transformers,"Hye Jin Kim, Nicolas Lell, Ansgar Scherp","Text role classification involves classifying the semantic role of textual elements within scientific charts. For this task, we propose to finetune two pretrained multimodal document layout analysis models, LayoutLMv3 and UDOP, on chart datasets. The transformers utilize the three modalities of text, image, and layout as input. We further investigate whether data augmentation and balancing methods help the performance of the models. The models are evaluated on various chart datasets, and results show that LayoutLMv3 outperforms UDOP in all experiments. LayoutLMv3 achieves the highest F1-macro score of 82.87 on the ICPR22 test dataset, beating the best-performing model from the ICPR22 CHART-Infographics challenge. Moreover, the robustness of the models is tested on a synthetic noisy dataset ICPR22-N. Finally, the generalizability of the models is evaluated on three chart datasets, CHIME-R, DeGruyter, and EconBiz, for which we added labels for the text roles. Findings indicate that even in cases where there is limited training data, transformers can be used with the help of data augmentation and balancing methods.

"Merging Facts, Crafting Fallacies: Evaluating the Contradictory Nature of Aggregated Factual Claims in Long-Form Generations","Cheng-Han Chiang, Hung-yi Lee","Long-form generations from large language models (LLMs) contain a mix of factual and non-factual claims, making evaluating factuality difficult. Prior works evaluate the factuality of a long paragraph by decomposing it into multiple facts, verifying those facts independently, and aggregating the results. Such methods assume that combining factual claims forms a factual paragraph. The above assumption can be violated: we show that strong open-source models like Llama-chat can generate paragraphs that contain verifiable facts, but the facts are combined into a non-factual paragraph due to entity ambiguity. We further reveal that existing factuality metrics, including FActScore and citation recall, cannot properly evaluate these non-factual paragraphs and overestimate their factuality. To address this, we introduce an enhanced metric, D-FActScore, specifically designed for content with ambiguous entities. We evaluate the D-FActScores of people biographies generated by retrieval-augmented LLMs. We show that D-FActScore can better assess the factuality of paragraphs with entity ambiguity than FActScore. We also find that four widely used open-source LLMs tend to mix information of distinct entities to form non-factual paragraphs, making their D-FActScore much lower than FActScore by over 10%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05629v4,2024-02
"Efficient Models for the Detection of Hate, Abuse and Profanity","Christoph Tillmann, Aashka Trivedi, Bishwaranjan Bhattacharjee","Large Language Models (LLMs) are the cornerstone for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, document classification, named entity recognition, question answering, summarization, etc. LLMs are often trained on data which originates from the web. This data is prone to having content with Hate, Abuse and Profanity (HAP). For a detailed definition of HAP, please refer to the Appendix. Due to the LLMs being exposed to HAP content during training, the models learn it and may then generate hateful or profane content. For example, when the open-source RoBERTa model (specifically, the RoBERTA base model) from the HuggingFace (HF) Transformers library is prompted to replace the mask token in `I do not know that Persian people are that MASK` it returns the word `stupid` with the highest score. This is unacceptable in civil discourse.The detection of Hate, Abuse and Profanity in text is a vital component of creating civil and unbiased LLMs, which is needed not only for English, but for all languages. In this article, we briefly describe the creation of HAP detectors and various ways of using them to make models civil and acceptable in the output they generate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05624v1,2024-02

Pretrained Generative Language Models as General Learning Frameworks for Sequence-Based Tasks,Ben Fauber,"We propose that small pretrained foundational generative language models with millions of parameters can be utilized as a general learning framework for sequence-based tasks.

AttnLRP: Attention-Aware Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation for Transformers,"Reduan Achtibat, Sayed Mohammad Vakilzadeh Hatefi, Maximilian Dreyer, Aakriti Jain, Thomas Wiegand, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek","Large Language Models are prone to biased predictions and hallucinations, underlining the paramount importance of understanding their model-internal reasoning process. However, achieving faithful attributions for the entirety of a black-box transformer model and maintaining computational efficiency is an unsolved challenge. By extending the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation attribution method to handle attention layers, we address these challenges effectively. While partial solutions exist, our method is the first to faithfully and holistically attribute not only input but also latent representations of transformer models with the computational efficiency similar to a single backward pass. Through extensive evaluations against existing methods on LLaMa 2, Mixtral 8x7b, Flan-T5 and vision transformer architectures, we demonstrate that our proposed approach surpasses alternative methods in terms of faithfulness and enables the understanding of latent representations, opening up the door for concept-based explanations.

SoftEDA: Rethinking Rule-Based Data Augmentation with Soft Labels,"Juhwan Choi, Kyohoon Jin, Junho Lee, Sangmin Song, Youngbin Kim","Rule-based text data augmentation is widely used for NLP tasks due to its simplicity. However, this method can potentially damage the original meaning of the text, ultimately hurting the performance of the model. To overcome this limitation, we propose a straightforward technique for applying soft labels to augmented data. We conducted experiments across seven different classification tasks and empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach. We have publicly opened our source code for reproducibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05591v1,2024-02
AutoAugment Is What You Need: Enhancing Rule-based Augmentation Methods in Low-resource Regimes,"Juhwan Choi, Kyohoon Jin, Junho Lee, Sangmin Song, Youngbin Kim","Text data augmentation is a complex problem due to the discrete nature of sentences. Although rule-based augmentation methods are widely adopted in real-world applications because of their simplicity, they suffer from potential semantic damage. Previous researchers have suggested easy data augmentation with soft labels (softEDA), employing label smoothing to mitigate this problem. However, finding the best factor for each model and dataset is challenging; therefore, using softEDA in real-world applications is still difficult. In this paper, we propose adapting AutoAugment to solve this problem. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method can boost existing augmentation methods and that rule-based methods can enhance cutting-edge pre-trained language models. We offer the source code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05584v1,2024-02
Establishing degrees of closeness between audio recordings along different dimensions using large-scale cross-lingual models,"Maxime Fily, Guillaume Wisniewski, Severine Guillaume, Gilles Adda, Alexis Michaud","In the highly constrained context of low-resource language studies, we explore vector representations of speech from a pretrained model to determine their level of abstraction with regard to the audio signal. We propose a new unsupervised method using ABX tests on audio recordings with carefully curated metadata to shed light on the type of information present in the representations. ABX tests determine whether the representations computed by a multilingual speech model encode a given characteristic. Three experiments are devised: one on room acoustics aspects, one on linguistic genre, and one on phonetic aspects. The results confirm that the representations extracted from recordings with different linguistic/extra-linguistic characteristics differ along the same lines. Embedding more audio signal in one vector better discriminates extra-linguistic characteristics, whereas shorter snippets are better to distinguish segmental information. The method is fully unsupervised, potentially opening new research avenues for comparative work on under-documented languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05581v1,2024-02
Traditional Machine Learning Models and Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformer (BERT)-Based Automatic Classification of Tweets About Eating Disorders: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,"José Alberto Benítez-Andrades, José-Manuel Alija-Pérez, Maria-Esther Vidal, Rafael Pastor-Vargas, María Teresa García-Ordás","Background: Eating disorders are increasingly prevalent, and social networks offer valuable information.   Objective: Our goal was to identify efficient machine learning models for categorizing tweets related to eating disorders.   Methods: Over three months, we collected tweets about eating disorders. A 2,000-tweet subset was labeled for: (1) being written by individuals with eating disorders, (2) promoting eating disorders, (3) informativeness, and (4) scientific content. Both traditional machine learning and deep learning models were employed for classification, assessing accuracy, F1 score, and computational time.   Results: From 1,058,957 collected tweets, transformer-based bidirectional encoder representations achieved the highest F1 scores (71.1%-86.4%) across all four categories.   Conclusions: Transformer-based models outperform traditional techniques in classifying eating disorder-related tweets, though they require more computational resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05571v1,2024-02
Benchmarking Large Language Models on Communicative Medical Coaching: a Novel System and Dataset,"Hengguan Huang, Songtao Wang, Hongfu Liu, Hao Wang, Ye Wang","Traditional applications of natural language processing (NLP) in healthcare have predominantly focused on patient-centered services, enhancing patient interactions and care delivery, such as through medical dialogue systems. However, the potential of NLP to benefit inexperienced doctors, particularly in areas such as communicative medical coaching, remains largely unexplored. We introduce ""ChatCoach"", a human-AI cooperative framework designed to assist medical learners in practicing their communication skills during patient consultations. ChatCoach (Our data and code are available online: https://github.com/zerowst/Chatcoach)differentiates itself from conventional dialogue systems by offering a simulated environment where medical learners can practice dialogues with a patient agent, while a coach agent provides immediate, structured feedback. This is facilitated by our proposed Generalized Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) approach, which fosters the generation of structured feedback and enhances the utilization of external knowledge sources. Additionally, we have developed a dataset specifically for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) within the ChatCoach framework on communicative medical coaching tasks. Our empirical results validate the effectiveness of ChatCoach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05547v2,2024-02

Empowering machine learning models with contextual knowledge for enhancing the detection of eating disorders in social media posts,"José Alberto Benítez-Andrades, María Teresa García-Ordás, Mayra Russo, Ahmad Sakor, Luis Daniel Fernandes Rotger, Maria-Esther Vidal","Social networks are vital for information sharing, especially in the health sector for discussing diseases and treatments. These platforms, however, often feature posts as brief texts, posing challenges for Artificial Intelligence (AI) in understanding context. We introduce a novel hybrid approach combining community-maintained knowledge graphs (like Wikidata) with deep learning to enhance the categorization of social media posts. This method uses advanced entity recognizers and linkers (like Falcon 2.0) to connect short post entities to knowledge graphs. Knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and contextualized word embeddings (like BERT) are then employed to create rich, context-based representations of these posts.   Our focus is on the health domain, particularly in identifying posts related to eating disorders (e.g., anorexia, bulimia) to aid healthcare providers in early diagnosis. We tested our approach on a dataset of 2,000 tweets about eating disorders, finding that merging word embeddings with knowledge graph information enhances the predictive models' reliability. This methodology aims to assist health experts in spotting patterns indicative of mental disorders, thereby improving early detection and accurate diagnosis for personalized medicine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05536v1,2024-02
NoisyICL: A Little Noise in Model Parameters Calibrates In-context Learning,"Yufeng Zhao, Yoshihiro Sakai, Naoya Inoue","In-Context Learning (ICL) is suffering from unsatisfactory performance and under-calibration due to high prior bias and unfaithful confidence. Some previous works fine-tuned language models for better ICL performance with enormous datasets and computing costs. In this paper, we propose NoisyICL, simply perturbing the model parameters by random noises to strive for better performance and calibration. Our experiments on two models and 12 downstream datasets show that NoisyICL can help ICL produce more accurate predictions. Our further analysis indicates that NoisyICL enables the model to provide more fair predictions, and also with more faithful confidence. Therefore, we believe that NoisyICL is an effective calibration of ICL. Our experimental code is uploaded to Github.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05515v2,2024-02
GPTs Are Multilingual Annotators for Sequence Generation Tasks,"Juhwan Choi, Eunju Lee, Kyohoon Jin, YoungBin Kim","Data annotation is an essential step for constructing new datasets. However, the conventional approach of data annotation through crowdsourcing is both time-consuming and expensive. In addition, the complexity of this process increases when dealing with low-resource languages owing to the difference in the language pool of crowdworkers. To address these issues, this study proposes an autonomous annotation method by utilizing large language models, which have been recently demonstrated to exhibit remarkable performance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is not just cost-efficient but also applicable for low-resource language annotation. Additionally, we constructed an image captioning dataset using our approach and are committed to open this dataset for future study. We have opened our source code for further study and reproducibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05512v1,2024-02
Rapid Optimization for Jailbreaking LLMs via Subconscious Exploitation and Echopraxia,"Guangyu Shen, Siyuan Cheng, Kaiyuan Zhang, Guanhong Tao, Shengwei An, Lu Yan, Zhuo Zhang, Shiqing Ma, Xiangyu Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become prevalent across diverse sectors, transforming human life with their extraordinary reasoning and comprehension abilities. As they find increased use in sensitive tasks, safety concerns have gained widespread attention. Extensive efforts have been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral principles to ensure their safe deployment. Despite their potential, recent research indicates aligned LLMs are prone to specialized jailbreaking prompts that bypass safety measures to elicit violent and harmful content. The intrinsic discrete nature and substantial scale of contemporary LLMs pose significant challenges in automatically generating diverse, efficient, and potent jailbreaking prompts, representing a continuous obstacle. In this paper, we introduce RIPPLE (Rapid Optimization via Subconscious Exploitation and Echopraxia), a novel optimization-based method inspired by two psychological concepts: subconsciousness and echopraxia, which describe the processes of the mind that occur without conscious awareness and the involuntary mimicry of actions, respectively. Evaluations across 6 open-source LLMs and 4 commercial LLM APIs show RIPPLE achieves an average Attack Success Rate of 91.5\%, outperforming five current methods by up to 47.0\% with an 8x reduction in overhead. Furthermore, it displays significant transferability and stealth, successfully evading established detection mechanisms.

It's Never Too Late: Fusing Acoustic Information into Large Language Models for Automatic Speech Recognition,"Chen Chen, Ruizhe Li, Yuchen Hu, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Pin-Yu Chen, Ensiong Chng, Chao-Han Huck Yang","Recent studies have successfully shown that large language models (LLMs) can be successfully used for generative error correction (GER) on top of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) output. Specifically, an LLM is utilized to carry out a direct mapping from the N-best hypotheses list generated by an ASR system to the predicted output transcription. However, despite its effectiveness, GER introduces extra data uncertainty since the LLM is trained without taking into account acoustic information available in the speech signal. In this work, we aim to overcome such a limitation by infusing acoustic information before generating the predicted transcription through a novel late fusion solution termed Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Fusion (UADF). UADF is a multimodal fusion approach implemented into an auto-regressive decoding process and works in two stages: (i) It first analyzes and calibrates the token-level LLM decision, and (ii) it then dynamically assimilates the information from the acoustic modality. Experimental evidence collected from various ASR tasks shows that UADF surpasses existing fusion mechanisms in several ways. It yields significant improvements in word error rate (WER) while mitigating data uncertainty issues in LLM and addressing the poor generalization relied with sole modality during fusion. We also demonstrate that UADF seamlessly adapts to audio-visual speech recognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05457v1,2024-02
Large Language Models for Psycholinguistic Plausibility Pretesting,"Samuel Joseph Amouyal, Aya Meltzer-Asscher, Jonathan Berant","In psycholinguistics, the creation of controlled materials is crucial to ensure that research outcomes are solely attributed to the intended manipulations and not influenced by extraneous factors. To achieve this, psycholinguists typically pretest linguistic materials, where a common pretest is to solicit plausibility judgments from human evaluators on specific sentences. In this work, we investigate whether Language Models (LMs) can be used to generate these plausibility judgements. We investigate a wide range of LMs across multiple linguistic structures and evaluate whether their plausibility judgements correlate with human judgements. We find that GPT-4 plausibility judgements highly correlate with human judgements across the structures we examine, whereas other LMs correlate well with humans on commonly used syntactic structures. We then test whether this correlation implies that LMs can be used instead of humans for pretesting. We find that when coarse-grained plausibility judgements are needed, this works well, but when fine-grained judgements are necessary, even GPT-4 does not provide satisfactory discriminative power.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05455v1,2024-02
Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention,"Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno","The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to obtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade and even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a novel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate through information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two technologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1) statistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized parameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2) finetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic representation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive experiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA and LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4% improvement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant performance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption, revealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that IR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks (e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.

GPT-4 Generated Narratives of Life Events using a Structured Narrative Prompt: A Validation Study,"Christopher J. Lynch, Erik Jensen, Madison H. Munro, Virginia Zamponi, Joseph Martinez, Kevin O'Brien, Brandon Feldhaus, Katherine Smith, Ann Marie Reinhold, Ross Gore","Large Language Models (LLMs) play a pivotal role in generating vast arrays of narratives, facilitating a systematic exploration of their effectiveness for communicating life events in narrative form. In this study, we employ a zero-shot structured narrative prompt to generate 24,000 narratives using OpenAI's GPT-4. From this dataset, we manually classify 2,880 narratives and evaluate their validity in conveying birth, death, hiring, and firing events. Remarkably, 87.43% of the narratives sufficiently convey the intention of the structured prompt. To automate the identification of valid and invalid narratives, we train and validate nine Machine Learning models on the classified datasets. Leveraging these models, we extend our analysis to predict the classifications of the remaining 21,120 narratives. All the ML models excelled at classifying valid narratives as valid, but experienced challenges at simultaneously classifying invalid narratives as invalid. Our findings not only advance the study of LLM capabilities, limitations, and validity but also offer practical insights for narrative generation and natural language processing applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05435v2,2024-02
Everybody Prune Now: Structured Pruning of LLMs with only Forward Passes,"Lucio Dery, Steven Kolawole, Jean-François Kagy, Virginia Smith, Graham Neubig, Ameet Talwalkar","Given the generational gap in available hardware between lay practitioners and the most endowed institutions, LLMs are becoming increasingly inaccessible as they grow in size. Whilst many approaches have been proposed to compress LLMs to make their resource consumption manageable, these methods themselves tend to be resource intensive, putting them out of the reach of the very user groups they target. In this work, we explore the problem of structured pruning of LLMs using only forward passes. We seek to empower practitioners to prune models so large that their available hardware has just enough memory to run inference. We develop Bonsai, a gradient-free, perturbative pruning method capable of delivering small, fast, and accurate pruned models.   We observe that Bonsai outputs pruned models that (i) outperform those generated by more expensive gradient-based structured pruning methods, and (ii) are twice as fast (with comparable accuracy) as those generated by semi-structured pruning methods requiring comparable resources as Bonsai. We also leverage Bonsai to produce a new sub-2B model using a single A6000 that yields state-of-the-art performance on 4/6 tasks on the Huggingface Open LLM leaderboard.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05406v2,2024-02
In-Context Principle Learning from Mistakes,"Tianjun Zhang, Aman Madaan, Luyu Gao, Steven Zheng, Swaroop Mishra, Yiming Yang, Niket Tandon, Uri Alon","In-context learning (ICL, also known as few-shot prompting) has been the standard method of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks, by learning from a few input-output examples. Nonetheless, all ICL-based approaches only learn from correct input-output pairs. In this paper, we revisit this paradigm, by learning more from the few given input-output examples. We introduce Learning Principles (LEAP): First, we intentionally induce the model to make mistakes on these few examples; then we reflect on these mistakes, and learn explicit task-specific ""principles"" from them, which help solve similar problems and avoid common mistakes; finally, we prompt the model to answer unseen test questions using the original few-shot examples and these learned general principles. We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop question answering (Hotpot QA), textual QA (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning, and math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the strongest available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4 turbo and Claude-2.1. For example, LEAP improves over the standard few-shot prompting using GPT-4 by 7.5% in DROP, and by 3.3% in HotpotQA. Importantly, LEAP does not require any more input or examples than the standard few-shot prompting settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05403v2,2024-02
Text2Data: Low-Resource Data Generation with Textual Control,"Shiyu Wang, Yihao Feng, Tian Lan, Ning Yu, Yu Bai, Ran Xu, Huan Wang, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese","Natural language serves as a common and straightforward signal for humans to interact seamlessly with machines. Recognizing the importance of this interface, the machine learning community is investing considerable effort in generating data that is semantically coherent with textual instructions. While strides have been made in text-to-data generation spanning image editing, audio synthesis, video creation, and beyond, low-resource areas characterized by expensive annotations or complex data structures, such as molecules, motion dynamics, and time series, often lack textual labels. This deficiency impedes supervised learning, thereby constraining the application of advanced generative models for text-to-data tasks. In response to these challenges in the low-resource scenario, we propose Text2Data, a novel approach that utilizes unlabeled data to understand the underlying data distribution through an unsupervised diffusion model. Subsequently, it undergoes controllable finetuning via a novel constraint optimization-based learning objective that ensures controllability and effectively counteracts catastrophic forgetting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Text2Data is able to achieve enhanced performance regarding controllability across various modalities, including molecules, motions and time series, when compared to existing baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10941v2,2024-02
Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Guided by Evolutionary Algorithms in Large Language Models,"Feihu Jin, Yifan Liu, Ying Tan","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks and exhibited impressive reasoning abilities by applying zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, due to the evolving nature of sentence prefixes during the pre-training phase, existing zero-shot CoT prompting methods that employ identical CoT prompting across all task instances may not be optimal. In this paper, we introduce a novel zero-shot prompting method that leverages evolutionary algorithms to generate diverse promptings for LLMs dynamically. Our approach involves initializing two CoT promptings, performing evolutionary operations based on LLMs to create a varied set, and utilizing the LLMs to select a suitable CoT prompting for a given problem. Additionally, a rewriting operation, guided by the selected CoT prompting, enhances the understanding of the LLMs about the problem. Extensive experiments conducted across ten reasoning datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to current zero-shot CoT prompting methods on GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4. Moreover, in-depth analytical experiments underscore the adaptability and effectiveness of our method in various reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05376v1,2024-02
CIC: A Framework for Culturally-Aware Image Captioning,"Youngsik Yun, Jihie Kim","Image Captioning generates descriptive sentences from images using Vision-Language Pre-trained models (VLPs) such as BLIP, which has improved greatly. However, current methods lack the generation of detailed descriptive captions for the cultural elements depicted in the images, such as the traditional clothing worn by people from Asian cultural groups. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Culturally-aware Image Captioning (CIC), that generates captions and describes cultural elements extracted from cultural visual elements in images representing cultures. Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts. Our human evaluation conducted on 45 participants from 4 different cultural groups with a high understanding of the corresponding culture shows that our proposed framework generates more culturally descriptive captions when compared to the image captioning baseline based on VLPs.

Noise Contrastive Alignment of Language Models with Explicit Rewards,"Huayu Chen, Guande He, Lifan Yuan, Ganqu Cui, Hang Su, Jun Zhu","User intentions are typically formalized as evaluation rewards to be maximized when fine-tuning language models (LMs). Existing alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are mainly tailored for pairwise preference data where rewards are implicitly defined rather than explicitly given. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for LM alignment, leveraging Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to bridge the gap in handling reward datasets explicitly annotated with scalar evaluations. Our framework comprises two parallel algorithms, NCA and InfoNCA, both enabling the direct extraction of an LM policy from reward data as well as preference data. Notably, we show that the DPO loss is a special case of our proposed InfoNCA objective under pairwise preference settings, thereby integrating and extending current alignment theories. By comparing NCA and InfoNCA, we demonstrate that the well-observed decreasing-likelihood trend of DPO/InfoNCA is caused by their focus on adjusting relative likelihood across different responses. In contrast, NCA optimizes the absolute likelihood for each response, thereby effectively preventing the chosen likelihood from decreasing. We evaluate our methods in both reward and preference settings with Mistral-8*7B and 7B models. Experiments suggest that InfoNCA/NCA surpasses various preference baselines when reward datasets are available. We also find NCA significantly outperforms DPO in complex reasoning tasks like math and coding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05369v3,2024-02
An Examination on the Effectiveness of Divide-and-Conquer Prompting in Large Language Models,"Yizhou Zhang, Lun Du, Defu Cao, Qiang Fu, Yan Liu","Foundation models, such as Large language Models (LLMs), have attracted significant amount of interest due to their large number of applications. However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level fake news detection, simple instructional prompts suffer from inaccurate responses. Existing works show that more complicated prompting strategies, such as Chain-of-Thoughts and Least-to-Most, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. Recent researches reveal that simple divide-and-conquer prompting strategy, i.e. simply dividing the input sequence to multiple sub-inputs, can also substantially improve LLM's performance in some specific tasks such as misinformation detection. In this paper, we aim at examining the utility of divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and answer on which kind of tasks this strategy gets advantages. Specifically, we provide a theoretic analysis to divide-and-conquer prompting strategy and help us identify the specific tasks where DaC prompting can bring performance boost with theoretic guarantee.

This study proposes a method for scaling up LLM reviews for content moderation in Google Ads. First, we use heuristics to select candidates via filtering and duplicate removal, and create clusters of ads for which we select one representative ad per cluster. We then use LLMs to review only the representative ads. Finally, we propagate the LLM decisions for the representative ads back to their clusters. This method reduces the number of reviews by more than 3 orders of magnitude while achieving a 2x recall compared to a baseline non-LLM model. The success of this approach is a strong function of the representations used in clustering and label propagation; we found that cross-modal similarity representations yield better results than uni-modal representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14590v1,2024-02

However, the impact of missing modality in different clients, also called modality incongruity, has been greatly overlooked. This paper, for the first time, analyses the impact of modality incongruity and reveals its connection with data heterogeneity across participating clients. We particularly inspect whether incongruent MMFL with unimodal and multimodal clients is more beneficial than unimodal FL. Furthermore, we examine three potential routes of addressing this issue. Firstly, we study the effectiveness of various self-attention mechanisms towards incongruity-agnostic information fusion in MMFL. Secondly, we introduce a modality imputation network (MIN) pre-trained in a multimodal client for modality translation in unimodal clients and investigate its potential towards mitigating the missing modality problem. Thirdly, we assess the capability of client-level and server-level regularization techniques towards mitigating modality incongruity effects.

We provide methods to convert previous annotation schemes into TreeForm structures and evaluate TreeForm predictions using a modified version of the normalized tree-edit distance. We present initial baselines for our end-to-end performance metric and the TreeForm edit distance, averaged over the FUNSD and XFUND datasets, of 61.5 and 26.4 respectively.

Large Language User Interfaces: Voice Interactive User Interfaces powered by LLMs,"Syed Mekael Wasti, Ken Q. Pu, Ali Neshati","The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has showcased remarkable capacities for logical reasoning and natural language comprehension. These capabilities can be leveraged in solutions that semantically and textually model complex problems. In this paper, we present our efforts toward constructing a framework that can serve as an intermediary between a user and their user interface (UI), enabling dynamic and real-time interactions. We employ a system that stands upon textual semantic mappings of UI components, in the form of annotations. These mappings are stored, parsed, and scaled in a custom data structure, supplementary to an agent-based prompting backend engine. Employing textual semantic mappings allows each component to not only explain its role to the engine but also provide expectations. By comprehending the needs of both the user and the components, our LLM engine can classify the most appropriate application, extract relevant parameters, and subsequently execute precise predictions of the user's expected actions. Such an integration evolves static user interfaces into highly dynamic and adaptable solutions, introducing a new frontier of intelligent and responsive user experiences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07938v2,2024-02

VerAs: Verify then Assess STEM Lab Reports,"Berk Atil, Mahsa Sheikhi Karizaki, Rebecca J. Passonneau","With an increasing focus in STEM education on critical thinking skills, science writing plays an ever more important role in curricula that stress inquiry skills. A recently published dataset of two sets of college level lab reports from an inquiry-based physics curriculum relies on analytic assessment rubrics that utilize multiple dimensions, specifying subject matter knowledge and general components of good explanations. Each analytic dimension is assessed on a 6-point scale, to provide detailed feedback to students that can help them improve their science writing skills. Manual assessment can be slow, and difficult to calibrate for consistency across all students in large classes. While much work exists on automated assessment of open-ended questions in STEM subjects, there has been far less work on long-form writing such as lab reports. We present an end-to-end neural architecture that has separate verifier and assessment modules, inspired by approaches to Open Domain Question Answering (OpenQA). VerAs first verifies whether a report contains any content relevant to a given rubric dimension, and if so, assesses the relevant sentences. On the lab reports, VerAs outperforms multiple baselines based on OpenQA systems or Automated Essay Scoring (AES). VerAs also performs well on an analytic rubric for middle school physics essays.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05224v2,2024-02
The Effect of Sampling Temperature on Problem Solving in Large Language Models,"Matthew Renze, Erhan Guven","In this research study, we empirically investigate the effect of sampling temperature on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various problem-solving tasks. We created a multiple-choice question-and-answer (MCQA) exam by randomly sampling problems from standard LLM benchmarks. Then, we used nine popular LLMs with five prompt-engineering techniques to solve the MCQA problems while increasing the sampling temperature from 0.0 to 1.6. Despite anecdotal reports to the contrary, our empirical results indicate that changes in temperature from 0.0 to 1.0 do not have a statistically significant impact on LLM performance for problem-solving tasks. In addition, these results appear to generalize across LLMs, prompt-engineering techniques, and problem domains. All code, data, and supplemental materials are available on GitHub at: https://github.com/matthewrenze/jhu-llm-temperature",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05201v3,2024-02
Are LLMs Ready for Real-World Materials Discovery?,"Santiago Miret, N M Anoop Krishnan","Large Language Models (LLMs) create exciting possibilities for powerful language processing tools to accelerate research in materials science. While LLMs have great potential to accelerate materials understanding and discovery, they currently fall short in being practical materials science tools. In this position paper, we show relevant failure cases of LLMs in materials science that reveal current limitations of LLMs related to comprehending and reasoning over complex, interconnected materials science knowledge. Given those shortcomings, we outline a framework for developing Materials Science LLMs (MatSci-LLMs) that are grounded in materials science knowledge and hypothesis generation followed by hypothesis testing. The path to attaining performant MatSci-LLMs rests in large part on building high-quality, multi-modal datasets sourced from scientific literature where various information extraction challenges persist. As such, we describe key materials science information extraction challenges which need to be overcome in order to build large-scale, multi-modal datasets that capture valuable materials science knowledge. Finally, we outline a roadmap for applying future MatSci-LLMs for real-world materials discovery via: 1. Automated Knowledge Base Generation; 2. Automated In-Silico Material Design; and 3. MatSci-LLM Integrated Self-Driving Materials Laboratories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05200v2,2024-02
$λ$-ECLIPSE: Multi-Concept Personalized Text-to-Image Diffusion Models by Leveraging CLIP Latent Space,"Maitreya Patel, Sangmin Jung, Chitta Baral, Yezhou Yang","Despite the recent advances in personalized text-to-image (P-T2I) generative models, it remains challenging to perform finetuning-free multi-subject-driven T2I in a resource-efficient manner. Predominantly, contemporary approaches, involving the training of Hypernetworks and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), require heavy computing resources that range from 600 to 12300 GPU hours of training. These subject-driven T2I methods hinge on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), which facilitate T2I mapping through cross-attention layers. While LDMs offer distinct advantages, P-T2I methods' reliance on the latent space of these diffusion models significantly escalates resource demands, leading to inconsistent results and necessitating numerous iterations for a single desired image. In this paper, we present $\lambda$-ECLIPSE, an alternative prior-training strategy that works in the latent space of a pre-trained CLIP model without relying on the diffusion UNet models. $\lambda$-ECLIPSE leverages the image-text interleaved pre-training for fast and effective multi-subject-driven P-T2I. Through extensive experiments, we establish that $\lambda$-ECLIPSE surpasses existing baselines in composition alignment while preserving concept alignment performance, even with significantly lower resource utilization. $\lambda$-ECLIPSE performs multi-subject driven P-T2I with just 34M parameters and is trained on a mere 74 GPU hours. Additionally, $\lambda$-ECLIPSE demonstrates the unique ability to perform multi-concept interpolations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05195v2,2024-02
InCoRo: In-Context Learning for Robotics Control with Feedback Loops,"Jiaqiang Ye Zhu, Carla Gomez Cano, David Vazquez Bermudez, Michal Drozdzal","One of the challenges in robotics is to enable robotic units with the reasoning capability that would be robust enough to execute complex tasks in dynamic environments. Recent advances in LLMs have positioned them as go-to tools for simple reasoning tasks, motivating the pioneering work of Liang et al. [35] that uses an LLM to translate natural language commands into low-level static execution plans for robotic units. Using LLMs inside robotics systems brings their generalization to a new level, enabling zero-shot generalization to new tasks. This paper extends this prior work to dynamic environments. We propose InCoRo, a system that uses a classical robotic feedback loop composed of an LLM controller, a scene understanding unit, and a robot. Our system continuously analyzes the state of the environment and provides adapted execution commands, enabling the robot to adjust to changing environmental conditions and correcting for controller errors. Our system does not require any iterative optimization to learn to accomplish a task as it leverages in-context learning with an off-the-shelf LLM model. Through an extensive validation process involving two standardized industrial robotic units -- SCARA and DELTA types -- we contribute knowledge about these robots, not popular in the community, thereby enriching it. We highlight the generalization capabilities of our system and show that (1) in-context learning in combination with the current state-of-the-art LLMs is an effective way to implement a robotic controller; (2) in static environments, InCoRo surpasses the prior art in terms of the success rate; (3) in dynamic environments, we establish new state-of-the-art for the SCARA and DELTA units, respectively. This research paves the way towards building reliable, efficient, intelligent autonomous systems that adapt to dynamic environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05188v1,2024-02

Image captioning for Brazilian Portuguese using GRIT model,"Rafael Silva de Alencar, William Alberto Cruz Castañeda, Marcellus Amadeus","This work presents the early development of a model of image captioning for the Brazilian Portuguese language. We used the GRIT (Grid - and Region-based Image captioning Transformer) model to accomplish this work. GRIT is a Transformer-only neural architecture that effectively utilizes two visual features to generate better captions. The GRIT method emerged as a proposal to be a more efficient way to generate image captioning.

Assessing the Brittleness of Safety Alignment via Pruning and Low-Rank Modifications,"Boyi Wei, Kaixuan Huang, Yangsibo Huang, Tinghao Xie, Xiangyu Qi, Mengzhou Xia, Prateek Mittal, Mengdi Wang, Peter Henderson","Large language models (LLMs) show inherent brittleness in their safety mechanisms, as evidenced by their susceptibility to jailbreaking and even non-malicious fine-tuning. This study explores this brittleness of safety alignment by leveraging pruning and low-rank modifications. We develop methods to identify critical regions that are vital for safety guardrails, and that are disentangled from utility-relevant regions at both the neuron and rank levels. Surprisingly, the isolated regions we find are sparse, comprising about $3\%$ at the parameter level and $2.5\%$ at the rank level. Removing these regions compromises safety without significantly impacting utility, corroborating the inherent brittleness of the model's safety mechanisms. Moreover, we show that LLMs remain vulnerable to low-cost fine-tuning attacks even when modifications to the safety-critical regions are restricted. These findings underscore the urgent need for more robust safety strategies in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05162v4,2024-02
A Roadmap to Pluralistic Alignment,"Taylor Sorensen, Jared Moore, Jillian Fisher, Mitchell Gordon, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Christopher Michael Rytting, Andre Ye, Liwei Jiang, Ximing Lu, Nouha Dziri, Tim Althoff, Yejin Choi","With increased power and prevalence of AI systems, it is ever more critical that AI systems are designed to serve all, i.e., people with diverse values and perspectives. However, aligning models to serve pluralistic human values remains an open research question. In this piece, we propose a roadmap to pluralistic alignment, specifically using language models as a test bed. We identify and formalize three possible ways to define and operationalize pluralism in AI systems: 1) Overton pluralistic models that present a spectrum of reasonable responses; 2) Steerably pluralistic models that can steer to reflect certain perspectives; and 3) Distributionally pluralistic models that are well-calibrated to a given population in distribution. We also formalize and discuss three possible classes of pluralistic benchmarks: 1) Multi-objective benchmarks, 2) Trade-off steerable benchmarks, which incentivize models to steer to arbitrary trade-offs, and 3) Jury-pluralistic benchmarks which explicitly model diverse human ratings. We use this framework to argue that current alignment techniques may be fundamentally limited for pluralistic AI; indeed, we highlight empirical evidence, both from our own experiments and from other work, that standard alignment procedures might reduce distributional pluralism in models, motivating the need for further research on pluralistic alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05070v3,2024-02
SALAD-Bench: A Hierarchical and Comprehensive Safety Benchmark for Large Language Models,"Lijun Li, Bowen Dong, Ruohui Wang, Xuhao Hu, Wangmeng Zuo, Dahua Lin, Yu Qiao, Jing Shao","In the rapidly evolving landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring robust safety measures is paramount.

How BERT Speaks Shakespearean English? Evaluating Historical Bias in Contextual Language Models,"Miriam Cuscito, Alfio Ferrara, Martin Ruskov","In this paper, we explore the idea of analysing the historical bias of contextual language models based on BERT by measuring their adequacy with respect to Early Modern (EME) and Modern (ME) English. In our preliminary experiments, we perform fill-in-the-blank tests with 60 masked sentences (20 EME-specific, 20 ME-specific and 20 generic) and three different models (i.e., BERT Base, MacBERTh, English HLM). We then rate the model predictions according to a 5-point bipolar scale between the two language varieties and derive a weighted score to measure the adequacy of each model to EME and ME varieties of English.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05034v1,2024-02
Pedagogical Alignment of Large Language Models,"Shashank Sonkar, Kangqi Ni, Sapana Chaudhary, Richard G. Baraniuk","Large Language Models (LLMs), when used in educational settings without pedagogical fine-tuning, often provide immediate answers rather than guiding students through the problem-solving process. This approach falls short of pedagogically best practices and limits their effectiveness as educational tools. We term the objective of training LLMs to emulate effective teaching strategies as `pedagogical alignment.' In this paper, we investigate Learning from Human Preferences (LHP) algorithms to achieve this alignment objective. A key challenge in this process is the scarcity of high-quality preference datasets to guide the alignment. To address this, we propose a novel approach for constructing a large-scale dataset using synthetic data generation techniques, eliminating the need for time-consuming and costly manual annotation. Leveraging this dataset, our experiments with Llama and Mistral models demonstrate that LHP methods outperform standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), improving pedagogical alignment accuracy by 13.1% and 8.7% respectively. Existing evaluation methods also lack quantitative metrics to adequately measure the pedagogical alignment of LLMs. To address this gap, we propose novel perplexity-based metrics that quantify LLMs' tendency to provide scaffolded guidance versus direct answers, offering a robust measure of pedagogical alignment. Our analysis provides compelling evidence for the superiority of LHP methods over SFT in optimizing LLMs' behavior, underscoring the potential of LHP methods in better aligning LLMs with educational objectives and fostering effective learning experiences.

An Enhanced Prompt-Based LLM Reasoning Scheme via Knowledge Graph-Integrated Collaboration,"Yihao Li, Ru Zhang, Jianyi Liu","While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in a multitude of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, they encounter challenges in practical applications, including issues with hallucinations, inadequate knowledge updating, and limited transparency in the reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, this study innovatively proposes a collaborative training-free reasoning scheme involving tight cooperation between Knowledge Graph (KG) and LLMs. This scheme first involves using LLMs to iteratively explore KG, selectively retrieving a task-relevant knowledge subgraph to support reasoning. The LLMs are then guided to further combine inherent implicit knowledge to reason on the subgraph while explicitly elucidating the reasoning process. Through such a cooperative approach, our scheme achieves more reliable knowledge-based reasoning and facilitates the tracing of the reasoning results. Experimental results show that our scheme significantly progressed across multiple datasets, notably achieving over a 10% improvement on the QALD10 dataset compared to the best baseline and the fine-tuned state-of-the-art (SOTA) work. Building on this success, this study hopes to offer a valuable reference for future research in the fusion of KG and LLMs, thereby enhancing LLMs' proficiency in solving complex issues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04978v2,2024-02
Text or Image? What is More Important in Cross-Domain Generalization Capabilities of Hate Meme Detection Models?,"Piush Aggarwal, Jawar Mehrabanian, Weigang Huang, Özge Alacam, Torsten Zesch","This paper delves into the formidable challenge of cross-domain generalization in multimodal hate meme detection, presenting compelling findings. We provide enough pieces of evidence supporting the hypothesis that only the textual component of hateful memes enables the existing multimodal classifier to generalize across different domains, while the image component proves highly sensitive to a specific training dataset. The evidence includes demonstrations showing that hate-text classifiers perform similarly to hate-meme classifiers in a zero-shot setting. Simultaneously, the introduction of captions generated from images of memes to the hate-meme classifier worsens performance by an average F1 of 0.02. Through blackbox explanations, we identify a substantial contribution of the text modality (average of 83%), which diminishes with the introduction of meme's image captions (52%). Additionally, our evaluation on a newly created confounder dataset reveals higher performance on text confounders as compared to image confounders with an average $\Delta$F1 of 0.18.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04967v1,2024-02
Reconfidencing LLMs from the Grouping Loss Perspective,"Lihu Chen, Alexandre Perez-Lebel, Fabian M. Suchanek, Gaël Varoquaux","Large Language Models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and LLaMA, are susceptible to generating hallucinated answers in a confident tone. While efforts to elicit and calibrate confidence scores have proven useful, recent findings show that controlling uncertainty must go beyond calibration: predicted scores may deviate significantly from the actual posterior probabilities due to the impact of grouping loss. In this work, we construct a new evaluation dataset derived from a knowledge base to assess confidence scores given to answers of Mistral and LLaMA. Experiments show that they tend to be overconfident. Further, we show that they are more overconfident on some answers than others, \emph{eg} depending on the nationality of the person in the query. In uncertainty-quantification theory, this is grouping loss. To address this, we propose a solution to reconfidence LLMs, canceling not only calibration but also grouping loss. The LLMs, after the reconfidencing process, indicate improved confidence alignment with the accuracy of their responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04957v3,2024-02
Prompting Implicit Discourse Relation Annotation,"Frances Yung, Mansoor Ahmad, Merel Scholman, Vera Demberg","Pre-trained large language models, such as ChatGPT, archive outstanding performance in various reasoning tasks without supervised training and were found to have outperformed crowdsourcing workers. Nonetheless, ChatGPT's performance in the task of implicit discourse relation classification, prompted by a standard multiple-choice question, is still far from satisfactory and considerably inferior to state-of-the-art supervised approaches. This work investigates several proven prompting techniques to improve ChatGPT's recognition of discourse relations. In particular, we experimented with breaking down the classification task that involves numerous abstract labels into smaller subtasks. Nonetheless, experiment results show that the inference accuracy hardly changes even with sophisticated prompt engineering, suggesting that implicit discourse relation classification is not yet resolvable under zero-shot or few-shot settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04918v1,2024-02
Personalized Text Generation with Fine-Grained Linguistic Control,"Bashar Alhafni, Vivek Kulkarni, Dhruv Kumar, Vipul Raheja","As the text generation capabilities of large language models become increasingly prominent, recent studies have focused on controlling particular aspects of the generated text to make it more personalized. However, most research on controllable text generation focuses on controlling the content or modeling specific high-level/coarse-grained attributes that reflect authors' writing styles, such as formality, domain, or sentiment. In this paper, we focus on controlling fine-grained attributes spanning multiple linguistic dimensions, such as lexical and syntactic attributes. We introduce a novel benchmark to train generative models and evaluate their ability to generate personalized text based on multiple fine-grained linguistic attributes. We systematically investigate the performance of various large language models on our benchmark and draw insights from the factors that impact their performance.

L4Q: Parameter Efficient Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning on Large Language Models,"Hyesung Jeon, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-joon Kim","Due to the high memory and computational costs associated with large language models (LLMs), model compression techniques such as quantization, which reduces inference costs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which reduce training costs, have gained significant popularity. This trend has spurred active research into quantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while minimizing memory overhead during both inference and training. Previous quantization-aware PEFT methods typically apply post-training quantization (PTQ) to pre-trained LLMs, followed by PEFT to recover accuracy loss. Meanwhile, this approach has limitations in recovering the accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with LoRA. By employing a memory-optimized layer design, L4Q significantly reduces QAT's memory overhead, making its training cost comparable to LoRA, while preserving the advantage of QAT in producing fully quantized LLMs with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that this combined approach to quantization and fine-tuning achieves superior accuracy compared to decoupled fine-tuning schemes, particularly in 4-bit and 3-bit quantization, positioning L4Q as an efficient QAT solution. Using the LLaMA and Mistral models with instructional datasets, we showcase L4Q's capabilities in language tasks and few-shot learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04902v5,2024-02
Detecting Generated Native Ads in Conversational Search,"Sebastian Schmidt, Ines Zelch, Janek Bevendorff, Benno Stein, Matthias Hagen, Martin Potthast","Conversational search engines such as YouChat and Microsoft Copilot use large language models (LLMs) to generate responses to queries. It is only a small step to also let the same technology insert ads within the generated responses - instead of separately placing ads next to a response. Inserted ads would be reminiscent of native advertising and product placement, both of which are very effective forms of subtle and manipulative advertising. Considering the high computational costs associated with LLMs, for which providers need to develop sustainable business models, users of conversational search engines may very well be confronted with generated native ads in the near future. In this paper, we thus take a first step to investigate whether LLMs can also be used as a countermeasure, i.e., to block generated native ads. We compile the Webis Generated Native Ads 2024 dataset of queries and generated responses with automatically inserted ads, and evaluate whether LLMs or fine-tuned sentence transformers can detect the ads. In our experiments, the investigated LLMs struggle with the task but sentence transformers achieve precision and recall values above 0.9.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04889v2,2024-02
On Provable Length and Compositional Generalization,"Kartik Ahuja, Amin Mansouri","Out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of sequence-to-sequence models can be studied from the lens of two crucial forms of generalization: length generalization -- the ability to generalize to longer sequences than ones seen during training, and compositional generalization: the ability to generalize to token combinations not seen during training. In this work, we provide first provable guarantees on length and compositional generalization for common sequence-to-sequence models -- deep sets, transformers, state space models, and recurrent neural nets -- trained to minimize the prediction error. We show that limited capacity versions of these different architectures achieve both length and compositional generalization provided the training distribution is sufficiently diverse. In the first part, we study structured limited capacity variants of different architectures and arrive at the generalization guarantees with limited diversity requirements on the training distribution. In the second part, we study limited capacity variants with less structural assumptions and arrive at generalization guarantees but with more diversity requirements on the training distribution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04875v5,2024-02
CodeIt: Self-Improving Language Models with Prioritized Hindsight Replay,"Natasha Butt, Blazej Manczak, Auke Wiggers, Corrado Rainone, David W. Zhang, Michaël Defferrard, Taco Cohen","Large language models are increasingly solving tasks that are commonly believed to require human-level reasoning ability. However, these models still perform very poorly on benchmarks of general intelligence such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). In this paper, we approach ARC as a programming-by-examples problem, and introduce a novel and scalable method for language model self-improvement called Code Iteration (CodeIt). Our method iterates between 1) program sampling and hindsight relabeling, and 2) learning from prioritized experience replay. By relabeling the goal of an episode (i.e., the target program output given input) to the realized output produced by the sampled program, our method effectively deals with the extreme sparsity of rewards in program synthesis. Applying CodeIt to the ARC dataset, we demonstrate that prioritized hindsight replay, along with pre-training and data-augmentation, leads to successful inter-task generalization. CodeIt is the first neuro-symbolic approach that scales to the full ARC evaluation dataset. Our method solves 15% of ARC evaluation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing neural and symbolic baselines.

Hierarchical Tree-structured Knowledge Graph For Academic Insight Survey,"Jinghong Li, Huy Phan, Wen Gu, Koichi Ota, Shinobu Hasegawa","Research surveys have always posed a challenge for beginner researchers who lack of research training. These researchers struggle to understand the directions within their research topic, and the discovery of new research findings within a short time. One way to provide intuitive assistance to beginner researchers is by offering relevant knowledge graphs(KG) and recommending related academic papers. However, existing navigation knowledge graphs primarily rely on keywords in the research field and often fail to present the logical hierarchy among multiple related papers clearly. Moreover, most recommendation systems for academic papers simply rely on high text similarity, which can leave researchers confused as to why a particular article is being recommended. They may lack of grasp important information about the insight connection between ""Issue resolved"" and ""Issue finding"" that they hope to obtain. To address these issues, this study aims to support research insight surveys for beginner researchers by establishing a hierarchical tree-structured knowledge graph that reflects the inheritance insight of research topics and the relevance insight among the academic papers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04854v7,2024-02

"Guiding LLMs The Right Way: Fast, Non-Invasive Constrained Generation","Luca Beurer-Kellner, Marc Fischer, Martin Vechev","To ensure that text generated by large language models (LLMs) is in an expected format, constrained decoding proposes to enforce strict formal language constraints during generation. However, as we show in this work, not only do such methods incur performance overhead during generation, but many of them also significantly impair task accuracy, if they do not correctly align the underlying LLM sub-word vocabularies with external constraints. To address this, we present a novel decoding algorithm, DOMINO, that can enforce constraints in a fully subword-aligned fashion, while leveraging pre-computation and speculative decoding to achieve virtually no overhead and in some cases even almost 2$\times$ speedup over unconstrained decoding -- thereby outperforming existing approaches by a wide margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06988v1,2024-02
Long Is More for Alignment: A Simple but Tough-to-Beat Baseline for Instruction Fine-Tuning,"Hao Zhao, Maksym Andriushchenko, Francesco Croce, Nicolas Flammarion","There is a consensus that instruction fine-tuning of LLMs requires high-quality data, but what are they? LIMA (NeurIPS 2023) and AlpaGasus (ICLR 2024) are state-of-the-art methods for selecting such high-quality examples, either via manual curation or using GPT-3.5-Turbo as a quality scorer. We show that the extremely simple baseline of selecting the 1,000 instructions with longest responses -- that intuitively contain more learnable information and are harder to overfit -- from standard datasets can consistently outperform these sophisticated methods according to GPT-4 and PaLM-2 as judges, while remaining competitive on the Open LLM benchmarks that test factual knowledge. We demonstrate this for several LLMs (Llama-2-7B, Llama-2-13B, Mistral-7B-v0.1) and datasets (Alpaca-52k, Evol-Instruct-70k). In addition, a lightweight refinement of such long instructions can further improve the abilities of the fine-tuned LLMs, and allows us to obtain competitive results on MT-Bench and the 2nd highest-ranked Llama-2-7B-based model on AlpacaEval 2.0, while training on only 1,000 examples and no extra preference data. We also conduct a thorough analysis of our models to ensure that their enhanced performance is not simply due to GPT-4's preference for longer responses. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-tuning on the longest responses should be the default baseline for any work on instruction fine-tuning.

In this work we evaluate the adaptability of neural artificial agents towards assumed partner behaviors in a collaborative reference game. In this game success is achieved when a knowledgeable Guide can verbally lead a Follower to the selection of a specific puzzle piece among several distractors. We frame this language grounding and coordination task as a reinforcement learning problem and measure to which extent a common reinforcement training algorithm (PPO) is able to produce neural agents (the Guides) that perform well with various heuristic Follower behaviors that vary along the dimensions of confidence and autonomy. We experiment with a learning signal that in addition to the goal condition also respects an assumed communicative effort. Our results indicate that this novel ingredient leads to communicative strategies that are less verbose (staying silent in some of the steps) and that with respect to that the Guide's strategies indeed adapt to the partner's level of confidence and autonomy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04824v1,2024-02
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis for Open-Ended HR Survey Responses,"Lois Rink, Job Meijdam, David Graus","Understanding preferences, opinions, and sentiment of the workforce is paramount for effective employee lifecycle management. Open-ended survey responses serve as a valuable source of information. This paper proposes a machine learning approach for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) of Dutch open-ended responses in employee satisfaction surveys. Our approach aims to overcome the inherent noise and variability in these responses, enabling a comprehensive analysis of sentiments that can support employee lifecycle management. Through response clustering we identify six key aspects (salary, schedule, contact, communication, personal attention, agreements), which we validate by domain experts. We compile a dataset of 1,458 Dutch survey responses, revealing label imbalance in aspects and sentiments. We propose few-shot approaches for ABSA based on Dutch BERT models, and compare them against bag-of-words and zero-shot baselines. Our work significantly contributes to the field of ABSA by demonstrating the first successful application of Dutch pre-trained language models to aspect-based sentiment analysis in the domain of human resources (HR).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04812v1,2024-02
Direct Language Model Alignment from Online AI Feedback,"Shangmin Guo, Biao Zhang, Tianlin Liu, Tianqi Liu, Misha Khalman, Felipe Llinares, Alexandre Rame, Thomas Mesnard, Yao Zhao, Bilal Piot, Johan Ferret, Mathieu Blondel","Direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods, such as DPO, have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), that do not require a separate reward model. However, the preference datasets used in DAP methods are usually collected ahead of training and never updated, thus the feedback is purely offline. Moreover, responses in these datasets are often sampled from a language model distinct from the one being aligned, and since the model evolves over training, the alignment phase is inevitably off-policy. In this study, we posit that online feedback is key and improves DAP methods. Our method, online AI feedback (OAIF), uses an LLM as annotator: on each training iteration, we sample two responses from the current model and prompt the LLM annotator to choose which one is preferred, thus providing online feedback. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate via human evaluation in several tasks that OAIF outperforms both offline DAP and RLHF methods. We further show that the feedback leveraged in OAIF is easily controllable, via instruction prompts to the LLM annotator.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04792v2,2024-02
MLLM-as-a-Judge: Assessing Multimodal LLM-as-a-Judge with Vision-Language Benchmark,"Dongping Chen, Ruoxi Chen, Shilin Zhang, Yinuo Liu, Yaochen Wang, Huichi Zhou, Qihui Zhang, Yao Wan, Pan Zhou, Lichao Sun","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention recently, showing remarkable potential in artificial general intelligence. However, assessing the utility of MLLMs presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the absence of multimodal benchmarks that align with human preferences. Drawing inspiration from the concept of LLM-as-a-Judge within LLMs, this paper introduces a novel benchmark, termed MLLM-as-a-Judge, to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting judges across diverse modalities, encompassing three distinct tasks: Scoring Evaluation, Pair Comparison, and Batch Ranking. Our study reveals that, while MLLMs demonstrate remarkable human-like discernment in Pair Comparison, there is a significant divergence from human preferences in Scoring Evaluation and Batch Ranking. Furthermore, a closer examination reveals persistent challenges in the judgment capacities of LLMs, including diverse biases, hallucinatory responses, and inconsistencies in judgment, even in advanced models such as GPT-4V. These findings emphasize the pressing need for enhancements and further research efforts to be undertaken before regarding MLLMs as fully reliable evaluators. In light of this, we advocate for additional efforts dedicated to supporting the continuous development within the domain of MLLM functioning as judges.

A Hypothesis-Driven Framework for the Analysis of Self-Rationalising Models,"Marc Braun, Jenny Kunz","The self-rationalising capabilities of LLMs are appealing because the generated explanations can give insights into the plausibility of the predictions. However, how faithful the explanations are to the predictions is questionable, raising the need to explore the patterns behind them further. To this end, we propose a hypothesis-driven statistical framework. We use a Bayesian network to implement a hypothesis about how a task (in our example, natural language inference) is solved, and its internal states are translated into natural language with templates. Those explanations are then compared to LLM-generated free-text explanations using automatic and human evaluations. This allows us to judge how similar the LLM's and the Bayesian network's decision processes are. We demonstrate the usage of our framework with an example hypothesis and two realisations in Bayesian networks. The resulting models do not exhibit a strong similarity to GPT-3.5. We discuss the implications of this as well as the framework's potential to approximate LLM decisions better in future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04787v1,2024-02
StableMask: Refining Causal Masking in Decoder-only Transformer,"Qingyu Yin, Xuzheng He, Xiang Zhuang, Yu Zhao, Jianhua Yao, Xiaoyu Shen, Qiang Zhang","The decoder-only Transformer architecture with causal masking and relative position encoding (RPE) has become the de facto choice in language modeling. Despite its exceptional performance across various tasks, we have identified two limitations: First, it requires all attention scores to be non-zero and sum up to 1, even if the current embedding has sufficient self-contained information. This compels the model to assign disproportional excessive attention to specific tokens. Second, RPE-based Transformers are not universal approximators due to their limited capacity at encoding absolute positional information, which limits their application in position-critical tasks. In this work, we propose StableMask: a parameter-free method to address both limitations by refining the causal mask. It introduces pseudo-attention values to balance attention distributions and encodes absolute positional information via a progressively decreasing mask ratio. StableMask's effectiveness is validated both theoretically and empirically, showing significant enhancements in language models with parameter sizes ranging from 71M to 1.4B across diverse datasets and encoding methods. We further show that it naturally supports (1) efficient extrapolation without special tricks such as StreamingLLM and (2) easy integration with existing attention optimization techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04779v1,2024-02
ApiQ: Finetuning of 2-Bit Quantized Large Language Model,"Baohao Liao, Christian Herold, Shahram Khadivi, Christof Monz","Memory-efficient finetuning of large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted huge attention with the increasing size of LLMs, primarily due to the constraints posed by GPU memory limitations and the effectiveness of these methods compared to full finetuning. Despite the advancements, current strategies for memory-efficient finetuning, such as QLoRA, exhibit inconsistent performance across diverse bit-width quantizations and multifaceted tasks. This inconsistency largely stems from the detrimental impact of the quantization process on preserved knowledge, leading to catastrophic forgetting and undermining the utilization of pretrained models for finetuning purposes. In this work, we introduce a novel quantization framework, ApiQ, designed to restore the lost information from quantization by concurrently initializing the LoRA components and quantizing the weights of LLMs. This approach ensures the maintenance of the original LLM's activation precision while mitigating the error propagation from shallower into deeper layers. Through comprehensive evaluations conducted on a spectrum of language tasks with various LLMs, ApiQ demonstrably minimizes activation error during quantization. Consequently, it consistently achieves superior finetuning results across various bit-widths.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05147v3,2024-02
FaithLM: Towards Faithful Explanations for Large Language Models,"Yu-Neng Chuang, Guanchu Wang, Chia-Yuan Chang, Ruixiang Tang, Shaochen Zhong, Fan Yang, Mengnan Du, Xuanting Cai, Xia Hu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become proficient in addressing complex tasks by leveraging their extensive internal knowledge and reasoning capabilities. However, the black-box nature of these models complicates the task of explaining their decision-making processes. While recent advancements demonstrate the potential of leveraging LLMs to self-explain their predictions through natural language (NL) explanations, their explanations may not accurately reflect the LLMs' decision-making process due to a lack of fidelity optimization on the derived explanations. Measuring the fidelity of NL explanations is a challenging issue, as it is difficult to manipulate the input context to mask the semantics of these explanations. To this end, we introduce FaithLM to explain the decision of LLMs with NL explanations. Specifically, FaithLM designs a method for evaluating the fidelity of NL explanations by incorporating the contrary explanations to the query process. Moreover, FaithLM conducts an iterative process to improve the fidelity of derived explanations. Experiment results on three datasets from multiple domains demonstrate that FaithLM can significantly improve the fidelity of derived explanations, which also provides a better alignment with the ground-truth explanations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04678v3,2024-02
Source Identification in Abstractive Summarization,"Yoshi Suhara, Dimitris Alikaniotis","Neural abstractive summarization models make summaries in an end-to-end manner, and little is known about how the source information is actually converted into summaries. In this paper, we define input sentences that contain essential information in the generated summary as $\textit{source sentences}$ and study how abstractive summaries are made by analyzing the source sentences. To this end, we annotate source sentences for reference summaries and system summaries generated by PEGASUS on document-summary pairs sampled from the CNN/DailyMail and XSum datasets. We also formulate automatic source sentence detection and compare multiple methods to establish a strong baseline for the task. Experimental results show that the perplexity-based method performs well in highly abstractive settings, while similarity-based methods perform robustly in relatively extractive settings.

TransLLaMa: LLM-based Simultaneous Translation System,"Roman Koshkin, Katsuhito Sudoh, Satoshi Nakamura","Decoder-only large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in text generation and reasoning. Nonetheless, they have limited applications in simultaneous machine translation (SiMT), currently dominated by encoder-decoder transformers. This study demonstrates that, after fine-tuning on a small dataset comprising causally aligned source and target sentence pairs, a pre-trained open-source LLM can control input segmentation directly by generating a special ""wait"" token. This obviates the need for a separate policy and enables the LLM to perform English-German and English-Russian SiMT tasks with BLEU scores that are comparable to those of specific state-of-the-art baselines. We also evaluated closed-source models such as GPT-4, which displayed encouraging results in performing the SiMT task without prior training (zero-shot), indicating a promising avenue for enhancing future SiMT systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04636v1,2024-02
The Future of Cognitive Strategy-enhanced Persuasive Dialogue Agents: New Perspectives and Trends,"Mengqi Chen, Bin Guo, Hao Wang, Haoyu Li, Qian Zhao, Jingqi Liu, Yasan Ding, Yan Pan, Zhiwen Yu","Persuasion, as one of the crucial abilities in human communication, has garnered extensive attention from researchers within the field of intelligent dialogue systems. We humans tend to persuade others to change their viewpoints, attitudes or behaviors through conversations in various scenarios (e.g., persuasion for social good, arguing in online platforms). Developing dialogue agents that can persuade others to accept certain standpoints is essential to achieving truly intelligent and anthropomorphic dialogue system. Benefiting from the substantial progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), dialogue agents have acquired an exceptional capability in context understanding and response generation. However, as a typical and complicated cognitive psychological system, persuasive dialogue agents also require knowledge from the domain of cognitive psychology to attain a level of human-like persuasion. Consequently, the cognitive strategy-enhanced persuasive dialogue agent (defined as CogAgent), which incorporates cognitive strategies to achieve persuasive targets through conversation, has become a predominant research paradigm. To depict the research trends of CogAgent, in this paper, we first present several fundamental cognitive psychology theories and give the formalized definition of three typical cognitive strategies, including the persuasion strategy, the topic path planning strategy, and the argument structure prediction strategy. Then we propose a new system architecture by incorporating the formalized definition to lay the foundation of CogAgent. Representative works are detailed and investigated according to the combined cognitive strategy, followed by the summary of authoritative benchmarks and evaluation metrics. Finally, we summarize our insights on open issues and future directions of CogAgent for upcoming researchers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04631v1,2024-02
SPARQL Generation: an analysis on fine-tuning OpenLLaMA for Question Answering over a Life Science Knowledge Graph,"Julio C. Rangel, Tarcisio Mendes de Farias, Ana Claudia Sima, Norio Kobayashi","The recent success of Large Language Models (LLM) in a wide range of Natural Language Processing applications opens the path towards novel Question Answering Systems over Knowledge Graphs leveraging LLMs. However, one of the main obstacles preventing their implementation is the scarcity of training data for the task of translating questions into corresponding SPARQL queries, particularly in the case of domain-specific KGs. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we evaluate several strategies for fine-tuning the OpenLlama LLM for question answering over life science knowledge graphs. In particular, we propose an end-to-end data augmentation approach for extending a set of existing queries over a given knowledge graph towards a larger dataset of semantically enriched question-to-SPARQL query pairs, enabling fine-tuning even for datasets where these pairs are scarce. In this context, we also investigate the role of semantic ""clues"" in the queries, such as meaningful variable names and inline comments. Finally, we evaluate our approach over the real-world Bgee gene expression knowledge graph and we show that semantic clues can improve model performance by up to 33% compared to a baseline with random variable names and no comments included.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04627v1,2024-02

We aim to build models containing a considerable portion of self-updatable parameters, enabling the model to integrate new knowledge effectively and efficiently. To this end, we introduce MEMORYLLM, a model that comprises a transformer and a fixed-size memory pool within the latent space of the transformer. MEMORYLLM can self-update with text knowledge and memorize the knowledge injected earlier. Our evaluations demonstrate the ability of MEMORYLLM to effectively incorporate new knowledge, as evidenced by its performance on model editing benchmarks. Meanwhile, the model exhibits long-term information retention capacity, which is validated through our custom-designed evaluations and long-context benchmarks.

InfLLM: Training-Free Long-Context Extrapolation for LLMs with an Efficient Context Memory,"Chaojun Xiao, Pengle Zhang, Xu Han, Guangxuan Xiao, Yankai Lin, Zhengyan Zhang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a cornerstone in real-world applications with lengthy streaming inputs (e.g., LLM-driven agents). However, existing LLMs, pre-trained on sequences with a restricted maximum length, cannot process longer sequences due to the out-of-domain and distraction issues. Common solutions often involve continual pre-training on longer sequences, which will introduce expensive computational overhead and uncontrollable change in model capabilities. In this paper, we unveil the intrinsic capacity of LLMs for understanding extremely long sequences without any fine-tuning. To this end, we introduce a training-free memory-based method, InfLLM. Specifically, InfLLM stores distant contexts into additional memory units and employs an efficient mechanism to lookup token-relevant units for attention computation. Thereby, InfLLM allows LLMs to efficiently process long sequences with a limited context window and well capture long-distance dependencies. Without any training, InfLLM enables LLMs that are pre-trained on sequences consisting of a few thousand tokens to achieve comparable performance with competitive baselines that continually train these LLMs on long sequences. Even when the sequence length is scaled to $1,024$K, InfLLM still effectively captures long-distance dependencies.

Beyond Answers: Transferring Reasoning Capabilities to Smaller LLMs Using Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation,"Yijun Tian, Yikun Han, Xiusi Chen, Wei Wang, Nitesh V. Chawla","Transferring the reasoning capability from stronger large language models (LLMs) to smaller ones has been quite appealing, as smaller LLMs are more flexible to deploy with less expense. Among the existing solutions, knowledge distillation stands out due to its outstanding efficiency and generalization. However, existing methods suffer from several drawbacks, including limited knowledge diversity and the lack of rich contextual information. To solve the problems and facilitate the learning of compact language models, we propose TinyLLM, a new knowledge distillation paradigm to learn a small student LLM from multiple large teacher LLMs. In particular, we encourage the student LLM to not only generate the correct answers but also understand the rationales behind these answers. Given that different LLMs possess diverse reasoning skills, we guide the student model to assimilate knowledge from various teacher LLMs. We further introduce an in-context example generator and a teacher-forcing Chain-of-Thought strategy to ensure that the rationales are accurate and grounded in contextually appropriate scenarios. Extensive experiments on six datasets across two reasoning tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. Results show that TinyLLM can outperform large teacher LLMs significantly, despite a considerably smaller model size.

Faithfulness vs. Plausibility: On the (Un)Reliability of Explanations from Large Language Models,"Chirag Agarwal, Sree Harsha Tanneru, Himabindu Lakkaraju","Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as powerful tools for several natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent works show that modern LLMs can generate self-explanations (SEs), which elicit their intermediate reasoning steps for explaining their behavior. Self-explanations have seen widespread adoption owing to their conversational and plausible nature. However, there is little to no understanding of their faithfulness. In this work, we discuss the dichotomy between faithfulness and plausibility in SEs generated by LLMs. We argue that while LLMs are adept at generating plausible explanations -- seemingly logical and coherent to human users -- these explanations do not necessarily align with the reasoning processes of the LLMs, raising concerns about their faithfulness. We highlight that the current trend towards increasing the plausibility of explanations, primarily driven by the demand for user-friendly interfaces, may come at the cost of diminishing their faithfulness. We assert that the faithfulness of explanations is critical in LLMs employed for high-stakes decision-making. Moreover, we emphasize the need for a systematic characterization of faithfulness-plausibility requirements of different real-world applications and ensure explanations meet those needs. While there are several approaches to improving plausibility, improving faithfulness is an open challenge. We call upon the community to develop novel methods to enhance the faithfulness of self explanations thereby enabling transparent deployment of LLMs in diverse high-stakes settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04614v3,2024-02
Improving Cross-Domain Low-Resource Text Generation through LLM Post-Editing: A Programmer-Interpreter Approach,"Zhuang Li, Levon Haroutunian, Raj Tumuluri, Philip Cohen, Gholamreza Haffari","Post-editing has proven effective in improving the quality of text generated by large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, particularly when direct updating of their parameters to enhance text quality is infeasible or expensive. However, relying solely on smaller language models for post-editing can limit the LLMs' ability to generalize across domains. Moreover, the editing strategies in these methods are not optimally designed for text-generation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a neural programmer-interpreter approach that preserves the domain generalization ability of LLMs when editing their output. The editing actions in this framework are specifically devised for text generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the programmer-interpreter significantly enhances GPT-3.5's performance in logical form-to-text conversion and low-resource machine translation, surpassing other state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM post-editing methods in cross-domain settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04609v1,2024-02
Alirector: Alignment-Enhanced Chinese Grammatical Error Corrector,"Haihui Yang, Xiaojun Quan","Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) faces serious overcorrection challenges when employing autoregressive generative models such as sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models and decoder-only large language models (LLMs). While previous methods aim to address overcorrection in Seq2Seq models, they are difficult to adapt to decoder-only LLMs. In this paper, we propose an alignment-enhanced corrector for the overcorrection problem that applies to both Seq2Seq models and decoder-only LLMs. Our method first trains a correction model to generate an initial correction of the source sentence. Then, we combine the source sentence with the initial correction and feed it through an alignment model for another round of correction, aiming to enforce the alignment model to focus on potential overcorrection. Moreover, to enhance the model's ability to identify nuances, we further explore the reverse alignment of the source sentence and the initial correction. Finally, we transfer the alignment knowledge from two alignment models to the correction model, instructing it on how to avoid overcorrection. Experimental results on three CGEC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in alleviating overcorrection and improving overall performance.

Nevertheless, the majority of studies primarily concentrate on English, with only limited exploration into the realm of multilingual abilities. In this work, we therefore construct an open-source multilingual supervised fine-tuning dataset. Different from previous works that simply translate English instructions, we consider both the language-specific and language-agnostic abilities of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a knowledge-grounded data augmentation approach to elicit more language-specific knowledge of LLMs, improving their ability to serve users from different countries. Moreover, we find modern LLMs possess strong cross-lingual transfer capabilities, thus repeatedly learning identical content in various languages is not necessary. Consequently, we can substantially prune the language-agnostic supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data without any performance degradation, making multilingual SFT more efficient. The resulting UltraLink dataset comprises approximately 1 million samples across five languages (i.e., En, Zh, Ru, Fr, Es), and the proposed data construction method can be easily extended to other languages. UltraLink-LM, which is trained on UltraLink, outperforms several representative baselines across many tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04588v2,2024-02
Can Large Language Model Agents Simulate Human Trust Behavior?,"Chengxing Xie, Canyu Chen, Feiran Jia, Ziyu Ye, Shiyang Lai, Kai Shu, Jindong Gu, Adel Bibi, Ziniu Hu, David Jurgens, James Evans, Philip Torr, Bernard Ghanem, Guohao Li","Large Language Model (LLM) agents have been increasingly adopted as simulation tools to model humans in social science and role-playing applications. However, one fundamental question remains: can LLM agents really simulate human behavior? In this paper, we focus on one critical and elemental behavior in human interactions, trust, and investigate whether LLM agents can simulate human trust behavior. We first find that LLM agents generally exhibit trust behavior, referred to as agent trust, under the framework of Trust Games, which are widely recognized in behavioral economics. Then, we discover that GPT-4 agents manifest high behavioral alignment with humans in terms of trust behavior, indicating the feasibility of simulating human trust behavior with LLM agents. In addition, we probe the biases of agent trust and differences in agent trust towards other LLM agents and humans. We also explore the intrinsic properties of agent trust under conditions including external manipulations and advanced reasoning strategies. Our study provides new insights into the behaviors of LLM agents and the fundamental analogy between LLMs and humans beyond value alignment. We further illustrate broader implications of our discoveries for applications where trust is paramount.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04559v4,2024-02
Share What You Already Know: Cross-Language-Script Transfer and Alignment for Sentiment Detection in Code-Mixed Data,"Niraj Pahari, Kazutaka Shimada","Code-switching entails mixing multiple languages. It is an increasingly occurring phenomenon in social media texts. Usually, code-mixed texts are written in a single script, even though the languages involved have different scripts. Pre-trained multilingual models primarily utilize the data in the native script of the language. In existing studies, the code-switched texts are utilized as they are. However, using the native script for each language can generate better representations of the text owing to the pre-trained knowledge. Therefore, a cross-language-script knowledge sharing architecture utilizing the cross attention and alignment of the representations of text in individual language scripts was proposed in this study. Experimental results on two different datasets containing Nepali-English and Hindi-English code-switched texts, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The interpretation of the model using model explainability technique illustrates the sharing of language-specific knowledge between language-specific representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04542v1,2024-02

Online Cascade Learning for Efficient Inference over Streams,"Lunyiu Nie, Zhimin Ding, Erdong Hu, Christopher Jermaine, Swarat Chaudhuri","Large Language Models (LLMs) have a natural role in answering complex queries about data streams, but the high computational cost of LLM inference makes them infeasible in many such tasks. We propose online cascade learning, the first approach to address this challenge. The objective here is to learn a ""cascade"" of models, starting with lower-capacity models (such as logistic regression) and ending with a powerful LLM, along with a deferral policy that determines the model to be used on a given input. We formulate the task of learning cascades online as an imitation-learning problem, where smaller models are updated over time imitating the collected LLM demonstrations, and give a no-regret algorithm for the problem. Experimental results across four benchmarks show that our method parallels LLMs in accuracy while cutting down inference costs by as much as 90% with strong robustness against input distribution shifts, underscoring its efficacy and adaptability in stream processing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04513v3,2024-02
Developments in Sheaf-Theoretic Models of Natural Language Ambiguities,"Kin Ian Lo, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, Shane Mansfield","Sheaves are mathematical objects consisting of a base which constitutes a topological space and the data associated with each open set thereof, e.g. continuous functions defined on the open sets. Sheaves have originally been used in algebraic topology and logic. Recently, they have also modelled events such as physical experiments and natural language disambiguation processes. We extend the latter models from lexical ambiguities to discourse ambiguities arising from anaphora. To begin, we calculated a new measure of contextuality for a dataset of basic anaphoric discourses, resulting in a higher proportion of contextual models-82.9%-compared to previous work which only yielded 3.17% contextual models. Then, we show how an extension of the natural language processing challenge, known as the Winograd Schema, which involves anaphoric ambiguities can be modelled on the Bell-CHSH scenario with a contextual fraction of 0.096.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04505v2,2024-02
The Fine-Grained Complexity of Gradient Computation for Training Large Language Models,"Josh Alman, Zhao Song","Large language models (LLMs) have made fundamental contributions over the last a few years. To train an LLM, one needs to alternatingly run `forward' computations and `backward' computations. The forward computation can be viewed as attention function evaluation, and the backward computation can be viewed as a gradient computation. In previous work by [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023], it was proved that the forward step can be performed in almost-linear time in certain parameter regimes, but that there is no truly sub-quadratic time algorithm in the remaining parameter regimes unless the popular hypothesis SETH is false. In this work, we show nearly identical results for the harder-seeming problem of computing the gradient of loss function of one layer attention network, and thus for the entire process of LLM training. This completely characterizes the fine-grained complexity of every step of LLM training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04497v1,2024-02
ColorSwap: A Color and Word Order Dataset for Multimodal Evaluation,"Jirayu Burapacheep, Ishan Gaur, Agam Bhatia, Tristan Thrush","This paper introduces the ColorSwap dataset, designed to assess and improve the proficiency of multimodal models in matching objects with their colors. The dataset is comprised of 2,000 unique image-caption pairs, grouped into 1,000 examples. Each example includes a caption-image pair, along with a ``color-swapped'' pair. We follow the Winoground schema: the two captions in an example have the same words, but the color words have been rearranged to modify different objects. The dataset was created through a novel blend of automated caption and image generation with humans in the loop. We evaluate image-text matching (ITM) and visual language models (VLMs) and find that even the latest ones are still not robust at this task. GPT-4V and LLaVA score 72% and 42% on our main VLM metric, although they may improve with more advanced prompting techniques. On the main ITM metric, contrastive models such as CLIP and SigLIP perform close to chance (at 12% and 30%, respectively), although the non-contrastive BLIP ITM model is stronger (87%). We also find that finetuning on fewer than 2,000 examples yields significant performance gains on this out-of-distribution word-order understanding task.

Detecting Mode Collapse in Language Models via Narration,Sil Hamilton,"No two authors write alike. Personal flourishes invoked in written narratives, from lexicon to rhetorical devices, imply a particular author--what literary theorists label the implied or virtual author; distinct from the real author or narrator of a text. Early large language models trained on unfiltered training sets drawn from a variety of discordant sources yielded incoherent personalities, problematic for conversational tasks but proving useful for sampling literature from multiple perspectives. Successes in alignment research in recent years have allowed researchers to impose subjectively consistent personae on language models via instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), but whether aligned models retain the ability to model an arbitrary virtual author has received little scrutiny. By studying 4,374 stories sampled from three OpenAI language models, we show successive versions of GPT-3 suffer from increasing degrees of ""mode collapse"" whereby overfitting the model during alignment constrains it from generalizing over authorship: models suffering from mode collapse become unable to assume a multiplicity of perspectives. Our method and results are significant for researchers seeking to employ language models in sociological simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04477v1,2024-02
Dual-View Visual Contextualization for Web Navigation,"Jihyung Kil, Chan Hee Song, Boyuan Zheng, Xiang Deng, Yu Su, Wei-Lun Chao","Automatic web navigation aims to build a web agent that can follow language instructions to execute complex and diverse tasks on real-world websites. Existing work primarily takes HTML documents as input, which define the contents and action spaces (i.e., actionable elements and operations) of webpages. Nevertheless, HTML documents may not provide a clear task-related context for each element, making it hard to select the right (sequence of) actions. In this paper, we propose to contextualize HTML elements through their ""dual views"" in webpage screenshots: each HTML element has its corresponding bounding box and visual content in the screenshot. We build upon the insight -- web developers tend to arrange task-related elements nearby on webpages to enhance user experiences -- and propose to contextualize each element with its neighbor elements, using both textual and visual features. The resulting representations of HTML elements are more informative for the agent to take action. We validate our method on the recently released Mind2Web dataset, which features diverse navigation domains and tasks on real-world websites. Our method consistently outperforms the baseline in all the scenarios, including cross-task, cross-website, and cross-domain ones.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04476v2,2024-02
Evaluating Embeddings for One-Shot Classification of Doctor-AI Consultations,"Olumide Ebenezer Ojo, Olaronke Oluwayemisi Adebanji, Alexander Gelbukh, Hiram Calvo, Anna Feldman","Effective communication between healthcare providers and patients is crucial to providing high-quality patient care. In this work, we investigate how Doctor-written and AI-generated texts in healthcare consultations can be classified using state-of-the-art embeddings and one-shot classification systems. By analyzing embeddings such as bag-of-words, character n-grams, Word2Vec, GloVe, fastText, and GPT2 embeddings, we examine how well our one-shot classification systems capture semantic information within medical consultations. Results show that the embeddings are capable of capturing semantic features from text in a reliable and adaptable manner. Overall, Word2Vec, GloVe and Character n-grams embeddings performed well, indicating their suitability for modeling targeted to this task. GPT2 embedding also shows notable performance, indicating its suitability for models tailored to this task as well. Our machine learning architectures significantly improved the quality of health conversations when training data are scarce, improving communication between patients and healthcare providers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04442v1,2024-02
Learning to Extract Structured Entities Using Language Models,"Haolun Wu, Ye Yuan, Liana Mikaelyan, Alexander Meulemans, Xue Liu, James Hensman, Bhaskar Mitra","Recent advances in machine learning have significantly impacted the field of information extraction, with Language Models (LMs) playing a pivotal role in extracting structured information from unstructured text. Prior works typically represent information extraction as triplet-centric and use classical metrics such as precision and recall for evaluation. We reformulate the task to be entity-centric, enabling the use of diverse metrics that can provide more insights from various perspectives. We contribute to the field by introducing Structured Entity Extraction and proposing the Approximate Entity Set OverlaP (AESOP) metric, designed to appropriately assess model performance. Later, we introduce a new Multistage Structured Entity Extraction (MuSEE) model that harnesses the power of LMs for enhanced effectiveness and efficiency by decomposing the extraction task into multiple stages. Quantitative and human side-by-side evaluations confirm that our model outperforms baselines, offering promising directions for future advancements in structured entity extraction.

DFA-RAG: Conversational Semantic Router for Large Language Model with Definite Finite Automaton,"Yiyou Sun, Junjie Hu, Wei Cheng, Haifeng Chen","This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented large language model with Definite Finite Automaton (DFA-RAG), a novel framework designed to enhance the capabilities of conversational agents using large language models (LLMs). Traditional LLMs face challenges in generating regulated and compliant responses in special scenarios with predetermined response guidelines, like emotional support and customer service. Our framework addresses these challenges by embedding a Definite Finite Automaton (DFA), learned from training dialogues, within the LLM. This structured approach acts as a semantic router which enables the LLM to adhere to a deterministic response pathway. The routing is achieved by the retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) strategy, which carefully selects dialogue examples aligned with the current conversational context. The advantages of DFA-RAG include an interpretable structure through human-readable DFA, context-aware retrieval for responses in conversations, and plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs. Extensive benchmarks validate DFA-RAG's effectiveness, indicating its potential as a valuable contribution to the conversational agent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04411v2,2024-02
Democratizing Large Language Models via Personalized Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning,"Zhaoxuan Tan, Qingkai Zeng, Yijun Tian, Zheyuan Liu, Bing Yin, Meng Jiang","Personalization in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly important, aiming to align the LLMs' interactions, content, and recommendations with individual user preferences. Recent advances have highlighted effective prompt design by enriching user queries with non-parametric knowledge through behavior history retrieval and textual profiles. However, these methods faced limitations due to a lack of model ownership, resulting in constrained customization and privacy issues, and often failed to capture complex, dynamic user behavior patterns. To address these shortcomings, we introduce One PEFT Per User (OPPU), employing personalized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules to store user-specific behavior patterns and preferences. By plugging in personal PEFT parameters, users can own and use their LLMs individually. OPPU integrates parametric user knowledge in the personal PEFT parameters with non-parametric knowledge from retrieval and profiles, adapting LLMs to user behavior shifts. Experimental results demonstrate that OPPU significantly outperforms existing prompt-based methods across seven diverse tasks in the LaMP benchmark. Further studies reveal OPPU's enhanced capabilities in handling user behavior shifts, modeling users at different activity levels, maintaining robustness across various user history formats, and displaying versatility with different PEFT methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04401v2,2024-02
QuIP#: Even Better LLM Quantization with Hadamard Incoherence and Lattice Codebooks,"Albert Tseng, Jerry Chee, Qingyao Sun, Volodymyr Kuleshov, Christopher De Sa","Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint of LLMs by quantizing their weights to low-precision. In this work, we introduce QuIP#, a weight-only PTQ method that achieves state-of-the-art results in extreme compression regimes ($\le$ 4 bits per weight) using three novel techniques. First, QuIP# improves QuIP's (Chee et al., 2023) incoherence processing by using the randomized Hadamard transform, which is faster and has better theoretical properties. Second, QuIP# uses vector quantization to take advantage of the ball-shaped sub-Gaussian distribution that incoherent weights possess: specifically, we introduce a set of hardware-efficient codebooks based on the highly symmetric $E_8$ lattice, which achieves the optimal 8-dimension unit ball packing. Third, QuIP# uses fine-tuning to improve fidelity to the original model. Our experiments show that QuIP# outperforms existing PTQ methods, enables new behaviors in PTQ scaling, and supports fast inference.

Monitoring the evolution of antisemitic discourse on extremist social media using BERT,"Raza Ul Mustafa, Nathalie Japkowicz","Racism and intolerance on social media contribute to a toxic online environment which may spill offline to foster hatred, and eventually lead to physical violence. That is the case with online antisemitism, the specific category of hatred considered in this study. Tracking antisemitic themes and their associated terminology over time in online discussions could help monitor the sentiments of their participants and their evolution, and possibly offer avenues for intervention that may prevent the escalation of hatred. Due to the large volume and constant evolution of online traffic, monitoring conversations manually is impractical. Instead, we propose an automated method that extracts antisemitic themes and terminology from extremist social media over time and captures their evolution. Since supervised learning would be too limited for such a task, we created an unsupervised online machine learning approach that uses large language models to assess the contextual similarity of posts. The method clusters similar posts together, dividing, and creating additional clusters over time when sub-themes emerge from existing ones or new themes appear. The antisemitic terminology used within each theme is extracted from the posts in each cluster. Our experiments show that our methodology outperforms existing baselines and demonstrates the kind of themes and sub-themes it discovers within antisemitic discourse along with their associated terminology. We believe that our approach will be useful for monitoring the evolution of all kinds of hatred beyond antisemitism on social platforms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05548v1,2024-02
The World of Generative AI: Deepfakes and Large Language Models,"Alakananda Mitra, Saraju P. Mohanty, Elias Kougianos","We live in the era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Deepfakes and Large Language Models (LLMs) are two examples of GenAI. Deepfakes, in particular, pose an alarming threat to society as they are capable of spreading misinformation and changing the truth. LLMs are powerful language models that generate general-purpose language. However due to its generative aspect, it can also be a risk for people if used with ill intentions.

Tag-LLM: Repurposing General-Purpose LLMs for Specialized Domains,"Junhong Shen, Neil Tenenholtz, James Brian Hall, David Alvarez-Melis, Nicolo Fusi","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM's embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM's performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05140v3,2024-02
The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax Mimicry,"Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher Ré","Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency, reducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This holds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2) ""finetuned-conversion"" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that recover task performance, and (3) ""pretrained-conversion"" of Transformers such as large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks. However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or ""spiky"") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for 125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04347v1,2024-02
LegalLens: Leveraging LLMs for Legal Violation Identification in Unstructured Text,"Dor Bernsohn, Gil Semo, Yaron Vazana, Gila Hayat, Ben Hagag, Joel Niklaus, Rohit Saha, Kyryl Truskovskyi","In this study, we focus on two main tasks, the first for detecting legal violations within unstructured textual data, and the second for associating these violations with potentially affected individuals. We constructed two datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) which were subsequently validated by domain expert annotators. Both tasks were designed specifically for the context of class-action cases. The experimental design incorporated fine-tuning models from the BERT family and open-source LLMs, and conducting few-shot experiments using closed-source LLMs. Our results, with an F1-score of 62.69\% (violation identification) and 81.02\% (associating victims), show that our datasets and setups can be used for both tasks.

LESS: Selecting Influential Data for Targeted Instruction Tuning,"Mengzhou Xia, Sadhika Malladi, Suchin Gururangan, Sanjeev Arora, Danqi Chen","Instruction tuning has unlocked powerful capabilities in large language models (LLMs), effectively using combined datasets to develop generalpurpose chatbots. However, real-world applications often require a specialized suite of skills (e.g., reasoning). The challenge lies in identifying the most relevant data from these extensive datasets to effectively develop specific capabilities, a setting we frame as targeted instruction tuning. We propose LESS, an optimizer-aware and practically efficient algorithm to effectively estimate data influences and perform Low-rank gradiEnt Similarity Search for instruction data selection. Crucially, LESS adapts existing influence formulations to work with the Adam optimizer and variable-length instruction data. LESS first constructs a highly reusable and transferable gradient datastore with low-dimensional gradient features and then selects examples based on their similarity to few-shot examples embodying a specific capability. Experiments show that training on a LESS-selected 5% of the data can often outperform training on the full dataset across diverse downstream tasks. Furthermore, the selected data is highly transferable: smaller models can be leveraged to select useful data for larger models and models from different families. Our qualitative analysis shows that our method goes beyond surface form cues to identify data that exemplifies the necessary reasoning skills for the intended downstream application.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04333v3,2024-02

Training Language Models to Generate Text with Citations via Fine-grained Rewards,"Chengyu Huang, Zeqiu Wu, Yushi Hu, Wenya Wang","While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven useful in answering user queries, they are prone to hallucination, and their responses often lack credibility due to missing references to reliable sources. An intuitive solution to these issues would be to include in-text citations referring to external documents as evidence. While previous works have directly prompted LLMs to generate in-text citations, their performances are far from satisfactory, especially when it comes to smaller LLMs. In this work, we propose an effective training framework using fine-grained rewards to teach LLMs to generate highly supportive and relevant citations, while ensuring the correctness of their responses. We also conduct a systematic analysis of applying these fine-grained rewards to common LLM training strategies, demonstrating its advantage over conventional practices. We conduct extensive experiments on Question Answering (QA) datasets taken from the ALCE benchmark and validate the model's generalizability using EXPERTQA. On LLaMA-2-7B, the incorporation of fine-grained rewards achieves the best performance among the baselines, even surpassing that of GPT-3.5-turbo.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04315v3,2024-02
"AnyTool: Self-Reflective, Hierarchical Agents for Large-Scale API Calls","Yu Du, Fangyun Wei, Hongyang Zhang","We introduce AnyTool, a large language model agent designed to revolutionize the utilization of a vast array of tools in addressing user queries. We utilize over 16,000 APIs from Rapid API, operating under the assumption that a subset of these APIs could potentially resolve the queries. AnyTool primarily incorporates three elements: an API retriever with a hierarchical structure, a solver aimed at resolving user queries using a selected set of API candidates, and a self-reflection mechanism, which re-activates AnyTool if the initial solution proves impracticable. AnyTool is powered by the function calling feature of GPT-4, eliminating the need for training external modules. We also revisit the evaluation protocol introduced by previous works and identify a limitation in this protocol that leads to an artificially high pass rate. By revising the evaluation protocol to better reflect practical application scenarios, we introduce an additional benchmark, termed AnyToolBench. Experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our AnyTool over strong baselines such as ToolLLM and a GPT-4 variant tailored for tool utilization. For instance, AnyTool outperforms ToolLLM by +35.4% in terms of average pass rate on ToolBench. Code will be available at https://github.com/dyabel/AnyTool.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04253v1,2024-02
Linear-time Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding with Reference Aggregation,"Jannis Vamvas, Rico Sennrich","Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding is a text generation technique that has been shown to improve the quality of machine translations, but is expensive, even if a sampling-based approximation is used. Besides requiring a large number of sampled sequences, it requires the pairwise calculation of a utility metric, which has quadratic complexity. In this paper, we propose to approximate pairwise metric scores with scores calculated against aggregated reference representations. This changes the complexity of utility estimation from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, while empirically preserving most of the quality gains of MBR decoding.

While their capabilities are promising, these agents, called scientific LLM agents, also introduce novel vulnerabilities that demand careful consideration for safety. However, there exists a notable gap in the literature, as there has been no comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This perspective paper fills this gap by conducting a thorough examination of vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents within scientific domains, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the potential risks inherent to scientific LLM agents, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we delve into the origins of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks.

CogCoM: Train Large Vision-Language Models Diving into Details through Chain of Manipulations,"Ji Qi, Ming Ding, Weihan Wang, Yushi Bai, Qingsong Lv, Wenyi Hong, Bin Xu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated their broad effectiveness thanks to extensive training in aligning visual instructions to responses. However, such training of conclusive alignment leads models to ignore essential visual reasoning, further resulting in failures in meticulous visual problems and unfaithful responses. Drawing inspiration from human cognition in solving visual problems (e.g., marking, zoom in), this paper introduces Chain of Manipulations, a mechanism that enables VLMs to solve problems step-by-step with evidence. After training, models can solve various visual problems by eliciting intrinsic manipulations (e.g., grounding, zoom in) with results (e.g., boxes, image) actively without involving external tools, while also allowing users to trace error causes. We study the roadmap to implement this mechanism, including (1) a flexible design of manipulations upon extensive analysis, (2) an efficient automated data generation pipeline, (3) a compatible VLM architecture capable of multi-turn multi-image, and (4) a model training process for versatile capabilities. With the design, we also manually annotate 6K high-quality samples for the challenging graphical mathematical problems. Our trained model, \textbf{CogCoM}, equipped with this mechanism with 17B parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance across 9 benchmarks from 4 categories, demonstrating the effectiveness while preserving the interpretability.

Can Generative Agents Predict Emotion?,"Ciaran Regan, Nanami Iwahashi, Shogo Tanaka, Mizuki Oka","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a number of human-like abilities, however the empathic understanding and emotional state of LLMs is yet to be aligned to that of humans. In this work, we investigate how the emotional state of generative LLM agents evolves as they perceive new events, introducing a novel architecture in which new experiences are compared to past memories. Through this comparison, the agent gains the ability to understand new experiences in context, which according to the appraisal theory of emotion is vital in emotion creation. First, the agent perceives new experiences as time series text data. After perceiving each new input, the agent generates a summary of past relevant memories, referred to as the norm, and compares the new experience to this norm. Through this comparison we can analyse how the agent reacts to the new experience in context. The PANAS, a test of affect, is administered to the agent, capturing the emotional state of the agent after the perception of the new event. Finally, the new experience is then added to the agents memory to be used in the creation of future norms. By creating multiple experiences in natural language from emotionally charged situations, we test the proposed architecture on a wide range of scenarios. The mixed results suggests that introducing context can occasionally improve the emotional alignment of the agent, but further study and comparison with human evaluators is necessary. We hope that this paper is another step towards the alignment of generative agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04232v2,2024-02
"What is ""Typological Diversity"" in NLP?","Esther Ploeger, Wessel Poelman, Miryam de Lhoneux, Johannes Bjerva","The NLP research community has devoted increased attention to languages beyond English, resulting in considerable improvements for multilingual NLP. However, these improvements only apply to a small subset of the world's languages. Aiming to extend this, an increasing number of papers aspires to enhance generalizable multilingual performance across languages. To this end, linguistic typology is commonly used to motivate language selection, on the basis that a broad typological sample ought to imply generalization across a broad range of languages. These selections are often described as being 'typologically diverse'. In this work, we systematically investigate NLP research that includes claims regarding 'typological diversity'. We find there are no set definitions or criteria for such claims. We introduce metrics to approximate the diversity of language selection along several axes and find that the results vary considerably across papers. Crucially, we show that skewed language selection can lead to overestimated multilingual performance. We recommend future work to include an operationalization of 'typological diversity' that empirically justifies the diversity of language samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04222v4,2024-02
Scaling Laws for Downstream Task Performance of Large Language Models,"Berivan Isik, Natalia Ponomareva, Hussein Hazimeh, Dimitris Paparas, Sergei Vassilvitskii, Sanmi Koyejo","Scaling laws provide important insights that can guide the design of large language models (LLMs). Existing work has primarily focused on studying scaling laws for pretraining (upstream) loss. However, in transfer learning settings, in which LLMs are pretrained on an unsupervised dataset and then finetuned on a downstream task, we often also care about the downstream performance. In this work, we study the scaling behavior in a transfer learning setting, where LLMs are finetuned for machine translation tasks. Specifically, we investigate how the choice of the pretraining data and its size affect downstream performance (translation quality) as judged by two metrics: downstream cross-entropy and BLEU score. Our experiments indicate that the size of the finetuning dataset and the distribution alignment between the pretraining and downstream data significantly influence the scaling behavior. With sufficient alignment, both downstream cross-entropy and BLEU score improve monotonically with more pretraining data. In such cases, we show that it is possible to predict the downstream BLEU score with good accuracy using a log-law. However, there are also cases where moderate misalignment causes the BLEU score to fluctuate or get worse with more pretraining, whereas downstream cross-entropy monotonically improves. By analyzing these observations, we provide new practical insights for choosing appropriate pretraining data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04177v1,2024-02
Attention with Markov: A Framework for Principled Analysis of Transformers via Markov Chains,"Ashok Vardhan Makkuva, Marco Bondaschi, Adway Girish, Alliot Nagle, Martin Jaggi, Hyeji Kim, Michael Gastpar","In recent years, attention-based transformers have achieved tremendous success across a variety of disciplines including natural languages. A key ingredient behind their success is the generative pretraining procedure, during which these models are trained on a large text corpus in an auto-regressive manner. To shed light on this phenomenon, we propose a new framework that allows both theory and systematic experiments to study the sequential modeling capabilities of transformers through the lens of Markov chains. Inspired by the Markovianity of natural languages, we model the data as a Markovian source and utilize this framework to systematically study the interplay between the data-distributional properties, the transformer architecture, the learnt distribution, and the final model performance. In particular, we theoretically characterize the loss landscape of single-layer transformers and show the existence of global minima and bad local minima contingent upon the specific data characteristics and the transformer architecture. Backed by experiments, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are in congruence with the empirical results. We further investigate these findings in the broader context of higher order Markov chains and deeper architectures, and outline open problems in this arena.

Harnessing the Plug-and-Play Controller by Prompting,"Hao Wang, Lei Sha","Controllable text generation is a growing field within natural language generation (NLG) that focuses on producing text that meets specific constraints in real-world applications. Previous approaches, such as plug-and-play controllers (PPCs), aimed to steer the properties of generated text in a flexible manner. However, these methods often compromised the integrity of the language model's decoding process, resulting in less smooth text generation. Alternatively, other techniques utilized multiple attribute prompts to align the generated text with desired attributes, but this approach required prompt design for each attribute and was dependent on the size of the language model. This paper introduces a novel method for flexible attribute control in text generation using pre-trained language models (PLMs). The proposed approach aims to enhance the fluency of generated text by guiding the generation process with PPCs. The key idea is to dynamically adjust the distribution of generated text by modifying prompts, effectively constraining the output space of the language model and influencing the desired attribute. To enable smooth cooperation between the PLM and the PPC, our work innovatively proposes a new model fine-tuning method: Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Adjust Feedback (RLDAF).This fine-tuning process adapts a small subset of the language model's parameters based on the generating actions taken during the PPC control process. The resulting harmonious collaboration between the PLM and PPC leads to improved smoothness in text generation during inference. Extensive experiments were conducted on the SST2 dataset, and the proposed method outperformed previous approaches in various evaluation metrics, including text fluency and attribute consistency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04160v1,2024-02

The study of causality lends itself to the construction of veridical world models, which are crucial for accurately predicting the outcomes of possible interactions. This paper focuses on the prospects of building foundation world models for the upcoming generation of embodied agents and presents a novel viewpoint on the significance of causality within these. We posit that integrating causal considerations is vital to facilitating meaningful physical interactions with the world. Finally, we demystify misconceptions about causality in this context and present our outlook for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06665v2,2024-02
Behind the Screen: Investigating ChatGPT's Dark Personality Traits and Conspiracy Beliefs,"Erik Weber, Jérôme Rutinowski, Markus Pauly","ChatGPT is notorious for its intransparent behavior. This paper tries to shed light on this, providing an in-depth analysis of the dark personality traits and conspiracy beliefs of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Different psychological tests and questionnaires were employed, including the Dark Factor Test, the Mach-IV Scale, the Generic Conspiracy Belief Scale, and the Conspiracy Mentality Scale. The responses were analyzed computing average scores, standard deviations, and significance tests to investigate differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. For traits that have shown to be interdependent in human studies, correlations were considered. Additionally, system roles corresponding to groups that have shown distinct answering behavior in the corresponding questionnaires were applied to examine the models' ability to reflect characteristics associated with these roles in their responses. Dark personality traits and conspiracy beliefs were not particularly pronounced in either model with little differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. However, GPT-4 showed a pronounced tendency to believe in information withholding. This is particularly intriguing given that GPT-4 is trained on a significantly larger dataset than GPT-3.5. Apparently, in this case an increased data exposure correlates with a greater belief in the control of information. An assignment of extreme political affiliations increased the belief in conspiracy theories. Test sequencing affected the models' responses and the observed correlations, indicating a form of contextual memory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04110v1,2024-02
Measuring Implicit Bias in Explicitly Unbiased Large Language Models,"Xuechunzi Bai, Angelina Wang, Ilia Sucholutsky, Thomas L. Griffiths","Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two new measures of bias: LLM Implicit Bias, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Implicit Bias adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Decision Bias operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). Our prompt-based LLM Implicit Bias measure correlates with existing language model embedding-based bias methods, but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias. These new prompt-based measures draw from psychology's long history of research into measuring stereotype biases based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04105v2,2024-02
The Use of a Large Language Model for Cyberbullying Detection,"Bayode Ogunleye, Babitha Dharmaraj","The dominance of social media has added to the channels of bullying for perpetrators. Unfortunately, cyberbullying (CB) is the most prevalent phenomenon in todays cyber world, and is a severe threat to the mental and physical health of citizens. This opens the need to develop a robust system to prevent bullying content from online forums, blogs, and social media platforms to manage the impact in our society. Several machine learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed for this purpose. However, their performances are not consistent due to high class imbalance and generalisation issues. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) like BERT and RoBERTa have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in several natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Unfortunately, the LLMs have not been applied extensively for CB detection. In our paper, we explored the use of these models for cyberbullying (CB) detection. We have prepared a new dataset (D2) from existing studies (Formspring and Twitter). Our experimental results for dataset D1 and D2 showed that RoBERTa outperformed other models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04088v1,2024-02
A Human-Machine Collaboration Framework for the Development of Schemas,Nicos Isaak,"The Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a seemingly well-thought-out test for machine intelligence, has been proposed to shed light on developing systems that exhibit human behavior. Since its introduction, it aimed to pivot the focus of the AI community from the technology to the science of AI. While common and trivial for humans, studies show that it is still challenging for machines, especially when they have to deal with novel schemas, that is, well-designed sentences that require the resolving of definite pronouns. As researchers have become increasingly interested in the challenge itself, this presumably necessitates the availability of an extensive collection of Winograd schemas, which goes beyond what human experts can reasonably develop themselves, especially after proposed ways of utilizing them as novel forms of CAPTCHAs.   To address this necessity, we propose a novel framework that explicitly focuses on how humans and machines can collaborate as teammates to design novel schemas from scratch. This is being accomplished by combining two recent studies from the literature: i) Winventor, a machine-driven approach for the development of large amounts of Winograd schemas, albeit not of high quality, and ii) WinoFlexi, an online crowdsourcing system that allows crowd workers to develop a limited number of schemas often of similar quality to that of experts. Our proposal crafts a new road map toward developing a novel collaborative platform that amplifies human and machine intelligence by combining their complementary strengths.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07932v1,2024-02
Iterative Prompt Refinement for Radiation Oncology Symptom Extraction Using Teacher-Student Large Language Models,"Reza Khanmohammadi, Ahmed I Ghanem, Kyle Verdecchia, Ryan Hall, Mohamed Elshaikh, Benjamin Movsas, Hassan Bagher-Ebadian, Indrin Chetty, Mohammad M. Ghassemi, Kundan Thind","This study introduces a novel teacher-student architecture utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve prostate cancer radiotherapy symptom extraction from clinical notes. Mixtral, the student model, initially extracts symptoms, followed by GPT-4, the teacher model, which refines prompts based on Mixtral's performance. This iterative process involved 294 single symptom clinical notes across 12 symptoms, with up to 16 rounds of refinement per epoch. Results showed significant improvements in extracting symptoms from both single and multi-symptom notes. For 59 single symptom notes, accuracy increased from 0.51 to 0.71, precision from 0.52 to 0.82, recall from 0.52 to 0.72, and F1 score from 0.49 to 0.73. In 375 multi-symptom notes, accuracy rose from 0.24 to 0.43, precision from 0.6 to 0.76, recall from 0.24 to 0.43, and F1 score from 0.20 to 0.44.

Retrieve to Explain: Evidence-driven Predictions with Language Models,"Ravi Patel, Angus Brayne, Rogier Hintzen, Daniel Jaroslawicz, Georgiana Neculae, Dane Corneil","Language models hold incredible promise for enabling scientific discovery by synthesizing massive research corpora. Many complex scientific research questions have multiple plausible answers, each supported by evidence of varying strength. However, existing language models lack the capability to quantitatively and faithfully compare answer plausibility in terms of supporting evidence. To address this issue, we introduce Retrieve to Explain (R2E), a retrieval-based language model. R2E scores and ranks all possible answers to a research question based on evidence retrieved from a document corpus. The architecture represents each answer only in terms of its supporting evidence, with the answer itself masked. This allows us to extend feature attribution methods, such as Shapley values, to transparently attribute each answer's score back to its supporting evidence at inference time. The architecture also allows R2E to incorporate new evidence without retraining, including non-textual data modalities templated into natural language. We assess on the challenging task of drug target identification from scientific literature, a human-in-the-loop process where failures are extremely costly and explainability is paramount. When predicting whether drug targets will subsequently be confirmed as efficacious in clinical trials, R2E not only matches non-explainable literature-based models but also surpasses a genetics-based target identification approach used throughout the pharmaceutical industry.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04068v3,2024-02
Systematic Biases in LLM Simulations of Debates,"Amir Taubenfeld, Yaniv Dover, Roi Reichart, Ariel Goldstein","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), has opened exciting possibilities for constructing computational simulations designed to replicate human behavior accurately. Current research suggests that LLM-based agents become increasingly human-like in their performance, sparking interest in using these AI agents as substitutes for human participants in behavioral studies. However, LLMs are complex statistical learners without straightforward deductive rules, making them prone to unexpected behaviors. Hence, it is crucial to study and pinpoint the key behavioral distinctions between humans and LLM-based agents. In this study, we highlight the limitations of LLMs in simulating human interactions, particularly focusing on LLMs' ability to simulate political debates on topics that are important aspects of people's day-to-day lives and decision-making processes. Our findings indicate a tendency for LLM agents to conform to the model's inherent social biases despite being directed to debate from certain political perspectives. This tendency results in behavioral patterns that seem to deviate from well-established social dynamics among humans. We reinforce these observations using an automatic self-fine-tuning method, which enables us to manipulate the biases within the LLM and demonstrate that agents subsequently align with the altered biases. These results underscore the need for further research to develop methods that help agents overcome these biases, a critical step toward creating more realistic simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04049v3,2024-02

We report the initial classification scores of some traditional machine learning classifiers trained with the AlbNews samples.

Two datasets comprising MHealth information from the UK National Health Service website and information leaflets from The Royal College of Psychiatrists were used. Native speakers of the target languages manually assessed the GT translations, focusing on medical terminology accuracy, comprehensibility, and critical syntactic/semantic errors. GT output analysis revealed challenges in accurately translating medical terminology, particularly in Arabic, Romanian, and Persian. Fluency issues were prevalent across various languages, affecting comprehension, mainly in Arabic and Spanish. Critical errors arose in specific contexts, such as bullet-point formatting, specifically in Persian, Turkish, and Romanian. Although improvements are seen in longer-text translations, there remains a need to enhance accuracy in medical and mental health terminology and fluency, whilst also addressing formatting issues for a more seamless user experience. The findings highlight the need to use customised translation engines for Mhealth translation and the challenges when relying solely on machine-translated medical content, emphasising the crucial role of human reviewers in multilingual healthcare communication.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04023v1,2024-02
REBORN: Reinforcement-Learned Boundary Segmentation with Iterative Training for Unsupervised ASR,"Liang-Hsuan Tseng, En-Pei Hu, Cheng-Han Chiang, Yuan Tseng, Hung-yi Lee, Lin-shan Lee, Shao-Hua Sun","Unsupervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to learn the mapping between the speech signal and its corresponding textual transcription without the supervision of paired speech-text data. A word/phoneme in the speech signal is represented by a segment of speech signal with variable length and unknown boundary, and this segmental structure makes learning the mapping between speech and text challenging, especially without paired data. In this paper, we propose REBORN,Reinforcement-Learned Boundary Segmentation with Iterative Training for Unsupervised ASR. REBORN alternates between (1) training a segmentation model that predicts the boundaries of the segmental structures in speech signals and (2) training the phoneme prediction model, whose input is the speech feature segmented by the segmentation model, to predict a phoneme transcription. Since supervised data for training the segmentation model is not available, we use reinforcement learning to train the segmentation model to favor segmentations that yield phoneme sequence predictions with a lower perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments and find that under the same setting, REBORN outperforms all prior unsupervised ASR models on LibriSpeech, TIMIT, and five non-English languages in Multilingual LibriSpeech. We comprehensively analyze why the boundaries learned by REBORN improve the unsupervised ASR performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03988v3,2024-02
Enhancing Retrieval Processes for Language Generation with Augmented Queries,"Julien Pierre Edmond Ghali, Kosuke Shima, Koichi Moriyama, Atsuko Mutoh, Nobuhiro Inuzuka","In the rapidly changing world of smart technology, searching for documents has become more challenging due to the rise of advanced language models. These models sometimes face difficulties, like providing inaccurate information, commonly known as ""hallucination."" This research focuses on addressing this issue through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that guides models to give accurate responses based on real facts. To overcome scalability issues, the study explores connecting user queries with sophisticated language models such as BERT and Orca2, using an innovative query optimization process. The study unfolds in three scenarios: first, without RAG, second, without additional assistance, and finally, with extra help. Choosing the compact yet efficient Orca2 7B model demonstrates a smart use of computing resources. The empirical results indicate a significant improvement in the initial language model's performance under RAG, particularly when assisted with prompts augmenters. Consistency in document retrieval across different encodings highlights the effectiveness of using language model-generated queries. The introduction of UMAP for BERT further simplifies document retrieval while maintaining strong results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16874v1,2024-02
LV-Eval: A Balanced Long-Context Benchmark with 5 Length Levels Up to 256K,"Tao Yuan, Xuefei Ning, Dong Zhou, Zhijie Yang, Shiyao Li, Minghui Zhuang, Zheyue Tan, Zhuyu Yao, Dahua Lin, Boxun Li, Guohao Dai, Shengen Yan, Yu Wang","State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are now claiming remarkable supported context lengths of 256k or even more. In contrast, the average context lengths of mainstream benchmarks are insufficient (5k-21k), and they suffer from potential knowledge leakage and inaccurate metrics, resulting in biased evaluation. This paper introduces LV-Eval, a challenging long-context benchmark with five length levels (16k, 32k, 64k, 128k, and 256k) reaching up to 256k words. LV-Eval features two main tasks, single-hop QA and multi-hop QA, comprising 11 bilingual datasets. The design of LV-Eval has incorporated three key techniques, namely confusing facts insertion, keyword and phrase replacement, and keyword-recall-based metric design. The advantages of LV-Eval include controllable evaluation across different context lengths, challenging test instances with confusing facts, mitigated knowledge leakage, and more objective evaluations. We evaluate 15 LLMs on LV-Eval and conduct ablation studies on the benchmarking techniques. The results reveal that: (i) Moonshot-v1 and recent large-scale open-source models, such as Qwen-2.5-72B and Llama-3.1-70B, achieve the highest performance on LV-Eval, particularly at lengths below 64k. (ii) Models exhibit distinct score trends. For example, GLM-4-9B-128k, Yi-6B-200k, and Llama3-8B-1M exhibit a relatively gentle degradation of performance, but their absolute performances may not necessarily be higher than those of LLMs with shorter context lengths. (iii) LLMs' performances can significantly degrade in the presence of confusing information, especially in the pressure test of ""needle in a haystack"". (iv) Issues related to knowledge leakage and inaccurate metrics introduce bias in evaluation, and these concerns are alleviated in LV-Eval.

Position: Stop Making Unscientific AGI Performance Claims,"Patrick Altmeyer, Andrew M. Demetriou, Antony Bartlett, Cynthia C. S. Liem","Developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and particularly large language models (LLMs), have created a 'perfect storm' for observing 'sparks' of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that are spurious. Like simpler models, LLMs distill meaningful representations in their latent embeddings that have been shown to correlate with external variables. Nonetheless, the correlation of such representations has often been linked to human-like intelligence in the latter but not the former. We probe models of varying complexity including random projections, matrix decompositions, deep autoencoders and transformers: all of them successfully distill information that can be used to predict latent or external variables and yet none of them have previously been linked to AGI. We argue and empirically demonstrate that the finding of meaningful patterns in latent spaces of models cannot be seen as evidence in favor of AGI. Additionally, we review literature from the social sciences that shows that humans are prone to seek such patterns and anthropomorphize. We conclude that both the methodological setup and common public image of AI are ideal for the misinterpretation that correlations between model representations and some variables of interest are 'caused' by the model's understanding of underlying 'ground truth' relationships. We, therefore, call for the academic community to exercise extra caution, and to be keenly aware of principles of academic integrity, in interpreting and communicating about AI research outcomes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03962v3,2024-02
Sparse Graph Representations for Procedural Instructional Documents,"Shruti Singh, Rishabh Gupta","Computation of document similarity is a critical task in various NLP domains that has applications in deduplication, matching, and recommendation. Traditional approaches for document similarity computation include learning representations of documents and employing a similarity or a distance function over the embeddings. However, pairwise similarities and differences are not efficiently captured by individual representations. Graph representations such as Joint Concept Interaction Graph (JCIG) represent a pair of documents as a joint undirected weighted graph. JCIGs facilitate an interpretable representation of document pairs as a graph. However, JCIGs are undirected, and don't consider the sequential flow of sentences in documents. We propose two approaches to model document similarity by representing document pairs as a directed and sparse JCIG that incorporates sequential information. We propose two algorithms inspired by Supergenome Sorting and Hamiltonian Path that replace the undirected edges with directed edges. Our approach also sparsifies the graph to $O(n)$ edges from JCIG's worst case of $O(n^2)$. We show that our sparse directed graph model architecture consisting of a Siamese encoder and GCN achieves comparable results to the baseline on datasets not containing sequential information and beats the baseline by ten points on an instructional documents dataset containing sequential information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03957v1,2024-02
"Leak, Cheat, Repeat: Data Contamination and Evaluation Malpractices in Closed-Source LLMs","Simone Balloccu, Patrícia Schmidtová, Mateusz Lango, Ondřej Dušek","Natural Language Processing (NLP) research is increasingly focusing on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), with some of the most popular ones being either fully or partially closed-source. The lack of access to model details, especially regarding training data, has repeatedly raised concerns about data contamination among researchers. Several attempts have been made to address this issue, but they are limited to anecdotal evidence and trial and error. Additionally, they overlook the problem of \emph{indirect} data leaking, where models are iteratively improved by using data coming from users. In this work, we conduct the first systematic analysis of work using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, the most prominently used LLMs today, in the context of data contamination. By analysing 255 papers and considering OpenAI's data usage policy, we extensively document the amount of data leaked to these models during the first year after the model's release. We report that these models have been globally exposed to $\sim$4.7M samples from 263 benchmarks. At the same time, we document a number of evaluation malpractices emerging in the reviewed papers, such as unfair or missing baseline comparisons and reproducibility issues. We release our results as a collaborative project on https://leak-llm.github.io/, where other researchers can contribute to our efforts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03927v2,2024-02
Can Large Language Models Detect Rumors on Social Media?,"Qiang Liu, Xiang Tao, Junfei Wu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang","In this work, we investigate to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for rumor detection on social media. However, it is challenging for LLMs to reason over the entire propagation information on social media, which contains news contents and numerous comments, due to LLMs may not concentrate on key clues in the complex propagation information, and have trouble in reasoning when facing massive and redundant information. Accordingly, we propose an LLM-empowered Rumor Detection (LeRuD) approach, in which we design prompts to teach LLMs to reason over important clues in news and comments, and divide the entire propagation information into a Chain-of-Propagation for reducing LLMs' burden. We conduct extensive experiments on the Twitter and Weibo datasets, and LeRuD outperforms several state-of-the-art rumor detection models by 3.2% to 7.7%. Meanwhile, by applying LLMs, LeRuD requires no data for training, and thus shows more promising rumor detection ability in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03916v2,2024-02
CADReN: Contextual Anchor-Driven Relational Network for Controllable Cross-Graphs Node Importance Estimation,"Zijie Zhong, Yunhui Zhang, Ziyi Chang, Zengchang Qin","Node Importance Estimation (NIE) is crucial for integrating external information into Large Language Models through Retriever-Augmented Generation. Traditional methods, focusing on static, single-graph characteristics, lack adaptability to new graphs and user-specific requirements. CADReN, our proposed method, addresses these limitations by introducing a Contextual Anchor (CA) mechanism. This approach enables the network to assess node importance relative to the CA, considering both structural and semantic features within Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Extensive experiments show that CADReN achieves better performance in cross-graph NIE task, with zero-shot prediction ability. CADReN is also proven to match the performance of previous models on single-graph NIE task. Additionally, we introduce and opensource two new datasets, RIC200 and WK1K, specifically designed for cross-graph NIE research, providing a valuable resource for future developments in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05135v1,2024-02
Pro-HAN: A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network for Profile-Based Spoken Language Understanding,"Dechuan Teng, Chunlin Lu, Xiao Xu, Wanxiang Che, Libo Qin","Recently, Profile-based Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) has gained increasing attention, which aims to incorporate various types of supplementary profile information (i.e., Knowledge Graph, User Profile, Context Awareness) to eliminate the prevalent ambiguities in user utterances. However, existing approaches can only separately model different profile information, without considering their interrelationships or excluding irrelevant and conflicting information within them. To address the above issues, we introduce a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network to perform reasoning across multiple Profile information, called Pro-HAN. Specifically, we design three types of edges, denoted as intra-Pro, inter-Pro, and utterance-Pro, to capture interrelationships among multiple Pros. We establish a new state-of-the-art on the ProSLU dataset, with an improvement of approximately 8% across all three metrics.

DistiLLM: Towards Streamlined Distillation for Large Language Models,"Jongwoo Ko, Sungnyun Kim, Tianyi Chen, Se-Young Yun","Knowledge distillation (KD) is widely used for compressing a teacher model to a smaller student model, reducing its inference cost and memory footprint while preserving model capabilities. However, current KD methods for auto-regressive sequence models (e.g., large language models) suffer from missing a standardized objective function. Moreover, the recent use of student-generated outputs to address training-inference mismatches has significantly escalated computational costs. To tackle these issues, we introduce DistiLLM, a more effective and efficient KD framework for auto-regressive language models. DistiLLM comprises two components: (1) a novel skew Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, where we unveil and leverage its theoretical properties, and (2) an adaptive off-policy approach designed to enhance the efficiency in utilizing student-generated outputs. Extensive experiments, including instruction-following tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of DistiLLM in building high-performing student models while achieving up to 4.3$\times$ speedup compared to recent KD methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03898v2,2024-02
Shifting social norms as a driving force for linguistic change: Struggles about language and gender in the German Bundestag,"Carolin Müller-Spitzer, Samira Ochs","This paper focuses on language change based on shifting social norms, in particular with regard to the debate on language and gender. It is a recurring argument in this debate that language develops ""naturally"" and that ""severe interventions"" - such as gender-inclusive language is often claimed to be - in the allegedly ""organic"" language system are inappropriate and even ""dangerous"". Such interventions are, however, not unprecedented. Socially motivated processes of language change are neither unusual nor new. We focus in our contribution on one important political-social space in Germany, the German Bundestag. Taking other struggles about language and gender in the plenaries of the Bundestag as a starting point, our article illustrates that language and gender has been a recurring issue in the German Bundestag since the 1980s. We demonstrate how this is reflected in linguistic practices of the Bundestag, by the use of a) designations for gays and lesbians; b) pair forms such as B\""urgerinnen und B\""urger (female and male citizens); and c) female forms of addresses and personal nouns ('Pr\""asidentin' in addition to 'Pr\""asident'). Lastly, we will discuss implications of these earlier language battles for the currently very heated debate about gender-inclusive language, especially regarding new forms with gender symbols like the asterisk or the colon (Lehrer*innen, Lehrer:innen; male*female teachers) which are intended to encompass all gender identities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03887v1,2024-02
Beyond Lines and Circles: Unveiling the Geometric Reasoning Gap in Large Language Models,"Spyridon Mouselinos, Henryk Michalewski, Mateusz Malinowski","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate ever-increasing abilities in mathematical and algorithmic tasks, yet their geometric reasoning skills are underexplored. We investigate LLMs' abilities in constructive geometric problem-solving one of the most fundamental steps in the development of human mathematical reasoning. Our work reveals notable challenges that the state-of-the-art LLMs face in this domain despite many successes in similar areas. LLMs exhibit biases in target variable selection and struggle with 2D spatial relationships, often misrepresenting and hallucinating objects and their placements. To this end, we introduce a framework that formulates an LLMs-based multi-agents system that enhances their existing reasoning potential by conducting an internal dialogue. This work underscores LLMs' current limitations in geometric reasoning and improves geometric reasoning capabilities through self-correction, collaboration, and diverse role specializations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03877v3,2024-02
Less than one percent of words would be affected by gender-inclusive language in German press texts,"Carolin Müller-Spitzer, Samira Ochs, Alexander Koplenig, Jan-Oliver Rüdiger, Sascha Wolfer","Research on gender and language is tightly knitted to social debates on gender equality and non-discriminatory language use. Psycholinguistic scholars have made significant contributions in this field. However, corpus-based studies that investigate these matters within the context of language use are still rare. In our study, we address the question of how much textual material would actually have to be changed if non-gender-inclusive texts were rewritten to be gender-inclusive. This quantitative measure is an important empirical insight, as a recurring argument against the use of gender-inclusive German is that it supposedly makes written texts too long and complicated. It is also argued that gender-inclusive language has negative effects on language learners. However, such effects are only likely if gender-inclusive texts are very different from those that are not gender-inclusive. In our corpus-linguistic study, we manually annotated German press texts to identify the parts that would have to be changed. Our results show that, on average, less than 1% of all tokens would be affected by gender-inclusive language. This small proportion calls into question whether gender-inclusive German presents a substantial barrier to understanding and learning the language, particularly when we take into account the potential complexities of interpreting masculine generics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03870v1,2024-02
ANLS* -- A Universal Document Processing Metric for Generative Large Language Models,"David Peer, Philemon Schöpf, Volckmar Nebendahl, Alexander Rietzler, Sebastian Stabinger","Traditionally, discriminative models have been the predominant choice for tasks like document classification and information extraction. These models make predictions that fall into a limited number of predefined classes, facilitating a binary true or false evaluation and enabling the direct calculation of metrics such as the F1 score. However, recent advancements in generative large language models (GLLMs) have prompted a shift in the field due to their enhanced zero-shot capabilities, which eliminate the need for a downstream dataset and computationally expensive fine-tuning. However, evaluating GLLMs presents a challenge as the binary true or false evaluation used for discriminative models is not applicable to the predictions made by GLLMs.   This paper introduces a new metric for generative models called ANLS* for evaluating a wide variety of tasks, including information extraction and classification tasks. The ANLS* metric extends existing ANLS metrics as a drop-in-replacement and is still compatible with previously reported ANLS scores. An evaluation of 7 different datasets, and more than 10 different GLLMs together with 3 different prompting methods using the ANLS* metric is also provided, demonstrating the importance of the proposed metric.   We also benchmark a novel approach to generate prompts for documents, called SFT, against other prompting techniques such as LATIN. In almost all cases, SFT outperforms other techniques and improves the state-of-the-art, sometimes by as much as $10$ percentage points.

BiLLM: Pushing the Limit of Post-Training Quantization for LLMs,"Wei Huang, Yangdong Liu, Haotong Qin, Ying Li, Shiming Zhang, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno, Xiaojuan Qi","Pretrained large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional general language processing capabilities but come with significant demands on memory and computational resources. As a powerful compression technology, binarization can extremely reduce model weights to a mere 1 bit, lowering the expensive computation and memory requirements. However, existing quantization techniques fall short of maintaining LLM performance under ultra-low bit-widths. In response to this challenge, we present BiLLM, a groundbreaking 1-bit post-training quantization scheme tailored for pretrained LLMs. Based on the weight distribution of LLMs, BiLLM first identifies and structurally selects salient weights, and minimizes the compression loss through an effective binary residual approximation strategy. Moreover, considering the bell-shaped distribution of the non-salient weights, we propose an optimal splitting search to group and binarize them accurately. BiLLM achieving for the first time high-accuracy inference (e.g. 8.41 perplexity on LLaMA2-70B) with only 1.08-bit weights across various LLMs families and evaluation metrics, outperforms SOTA quantization methods of LLM by significant margins.

Rethinking Skill Extraction in the Job Market Domain using Large Language Models,"Khanh Cao Nguyen, Mike Zhang, Syrielle Montariol, Antoine Bosselut","Skill Extraction involves identifying skills and qualifications mentioned in documents such as job postings and resumes. The task is commonly tackled by training supervised models using a sequence labeling approach with BIO tags. However, the reliance on manually annotated data limits the generalizability of such approaches. Moreover, the common BIO setting limits the ability of the models to capture complex skill patterns and handle ambiguous mentions. In this paper, we explore the use of in-context learning to overcome these challenges, on a benchmark of 6 uniformized skill extraction datasets. Our approach leverages the few-shot learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to identify and extract skills from sentences. We show that LLMs, despite not being on par with traditional supervised models in terms of performance, can better handle syntactically complex skill mentions in skill extraction tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03832v1,2024-02
RevOrder: A Novel Method for Enhanced Arithmetic in Language Models,"Si Shen, Peijun Shen, Danhao Zhu","This paper presents RevOrder, a novel technique aimed at improving arithmetic operations in large language models (LLMs) by reversing the output digits in addition, subtraction, and n-digit by 1-digit (nD by 1D) multiplication tasks. Our method significantly reduces the Count of Sequential Intermediate Digits (CSID) to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, a new metric we introduce to assess equation complexity. Through comprehensive testing, RevOrder not only achieves perfect accuracy in basic arithmetic operations but also substantially boosts LLM performance in division tasks, particularly with large numbers where traditional models struggle. Implementation of RevOrder is cost-effective for both training and inference phases. Moreover, applying RevOrder to fine-tune the LLaMA2-7B model on the GSM8K math task results in a considerable improvement, reducing equation calculation errors by 46% and increasing overall scores from 41.6 to 44.4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03822v2,2024-02
Soft Prompt Tuning for Cross-Lingual Transfer: When Less is More,"Fred Philippy, Siwen Guo, Shohreh Haddadan, Cedric Lothritz, Jacques Klein, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé","Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT) is a parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to specific tasks by inserting learnable embeddings, or soft prompts, at the input layer of the PLM, without modifying its parameters. This paper investigates the potential of SPT for cross-lingual transfer. Unlike previous studies on SPT for cross-lingual transfer that often fine-tune both the soft prompt and the model parameters, we adhere to the original intent of SPT by keeping the model parameters frozen and only training the soft prompt. This does not only reduce the computational cost and storage overhead of full-model fine-tuning, but we also demonstrate that this very parameter efficiency intrinsic to SPT can enhance cross-lingual transfer performance to linguistically distant languages. Moreover, we explore how different factors related to the prompt, such as the length or its reparameterization, affect cross-lingual transfer performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03782v1,2024-02
Exposing propaganda: an analysis of stylistic cues comparing human annotations and machine classification,"Géraud Faye, Benjamin Icard, Morgane Casanova, Julien Chanson, François Maine, François Bancilhon, Guillaume Gadek, Guillaume Gravier, Paul Égré","This paper investigates the language of propaganda and its stylistic features. It presents the PPN dataset, standing for Propagandist Pseudo-News, a multisource, multilingual, multimodal dataset composed of news articles extracted from websites identified as propaganda sources by expert agencies. A limited sample from this set was randomly mixed with papers from the regular French press, and their URL masked, to conduct an annotation-experiment by humans, using 11 distinct labels. The results show that human annotators were able to reliably discriminate between the two types of press across each of the labels. We propose different NLP techniques to identify the cues used by the annotators, and to compare them with machine classification. They include the analyzer VAGO to measure discourse vagueness and subjectivity, a TF-IDF to serve as a baseline, and four different classifiers: two RoBERTa-based models, CATS using syntax, and one XGBoost combining syntactic and semantic features.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03780v3,2024-02
Large Language Models As MOOCs Graders,"Shahriar Golchin, Nikhil Garuda, Christopher Impey, Matthew Wenger","Massive open online courses (MOOCs) unlock the doors to free education for anyone around the globe with access to a computer and the internet. Despite this democratization of learning, the massive enrollment in these courses means it is almost impossible for one instructor to assess every student's writing assignment. As a result, peer grading, often guided by a straightforward rubric, is the method of choice. While convenient, peer grading often falls short in terms of reliability and validity. In this study, using 18 distinct settings, we explore the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to replace peer grading in MOOCs. Specifically, we focus on two state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, across three distinct courses: Introductory Astronomy, Astrobiology, and the History and Philosophy of Astronomy. To instruct LLMs, we use three different prompts based on a variant of the zero-shot chain-of-thought (Zero-shot-CoT) prompting technique: Zero-shot-CoT combined with instructor-provided correct answers; Zero-shot-CoT in conjunction with both instructor-formulated answers and rubrics; and Zero-shot-CoT with instructor-offered correct answers and LLM-generated rubrics. Our results show that Zero-shot-CoT, when integrated with instructor-provided answers and rubrics, produces grades that are more aligned with those assigned by instructors compared to peer grading. However, the History and Philosophy of Astronomy course proves to be more challenging in terms of grading as opposed to other courses. Finally, our study reveals a promising direction for automating grading systems for MOOCs, especially in subjects with well-defined rubrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03776v4,2024-02
Learning a Decision Tree Algorithm with Transformers,"Yufan Zhuang, Liyuan Liu, Chandan Singh, Jingbo Shang, Jianfeng Gao","Decision trees are renowned for their ability to achieve high predictive performance while remaining interpretable, especially on tabular data. Traditionally, they are constructed through recursive algorithms, where they partition the data at every node in a tree. However, identifying a good partition is challenging, as decision trees optimized for local segments may not yield global generalization. To address this, we introduce MetaTree, a transformer-based model trained via meta-learning to directly produce strong decision trees. Specifically, we fit both greedy decision trees and globally optimized decision trees on a large number of datasets, and train MetaTree to produce only the trees that achieve strong generalization performance. This training enables MetaTree to emulate these algorithms and intelligently adapt its strategy according to the context, thereby achieving superior generalization performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03774v2,2024-02
The Instinctive Bias: Spurious Images lead to Illusion in MLLMs,"Tianyang Han, Qing Lian, Rui Pan, Renjie Pi, Jipeng Zhang, Shizhe Diao, Yong Lin, Tong Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced remarkable progress, where the advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has endowed LLMs with visual capabilities, leading to impressive performances in various multi-modal tasks. However, those powerful MLLMs such as GPT-4V still fail spectacularly when presented with certain image and text inputs. In this paper, we identify a typical class of inputs that baffles MLLMs, which consist of images that are highly relevant but inconsistent with answers, causing MLLMs to suffer from visual illusion. To quantify the effect, we propose CorrelationQA, the first benchmark that assesses the visual illusion level given spurious images. This benchmark contains 7,308 text-image pairs across 13 categories. Based on the proposed CorrelationQA, we conduct a thorough analysis on 9 mainstream MLLMs, illustrating that they universally suffer from this instinctive bias to varying degrees. We hope that our curated benchmark and evaluation results aid in better assessments of the MLLMs' robustness in the presence of misleading images.

INSIDE: LLMs' Internal States Retain the Power of Hallucination Detection,"Chao Chen, Kai Liu, Ze Chen, Yi Gu, Yue Wu, Mingyuan Tao, Zhihang Fu, Jieping Ye","Knowledge hallucination have raised widespread concerns for the security and reliability of deployed LLMs. Previous efforts in detecting hallucinations have been employed at logit-level uncertainty estimation or language-level self-consistency evaluation, where the semantic information is inevitably lost during the token-decoding procedure. Thus, we propose to explore the dense semantic information retained within LLMs' \textbf{IN}ternal \textbf{S}tates for halluc\textbf{I}nation \textbf{DE}tection (\textbf{INSIDE}). In particular, a simple yet effective \textbf{EigenScore} metric is proposed to better evaluate responses' self-consistency, which exploits the eigenvalues of responses' covariance matrix to measure the semantic consistency/diversity in the dense embedding space. Furthermore, from the perspective of self-consistent hallucination detection, a test time feature clipping approach is explored to truncate extreme activations in the internal states, which reduces overconfident generations and potentially benefits the detection of overconfident hallucinations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed on several popular LLMs and question-answering (QA) benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposal.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03744v2,2024-02
Deep Outdated Fact Detection in Knowledge Graphs,"Huiling Tu, Shuo Yu, Vidya Saikrishna, Feng Xia, Karin Verspoor","Knowledge graphs (KGs) have garnered significant attention for their vast potential across diverse domains. However, the issue of outdated facts poses a challenge to KGs, affecting their overall quality as real-world information evolves. Existing solutions for outdated fact detection often rely on manual recognition. In response, this paper presents DEAN (Deep outdatEd fAct detectioN), a novel deep learning-based framework designed to identify outdated facts within KGs. DEAN distinguishes itself by capturing implicit structural information among facts through comprehensive modeling of both entities and relations. To effectively uncover latent out-of-date information, DEAN employs a contrastive approach based on a pre-defined Relations-to-Nodes (R2N) graph, weighted by the number of entities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of DEAN over state-of-the-art baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03732v1,2024-02

Our empirical study demonstrates the superiority of our approach over conventional baselines on multiple datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03728v1,2024-02
Similarity-based Neighbor Selection for Graph LLMs,"Rui Li, Jiwei Li, Jiawei Han, Guoyin Wang","Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) present unique challenges for direct processing by Language Learning Models (LLMs), yet their extensive commonsense knowledge and robust reasoning capabilities offer great promise for node classification in TAGs. Prior research in this field has grappled with issues such as over-squashing, heterophily, and ineffective graph information integration, further compounded by inconsistencies in dataset partitioning and underutilization of advanced LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Similarity-based Neighbor Selection (SNS). Using SimCSE and advanced neighbor selection techniques, SNS effectively improves the quality of selected neighbors, thereby improving graph representation and alleviating issues like over-squashing and heterophily. Besides, as an inductive and training-free approach, SNS demonstrates superior generalization and scalability over traditional GNN methods. Our comprehensive experiments, adhering to standard dataset partitioning practices, demonstrate that SNS, through simple prompt interactions with LLMs, consistently outperforms vanilla GNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results on datasets like PubMed in node classification, showcasing LLMs' potential in graph structure understanding. Our research further underscores the significance of graph structure integration in LLM applications and identifies key factors for their success in node classification.

Empowering Language Models with Active Inquiry for Deeper Understanding,"Jing-Cheng Pang, Heng-Bo Fan, Pengyuan Wang, Jia-Hao Xiao, Nan Tang, Si-Hang Yang, Chengxing Jia, Sheng-Jun Huang, Yang Yu","The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way that we interact with artificial intelligence systems through natural language. However, LLMs often misinterpret user queries because of their uncertain intention, leading to less helpful responses. In natural human interactions, clarification is sought through targeted questioning to uncover obscure information. Thus, in this paper, we introduce LaMAI (Language Model with Active Inquiry), designed to endow LLMs with this same level of interactive engagement. LaMAI leverages active learning techniques to raise the most informative questions, fostering a dynamic bidirectional dialogue. This approach not only narrows the contextual gap but also refines the output of the LLMs, aligning it more closely with user expectations. Our empirical studies, across a variety of complex datasets where LLMs have limited conversational context, demonstrate the effectiveness of LaMAI. The method improves answer accuracy from 31.9% to 50.9%, outperforming other leading question-answering frameworks. Moreover, in scenarios involving human participants, LaMAI consistently generates responses that are superior or comparable to baseline methods in more than 82% of the cases. The applicability of LaMAI is further evidenced by its successful integration with various LLMs, highlighting its potential for the future of interactive language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03719v1,2024-02
Clarify: Improving Model Robustness With Natural Language Corrections,"Yoonho Lee, Michelle S. Lam, Helena Vasconcelos, Michael S. Bernstein, Chelsea Finn","The standard way to teach models is by feeding them lots of data. However, this approach often teaches models incorrect ideas because they pick up on misleading signals in the data. To prevent such misconceptions, we must necessarily provide additional information beyond the training data. Prior methods incorporate additional instance-level supervision, such as labels for misleading features or additional labels for debiased data. However, such strategies require a large amount of labeler effort. We hypothesize that people are good at providing textual feedback at the concept level, a capability that existing teaching frameworks do not leverage. We propose Clarify, a novel interface and method for interactively correcting model misconceptions. Through Clarify, users need only provide a short text description of a model's consistent failure patterns. Then, in an entirely automated way, we use such descriptions to improve the training process. Clarify is the first end-to-end system for user model correction. Our user studies show that non-expert users can successfully describe model misconceptions via Clarify, leading to increased worst-case performance in two datasets. We additionally conduct a case study on a large-scale image dataset, ImageNet, using Clarify to find and rectify 31 novel hard subpopulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03715v3,2024-02
"Listen, Chat, and Edit: Text-Guided Soundscape Modification for Enhanced Auditory Experience","Xilin Jiang, Cong Han, Yinghao Aaron Li, Nima Mesgarani","In daily life, we encounter a variety of sounds, both desirable and undesirable, with limited control over their presence and volume. Our work introduces ""Listen, Chat, and Edit"" (LCE), a novel multimodal sound mixture editor that modifies each sound source in a mixture based on user-provided text instructions. LCE distinguishes itself with a user-friendly chat interface and its unique ability to edit multiple sound sources simultaneously within a mixture, without needing to separate them. Users input open-vocabulary text prompts, which are interpreted by a large language model to create a semantic filter for editing the sound mixture. The system then decomposes the mixture into its components, applies the semantic filter, and reassembles it into the desired output. We developed a 160-hour dataset with over 100k mixtures, including speech and various audio sources, along with text prompts for diverse editing tasks like extraction, removal, and volume control. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in signal quality across all editing tasks and robust performance in zero-shot scenarios with varying numbers and types of sound sources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03710v1,2024-02
Personalized Language Modeling from Personalized Human Feedback,"Xinyu Li, Ruiyang Zhou, Zachary C. Lipton, Liu Leqi","Personalized large language models (LLMs) are designed to tailor responses to individual user preferences. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a commonly used framework for aligning LLMs with human preferences, vanilla RLHF assumes that all human preferences share the same distribution, preventing fine-tuned LLMs from generating personalized content when user preferences are diverse. In this work, we propose Personalized-RLHF (P-RLHF), an efficient framework that utilizes a lightweight user model to capture individual user preferences and jointly learns the user model and the personalized LLM from human feedback. P-RLHF exhibits the following three characteristics: (1) It enables an LLM to generate personalized content and scale efficiently with growing number of users. (2) It handles both explicit user preferences described as textual input and implicit user preferences encoded in the feedback data. (3) It eliminates the need for users to fully articulate their preferences, which are normally needed for prompting LLMs to generate personalized content yet are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Our experimental results show that personalized LLMs trained using P-RLHF generate responses that are more closely aligned with individual user preferences, outperforming vanilla, non-personalized RLHF and prompting-based personalization approaches across different tasks. We opensource our code at https://github.com/HumainLab/Personalized_RLHF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05133v3,2024-02
Are Machines Better at Complex Reasoning? Unveiling Human-Machine Inference Gaps in Entailment Verification,"Soumya Sanyal, Tianyi Xiao, Jiacheng Liu, Wenya Wang, Xiang Ren","Making inferences in text comprehension to understand the meaning is essential in language processing. This work studies the entailment verification (EV) problem of multi-sentence premises that requires a system to make multiple inferences implicitly. Studying EV for such complex premises is important because modern NLP problems, such as detecting inconsistent model-generated rationales, require complex multi-hop reasoning. However, current textual inference datasets mostly contain short premises that only partially focus on these challenges. To address this, we compile an EV benchmark that includes datasets from three NLP domains (NLI, contextual QA, and rationales) containing multi-sentence premises. On benchmarking humans and LLMs, we find that LLMs are better than humans in multi-hop reasoning across extended contexts, while humans perform better in simple deductive reasoning tasks. We also finetune a Flan-T5 model for EV using two training objectives to obtain a strong open-source model that outperforms GPT-3.5 and rivals GPT-4. Finally, we use this model to filter out inconsistent model-generated rationales in self-consistency decoding, resulting in a 6% accuracy improvement on average across three MCQ datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03686v3,2024-02
Large Language Models as an Indirect Reasoner: Contrapositive and Contradiction for Automated Reasoning,"Yanfang Zhang, Yiliu Sun, Yibing Zhan, Dapeng Tao, Dacheng Tao, Chen Gong","Recently, increasing attention has been focused drawn on to improve the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning. However, previous methods, such as Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency, mainly follow Direct Reasoning (DR) frameworks, so they will meet difficulty in solving numerous real-world tasks which can hardly be solved via DR. Therefore, to strengthen the reasoning power of LLMs, this paper proposes a novel Indirect Reasoning (IR) method that employs the logic of contrapositives and contradictions to tackle IR tasks such as factual reasoning and mathematic proof. Specifically, our methodology comprises two steps. Firstly, we leverage the logical equivalence of contrapositive to augment the data and rules to enhance the comprehensibility of LLMs. Secondly, we design a set of prompt templates to trigger LLMs to conduct IR based on proof by contradiction that is logically equivalent to the original DR process. Our IR method is simple yet effective and can be straightforwardly integrated with existing DR methods to further boost the reasoning abilities of LLMs. The experimental results on popular LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-pro, show that our IR method enhances the overall accuracy of factual reasoning by 27.33% and mathematical proof by 31.43%, when compared with traditional DR methods. Moreover, the methods combining IR and DR significantly outperform the methods solely using IR or DR, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03667v1,2024-02
Limits of Large Language Models in Debating Humans,"James Flamino, Mohammed Shahid Modi, Boleslaw K. Szymanski, Brendan Cross, Colton Mikolajczyk","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise in their ability to interact proficiently with humans. Subsequently, their potential use as artificial confederates and surrogates in sociological experiments involving conversation is an exciting prospect. But how viable is this idea? This paper endeavors to test the limits of current-day LLMs with a pre-registered study integrating real people with LLM agents acting as people. The study focuses on debate-based opinion consensus formation in three environments: humans only, agents and humans, and agents only. Our goal is to understand how LLM agents influence humans, and how capable they are in debating like humans. We find that LLMs can blend in and facilitate human productivity but are less convincing in debate, with their behavior ultimately deviating from human's. We elucidate these primary failings and anticipate that LLMs must evolve further before being viable debaters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06049v1,2024-02
Learning to Generate Explainable Stock Predictions using Self-Reflective Large Language Models,"Kelvin J. L. Koa, Yunshan Ma, Ritchie Ng, Tat-Seng Chua","Explaining stock predictions is generally a difficult task for traditional non-generative deep learning models, where explanations are limited to visualizing the attention weights on important texts. Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution to this problem, given their known capabilities to generate human-readable explanations for their decision-making process. However, the task of stock prediction remains challenging for LLMs, as it requires the ability to weigh the varying impacts of chaotic social texts on stock prices. The problem gets progressively harder with the introduction of the explanation component, which requires LLMs to explain verbally why certain factors are more important than the others. On the other hand, to fine-tune LLMs for such a task, one would need expert-annotated samples of explanation for every stock movement in the training set, which is expensive and impractical to scale. To tackle these issues, we propose our Summarize-Explain-Predict (SEP) framework, which utilizes a self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to let a LLM teach itself how to generate explainable stock predictions in a fully autonomous manner. The reflective agent learns how to explain past stock movements through self-reasoning, while the PPO trainer trains the model to generate the most likely explanations from input texts. The training samples for the PPO trainer are also the responses generated during the reflective process, which eliminates the need for human annotators. Using our SEP framework, we fine-tune a LLM that can outperform both traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient for the stock classification task. To justify the generalization capability of our framework, we further test it on the portfolio construction task, and demonstrate its effectiveness through various portfolio metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03659v3,2024-02
Sentiment-enhanced Graph-based Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue,"Kun Ouyang, Liqiang Jing, Xuemeng Song, Meng Liu, Yupeng Hu, Liqiang Nie","Sarcasm Explanation in Dialogue (SED) is a new yet challenging task, which aims to generate a natural language explanation for the given sarcastic dialogue that involves multiple modalities (\ie utterance, video, and audio). Although existing studies have achieved great success based on the generative pretrained language model BART, they overlook exploiting the sentiments residing in the utterance, video and audio, which play important roles in reflecting sarcasm that essentially involves subtle sentiment contrasts. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to incorporate sentiments for boosting SED performance, due to three main challenges: 1) diverse effects of utterance tokens on sentiments; 2) gap between video-audio sentiment signals and the embedding space of BART; and 3) various relations among utterances, utterance sentiments, and video-audio sentiments. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel sEntiment-enhanceD Graph-based multimodal sarcasm Explanation framework, named EDGE. In particular, we first propose a lexicon-guided utterance sentiment inference module, where a heuristic utterance sentiment refinement strategy is devised. We then develop a module named Joint Cross Attention-based Sentiment Inference (JCA-SI) by extending the multimodal sentiment analysis model JCA to derive the joint sentiment label for each video-audio clip. Thereafter, we devise a context-sentiment graph to comprehensively model the semantic relations among the utterances, utterance sentiments, and video-audio sentiments, to facilitate sarcasm explanation generation. Extensive experiments on the publicly released dataset WITS verify the superiority of our model over cutting-edge methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03658v2,2024-02
Stanceosaurus 2.0: Classifying Stance Towards Russian and Spanish Misinformation,"Anton Lavrouk, Ian Ligon, Tarek Naous, Jonathan Zheng, Alan Ritter, Wei Xu","The Stanceosaurus corpus (Zheng et al., 2022) was designed to provide high-quality, annotated, 5-way stance data extracted from Twitter, suitable for analyzing cross-cultural and cross-lingual misinformation. In the Stanceosaurus 2.0 iteration, we extend this framework to encompass Russian and Spanish. The former is of current significance due to prevalent misinformation amid escalating tensions with the West and the violent incursion into Ukraine. The latter, meanwhile, represents an enormous community that has been largely overlooked on major social media platforms. By incorporating an additional 3,874 Spanish and Russian tweets over 41 misinformation claims, our objective is to support research focused on these issues. To demonstrate the value of this data, we employed zero-shot cross-lingual transfer on multilingual BERT, yielding results on par with the initial Stanceosaurus study with a macro F1 score of 43 for both languages. This underlines the viability of stance classification as an effective tool for identifying multicultural misinformation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03642v1,2024-02

We posit that PAgents can reshape professional services through continuously developed expertise. Our proposed PAgents framework entails a tri-layered architecture for genesis, evolution, and synergy: a base tool layer, a middle agent layer, and a top synergy layer. This paper aims to spur discourse on promising real-world applications of LLMs. We argue the increasing sophistication and integration of PAgents could lead to AI systems exhibiting professional mastery over complex domains, serving critical needs, and potentially achieving artificial general intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03628v1,2024-02
Partially Recentralization Softmax Loss for Vision-Language Models Robustness,"Hao Wang, Jinzhe Jiang, Xin Zhang, Chen Li","As Large Language Models make a breakthrough in natural language processing tasks (NLP), multimodal technique becomes extremely popular. However, it has been shown that multimodal NLP are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where the outputs of a model can be dramatically changed by a perturbation to the input. While several defense techniques have been proposed both in computer vision and NLP models, the multimodal robustness of models have not been fully explored. In this paper, we study the adversarial robustness provided by modifying loss function of pre-trained multimodal models, by restricting top K softmax outputs. Based on the evaluation and scoring, our experiments show that after a fine-tuning, adversarial robustness of pre-trained models can be significantly improved, against popular attacks. Further research should be studying, such as output diversity, generalization and the robustness-performance trade-off of this kind of loss functions.

Self-Discover: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures,"Pei Zhou, Jay Pujara, Xiang Ren, Xinyun Chen, Heng-Tze Cheng, Quoc V. Le, Ed H. Chi, Denny Zhou, Swaroop Mishra, Huaixiu Steven Zheng","We introduce SELF-DISCOVER, a general framework for LLMs to self-discover the task-intrinsic reasoning structures to tackle complex reasoning problems that are challenging for typical prompting methods. Core to the framework is a self-discovery process where LLMs select multiple atomic reasoning modules such as critical thinking and step-by-step thinking, and compose them into an explicit reasoning structure for LLMs to follow during decoding. SELF-DISCOVER substantially improves GPT-4 and PaLM 2's performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as BigBench-Hard, grounded agent reasoning, and MATH, by as much as 32% compared to Chain of Thought (CoT). Furthermore, SELF-DISCOVER outperforms inference-intensive methods such as CoT-Self-Consistency by more than 20%, while requiring 10-40x fewer inference compute. Finally, we show that the self-discovered reasoning structures are universally applicable across model families: from PaLM 2-L to GPT-4, and from GPT-4 to Llama2, and share commonalities with human reasoning patterns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03620v1,2024-02
Comparing Abstraction in Humans and Large Language Models Using Multimodal Serial Reproduction,"Sreejan Kumar, Raja Marjieh, Byron Zhang, Declan Campbell, Michael Y. Hu, Umang Bhatt, Brenden Lake, Thomas L. Griffiths","Humans extract useful abstractions of the world from noisy sensory data. Serial reproduction allows us to study how people construe the world through a paradigm similar to the game of telephone, where one person observes a stimulus and reproduces it for the next to form a chain of reproductions. Past serial reproduction experiments typically employ a single sensory modality, but humans often communicate abstractions of the world to each other through language. To investigate the effect language on the formation of abstractions, we implement a novel multimodal serial reproduction framework by asking people who receive a visual stimulus to reproduce it in a linguistic format, and vice versa. We ran unimodal and multimodal chains with both humans and GPT-4 and find that adding language as a modality has a larger effect on human reproductions than GPT-4's. This suggests human visual and linguistic representations are more dissociable than those of GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03618v1,2024-02
Leveraging Large Language Models for Hybrid Workplace Decision Support,"Yujin Kim, Chin-Chia Hsu","Large Language Models (LLMs) hold the potential to perform a variety of text processing tasks and provide textual explanations for proposed actions or decisions. In the era of hybrid work, LLMs can provide intelligent decision support for workers who are designing their hybrid work plans. In particular, they can offer suggestions and explanations to workers balancing numerous decision factors, thereby enhancing their work experience. In this paper, we present a decision support model for workspaces in hybrid work environments, leveraging the reasoning skill of LLMs. We first examine LLM's capability of making suitable workspace suggestions. We find that its reasoning extends beyond the guidelines in the prompt and the LLM can manage the trade-off among the available resources in the workspaces. We conduct an extensive user study to understand workers' decision process for workspace choices and evaluate the effectiveness of the system. We observe that a worker's decision could be influenced by the LLM's suggestions and explanations. The participants in our study find the system to be convenient, regardless of whether reasons are provided or not.

RAP distinguishes itself by being versatile: it excels in both text-only and multimodal environments, making it suitable for a wide range of tasks.

Enhancing Cross-Modal Contextual Congruence for Crowdfunding Success using Knowledge-infused Learning,"Trilok Padhi, Ugur Kursuncu, Yaman Kumar, Valerie L. Shalin, Lane Peterson Fronczek","The digital landscape continually evolves with multimodality, enriching the online experience for users. Creators and marketers aim to weave subtle contextual cues from various modalities into congruent content to engage users with a harmonious message. This interplay of multimodal cues is often a crucial factor in attracting users' attention. However, this richness of multimodality presents a challenge to computational modeling, as the semantic contextual cues spanning across modalities need to be unified to capture the true holistic meaning of the multimodal content. This contextual meaning is critical in attracting user engagement as it conveys the intended message of the brand or the organization. In this work, we incorporate external commonsense knowledge from knowledge graphs to enhance the representation of multimodal data using compact Visual Language Models (VLMs) and predict the success of multi-modal crowdfunding campaigns. Our results show that external knowledge commonsense bridges the semantic gap between text and image modalities, and the enhanced knowledge-infused representations improve the predictive performance of models for campaign success upon the baselines without knowledge. Our findings highlight the significance of contextual congruence in online multimodal content for engaging and successful crowdfunding campaigns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03607v2,2024-02
Breaking Symmetry When Training Transformers,"Chunsheng Zuo, Michael Guerzhoy","As we show in this paper, the prediction for output token $n+1$ of Transformer architectures without one of the mechanisms of positional encodings and causal attention is invariant to permutations of input tokens $1, 2, ..., n-1$. Usually, both mechanisms are employed and the symmetry with respect to the input tokens is broken. Recently, it has been shown that one can train Transformers without positional encodings. This must be enabled by the causal attention mechanism. In this paper, we elaborate on the argument that the causal connection mechanism must be responsible for the fact that Transformers are able to model input sequences where the order is important. Vertical ""slices"" of Transformers are all encouraged to represent the same location $k$ in the input sequence. We hypothesize that residual connections contribute to this phenomenon, and demonstrate evidence for this.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05969v2,2024-02
Identifying Reasons for Contraceptive Switching from Real-World Data Using Large Language Models,"Brenda Y. Miao, Christopher YK Williams, Ebenezer Chinedu-Eneh, Travis Zack, Emily Alsentzer, Atul J. Butte, Irene Y. Chen","Prescription contraceptives play a critical role in supporting women's reproductive health. With nearly 50 million women in the United States using contraceptives, understanding the factors that drive contraceptives selection and switching is of significant interest. However, many factors related to medication switching are often only captured in unstructured clinical notes and can be difficult to extract. Here, we evaluate the zero-shot abilities of a recently developed large language model, GPT-4 (via HIPAA-compliant Microsoft Azure API), to identify reasons for switching between classes of contraceptives from the UCSF Information Commons clinical notes dataset. We demonstrate that GPT-4 can accurately extract reasons for contraceptive switching, outperforming baseline BERT-based models with microF1 scores of 0.849 and 0.881 for contraceptive start and stop extraction, respectively. Human evaluation of GPT-4-extracted reasons for switching showed 91.4% accuracy, with minimal hallucinations. Using extracted reasons, we identified patient preference, adverse events, and insurance as key reasons for switching using unsupervised topic modeling approaches. Notably, we also showed using our approach that ""weight gain/mood change"" and ""insurance coverage"" are disproportionately found as reasons for contraceptive switching in specific demographic populations. Our code and supplemental data are available at https://github.com/BMiao10/contraceptive-switching.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03597v1,2024-02
TexShape: Information Theoretic Sentence Embedding for Language Models,"Kaan Kale, Homa Esfahanizadeh, Noel Elias, Oguzhan Baser, Muriel Medard, Sriram Vishwanath","With the exponential growth in data volume and the emergence of data-intensive applications, particularly in the field of machine learning, concerns related to resource utilization, privacy, and fairness have become paramount. This paper focuses on the textual domain of data and addresses challenges regarding encoding sentences to their optimized representations through the lens of information-theory. In particular, we use empirical estimates of mutual information, using the Donsker-Varadhan definition of Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our approach leverages this estimation to train an information-theoretic sentence embedding, called TexShape, for (task-based) data compression or for filtering out sensitive information, enhancing privacy and fairness. In this study, we employ a benchmark language model for initial text representation, complemented by neural networks for information-theoretic compression and mutual information estimations. Our experiments demonstrate significant advancements in preserving maximal targeted information and minimal sensitive information over adverse compression ratios, in terms of predictive accuracy of downstream models that are trained using the compressed data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05132v2,2024-02
Financial Report Chunking for Effective Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Antonio Jimeno Yepes, Yao You, Jan Milczek, Sebastian Laverde, Renyu Li","Chunking information is a key step in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Current research primarily centers on paragraph-level chunking. This approach treats all texts as equal and neglects the information contained in the structure of documents. We propose an expanded approach to chunk documents by moving beyond mere paragraph-level chunking to chunk primary by structural element components of documents. Dissecting documents into these constituent elements creates a new way to chunk documents that yields the best chunk size without tuning. We introduce a novel framework that evaluates how chunking based on element types annotated by document understanding models contributes to the overall context and accuracy of the information retrieved. We also demonstrate how this approach impacts RAG assisted Question & Answer task performance. Our research includes a comprehensive analysis of various element types, their role in effective information retrieval, and the impact they have on the quality of RAG outputs. Findings support that element type based chunking largely improve RAG results on financial reporting. Through this research, we are also able to answer how to uncover highly accurate RAG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05131v3,2024-02
Distinguishing the Knowable from the Unknowable with Language Models,"Gustaf Ahdritz, Tian Qin, Nikhil Vyas, Boaz Barak, Benjamin L. Edelman","We study the feasibility of identifying epistemic uncertainty (reflecting a lack of knowledge), as opposed to aleatoric uncertainty (reflecting entropy in the underlying distribution), in the outputs of large language models (LLMs) over free-form text. In the absence of ground-truth probabilities, we explore a setting where, in order to (approximately) disentangle a given LLM's uncertainty, a significantly larger model stands in as a proxy for the ground truth. We show that small linear probes trained on the embeddings of frozen, pretrained models accurately predict when larger models will be more confident at the token level and that probes trained on one text domain generalize to others. Going further, we propose a fully unsupervised method that achieves non-trivial accuracy on the same task. Taken together, we interpret these results as evidence that LLMs naturally contain internal representations of different types of uncertainty that could potentially be leveraged to devise more informative indicators of model confidence in diverse practical settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03563v2,2024-02
VLN-Video: Utilizing Driving Videos for Outdoor Vision-and-Language Navigation,"Jialu Li, Aishwarya Padmakumar, Gaurav Sukhatme, Mohit Bansal","Outdoor Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to navigate through realistic 3D outdoor environments based on natural language instructions. The performance of existing VLN methods is limited by insufficient diversity in navigation environments and limited training data. To address these issues, we propose VLN-Video, which utilizes the diverse outdoor environments present in driving videos in multiple cities in the U.S. augmented with automatically generated navigation instructions and actions to improve outdoor VLN performance. VLN-Video combines the best of intuitive classical approaches and modern deep learning techniques, using template infilling to generate grounded navigation instructions, combined with an image rotation similarity-based navigation action predictor to obtain VLN style data from driving videos for pretraining deep learning VLN models. We pre-train the model on the Touchdown dataset and our video-augmented dataset created from driving videos with three proxy tasks: Masked Language Modeling, Instruction and Trajectory Matching, and Next Action Prediction, so as to learn temporally-aware and visually-aligned instruction representations. The learned instruction representation is adapted to the state-of-the-art navigator when fine-tuning on the Touchdown dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that VLN-Video significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 2.1% in task completion rate, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the Touchdown dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03561v2,2024-02
Resolving Transcription Ambiguity in Spanish: A Hybrid Acoustic-Lexical System for Punctuation Restoration,"Xiliang Zhu, Chia-Tien Chang, Shayna Gardiner, David Rossouw, Jonas Robertson","Punctuation restoration is a crucial step after Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems to enhance transcript readability and facilitate subsequent NLP tasks. Nevertheless, conventional lexical-based approaches are inadequate for solving the punctuation restoration task in Spanish, where ambiguity can be often found between unpunctuated declaratives and questions. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid acoustic-lexical punctuation restoration system for Spanish transcription, which consolidates acoustic and lexical signals through a modular process. Our experiment results show that the proposed system can effectively improve F1 score of question marks and overall punctuation restoration on both public and internal Spanish conversational datasets. Additionally, benchmark comparison against LLMs (Large Language Model) indicates the superiority of our approach in accuracy, reliability and latency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Word Error Rate (WER) of the ASR module also benefits from our proposed system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03519v1,2024-02
Evaluating the Factuality of Zero-shot Summarizers Across Varied Domains,"Sanjana Ramprasad, Kundan Krishna, Zachary C Lipton, Byron C Wallace","Recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating summaries zero-shot (i.e., without explicit supervision) that, under human assessment, are often comparable or even preferred to manually composed reference summaries. However, this prior work has focussed almost exclusively on evaluating news article summarization. How do zero-shot summarizers perform in other (potentially more specialized) domains? In this work we evaluate zero-shot generated summaries across specialized domains including biomedical articles, and legal bills (in addition to standard news benchmarks for reference). We focus especially on the factuality of outputs. We acquire annotations from domain experts to identify inconsistencies in summaries and systematically categorize these errors. We analyze whether the prevalence of a given domain in the pretraining corpus affects extractiveness and faithfulness of generated summaries of articles in this domain. We release all collected annotations to facilitate additional research toward measuring and realizing factually accurate summarization, beyond news articles.

Neural networks for abstraction and reasoning: Towards broad generalization in machines,"Mikel Bober-Irizar, Soumya Banerjee","For half a century, artificial intelligence research has attempted to reproduce the human qualities of abstraction and reasoning - creating computer systems that can learn new concepts from a minimal set of examples, in settings where humans find this easy. While specific neural networks are able to solve an impressive range of problems, broad generalisation to situations outside their training data has proved elusive.In this work, we look at several novel approaches for solving the Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a dataset of abstract visual reasoning tasks introduced to test algorithms on broad generalization. Despite three international competitions with $100,000 in prizes, the best algorithms still fail to solve a majority of ARC tasks and rely on complex hand-crafted rules, without using machine learning at all. We revisit whether recent advances in neural networks allow progress on this task.   First, we adapt the DreamCoder neurosymbolic reasoning solver to ARC. DreamCoder automatically writes programs in a bespoke domain-specific language to perform reasoning, using a neural network to mimic human intuition. We present the Perceptual Abstraction and Reasoning Language (PeARL) language, which allows DreamCoder to solve ARC tasks, and propose a new recognition model that allows us to significantly improve on the previous best implementation.We also propose a new encoding and augmentation scheme that allows large language models (LLMs) to solve ARC tasks, and find that the largest models can solve some ARC tasks. LLMs are able to solve a different group of problems to state-of-the-art solvers, and provide an interesting way to complement other approaches. We perform an ensemble analysis, combining models to achieve better results than any system alone. Finally, we publish the arckit Python library to make future research on ARC easier.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03507v1,2024-02
An Inpainting-Infused Pipeline for Attire and Background Replacement,"Felipe Rodrigues Perche-Mahlow, André Felipe-Zanella, William Alberto Cruz-Castañeda, Marcellus Amadeus","In recent years, groundbreaking advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have triggered a transformative paradigm shift, significantly influencing various domains.

Experiments conducted in this study underscore the methodology's efficacy, highlighting its potential to produce visually captivating content. The convergence of these advanced techniques allows users to input photographs of individuals and manipulate them to modify clothing and background based on specific prompts without manually input inpainting masks, effectively placing the subjects within the vast landscape of creative imagination.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03501v1,2024-02
Attention Meets Post-hoc Interpretability: A Mathematical Perspective,"Gianluigi Lopardo, Frederic Precioso, Damien Garreau","Attention-based architectures, in particular transformers, are at the heart of a technological revolution. Interestingly, in addition to helping obtain state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications, the attention mechanism intrinsically provides meaningful insights on the internal behavior of the model. Can these insights be used as explanations? Debate rages on. In this paper, we mathematically study a simple attention-based architecture and pinpoint the differences between post-hoc and attention-based explanations. We show that they provide quite different results, and that, despite their limitations, post-hoc methods are capable of capturing more useful insights than merely examining the attention weights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03485v2,2024-02
Harnessing PubMed User Query Logs for Post Hoc Explanations of Recommended Similar Articles,"Ashley Shin, Qiao Jin, James Anibal, Zhiyong Lu","Searching for a related article based on a reference article is an integral part of scientific research. PubMed, like many academic search engines, has a ""similar articles"" feature that recommends articles relevant to the current article viewed by a user. Explaining recommended items can be of great utility to users, particularly in the literature search process. With more than a million biomedical papers being published each year, explaining the recommended similar articles would facilitate researchers and clinicians in searching for related articles. Nonetheless, the majority of current literature recommendation systems lack explanations for their suggestions. We employ a post hoc approach to explaining recommendations by identifying relevant tokens in the titles of similar articles. Our major contribution is building PubCLogs by repurposing 5.6 million pairs of coclicked articles from PubMed's user query logs. Using our PubCLogs dataset, we train the Highlight Similar Article Title (HSAT), a transformer-based model designed to select the most relevant parts of the title of a similar article, based on the title and abstract of a seed article. HSAT demonstrates strong performance in our empirical evaluations, achieving an F1 score of 91.72 percent on the PubCLogs test set, considerably outperforming several baselines including BM25 (70.62), MPNet (67.11), MedCPT (62.22), GPT-3.5 (46.00), and GPT-4 (64.89). Additional evaluations on a separate, manually annotated test set further verifies HSAT's performance. Moreover, participants of our user study indicate a preference for HSAT, due to its superior balance between conciseness and comprehensiveness. Our study suggests that repurposing user query logs of academic search engines can be a promising way to train state-of-the-art models for explaining literature recommendation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03484v1,2024-02

A Systematic Survey of Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models: Techniques and Applications,"Pranab Sahoo, Ayush Kumar Singh, Sriparna Saha, Vinija Jain, Samrat Mondal, Aman Chadha","Prompt engineering has emerged as an indispensable technique for extending the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). This approach leverages task-specific instructions, known as prompts, to enhance model efficacy without modifying the core model parameters. Rather than updating the model parameters, prompts allow seamless integration of pre-trained models into downstream tasks by eliciting desired model behaviors solely based on the given prompt. Prompts can be natural language instructions that provide context to guide the model or learned vector representations that activate relevant knowledge. This burgeoning field has enabled success across various applications, from question-answering to commonsense reasoning. However, there remains a lack of systematic organization and understanding of the diverse prompt engineering methods and techniques. This survey paper addresses the gap by providing a structured overview of recent advancements in prompt engineering, categorized by application area. For each prompting approach, we provide a summary detailing the prompting methodology, its applications, the models involved, and the datasets utilized. We also delve into the strengths and limitations of each approach and include a taxonomy diagram and table summarizing datasets, models, and critical points of each prompting technique. This systematic analysis enables a better understanding of this rapidly developing field and facilitates future research by illuminating open challenges and opportunities for prompt engineering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07927v1,2024-02
Arabic Synonym BERT-based Adversarial Examples for Text Classification,"Norah Alshahrani, Saied Alshahrani, Esma Wali, Jeanna Matthews","Text classification systems have been proven vulnerable to adversarial text examples, modified versions of the original text examples that are often unnoticed by human eyes, yet can force text classification models to alter their classification. Often, research works quantifying the impact of adversarial text attacks have been applied only to models trained in English. In this paper, we introduce the first word-level study of adversarial attacks in Arabic. Specifically, we use a synonym (word-level) attack using a Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task with a BERT model in a black-box setting to assess the robustness of the state-of-the-art text classification models to adversarial attacks in Arabic. To evaluate the grammatical and semantic similarities of the newly produced adversarial examples using our synonym BERT-based attack, we invite four human evaluators to assess and compare the produced adversarial examples with their original examples. We also study the transferability of these newly produced Arabic adversarial examples to various models and investigate the effectiveness of defense mechanisms against these adversarial examples on the BERT models. We find that fine-tuned BERT models were more susceptible to our synonym attacks than the other Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models like WordCNN and WordLSTM we trained. We also find that fine-tuned BERT models were more susceptible to transferred attacks. We, lastly, find that fine-tuned BERT models successfully regain at least 2% in accuracy after applying adversarial training as an initial defense mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03477v1,2024-02
Psychological Assessments with Large Language Models: A Privacy-Focused and Cost-Effective Approach,Sergi Blanco-Cuaresma,"This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze text comments from Reddit users, aiming to achieve two primary objectives: firstly, to pinpoint critical excerpts that support a predefined psychological assessment of suicidal risk; and secondly, to summarize the material to substantiate the preassigned suicidal risk level. The work is circumscribed to the use of ""open-source"" LLMs that can be run locally, thereby enhancing data privacy. Furthermore, it prioritizes models with low computational requirements, making it accessible to both individuals and institutions operating on limited computing budgets. The implemented strategy only relies on a carefully crafted prompt and a grammar to guide the LLM's text completion. Despite its simplicity, the evaluation metrics show outstanding results, making it a valuable privacy-focused and cost-effective approach.

Nevermind: Instruction Override and Moderation in Large Language Models,Edward Kim,"Given the impressive capabilities of recent Large Language Models (LLMs), we investigate and benchmark the most popular proprietary and different sized open source models on the task of explicit instruction following in conflicting situations, e.g. overrides. These include the ability of the model to override the knowledge within the weights of the model, the ability to override (or moderate) extracted knowledge in the prompt, and lastly the ability to perform a full jailbreak. Experimentation performed suggest several key findings to improve instruction following - larger models perform the best in following instructions that override internal and contextual instructions, and are obedient, even to a fault. When scaling to longer contexts via rope scaling, a significant buffer needs to be maintained from the edge of the perplexity cliff in order to maintain instruction following capabilities. Finally, we observe improving instruction following, and subsequently instruction overrides/jailbreaks, is fundamentally at odds with the ability of a language model to follow given safety filters or guidelines. Thus, we postulate the most effective approach for safe, trustworthy AI should be dealt external to the LLM itself.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03303v1,2024-02
DeepSeekMath: Pushing the Limits of Mathematical Reasoning in Open Language Models,"Zhihong Shao, Peiyi Wang, Qihao Zhu, Runxin Xu, Junxiao Song, Xiao Bi, Haowei Zhang, Mingchuan Zhang, Y. K. Li, Y.

GUARD: Role-playing to Generate Natural-language Jailbreakings to Test Guideline Adherence of Large Language Models,"Haibo Jin, Ruoxi Chen, Andy Zhou, Yang Zhang, Haohan Wang","The discovery of ""jailbreaks"" to bypass safety filters of Large Language Models (LLMs) and harmful responses have encouraged the community to implement safety measures. One major safety measure is to proactively test the LLMs with jailbreaks prior to the release. Therefore, such testing will require a method that can generate jailbreaks massively and efficiently. In this paper, we follow a novel yet intuitive strategy to generate jailbreaks in the style of the human generation. We propose a role-playing system that assigns four different roles to the user LLMs to collaborate on new jailbreaks. Furthermore, we collect existing jailbreaks and split them into different independent characteristics using clustering frequency and semantic patterns sentence by sentence. We organize these characteristics into a knowledge graph, making them more accessible and easier to retrieve. Our system of different roles will leverage this knowledge graph to generate new jailbreaks, which have proved effective in inducing LLMs to generate unethical or guideline-violating responses. In addition, we also pioneer a setting in our system that will automatically follow the government-issued guidelines to generate jailbreaks to test whether LLMs follow the guidelines accordingly. We refer to our system as GUARD (Guideline Upholding through Adaptive Role-play Diagnostics). We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on three cutting-edge open-sourced LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, and Llama-2-7B), as well as a widely-utilized commercial LLM (ChatGPT). Moreover, our work extends to the realm of vision language models (MiniGPT-v2 and Gemini Vision Pro), showcasing GUARD's versatility and contributing valuable insights for the development of safer, more reliable LLM-based applications across diverse modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03299v4,2024-02
"Deal, or no deal (or who knows)? Forecasting Uncertainty in Conversations using Large Language Models","Anthony Sicilia, Hyunwoo Kim, Khyathi Raghavi Chandu, Malihe Alikhani, Jack Hessel","Effective interlocutors account for the uncertain goals, beliefs, and emotions of others. But even the best human conversationalist cannot perfectly anticipate the trajectory of a dialogue. How well can language models represent inherent uncertainty in conversations? We propose FortUne Dial, an expansion of the long-standing ""conversation forecasting"" task: instead of just accuracy, evaluation is conducted with uncertainty-aware metrics, effectively enabling abstention on individual instances. We study two ways in which language models potentially represent outcome uncertainty (internally, using scores and directly, using tokens) and propose fine-tuning strategies to improve calibration of both representations. Experiments on eight difficult negotiation corpora demonstrate that our proposed fine-tuning strategies (a traditional supervision strategy and an off-policy reinforcement learning strategy) can calibrate smaller open-source models to compete with pre-trained models 10x their size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03284v1,2024-02
Uncertainty of Thoughts: Uncertainty-Aware Planning Enhances Information Seeking in Large Language Models,"Zhiyuan Hu, Chumin Liu, Xidong Feng, Yilun Zhao, See-Kiong Ng, Anh Tuan Luu, Junxian He, Pang Wei Koh, Bryan Hooi","In the face of uncertainty, the ability to *seek information* is of fundamental importance. In many practical applications, such as medical diagnosis and troubleshooting, the information needed to solve the task is not initially given and has to be actively sought by asking follow-up questions (for example, a doctor asking a patient for more details about their symptoms). In this work, we introduce Uncertainty of Thoughts (UoT), an algorithm to augment large language models with the ability to actively seek information by asking effective questions. UoT combines 1) an *uncertainty-aware simulation approach* which enables the model to simulate possible future scenarios and how likely they are to occur, 2) *uncertainty-based rewards* motivated by information gain which incentivizes the model to seek information, and 3) a *reward propagation scheme* to select the optimal question to ask in a way that maximizes the expected reward. In experiments on medical diagnosis, troubleshooting, and the `20 Questions` game, UoT achieves an average performance improvement of 38.1% in the rate of successful task completion across multiple LLMs compared with direct prompting and also improves efficiency (i.e., the number of questions needed to complete the task).

Meanwhile, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) system has provided an interpretable, language-independent method for transcribing human speech sounds. In this paper, we introduce ISPA (Inter-Species Phonetic Alphabet), a precise, concise, and interpretable system designed for transcribing animal sounds into text. We compare acoustics-based and feature-based methods for transcribing and classifying animal sounds, demonstrating their comparable performance with baseline methods utilizing continuous, dense audio representations. By representing animal sounds with text, we effectively treat them as a ""foreign language,"" and we show that established human language ML paradigms and models, such as language models, can be successfully applied to improve performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03269v1,2024-02
Understanding Reasoning Ability of Language Models From the Perspective of Reasoning Paths Aggregation,"Xinyi Wang, Alfonso Amayuelas, Kexun Zhang, Liangming Pan, Wenhu Chen, William Yang Wang","Pre-trained language models (LMs) are able to perform complex reasoning without explicit fine-tuning. To understand how pre-training with a next-token prediction objective contributes to the emergence of such reasoning capability, we propose that we can view an LM as deriving new conclusions by aggregating indirect reasoning paths seen at pre-training time. We found this perspective effective in two important cases of reasoning: logic reasoning with knowledge graphs (KGs) and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. More specifically, we formalize the reasoning paths as random walk paths on the knowledge/reasoning graphs. Analyses of learned LM distributions suggest that a weighted sum of relevant random walk path probabilities is a reasonable way to explain how LMs reason. Experiments and analysis on multiple KG and CoT datasets reveal the effect of training on random walk paths and suggest that augmenting unlabeled random walk reasoning paths can improve real-world multi-step reasoning performance. code: https://github.com/WANGXinyiLinda/LM_random_walk",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03268v3,2024-02
Skill Set Optimization: Reinforcing Language Model Behavior via Transferable Skills,"Kolby Nottingham, Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Sameer Singh, Peter Clark, Roy Fox","Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used for sequential decision making in interactive environments. However, leveraging environment reward signals for continual LLM actor improvement is not straightforward. We propose Skill Set Optimization (SSO) for improving LLM actor performance through constructing and refining sets of transferable skills. SSO constructs skills by extracting common subtrajectories with high rewards and generating subgoals and instructions to represent each skill. These skills are provided to the LLM actor in-context to reinforce behaviors with high rewards. Then, SSO further refines the skill set by pruning skills that do not continue to result in high rewards. We evaluate our method in the classic videogame NetHack and the text environment ScienceWorld to demonstrate SSO's ability to optimize a set of skills and perform in-context policy improvement. SSO outperforms baselines by 40% in our custom NetHack task and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in ScienceWorld by 35%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03244v2,2024-02
JOBSKAPE: A Framework for Generating Synthetic Job Postings to Enhance Skill Matching,"Antoine Magron, Anna Dai, Mike Zhang, Syrielle Montariol, Antoine Bosselut","Recent approaches in skill matching, employing synthetic training data for classification or similarity model training, have shown promising results, reducing the need for time-consuming and expensive annotations.

Within this framework, we create SkillSkape, a comprehensive open-source synthetic dataset of job postings tailored for skill-matching tasks. We introduce several offline metrics that show that our dataset resembles real-world data.

English Prompts are Better for NLI-based Zero-Shot Emotion Classification than Target-Language Prompts,"Patrick Bareiß, Roman Klinger, Jeremy Barnes","Emotion classification in text is a challenging task due to the processes involved when interpreting a textual description of a potential emotion stimulus. In addition, the set of emotion categories is highly domain-specific. For instance, literature analysis might require the use of aesthetic emotions (e.g., finding something beautiful), and social media analysis could benefit from fine-grained sets (e.g., separating anger from annoyance) than only those that represent basic categories as they have been proposed by Paul Ekman (anger, disgust, fear, joy, surprise, sadness). This renders the task an interesting field for zero-shot classifications, in which the label set is not known at model development time. Unfortunately, most resources for emotion analysis are English, and therefore, most studies on emotion analysis have been performed in English, including those that involve prompting language models for text labels. This leaves us with a research gap that we address in this paper: In which language should we prompt for emotion labels on non-English texts? This is particularly of interest when we have access to a multilingual large language model, because we could request labels with English prompts even for non-English data. Our experiments with natural language inference-based language models show that it is consistently better to use English prompts even if the data is in a different language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03223v4,2024-02
"""Define Your Terms"" : Enhancing Efficient Offensive Speech Classification with Definition","Huy Nghiem, Umang Gupta, Fred Morstatter","The propagation of offensive content through social media channels has garnered attention of the research community. Multiple works have proposed various semantically related yet subtle distinct categories of offensive speech. In this work, we explore meta-earning approaches to leverage the diversity of offensive speech corpora to enhance their reliable and efficient detection. We propose a joint embedding architecture that incorporates the input's label and definition for classification via Prototypical Network. Our model achieves at least 75% of the maximal F1-score while using less than 10% of the available training data across 4 datasets. Our experimental findings also provide a case study of training strategies valuable to combat resource scarcity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03221v1,2024-02
"BGE M3-Embedding: Multi-Lingual, Multi-Functionality, Multi-Granularity Text Embeddings Through Self-Knowledge Distillation","Jianlv Chen, Shitao Xiao, Peitian Zhang, Kun Luo, Defu Lian, Zheng Liu","In this paper, we present a new embedding model, called M3-Embedding, which is distinguished for its versatility in Multi-Linguality, Multi-Functionality, and Multi-Granularity. It can support more than 100 working languages, leading to new state-of-the-art performances on multi-lingual and cross-lingual retrieval tasks. It can simultaneously perform the three common retrieval functionalities of embedding model: dense retrieval, multi-vector retrieval, and sparse retrieval, which provides a unified model foundation for real-world IR applications. It is able to process inputs of different granularities, spanning from short sentences to long documents of up to 8192 tokens. The effective training of M3-Embedding involves the following technical contributions. We propose a novel self-knowledge distillation approach, where the relevance scores from different retrieval functionalities can be integrated as the teacher signal to enhance the training quality. We also optimize the batching strategy, enabling a large batch size and high training throughput to ensure the discriminativeness of embeddings. To the best of our knowledge, M3-Embedding is the first embedding model which realizes such a strong versatility.

"Isotropy, Clusters, and Classifiers","Timothee Mickus, Stig-Arne Grönroos, Joseph Attieh","Whether embedding spaces use all their dimensions equally, i.e., whether they are isotropic, has been a recent subject of discussion. Evidence has been accrued both for and against enforcing isotropy in embedding spaces. In the present paper, we stress that isotropy imposes requirements on the embedding space that are not compatible with the presence of clusters -- which also negatively impacts linear classification objectives. We demonstrate this fact both mathematically and empirically and use it to shed light on previous results from the literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03191v3,2024-02
Unified Hallucination Detection for Multimodal Large Language Models,"Xiang Chen, Chenxi Wang, Yida Xue, Ningyu Zhang, Xiaoyan Yang, Qiang Li, Yue Shen, Lei Liang, Jinjie Gu, Huajun Chen","Despite significant strides in multimodal tasks, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are plagued by the critical issue of hallucination. The reliable detection of such hallucinations in MLLMs has, therefore, become a vital aspect of model evaluation and the safeguarding of practical application deployment. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by a narrow focus on singular tasks, an inadequate range of hallucination categories addressed, and a lack of detailed granularity. In response to these challenges, our work expands the investigative horizons of hallucination detection. We present a novel meta-evaluation benchmark, MHaluBench, meticulously crafted to facilitate the evaluation of advancements in hallucination detection methods. Additionally, we unveil a novel unified multimodal hallucination detection framework, UNIHD, which leverages a suite of auxiliary tools to validate the occurrence of hallucinations robustly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UNIHD through meticulous evaluation and comprehensive analysis.

LB-KBQA: Large-language-model and BERT based Knowledge-Based Question and Answering System,"Yan Zhao, Zhongyun Li, Yushan Pan, Jiaxing Wang, Yihong Wang","Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), because of its emergent abilities, has empowered various fields, one typical of which is large language models (LLMs). One of the typical application fields of Generative AI is large language models (LLMs), and the natural language understanding capability of LLM is dramatically improved when compared with conventional AI-based methods. The natural language understanding capability has always been a barrier to the intent recognition performance of the Knowledge-Based-Question-and-Answer (KBQA) system, which arises from linguistic diversity and the newly appeared intent. Conventional AI-based methods for intent recognition can be divided into semantic parsing-based and model-based approaches. However, both of the methods suffer from limited resources in intent recognition. To address this issue, we propose a novel KBQA system based on a Large Language Model(LLM) and BERT (LB-KBQA). With the help of generative AI, our proposed method could detect newly appeared intent and acquire new knowledge.

C-RAG: Certified Generation Risks for Retrieval-Augmented Language Models,"Mintong Kang, Nezihe Merve Gürel, Ning Yu, Dawn Song, Bo Li","Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across diverse applications, they still suffer from trustworthiness issues, such as hallucinations and misalignments. Retrieval-augmented language models (RAG) have been proposed to enhance the credibility of generations by grounding external knowledge, but the theoretical understandings of their generation risks remains unexplored. In this paper, we answer: 1) whether RAG can indeed lead to low generation risks, 2) how to provide provable guarantees on the generation risks of RAG and vanilla LLMs, and 3) what sufficient conditions enable RAG models to reduce generation risks. We propose C-RAG, the first framework to certify generation risks for RAG models. Specifically, we provide conformal risk analysis for RAG models and certify an upper confidence bound of generation risks, which we refer to as conformal generation risk. We also provide theoretical guarantees on conformal generation risks for general bounded risk functions under test distribution shifts. We prove that RAG achieves a lower conformal generation risk than that of a single LLM when the quality of the retrieval model and transformer is non-trivial. Our intensive empirical results demonstrate the soundness and tightness of our conformal generation risk guarantees across four widely-used NLP datasets on four state-of-the-art retrieval models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03181v5,2024-02

However, current instruction datasets predominantly cater to English or are derived from English-dominated LLMs, resulting in inherent biases toward Western culture. This bias significantly impacts the linguistic structures of non-English languages such as Arabic, which has a distinct grammar reflective of the diverse cultures across the Arab region. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing CIDAR: https://hf.co/datasets/arbml/CIDAR, the first open Arabic instruction-tuning dataset culturally-aligned by human reviewers. CIDAR contains 10,000 instruction and output pairs that represent the Arab region.

Accurate and Well-Calibrated ICD Code Assignment Through Attention Over Diverse Label Embeddings,"Gonçalo Gomes, Isabel Coutinho, Bruno Martins","Although the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been adopted worldwide, manually assigning ICD codes to clinical text is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive, motivating the development of automated approaches. This paper describes a novel approach for automated ICD coding, combining several ideas from previous related work. We specifically employ a strong Transformer-based model as a text encoder and, to handle lengthy clinical narratives, we explored either (a) adapting the base encoder model into a Longformer, or (b) dividing the text into chunks and processing each chunk independently. The representations produced by the encoder are combined with a label embedding mechanism that explores diverse ICD code synonyms. Experiments with different splits of the MIMIC-III dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art models in ICD coding, with the label embeddings significantly contributing to the good performance. Our approach also leads to properly calibrated classification results, which can effectively inform downstream tasks such as quantification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03172v1,2024-02

Linguistic features for sentence difficulty prediction in ABSA,"Adrian-Gabriel Chifu, Sébastien Fournier","One of the challenges of natural language understanding is to deal with the subjectivity of sentences, which may express opinions and emotions that add layers of complexity and nuance. Sentiment analysis is a field that aims to extract and analyze these subjective elements from text, and it can be applied at different levels of granularity, such as document, paragraph, sentence, or aspect. Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a well-studied topic with many available data sets and models. However, there is no clear definition of what makes a sentence difficult for aspect-based sentiment analysis. In this paper, we explore this question by conducting an experiment with three data sets: ""Laptops"", ""Restaurants"", and ""MTSC"" (Multi-Target-dependent Sentiment Classification), and a merged version of these three datasets. We study the impact of domain diversity and syntactic diversity on difficulty. We use a combination of classifiers to identify the most difficult sentences and analyze their characteristics. We employ two ways of defining sentence difficulty. The first one is binary and labels a sentence as difficult if the classifiers fail to correctly predict the sentiment polarity. The second one is a six-level scale based on how many of the top five best-performing classifiers can correctly predict the sentiment polarity. We also define 9 linguistic features that, combined, aim at estimating the difficulty at sentence level.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03163v1,2024-02

Compared to static images, video poses unique challenges for effective large-scale pre-training due to the modeling of its spatiotemporal dynamics. In this paper, we address such limitations in video-language pre-training with an efficient video decomposition that represents each video as keyframes and temporal motions. These are then adapted to an LLM using well-designed tokenizers that discretize visual and temporal information as a few tokens, thus enabling unified generative pre-training of videos, images, and text. At inference, the generated tokens from the LLM are carefully recovered to the original continuous pixel space to create various video content. Our proposed framework is both capable of comprehending and generating image and video content, as demonstrated by its competitive performance across 13 multimodal benchmarks in image and video understanding and generation.

Less is KEN: a Universal and Simple Non-Parametric Pruning Algorithm for Large Language Models,"Michele Mastromattei, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto","Neural network pruning has become increasingly crucial due to the complexity of these models and their widespread use in various fields. Existing pruning algorithms often suffer from limitations such as architecture specificity, excessive complexity and reliance on demanding calculations, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. This paper introduces KEN: a straightforward, universal and unstructured pruning algorithm based on Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). KEN aims to construct optimized transformers by selectively preserving the most significant parameters while restoring others to their pre-training state. This strategy preserves model performance while enabling storage of only the optimized subnetwork, leading to substantial memory savings. Extensive evaluations across seven different LLMs demonstrate that KEN achieves equal or better performance than their original unpruned versions, with a minimum parameter reduction of 25%. Furthermore, in-depth comparisons with established pruning and PEFT algorithms confirm KEN effectiveness. We further introduce KEN$_{viz}$, an explainable tool that visualizes the optimized model composition achieved by KEN from different points of view.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03142v2,2024-02
Sociolinguistically Informed Interpretability: A Case Study on Hinglish Emotion Classification,"Kushal Tatariya, Heather Lent, Johannes Bjerva, Miryam de Lhoneux","Emotion classification is a challenging task in NLP due to the inherent idiosyncratic and subjective nature of linguistic expression, especially with code-mixed data. Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved high performance for many tasks and languages, but it remains to be seen whether these models learn and are robust to the differences in emotional expression across languages. Sociolinguistic studies have shown that Hinglish speakers switch to Hindi when expressing negative emotions and to English when expressing positive emotions. To understand if language models can learn these associations, we study the effect of language on emotion prediction across 3 PLMs on a Hinglish emotion classification dataset. Using LIME and token level language ID, we find that models do learn these associations between language choice and emotional expression. Moreover, having code-mixed data present in the pre-training can augment that learning when task-specific data is scarce. We also conclude from the misclassifications that the models may overgeneralise this heuristic to other infrequent examples where this sociolinguistic phenomenon does not apply.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03137v1,2024-02
Constrained Decoding for Cross-lingual Label Projection,"Duong Minh Le, Yang Chen, Alan Ritter, Wei Xu","Zero-shot cross-lingual transfer utilizing multilingual LLMs has become a popular learning paradigm for low-resource languages with no labeled training data. However, for NLP tasks that involve fine-grained predictions on words and phrases, the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning lags far behind supervised fine-tuning methods. Therefore, it is common to exploit translation and label projection to further improve the performance by (1) translating training data that is available in a high-resource language (e.g., English) together with the gold labels into low-resource languages, and/or (2) translating test data in low-resource languages to a high-source language to run inference on, then projecting the predicted span-level labels back onto the original test data. However, state-of-the-art marker-based label projection methods suffer from translation quality degradation due to the extra label markers injected in the input to the translation model. In this work, we explore a new direction that leverages constrained decoding for label projection to overcome the aforementioned issues. Our new method not only can preserve the quality of translated texts but also has the versatility of being applicable to both translating training and translating test data strategies. This versatility is crucial as our experiments reveal that translating test data can lead to a considerable boost in performance compared to translating only training data. We evaluate on two cross-lingual transfer tasks, namely Named Entity Recognition and Event Argument Extraction, spanning 20 languages. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art marker-based method by a large margin and also shows better performance than other label projection methods that rely on external word alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03131v1,2024-02
Best Practices for Text Annotation with Large Language Models,Petter Törnberg,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era of text annotation, as their ease-of-use, high accuracy, and relatively low costs have meant that their use has exploded in recent months. However, the rapid growth of the field has meant that LLM-based annotation has become something of an academic Wild West: the lack of established practices and standards has led to concerns about the quality and validity of research. Researchers have warned that the ostensible simplicity of LLMs can be misleading, as they are prone to bias, misunderstandings, and unreliable results. Recognizing the transformative potential of LLMs, this paper proposes a comprehensive set of standards and best practices for their reliable, reproducible, and ethical use. These guidelines span critical areas such as model selection, prompt engineering, structured prompting, prompt stability analysis, rigorous model validation, and the consideration of ethical and legal implications. The paper emphasizes the need for a structured, directed, and formalized approach to using LLMs, aiming to ensure the integrity and robustness of text annotation practices, and advocates for a nuanced and critical engagement with LLMs in social scientific research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05129v1,2024-02
Intent-based Prompt Calibration: Enhancing prompt optimization with synthetic boundary cases,"Elad Levi, Eli Brosh, Matan Friedmann","Prompt engineering is a challenging and important task due to the high sensitivity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the given prompt and the inherent ambiguity of a textual task instruction. Automatic prompt engineering is essential to achieve optimized performance from LLMs. Recent studies have demonstrated the capabilities of LLMs to automatically conduct prompt engineering by employing a meta-prompt that incorporates the outcomes of the last trials and proposes an improved prompt. However, this requires a high-quality benchmark to compare different prompts, which is difficult and expensive to acquire in many real-world use cases. In this work, we introduce a new method for automatic prompt engineering, using a calibration process that iteratively refines the prompt to the user intent. During the optimization process, the system jointly generates synthetic data of boundary use cases and optimizes the prompt according to the generated dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with respect to strong proprietary models on real-world tasks such as moderation and generation. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a limited number of annotated samples. Furthermore, we validate the advantages of each one of the system's key components. Our system is built in a modular way, facilitating easy adaptation to other tasks.

Enhancing the Stability of LLM-based Speech Generation Systems through Self-Supervised Representations,"Álvaro Martín-Cortinas, Daniel Sáez-Trigueros, Iván Vallés-Pérez, Biel Tura-Vecino, Piotr Biliński, Mateusz Lajszczak, Grzegorz Beringer, Roberto Barra-Chicote, Jaime Lorenzo-Trueba","Large Language Models (LLMs) are one of the most promising technologies for the next era of speech generation systems, due to their scalability and in-context learning capabilities. Nevertheless, they suffer from multiple stability issues at inference time, such as hallucinations, content skipping or speech repetitions. In this work, we introduce a new self-supervised Voice Conversion (VC) architecture which can be used to learn to encode transitory features, such as content, separately from stationary ones, such as speaker ID or recording conditions, creating speaker-disentangled representations. Using speaker-disentangled codes to train LLMs for text-to-speech (TTS) allows the LLM to generate the content and the style of the speech only from the text, similarly to humans, while the speaker identity is provided by the decoder of the VC model. Results show that LLMs trained over speaker-disentangled self-supervised representations provide an improvement of 4.7pp in speaker similarity over SOTA entangled representations, and a word error rate (WER) 5.4pp lower. Furthermore, they achieve higher naturalness than human recordings of the LibriTTS test-other dataset. Finally, we show that using explicit reference embedding negatively impacts intelligibility (stability), with WER increasing by 14pp compared to the model that only uses text to infer the style.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03407v1,2024-02
Multilingual transformer and BERTopic for short text topic modeling: The case of Serbian,"Darija Medvecki, Bojana Bašaragin, Adela Ljajić, Nikola Milošević","This paper presents the results of the first application of BERTopic, a state-of-the-art topic modeling technique, to short text written in a morphologi-cally rich language. We applied BERTopic with three multilingual embed-ding models on two levels of text preprocessing (partial and full) to evalu-ate its performance on partially preprocessed short text in Serbian. We also compared it to LDA and NMF on fully preprocessed text. The experiments were conducted on a dataset of tweets expressing hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccination. Our results show that with adequate parameter setting, BERTopic can yield informative topics even when applied to partially pre-processed short text. When the same parameters are applied in both prepro-cessing scenarios, the performance drop on partially preprocessed text is minimal. Compared to LDA and NMF, judging by the keywords, BERTopic offers more informative topics and gives novel insights when the number of topics is not limited.

Muddamsetty, Asta Sofie Stage Jarlner, Anna Murphy Høgenhaug, Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen, Thomas B. Moeslund","Explainable AI (XAI) aids in deciphering 'black-box' models. While several methods have been proposed and evaluated primarily in the image domain, the exploration of explainability in the text domain remains a growing research area. In this paper, we delve into the applicability of XAI methods for the text domain. In this context, the 'Similarity Difference and Uniqueness' (SIDU) XAI method, recognized for its superior capability in localizing entire salient regions in image-based classification is extended to textual data. The extended method, SIDU-TXT, utilizes feature activation maps from 'black-box' models to generate heatmaps at a granular, word-based level, thereby providing explanations that highlight contextually significant textual elements crucial for model predictions. Given the absence of a unified standard for assessing XAI methods, this study applies a holistic three-tiered comprehensive evaluation framework: Functionally-Grounded, Human-Grounded and Application-Grounded, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed SIDU-TXT across various experiments. We find that, in sentiment analysis task of a movie review dataset, SIDU-TXT excels in both functionally and human-grounded evaluations, demonstrating superior performance through quantitative and qualitative analyses compared to benchmarks like Grad-CAM and LIME. In the application-grounded evaluation within the sensitive and complex legal domain of asylum decision-making, SIDU-TXT and Grad-CAM demonstrate comparable performances, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses.

Automatic Combination of Sample Selection Strategies for Few-Shot Learning,"Branislav Pecher, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova, Joaquin Vanschoren","In few-shot learning, such as meta-learning, few-shot fine-tuning or in-context learning, the limited number of samples used to train a model have a significant impact on the overall success. Although a large number of sample selection strategies exist, their impact on the performance of few-shot learning is not extensively known, as most of them have been so far evaluated in typical supervised settings only. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the impact of 20 sample selection strategies on the performance of 5 few-shot learning approaches over 8 image and 6 text datasets. In addition, we propose a new method for automatic combination of sample selection strategies (ACSESS) that leverages the strengths and complementary information of the individual strategies. The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms the individual selection strategies, as well as the recently proposed method for selecting support examples for in-context learning. We also show a strong modality, dataset and approach dependence for the majority of strategies as well as their dependence on the number of shots - demonstrating that the sample selection strategies play a significant role for lower number of shots, but regresses to random selection at higher number of shots.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03038v1,2024-02
UniMem: Towards a Unified View of Long-Context Large Language Models,"Junjie Fang, Likai Tang, Hongzhe Bi, Yujia Qin, Si Sun, Zhenyu Li, Haolun Li, Yongjian Li, Xin Cong, Yankai Lin, Yukun Yan, Xiaodong Shi, Sen Song, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Long-context processing is a critical ability that constrains the applicability of large language models (LLMs).

We re-formulate 16 existing methods based on UniMem and analyze four representative methods: Transformer-XL, Memorizing Transformer, RMT, and Longformer into equivalent UniMem forms to reveal their design principles and strengths.

Decoding-time Realignment of Language Models,"Tianlin Liu, Shangmin Guo, Leonardo Bianco, Daniele Calandriello, Quentin Berthet, Felipe Llinares, Jessica Hoffmann, Lucas Dixon, Michal Valko, Mathieu Blondel","Aligning language models with human preferences is crucial for reducing errors and biases in these models. Alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), are typically cast as optimizing a tradeoff between human preference rewards and a proximity regularization term that encourages staying close to the unaligned model. Selecting an appropriate level of regularization is critical: insufficient regularization can lead to reduced model capabilities due to reward hacking, whereas excessive regularization hinders alignment. Traditional methods for finding the optimal regularization level require retraining multiple models with varying regularization strengths. This process, however, is resource-intensive, especially for large models. To address this challenge, we propose decoding-time realignment (DeRa), a simple method to explore and evaluate different regularization strengths in aligned models without retraining. DeRa enables control over the degree of alignment, allowing users to smoothly transition between unaligned and aligned models. It also enhances the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning by enabling the identification of effective regularization strengths using a validation dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02992v2,2024-02

The adversary could induce GPT models to leak such contents by querying them with designed malicious prompts. Our comprehensive examination of privacy risks during the interactions with GPT models under this attack reveals GPT-4's considerable resilience. We present two advanced attacks targeting improved reconstruction of past conversations, demonstrating significant privacy leakage across all models under these advanced techniques. Evaluating various defense mechanisms, we find them ineffective against these attacks. Our findings highlight the ease with which privacy can be compromised in interactions with GPT models, urging the community to safeguard against potential abuses of these models' capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02987v2,2024-02
Putting Context in Context: the Impact of Discussion Structure on Text Classification,"Nicolò Penzo, Antonio Longa, Bruno Lepri, Sara Tonelli, Marco Guerini","Current text classification approaches usually focus on the content to be classified. Contextual aspects (both linguistic and extra-linguistic) are usually neglected, even in tasks based on online discussions. Still in many cases the multi-party and multi-turn nature of the context from which these elements are selected can be fruitfully exploited. In this work, we propose a series of experiments on a large dataset for stance detection in English, in which we evaluate the contribution of different types of contextual information, i.e. linguistic, structural and temporal, by feeding them as natural language input into a transformer-based model. We also experiment with different amounts of training data and analyse the topology of local discussion networks in a privacy-compliant way. Results show that structural information can be highly beneficial to text classification but only under certain circumstances (e.g. depending on the amount of training data and on discussion chain complexity). Indeed, we show that contextual information on smaller datasets from other classification tasks does not yield significant improvements. Our framework, based on local discussion networks, allows the integration of structural information, while minimising user profiling, thus preserving their privacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02975v1,2024-02
Towards Understanding the Word Sensitivity of Attention Layers: A Study via Random Features,"Simone Bombari, Marco Mondelli","Understanding the reasons behind the exceptional success of transformers requires a better analysis of why attention layers are suitable for NLP tasks. In particular, such tasks require predictive models to capture contextual meaning which often depends on one or few words, even if the sentence is long. Our work studies this key property, dubbed word sensitivity (WS), in the prototypical setting of random features. We show that attention layers enjoy high WS, namely, there exists a vector in the space of embeddings that largely perturbs the random attention features map. The argument critically exploits the role of the softmax in the attention layer, highlighting its benefit compared to other activations (e.g., ReLU). In contrast, the WS of standard random features is of order $1/\sqrt{n}$, $n$ being the number of words in the textual sample, and thus it decays with the length of the context. We then translate these results on the word sensitivity into generalization bounds: due to their low WS, random features provably cannot learn to distinguish between two sentences that differ only in a single word; in contrast, due to their high WS, random attention features have higher generalization capabilities. We validate our theoretical results with experimental evidence over the BERT-Base word embeddings of the imdb review dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02969v2,2024-02
A Survey on Transformer Compression,"Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang, Jianyuan Guo, Zhijun Tu, Kai Han, Hailin Hu, Dacheng Tao","Transformer plays a vital role in the realms of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), specially for constructing large language models (LLM) and large vision models (LVM). Model compression methods reduce the memory and computational cost of Transformer, which is a necessary step to implement large language/vision models on practical devices. Given the unique architecture of Transformer, featuring alternative attention and feedforward neural network (FFN) modules, specific compression techniques are usually required. The efficiency of these compression methods is also paramount, as retraining large models on the entire training dataset is usually impractical. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent compression methods, with a specific focus on their application to Transformer-based models. The compression methods are primarily categorized into pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and efficient architecture design (Mamba, RetNet, RWKV, etc.). In each category, we discuss compression methods for both language and vision tasks, highlighting common underlying principles. Finally, we delve into the relation between various compression methods, and discuss further directions in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05964v2,2024-02
Enhancing Textbook Question Answering Task with Large Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Hessa Abdulrahman Alawwad, Areej Alhothali, Usman Naseem, Ali Alkhathlan, Amani Jamal","Textbook question answering (TQA) is a challenging task in artificial intelligence due to the complex nature of context and multimodal data. Although previous research has significantly improved the task, there are still some limitations including the models' weak reasoning and inability to capture contextual information in the lengthy context. The introduction of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of AI, however, directly applying LLMs often leads to inaccurate answers. This paper proposes a methodology that handle the out-of-domain scenario in TQA where concepts are spread across different lessons by incorporating the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technique and utilize transfer learning to handle the long context and enhance reasoning abilities. Through supervised fine-tuning of the LLM model Llama-2 and the incorporation of RAG, our architecture outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.12% accuracy improvement on validation set and 9.84% on test set for non-diagram multiple-choice questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05128v2,2024-02
Automated Cognate Detection as a Supervised Link Prediction Task with Cognate Transformer,"V. S. D. S. Mahesh Akavarapu, Arnab Bhattacharya","Identification of cognates across related languages is one of the primary problems in historical linguistics. Automated cognate identification is helpful for several downstream tasks including identifying sound correspondences, proto-language reconstruction, phylogenetic classification, etc. Previous state-of-the-art methods for cognate identification are mostly based on distributions of phonemes computed across multilingual wordlists and make little use of the cognacy labels that define links among cognate clusters. In this paper, we present a transformer-based architecture inspired by computational biology for the task of automated cognate detection. Beyond a certain amount of supervision, this method performs better than the existing methods, and shows steady improvement with further increase in supervision, thereby proving the efficacy of utilizing the labeled information. We also demonstrate that accepting multiple sequence alignments as input and having an end-to-end architecture with link prediction head saves much computation time while simultaneously yielding superior performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02926v1,2024-02
A Computational Model for the Assessment of Mutual Intelligibility Among Closely Related Languages,"Jessica Nieder, Johann-Mattis List","Closely related languages show linguistic similarities that allow speakers of one language to understand speakers of another language without having actively learned it. Mutual intelligibility varies in degree and is typically tested in psycholinguistic experiments. To study mutual intelligibility computationally, we propose a computer-assisted method using the Linear Discriminative Learner, a computational model developed to approximate the cognitive processes by which humans learn languages, which we expand with multilingual semantic vectors and multilingual sound classes. We test the model on cognate data from German, Dutch, and English, three closely related Germanic languages. We find that our model's comprehension accuracy depends on 1) the automatic trimming of inflections and 2) the language pair for which comprehension is tested. Our multilingual modelling approach does not only offer new methodological findings for automatic testing of mutual intelligibility across languages but also extends the use of Linear Discriminative Learning to multilingual settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02915v1,2024-02
LLM Agents in Interaction: Measuring Personality Consistency and Linguistic Alignment in Interacting Populations of Large Language Models,"Ivar Frisch, Mario Giulianelli","While both agent interaction and personalisation are vibrant topics in research on large language models (LLMs), there has been limited focus on the effect of language interaction on the behaviour of persona-conditioned LLM agents. Such an endeavour is important to ensure that agents remain consistent to their assigned traits yet are able to engage in open, naturalistic dialogues. In our experiments, we condition GPT-3.5 on personality profiles through prompting and create a two-group population of LLM agents using a simple variability-inducing sampling algorithm. We then administer personality tests and submit the agents to a collaborative writing task, finding that different profiles exhibit different degrees of personality consistency and linguistic alignment to their conversational partners. Our study seeks to lay the groundwork for better understanding of dialogue-based interaction between LLMs and highlights the need for new approaches to crafting robust, more human-like LLM personas for interactive environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02896v1,2024-02
Approximate Attributions for Off-the-Shelf Siamese Transformers,"Lucas Möller, Dmitry Nikolaev, Sebastian Padó","Siamese encoders such as sentence transformers are among the least understood deep models. Established attribution methods cannot tackle this model class since it compares two inputs rather than processing a single one. To address this gap, we have recently proposed an attribution method specifically for Siamese encoders (M\""oller et al., 2023). However, it requires models to be adjusted and fine-tuned and therefore cannot be directly applied to off-the-shelf models. In this work, we reassess these restrictions and propose (i) a model with exact attribution ability that retains the original model's predictive performance and (ii) a way to compute approximate attributions for off-the-shelf models. We extensively compare approximate and exact attributions and use them to analyze the models' attendance to different linguistic aspects. We gain insights into which syntactic roles Siamese transformers attend to, confirm that they mostly ignore negation, explore how they judge semantically opposite adjectives, and find that they exhibit lexical bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02883v1,2024-02
How do Large Language Models Learn In-Context? Query and Key Matrices of In-Context Heads are Two Towers for Metric Learning,"Zeping Yu, Sophia Ananiadou","We investigate the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on sentence classification tasks with semantically-unrelated labels (""foo""/""bar""). We find intervening in only 1\% heads (named ""in-context heads"") significantly affects ICL accuracy from 87.6\% to 24.4\%. To understand this phenomenon, we analyze the value-output vectors in these heads and discover that the vectors at each label position contain substantial information about the corresponding labels. Furthermore, we observe that the prediction shift from ""foo"" to ""bar"" is due to the respective reduction and increase in these heads' attention scores at ""foo"" and ""bar"" positions. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis for ICL: in in-context heads, the value-output matrices extract label features, while the query-key matrices compute the similarity between the features at the last position and those at each label position. The query and key matrices can be considered as two towers that learn the similarity metric between the last position's features and each demonstration at label positions. Using this hypothesis, we explain the majority label bias and recency bias in ICL and propose two methods to reduce these biases by 22\% and 17\%, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02872v3,2024-02
EEVEE: An Easy Annotation Tool for Natural Language Processing,"Axel Sorensen, Siyao Peng, Barbara Plank, Rob van der Goot","Annotation tools are the starting point for creating Natural Language Processing (NLP) datasets. There is a wide variety of tools available; setting up these tools is however a hindrance. We propose EEVEE, an annotation tool focused on simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use. It can run directly in the browser (no setup required) and uses tab-separated files (as opposed to character offsets or task-specific formats) for annotation. It allows for annotation of multiple tasks on a single dataset and supports four task-types: sequence labeling, span labeling, text classification and seq2seq.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02864v1,2024-02
Comparing Knowledge Sources for Open-Domain Scientific Claim Verification,"Juraj Vladika, Florian Matthes","The increasing rate at which scientific knowledge is discovered and health claims shared online has highlighted the importance of developing efficient fact-checking systems for scientific claims. The usual setting for this task in the literature assumes that the documents containing the evidence for claims are already provided and annotated or contained in a limited corpus. This renders the systems unrealistic for real-world settings where knowledge sources with potentially millions of documents need to be queried to find relevant evidence. In this paper, we perform an array of experiments to test the performance of open-domain claim verification systems. We test the final verdict prediction of systems on four datasets of biomedical and health claims in different settings. While keeping the pipeline's evidence selection and verdict prediction parts constant, document retrieval is performed over three common knowledge sources (PubMed, Wikipedia, Google) and using two different information retrieval techniques. We show that PubMed works better with specialized biomedical claims, while Wikipedia is more suited for everyday health concerns. Likewise, BM25 excels in retrieval precision, while semantic search in recall of relevant evidence. We discuss the results, outline frequent retrieval patterns and challenges, and provide promising future directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02844v1,2024-02
With a Little Help from my (Linguistic) Friends: Topic Segmentation of Multi-party Casual Conversations,"Amandine Decker, Maxime Amblard","Topics play an important role in the global organisation of a conversation as what is currently discussed constrains the possible contributions of the participant. Understanding the way topics are organised in interaction would provide insight on the structure of dialogue beyond the sequence of utterances. However, studying this high-level structure is a complex task that we try to approach by first segmenting dialogues into smaller topically coherent sets of utterances. Understanding the interactions between these segments would then enable us to propose a model of topic organisation at a dialogue level. In this paper we work with open-domain conversations and try to reach a comparable level of accuracy as recent machine learning based topic segmentation models but with a formal approach. The features we identify as meaningful for this task help us understand better the topical structure of a conversation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02837v1,2024-02
Shortened LLaMA: Depth Pruning for Large Language Models with Comparison of Retraining Methods,"Bo-Kyeong Kim, Geonmin Kim, Tae-Ho Kim, Thibault Castells, Shinkook Choi, Junho Shin, Hyoung-Kyu Song","Structured pruning of modern large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a way of decreasing their high computational needs. Width pruning reduces the size of projection weight matrices (e.g., by removing attention heads) while maintaining the number of layers. Depth pruning, in contrast, removes entire layers or blocks, while keeping the size of the remaining weights unchanged. Most current research focuses on either width-only or a blend of width and depth pruning, with little comparative analysis between the two units (width vs. depth) concerning their impact on LLM inference efficiency. In this work, we show that simple depth pruning can effectively compress LLMs while achieving comparable or superior performance to recent width pruning studies. Our pruning method boosts inference speeds, especially under memory-constrained conditions that require limited batch sizes for running LLMs, where width pruning is ineffective. In retraining pruned models for quality recovery, continued pretraining on a large corpus markedly outperforms LoRA-based tuning, particularly at severe pruning ratios. We hope this work can help build compact yet capable LLMs. Code and models can be found at: https://github.com/Nota-NetsPresso/shortened-llm",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02834v2,2024-02
Evading Data Contamination Detection for Language Models is (too) Easy,"Jasper Dekoninck, Mark Niklas Müller, Maximilian Baader, Marc Fischer, Martin Vechev","Large language models are widespread, with their performance on benchmarks frequently guiding user preferences for one model over another. However, the vast amount of data these models are trained on can inadvertently lead to contamination with public benchmarks, thus compromising performance measurements. While recently developed contamination detection methods try to address this issue, they overlook the possibility of deliberate contamination by malicious model providers aiming to evade detection. We argue that this setting is of crucial importance as it casts doubt on the reliability of public benchmarks. To more rigorously study this issue, we propose a categorization of both model providers and contamination detection methods. This reveals vulnerabilities in existing methods that we exploit with EAL, a simple yet effective contamination technique that significantly inflates benchmark performance while completely evading current detection methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02823v2,2024-02
Are Sounds Sound for Phylogenetic Reconstruction?,"Luise Häuser, Gerhard Jäger, Taraka Rama, Johann-Mattis List, Alexandros Stamatakis","In traditional studies on language evolution, scholars often emphasize the importance of sound laws and sound correspondences for phylogenetic inference of language family trees. However, to date, computational approaches have typically not taken this potential into account. Most computational studies still rely on lexical cognates as major data source for phylogenetic reconstruction in linguistics, although there do exist a few studies in which authors praise the benefits of comparing words at the level of sound sequences. Building on (a) ten diverse datasets from different language families, and (b) state-of-the-art methods for automated cognate and sound correspondence detection, we test, for the first time, the performance of sound-based versus cognate-based approaches to phylogenetic reconstruction. Our results show that phylogenies reconstructed from lexical cognates are topologically closer, by approximately one third with respect to the generalized quartet distance on average, to the gold standard phylogenies than phylogenies reconstructed from sound correspondences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02807v3,2024-02
Graph-enhanced Large Language Models in Asynchronous Plan Reasoning,"Fangru Lin, Emanuele La Malfa, Valentin Hofmann, Elle Michelle Yang, Anthony Cohn, Janet B. Pierrehumbert","Planning is a fundamental property of human intelligence. Reasoning about asynchronous plans is challenging since it requires sequential and parallel planning to optimize time costs. Can large language models (LLMs) succeed at this task? Here, we present the first large-scale study investigating this question. We find that a representative set of closed and open-source LLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, behave poorly when not supplied with illustrations about the task-solving process in our benchmark AsyncHow. We propose a novel technique called Plan Like a Graph (PLaG) that combines graphs with natural language prompts and achieves state-of-the-art results. We show that although PLaG can boost model performance, LLMs still suffer from drastic degradation when task complexity increases, highlighting the limits of utilizing LLMs for simulating digital devices. We see our study as an exciting step towards using LLMs as efficient autonomous agents.

KS-Lottery: Finding Certified Lottery Tickets for Multilingual Language Models,"Fei Yuan, Chang Ma, Shuai Yuan, Qiushi Sun, Lei Li","The lottery ticket hypothesis posits the existence of ``winning tickets'' within a randomly initialized neural network. Do winning tickets exist for LLMs in fine-tuning scenarios? How can we find such winning tickets? In this paper, we propose KS-Lottery, a method to identify a small subset of LLM parameters highly effective in multilingual fine-tuning. Our key idea is to use Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test to analyze the distribution shift of parameters before and after fine-tuning. We further theoretically prove that KS-Lottery can find the certified winning tickets in the embedding layer, fine-tuning on the found parameters is guaranteed to perform as well as full fine-tuning. Comparing KS-Lottery with other parameter-efficient tuning algorithms on translation tasks, the experimental results show that KS-Lottery finds a much smaller set of parameters for fine-tuning while achieving the comparable performance as full fine-tuning LLM. Surprisingly, we find that fine-tuning 18 tokens' embedding of LLaMA suffices to reach the fine-tuning translation performance~\footnote{https://github.com/CONE-MT/KS-Lottery.}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02801v2,2024-02
Rethinking Optimization and Architecture for Tiny Language Models,"Yehui Tang, Fangcheng Liu, Yunsheng Ni, Yuchuan Tian, Zheyuan Bai, Yi-Qi Hu, Sichao Liu, Shangling Jui, Kai Han, Yunhe Wang","The power of large language models (LLMs) has been demonstrated through numerous data and computing resources. However, the application of language models on mobile devices is facing huge challenge on the computation and memory costs, that is, tiny language models with high performance are urgently required. Limited by the highly complex training process, there are many details for optimizing language models that are seldom studied carefully. In this study, based on a tiny language model with 1B parameters, we carefully design a series of empirical study to analyze the effect of each component. Three perspectives are mainly discussed, \ie, neural architecture, parameter initialization, and optimization strategy. Several design formulas are empirically proved especially effective for tiny language models, including tokenizer compression, architecture tweaking, parameter inheritance and multiple-round training. Then we train PanGu-$\pi$-1B Pro and PanGu-$\pi$-1.5B Pro on 1.6T multilingual corpora, following the established formulas. Experimental results demonstrate the improved optimization and architecture yield a notable average improvement of 8.87 on benchmark evaluation sets for PanGu-$\pi$-1B Pro.

From Partial to Strictly Incremental Constituent Parsing,"Ana Ezquerro, Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez, David Vilares","We study incremental constituent parsers to assess their capacity to output trees based on prefix representations alone. Guided by strictly left-to-right generative language models and tree-decoding modules, we build parsers that adhere to a strong definition of incrementality across languages. This builds upon work that asserted incrementality, but that mostly only enforced it on either the encoder or the decoder. Finally, we conduct an analysis against non-incremental and partially incremental models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02782v1,2024-02
Dual Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sound Event Detection,"Yang Xiao, Rohan Kumar Das","Sound event detection (SED) is essential for recognizing specific sounds and their temporal locations within acoustic signals. This becomes challenging particularly for on-device applications, where computational resources are limited. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework referred to as dual knowledge distillation for developing efficient SED systems in this work. Our proposed dual knowledge distillation commences with temporal-averaging knowledge distillation (TAKD), utilizing a mean student model derived from the temporal averaging of the student model's parameters. This allows the student model to indirectly learn from a pre-trained teacher model, ensuring a stable knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce embedding-enhanced feature distillation (EEFD), which involves incorporating an embedding distillation layer within the student model to bolster contextual learning. On DCASE 2023 Task 4A public evaluation dataset, our proposed SED system with dual knowledge distillation having merely one-third of the baseline model's parameters, demonstrates superior performance in terms of PSDS1 and PSDS2. This highlights the importance of proposed dual knowledge distillation for compact SED systems, which can be ideal for edge devices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02781v1,2024-02
List-aware Reranking-Truncation Joint Model for Search and Retrieval-augmented Generation,"Shicheng Xu, Liang Pang, Jun Xu, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng","The results of information retrieval (IR) are usually presented in the form of a ranked list of candidate documents, such as web search for humans and retrieval-augmented generation for large language models (LLMs). List-aware retrieval aims to capture the list-level contextual features to return a better list, mainly including reranking and truncation. Reranking finely re-scores the documents in the list. Truncation dynamically determines the cut-off point of the ranked list to achieve the trade-off between overall relevance and avoiding misinformation from irrelevant documents. Previous studies treat them as two separate tasks and model them separately. However, the separation is not optimal. First, it is hard to share the contextual information of the ranking list between the two tasks. Second, the separate pipeline usually meets the error accumulation problem, where the small error from the reranking stage can largely affect the truncation stage. To solve these problems, we propose a Reranking-Truncation joint model (GenRT) that can perform the two tasks concurrently. GenRT integrates reranking and truncation via generative paradigm based on encoder-decoder architecture. We also design the novel loss functions for joint optimization to make the model learn both tasks. Sharing parameters by the joint model is conducive to making full use of the common modeling information of the two tasks. Besides, the two tasks are performed concurrently and co-optimized to solve the error accumulation problem between separate stages. Experiments on public learning-to-rank benchmarks and open-domain Q\&A tasks show that our method achieves SOTA performance on both reranking and truncation tasks for web search and retrieval-augmented LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02764v1,2024-02
DeAL: Decoding-time Alignment for Large Language Models,"James Y. Huang, Sailik Sengupta, Daniele Bonadiman, Yi-an Lai, Arshit Gupta, Nikolaos Pappas, Saab Mansour, Katrin Kirchhoff, Dan Roth","Large Language Models (LLMs) are nowadays expected to generate content aligned with human preferences. Current work focuses on alignment at model training time, through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, it is unclear if such methods are an effective choice to teach alignment objectives to the model. First, the inability to incorporate multiple, custom rewards and reliance on a model developer's view of universal and static principles are key limitations. Second, the residual gaps in model training and the reliability of such approaches are also questionable (e.g. susceptibility to jail-breaking even after safety training). To address these, we propose DeAL, a framework that allows the user to customize reward functions and enables Decoding-time Alignment of LLMs (DeAL). At its core, we view decoding as a heuristic-guided search process and facilitate the use of a wide variety of alignment objectives. Our experiments with programmatic constraints such as keyword and length constraints (studied widely in the pre-LLM era) and abstract objectives such as harmlessness and helpfulness (proposed in the post-LLM era) show that we can DeAL with fine-grained trade-offs, improve adherence to alignment objectives, and address residual gaps in LLMs. Lastly, while DeAL can be effectively paired with RLHF and prompting techniques, its generality makes decoding slower, an optimization we leave for future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06147v2,2024-02
Illuminate: A novel approach for depression detection with explainable analysis and proactive therapy using prompt engineering,Aryan Agrawal,"This paper introduces a novel paradigm for depression detection and treatment using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), Llama 2 chat, and Gemini. These LLMs are fine-tuned with specialized prompts to diagnose, explain, and suggest therapeutic interventions for depression. A unique few-shot prompting method enhances the models' ability to analyze and explain depressive symptoms based on the DSM-5 criteria. In the interaction phase, the models engage in empathetic dialogue management, drawing from resources like PsychDB and a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Guide, fostering supportive interactions with individuals experiencing major depressive disorders. Additionally, the research introduces the Illuminate Database, enriched with various CBT modules, aiding in personalized therapy recommendations. The study evaluates LLM performance using metrics such as F1 scores, Precision, Recall, Cosine similarity, and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) across different test sets, demonstrating their effectiveness.

KIVI: A Tuning-Free Asymmetric 2bit Quantization for KV Cache,"Zirui Liu, Jiayi Yuan, Hongye Jin, Shaochen Zhong, Zhaozhuo Xu, Vladimir Braverman, Beidi Chen, Xia Hu","Efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) requires batching of many requests to reduce the cost per request. Yet, with larger batch sizes and longer context lengths, the key-value (KV) cache, which stores attention keys and values to avoid re-computations, significantly increases memory demands and becomes the new bottleneck in speed and memory usage. Additionally, the loading of the KV cache causes the computational core to be idle, which limits the inference speed. A straightforward and effective solution to reduce KV cache size is quantization, which decreases the total bytes taken by KV cache. However, there is a lack of in-depth studies that explore the element distribution of KV cache to understand the hardness and limitation of KV cache quantization. To fill the gap, we conducted a comprehensive study on the element distribution in KV cache of popular LLMs. Our findings indicate that the key cache should be quantized per-channel, i.e., group elements along the channel dimension and quantize them together. In contrast, the value cache should be quantized per-token. From this analysis, we developed a tuning-free 2bit KV cache quantization algorithm named KIVI. With hardware-friendly implementation, KIVI can enable Llama, Falcon, and Mistral models to maintain almost the same quality while using $\mathbf{2.6\times}$ less peak memory (including model weight). This reduction in memory usage enables up to $\mathbf{4\times}$ larger batch size, bringing $\mathbf{2.35\times \sim 3.47\times}$ throughput on real LLM inference workload.

Exploiting Class Probabilities for Black-box Sentence-level Attacks,"Raha Moraffah, Huan Liu","Sentence-level attacks craft adversarial sentences that are synonymous with correctly-classified sentences but are misclassified by the text classifiers. Under the black-box setting, classifiers are only accessible through their feedback to queried inputs, which is predominately available in the form of class probabilities. Even though utilizing class probabilities results in stronger attacks, due to the challenges of using them for sentence-level attacks, existing attacks use either no feedback or only the class labels. Overcoming the challenges, we develop a novel algorithm that uses class probabilities for black-box sentence-level attacks, investigate the effectiveness of using class probabilities on the attack's success, and examine the question if it is worthy or practical to use class probabilities by black-box sentence-level attacks. We conduct extensive evaluations of our attack comparing with the baselines across various classifiers and benchmark datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02695v2,2024-02
Graph Neural Network and NER-Based Text Summarization,"Imaad Zaffar Khan, Amaan Aijaz Sheikh, Utkarsh Sinha","With the abundance of data and information in todays time, it is nearly impossible for man, or, even machine, to go through all of the data line by line. What one usually does is to try to skim through the lines and retain the absolutely important information, that in a more formal term is called summarization. Text summarization is an important task that aims to compress lengthy documents or articles into shorter, coherent representations while preserving the core information and meaning. This project introduces an innovative approach to text summarization, leveraging the capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems. GNNs, with their exceptional ability to capture and process the relational data inherent in textual information, are adept at understanding the complex structures within large documents. Meanwhile, NER systems contribute by identifying and emphasizing key entities, ensuring that the summarization process maintains a focus on the most critical aspects of the text. By integrating these two technologies, our method aims to enhances the efficiency of summarization and also tries to ensures a high degree relevance in the condensed content. This project, therefore, offers a promising direction for handling the ever increasing volume of textual data in an information-saturated world.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05126v1,2024-02
Adversarial Text Purification: A Large Language Model Approach for Defense,"Raha Moraffah, Shubh Khandelwal, Amrita Bhattacharjee, Huan Liu","Adversarial purification is a defense mechanism for safeguarding classifiers against adversarial attacks without knowing the type of attacks or training of the classifier. These techniques characterize and eliminate adversarial perturbations from the attacked inputs, aiming to restore purified samples that retain similarity to the initially attacked ones and are correctly classified by the classifier. Due to the inherent challenges associated with characterizing noise perturbations for discrete inputs, adversarial text purification has been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial purification methods in defending text classifiers. We propose a novel adversarial text purification that harnesses the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to purify adversarial text without the need to explicitly characterize the discrete noise perturbations. We utilize prompt engineering to exploit LLMs for recovering the purified examples for given adversarial examples such that they are semantically similar and correctly classified. Our proposed method demonstrates remarkable performance over various classifiers, improving their accuracy under the attack by over 65% on average.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06655v1,2024-02
Large Language Models are Geographically Biased,"Rohin Manvi, Samar Khanna, Marshall Burke, David Lobell, Stefano Ermon","Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently carry the biases contained in their training corpora, which can lead to the perpetuation of societal harm. As the impact of these foundation models grows, understanding and evaluating their biases becomes crucial to achieving fairness and accuracy. We propose to study what LLMs know about the world we live in through the lens of geography. This approach is particularly powerful as there is ground truth for the numerous aspects of human life that are meaningfully projected onto geographic space such as culture, race, language, politics, and religion. We show various problematic geographic biases, which we define as systemic errors in geospatial predictions. Initially, we demonstrate that LLMs are capable of making accurate zero-shot geospatial predictions in the form of ratings that show strong monotonic correlation with ground truth (Spearman's $\rho$ of up to 0.89). We then show that LLMs exhibit common biases across a range of objective and subjective topics. In particular, LLMs are clearly biased against locations with lower socioeconomic conditions (e.g. most of Africa) on a variety of sensitive subjective topics such as attractiveness, morality, and intelligence (Spearman's $\rho$ of up to 0.70). Finally, we introduce a bias score to quantify this and find that there is significant variation in the magnitude of bias across existing LLMs. Code is available on the project website: https://rohinmanvi.github.io/GeoLLM",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02680v2,2024-02
Image-Caption Encoding for Improving Zero-Shot Generalization,"Eric Yang Yu, Christopher Liao, Sathvik Ravi, Theodoros Tsiligkaridis, Brian Kulis","Recent advances in vision-language models have combined contrastive approaches with generative methods to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on downstream inference tasks like zero-shot image classification. However, a persistent issue of these models for image classification is their out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capabilities. We first show that when an OOD data point is misclassified, the correct class can be typically found in the Top-K predicted classes. In order to steer the model prediction toward the correct class within the top predicted classes, we propose the Image-Caption Encoding (ICE) method, a straightforward approach that directly enforces consistency between the image-conditioned and caption-conditioned predictions at evaluation time only. Intuitively, we take advantage of unique properties of the generated captions to guide our local search for the correct class label within the Top-K predicted classes. We show that our method can be easily combined with other SOTA methods to enhance Top-1 OOD accuracies by 0.5% on average and up to 3% on challenging datasets.

Multi-step Problem Solving Through a Verifier: An Empirical Analysis on Model-induced Process Supervision,"Zihan Wang, Yunxuan Li, Yuexin Wu, Liangchen Luo, Le Hou, Hongkun Yu, Jingbo Shang","Process supervision, using a trained verifier to evaluate the intermediate steps generated by a reasoner, has demonstrated significant improvements in multi-step problem solving. In this paper, to avoid the expensive effort of human annotation on the verifier training data, we introduce Model-induced Process Supervision (MiPS), a novel method for automating data curation. MiPS annotates an intermediate step by sampling completions of this solution through the reasoning model, and obtaining an accuracy defined as the proportion of correct completions. Inaccuracies of the reasoner would cause MiPS underestimating the accuracy of intermediate steps, therefore, we suggest and empirically show that verification focusing on high predicted scores of the verifier shall be preferred over that of low predicted scores, contrary to prior observations on human curated data. Our approach significantly improves the performance of PaLM 2 on math and coding tasks (accuracy +0.67% on GSM8K, +4.16% on MATH, +0.92% on MBPP compared with an output supervision trained verifier). Additionally, our study demonstrates that the verifier exhibits strong generalization ability across different reasoning models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02658v2,2024-02
RACER: An LLM-powered Methodology for Scalable Analysis of Semi-structured Mental Health Interviews,"Satpreet Harcharan Singh, Kevin Jiang, Kanchan Bhasin, Ashutosh Sabharwal, Nidal Moukaddam, Ankit B Patel","Semi-structured interviews (SSIs) are a commonly employed data-collection method in healthcare research, offering in-depth qualitative insights into subject experiences. Despite their value, the manual analysis of SSIs is notoriously time-consuming and labor-intensive, in part due to the difficulty of extracting and categorizing emotional responses, and challenges in scaling human evaluation for large populations. In this study, we develop RACER, a Large Language Model (LLM) based expert-guided automated pipeline that efficiently converts raw interview transcripts into insightful domain-relevant themes and sub-themes. We used RACER to analyze SSIs conducted with 93 healthcare professionals and trainees to assess the broad personal and professional mental health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. RACER achieves moderately high agreement with two human evaluators (72%), which approaches the human inter-rater agreement (77%). Interestingly, LLMs and humans struggle with similar content involving nuanced emotional, ambivalent/dialectical, and psychological statements. Our study highlights the opportunities and challenges in using LLMs to improve research efficiency and opens new avenues for scalable analysis of SSIs in healthcare research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02656v1,2024-02

Luu, Kiet Van Nguyen, Ngan Luu-Thuy Nguyen","This paper presents the development process of a Vietnamese spoken language corpus for machine reading comprehension (MRC) tasks and provides insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with using real-world data for machine reading comprehension tasks. The existing MRC corpora in Vietnamese mainly focus on formal written documents such as Wikipedia articles, online newspapers, or textbooks. In contrast, the VlogQA consists of 10,076 question-answer pairs based on 1,230 transcript documents sourced from YouTube -- an extensive source of user-uploaded content, covering the topics of food and travel. By capturing the spoken language of native Vietnamese speakers in natural settings, an obscure corner overlooked in Vietnamese research, the corpus provides a valuable resource for future research in reading comprehension tasks for the Vietnamese language. Regarding performance evaluation, our deep-learning models achieved the highest F1 score of 75.34% on the test set, indicating significant progress in machine reading comprehension for Vietnamese spoken language data. In terms of EM, the highest score we accomplished is 53.97%, which reflects the challenge in processing spoken-based content and highlights the need for further improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02655v2,2024-02
Recursive Chain-of-Feedback Prevents Performance Degradation from Redundant Prompting,"Jinwoo Ahn, Kyuseung Shin","Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently struggle with complex reasoning tasks, failing to construct logically sound steps towards the solution. In response to this behavior, users often try prompting the LLMs repeatedly in hopes of reaching a better response. This paper studies such repetitive behavior and its effect by defining a novel setting, Chain-of-Feedback (CoF). The setting takes questions that require multi-step reasoning as an input. Upon response, we repetitively prompt meaningless feedback (e.g. 'make another attempt') requesting additional trials. Surprisingly, our preliminary results show that repeated meaningless feedback gradually decreases the quality of the responses, eventually leading to a larger deviation from the intended outcome. To alleviate these troubles, we propose a novel method, Recursive Chain-of-Feedback (R-CoF). Following the logic of recursion in computer science, R-CoF recursively revises the initially incorrect response by breaking down each incorrect reasoning step into smaller individual problems. Our preliminary results show that majority of questions that LLMs fail to respond correctly can be answered using R-CoF without any sample data outlining the logical process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02648v2,2024-02
Zero-Shot Clinical Trial Patient Matching with LLMs,"Michael Wornow, Alejandro Lozano, Dev Dash, Jenelle Jindal, Kenneth W. Mahaffey, Nigam H. Shah","Matching patients to clinical trials is a key unsolved challenge in bringing new drugs to market. Today, identifying patients who meet a trial's eligibility criteria is highly manual, taking up to 1 hour per patient. Automated screening is challenging, however, as it requires understanding unstructured clinical text. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution. In this work, we explore their application to trial matching. First, we design an LLM-based system which, given a patient's medical history as unstructured clinical text, evaluates whether that patient meets a set of inclusion criteria (also specified as free text). Our zero-shot system achieves state-of-the-art scores on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection benchmark. Second, we improve the data and cost efficiency of our method by identifying a prompting strategy which matches patients an order of magnitude faster and more cheaply than the status quo, and develop a two-stage retrieval pipeline that reduces the number of tokens processed by up to a third while retaining high performance. Third, we evaluate the interpretability of our system by having clinicians evaluate the natural language justifications generated by the LLM for each eligibility decision, and show that it can output coherent explanations for 97% of its correct decisions and 75% of its incorrect ones. Our results establish the feasibility of using LLMs to accelerate clinical trial operations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05125v3,2024-02
LLM-Enhanced Data Management,"Xuanhe Zhou, Xinyang Zhao, Guoliang Li","Machine learning (ML) techniques for optimizing data management problems have been extensively studied and widely deployed in recent five years. However traditional ML methods have limitations on generalizability (adapting to different scenarios) and inference ability (understanding the context). Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have shown high generalizability and human-competitive abilities in understanding context, which are promising for data management tasks (e.g., database diagnosis, database tuning). However, existing LLMs have several limitations: hallucination, high cost, and low accuracy for complicated tasks. To address these challenges, we design LLMDB, an LLM-enhanced data management paradigm which has generalizability and high inference ability while avoiding hallucination, reducing LLM cost, and achieving high accuracy. LLMDB embeds domain-specific knowledge to avoid hallucination by LLM fine-tuning and prompt engineering. LLMDB reduces the high cost of LLMs by vector databases which provide semantic search and caching abilities. LLMDB improves the task accuracy by LLM agent which provides multiple-round inference and pipeline executions. We showcase three real-world scenarios that LLMDB can well support, including query rewrite, database diagnosis and data analytics. We also summarize the open research challenges of LLMDB.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02643v1,2024-02

This position paper explores ethical considerations in building NLP technologies for Indigenous languages, based on the premise that such projects should primarily serve Indigenous communities. We report on interviews with 17 researchers working in or with Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander communities on language technology projects in Australia. Drawing on insights from the interviews, we recommend practices for NLP researchers to increase attention to the process of engagements with Indigenous communities, rather than focusing only on decontextualised artefacts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02639v2,2024-02
Can Large Language Models Learn Independent Causal Mechanisms?,"Gaël Gendron, Bao Trung Nguyen, Alex Yuxuan Peng, Michael Witbrock, Gillian Dobbie","Despite impressive performance on language modelling and complex reasoning tasks, Large Language Models (LLMs) fall short on the same tasks in uncommon settings or with distribution shifts, exhibiting a lack of generalisation ability. By contrast, systems such as causal models, that learn abstract variables and causal relationships, can demonstrate increased robustness against changes in the distribution. One reason for this success is the existence and use of Independent Causal Mechanisms (ICMs) representing high-level concepts that only sparsely interact. In this work, we apply two concepts from causality to learn ICMs within LLMs. We develop a new LLM architecture composed of multiple sparsely interacting language modelling modules. We show that such causal constraints can improve out-of-distribution performance on abstract and causal reasoning tasks. We also investigate the level of independence and domain specialisation and show that LLMs rely on pre-trained partially domain-invariant mechanisms resilient to fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02636v2,2024-02
Predicting Machine Translation Performance on Low-Resource Languages: The Role of Domain Similarity,"Eric Khiu, Hasti Toossi, David Anugraha, Jinyu Liu, Jiaxu Li, Juan Armando Parra Flores, Leandro Acros Roman, A. Seza Doğruöz, En-Shiun Annie Lee","Fine-tuning and testing a multilingual large language model is expensive and challenging for low-resource languages (LRLs). While previous studies have predicted the performance of natural language processing (NLP) tasks using machine learning methods, they primarily focus on high-resource languages, overlooking LRLs and shifts across domains. Focusing on LRLs, we investigate three factors: the size of the fine-tuning corpus, the domain similarity between fine-tuning and testing corpora, and the language similarity between source and target languages. We employ classical regression models to assess how these factors impact the model's performance. Our results indicate that domain similarity has the most critical impact on predicting the performance of Machine Translation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02633v1,2024-02
GIRT-Model: Automated Generation of Issue Report Templates,"Nafiseh Nikeghbal, Amir Hossein Kargaran, Abbas Heydarnoori","Platforms such as GitHub and GitLab introduce Issue Report Templates (IRTs) to enable more effective issue management and better alignment with developer expectations. However, these templates are not widely adopted in most repositories, and there is currently no tool available to aid developers in generating them. In this work, we introduce GIRT-Model, an assistant language model that automatically generates IRTs based on the developer's instructions regarding the structure and necessary fields. We create GIRT-Instruct, a dataset comprising pairs of instructions and IRTs, with the IRTs sourced from GitHub repositories. We use GIRT-Instruct to instruction-tune a T5-base model to create the GIRT-Model. In our experiments, GIRT-Model outperforms general language models (T5 and Flan-T5 with different parameter sizes) in IRT generation by achieving significantly higher scores in ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and human evaluation. Additionally, we analyze the effectiveness of GIRT-Model in a user study in which participants wrote short IRTs with GIRT-Model. Our results show that the participants find GIRT-Model useful in the automated generation of templates. We hope that through the use of GIRT-Model, we can encourage more developers to adopt IRTs in their repositories.

UniTSyn: A Large-Scale Dataset Capable of Enhancing the Prowess of Large Language Models for Program Testing,"Yifeng He, Jiabo Huang, Yuyang Rong, Yiwen Guo, Ethan Wang, Hao Chen","The remarkable capability of large language models (LLMs) in generating high-quality code has drawn increasing attention in the software testing community. However, existing code LLMs often demonstrate unsatisfactory capabilities in generating accurate and complete tests since they were trained on code snippets collected without differentiating between code for testing purposes and other code. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset UniTSyn, which is capable of enhancing the prowess of LLMs for Unit Test Synthesis. Associating tests with the tested functions is crucial for LLMs to infer the expected behavior and the logic paths to be verified. By leveraging Language Server Protocol, UniTSyn achieves the challenging goal of collecting focal-test pairs without per-project execution setups or per-language heuristics that tend to be fragile and difficult to scale. It contains 2.7 million focal-test pairs across five mainstream programming languages, making it possible to be utilized for enhancing the test generation ability of LLMs. The details of UniTSyn can be found in Table 1. Our experiments demonstrate that, by building an autoregressive model based on UniTSyn, we can achieve significant benefits in learning and understanding unit test representations, resulting in improved generation accuracy and code coverage across all evaluated programming languages.

Enhancing Transformer RNNs with Multiple Temporal Perspectives,"Razvan-Gabriel Dumitru, Darius Peteleaza, Mihai Surdeanu","We introduce the concept of multiple temporal perspectives, a novel approach applicable to Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures for enhancing their understanding of sequential data. This method involves maintaining diverse temporal views of previously encountered text, significantly enriching the language models' capacity to interpret context. To show the efficacy of this approach, we incorporate it into the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture, addressing its inherent challenge of retaining all historical information within a single hidden state. Notably, this improvement is achieved with a minimal increase in the number of parameters --even as little as $0.04\%$ of the original number of parameters. Further, the additional parameters necessary for the multiple temporal perspectives are fine-tuned with minimal computational overhead, avoiding the need for a full pre-training. The resulting model maintains linear computational complexity during prompt inference, ensuring consistent efficiency across various sequence lengths. The empirical results and ablation studies included in our research validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing improved performance across multiple benchmarks.

DenseFormer: Enhancing Information Flow in Transformers via Depth Weighted Averaging,"Matteo Pagliardini, Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Francois Fleuret, Martin Jaggi","The transformer architecture by Vaswani et al. (2017) is now ubiquitous across application domains, from natural language processing to speech processing and image understanding. We propose DenseFormer, a simple modification to the standard architecture that improves the perplexity of the model without increasing its size -- adding a few thousand parameters for large-scale models in the 100B parameters range. Our approach relies on an additional averaging step after each transformer block, which computes a weighted average of current and past representations -- we refer to this operation as Depth-Weighted-Average (DWA). The learned DWA weights exhibit coherent patterns of information flow, revealing the strong and structured reuse of activations from distant layers. Experiments demonstrate that DenseFormer is more data efficient, reaching the same perplexity of much deeper transformer models, and that for the same perplexity, these new models outperform transformer baselines in terms of memory efficiency and inference time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02622v2,2024-02
Increasing Trust in Language Models through the Reuse of Verified Circuits,"Philip Quirke, Clement Neo, Fazl Barez","Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used for a wide range of prediction tasks, but their training can often neglect rare edge cases, reducing their reliability. Here, we define a stringent standard of trustworthiness whereby the task algorithm and circuit implementation must be verified, accounting for edge cases, with no known failure modes. We show that a model can be trained to meet this standard if built using mathematically and logically specified frameworks. In this paper, we fully verify an auto-regressive transformer model for n-digit integer addition. To exhibit the reusability of verified modules, we insert the trained integer addition model into a larger untrained model and train the combined model to perform both addition and subtraction. We find extensive reuse of the addition circuits for both tasks, easing verification of the more complex subtractor model. We discuss how inserting verified task modules into LMs can leverage model reuse to improve verifiability and trustworthiness of language models built using them. The reuse of verified circuits reduces the effort to verify more complex composite models which we believe to be a significant step towards safety of language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02619v8,2024-02
Layer-Wise Analysis of Self-Supervised Acoustic Word Embeddings: A Study on Speech Emotion Recognition,"Alexandra Saliba, Yuanchao Li, Ramon Sanabria, Catherine Lai","The efficacy of self-supervised speech models has been validated, yet the optimal utilization of their representations remains challenging across diverse tasks. In this study, we delve into Acoustic Word Embeddings (AWEs), a fixed-length feature derived from continuous representations, to explore their advantages in specific tasks. AWEs have previously shown utility in capturing acoustic discriminability. In light of this, we propose measuring layer-wise similarity between AWEs and word embeddings, aiming to further investigate the inherent context within AWEs. Moreover, we evaluate the contribution of AWEs, in comparison to other types of speech features, in the context of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). Through a comparative experiment and a layer-wise accuracy analysis on two distinct corpora, IEMOCAP and ESD, we explore differences between AWEs and raw self-supervised representations, as well as the proper utilization of AWEs alone and in combination with word embeddings. Our findings underscore the acoustic context conveyed by AWEs and showcase the highly competitive SER accuracies by appropriately employing AWEs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02617v1,2024-02
PuzzleBench: Can LLMs Solve Challenging First-Order Combinatorial Reasoning Problems?,"Chinmay Mittal, Krishna Kartik, Mausam, Parag Singla","Recent works show that the largest of the large language models (LLMs) can solve many simple reasoning tasks expressed in natural language, without any/much supervision. But, can they also solve challenging first-order combinatorial reasoning problems, such as graph coloring, knapsack and cryptarithmetic? To answer this question, we present PuzzleBench, a dataset of 31 such challenging problems along with a few solved instances for each problem. These problems are all first order, i.e., they can be instantiated with problem instances of varying sizes, and most of them are NP-hard, requiring several reasoning steps to reach the solution. We first observe that LLMs, even when aided by symbolic solvers, perform rather poorly on our dataset. In response, we propose a new approach, Puzzle-LM, which combines LLMs with both symbolic solvers and program interpreters, along with feedback from solved examples, to achieve huge performance gains. Our extensive experimentation and analyses offer new insights into the reasoning abilities and limitations of present-day LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02611v2,2024-02
Improving Assessment of Tutoring Practices using Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Zifei FeiFei Han, Jionghao Lin, Ashish Gurung, Danielle R. Thomas, Eason Chen, Conrad Borchers, Shivang Gupta, Kenneth R. Koedinger","One-on-one tutoring is an effective instructional method for enhancing learning, yet its efficacy hinges on tutor competencies. Novice math tutors often prioritize content-specific guidance, neglecting aspects such as social-emotional learning. Social-emotional learning promotes equity and inclusion and nurturing relationships with students, which is crucial for holistic student development. Assessing the competencies of tutors accurately and efficiently can drive the development of tailored tutor training programs. However, evaluating novice tutor ability during real-time tutoring remains challenging as it typically requires experts-in-the-loop. To address this challenge, this preliminary study aims to harness Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, to automatically assess tutors' ability of using social-emotional tutoring strategies. Moreover, this study also reports on the financial dimensions and considerations of employing these models in real-time and at scale for automated assessment. The current study examined four prompting strategies: two basic Zero-shot prompt strategies, Tree of Thought prompt, and Retrieval-Augmented Generator (RAG) based prompt. The results indicate that the RAG prompt demonstrated more accurate performance (assessed by the level of hallucination and correctness in the generated assessment texts) and lower financial costs than the other strategies evaluated.

On the performance of phonetic algorithms in microtext normalization,"Yerai Doval, Manuel Vilares, Jesús Vilares","User-generated content published on microblogging social networks constitutes a priceless source of information. However, microtexts usually deviate from the standard lexical and grammatical rules of the language, thus making its processing by traditional intelligent systems very difficult. As an answer, microtext normalization consists in transforming those non-standard microtexts into standard well-written texts as a preprocessing step, allowing traditional approaches to continue with their usual processing. Given the importance of phonetic phenomena in non-standard text formation, an essential element of the knowledge base of a normalizer would be the phonetic rules that encode these phenomena, which can be found in the so-called phonetic algorithms.   In this work we experiment with a wide range of phonetic algorithms for the English language. The aim of this study is to determine the best phonetic algorithms within the context of candidate generation for microtext normalization. In other words, we intend to find those algorithms that taking as input non-standard terms to be normalized allow us to obtain as output the smallest possible sets of normalization candidates which still contain the corresponding target standard words. As it will be stated, the choice of the phonetic algorithm will depend heavily on the capabilities of the candidate selection mechanism which we usually find at the end of a microtext normalization pipeline. The faster it can make the right choices among big enough sets of candidates, the more we can sacrifice on the precision of the phonetic algorithms in favour of coverage in order to increase the overall performance of the normalization system.

A Quantitative Discourse Analysis of Asian Workers in the US Historical Newspapers,"Jaihyun Park, Ryan Cordell","Warning: This paper contains examples of offensive language targetting marginalized population. The digitization of historical texts invites researchers to explore the large-scale corpus of historical texts with computational methods. In this study, we present computational text analysis on a relatively understudied topic of how Asian workers are represented in historical newspapers in the United States. We found that the word ""coolie"" was semantically different in some States (e.g., Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Arkansas) with the different discourses around coolie. We also found that then-Confederate newspapers and then-Union newspapers formed distinctive discourses by measuring over-represented words. Newspapers from then-Confederate States associated coolie with slavery-related words. In addition, we found Asians were perceived to be inferior to European immigrants and subjected to the target of racism.

A Truly Joint Neural Architecture for Segmentation and Parsing,"Danit Yshaayahu Levi, Reut Tsarfaty","Contemporary multilingual dependency parsers can parse a diverse set of languages, but for Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs), performance is attested to be lower than other languages. The key challenge is that, due to high morphological complexity and ambiguity of the space-delimited input tokens, the linguistic units that act as nodes in the tree are not known in advance. Pre-neural dependency parsers for MRLs subscribed to the joint morpho-syntactic hypothesis, stating that morphological segmentation and syntactic parsing should be solved jointly, rather than as a pipeline where segmentation precedes parsing. However, neural state-of-the-art parsers to date use a strict pipeline. In this paper we introduce a joint neural architecture where a lattice-based representation preserving all morphological ambiguity of the input is provided to an arc-factored model, which then solves the morphological segmentation and syntactic parsing tasks at once. Our experiments on Hebrew, a rich and highly ambiguous MRL, demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on parsing, tagging and segmentation of the Hebrew section of UD, using a single model. This proposed architecture is LLM-based and language agnostic, providing a solid foundation for MRLs to obtain further performance improvements and bridge the gap with other languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02564v2,2024-02
Synergy-of-Thoughts: Eliciting Efficient Reasoning in Hybrid Language Models,"Yu Shang, Yu Li, Fengli Xu, Yong Li","Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive emergent abilities in a wide range of tasks, but the associated expensive API cost greatly limits the real application. Previous works like chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thoughts (ToT) have predominately focused on enhancing accuracy, but overlook the rapidly increasing API cost, which could be particularly problematic for open-ended real-world tasks with huge solution spaces. Motivated by the dual process theory of human cognition, we propose ""Synergy of Thoughts""(SoT) to unleash the synergistic potential of hybrid LLMs with different scales for efficient reasoning. By default, SoT uses smaller-scale language models to generate multiple low-cost intuitive thoughts, which resembles the parallel intuitions produced by System 1. We then design a confidence evaluator where the intuitive thoughts are cross-evaluated and introduce a controllable threshold mechanism to decide their mutual conflict. If these intuitive thoughts exhibit conflicts, SoT will invoke the reflective reasoning of scaled-up language models to emulate the intervention of System 2, which will override the intuitive thoughts and rectify the reasoning results. This framework is model-agnostic and training-free, which can be flexibly implemented with various off-the-shelf LLMs. Experiments on six representative reasoning tasks show that SoT substantially reduces the API cost by 38.3%-75.1%, and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art reasoning accuracy and solution diversity. Notably, the average token cost reduction on open-ended tasks reaches up to 69.1%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02563v4,2024-02
NavHint: Vision and Language Navigation Agent with a Hint Generator,"Yue Zhang, Quan Guo, Parisa Kordjamshidi","Existing work on vision and language navigation mainly relies on navigation-related losses to establish the connection between vision and language modalities, neglecting aspects of helping the navigation agent build a deep understanding of the visual environment. In our work, we provide indirect supervision to the navigation agent through a hint generator that provides detailed visual descriptions. The hint generator assists the navigation agent in developing a global understanding of the visual environment. It directs the agent's attention toward related navigation details, including the relevant sub-instruction, potential challenges in recognition and ambiguities in grounding, and the targeted viewpoint description. To train the hint generator, we construct a synthetic dataset based on landmarks in the instructions and visible and distinctive objects in the visual environment. We evaluate our method on the R2R and R4R datasets and achieve state-of-the-art on several metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that generating hints not only enhances the navigation performance but also helps improve the interpretability of the agent's actions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02559v1,2024-02
Enhancing Robustness in Biomedical NLI Models: A Probing Approach for Clinical Trials,Ata Mustafa,"Large Language Models have revolutionized various fields and industries, such as Conversational AI, Content Generation, Information Retrieval, Business Intelligence, and Medical, to name a few. One major application in the field of medical is to analyze and investigate clinical trials for entailment tasks.However, It has been observed that Large Language Models are susceptible to shortcut learning, factual inconsistency, and performance degradation with little variation in context. Adversarial and robust testing is performed to ensure the integrity of models output. But, ambiguity still persists. In order to ensure the integrity of the reasoning performed and investigate the model has correct syntactic and semantic understanding probing is used. Here, I used mnestic probing to investigate the Sci-five model, trained on clinical trial. I investigated the model for feature learnt with respect to natural logic. To achieve the target, I trained task specific probes. Used these probes to investigate the final layers of trained model. Then, fine tuned the trained model using iterative null projection. The results shows that model accuracy improved. During experimentation, I observed that size of the probe has affect on the fine tuning process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02558v1,2024-02
Generalizable Entity Grounding via Assistance of Large Language Model,"Lu Qi, Yi-Wen Chen, Lehan Yang, Tiancheng Shen, Xiangtai Li, Weidong Guo, Yu Xu, Ming-Hsuan Yang","In this work, we propose a novel approach to densely ground visual entities from a long caption. We leverage a large multimodal model (LMM) to extract semantic nouns, a class-agnostic segmentation model to generate entity-level segmentation, and the proposed multi-modal feature fusion module to associate each semantic noun with its corresponding segmentation mask. Additionally, we introduce a strategy of encoding entity segmentation masks into a colormap, enabling the preservation of fine-grained predictions from features of high-resolution masks. This approach allows us to extract visual features from low-resolution images using the CLIP vision encoder in the LMM, which is more computationally efficient than existing approaches that use an additional encoder for high-resolution images. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques on three tasks, including panoptic narrative grounding, referring expression segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02555v1,2024-02

They have shown powerful zero-shot and in-context learning abilities on several NLP tasks, but their potential on TFV is still unknown. In this work, we implement a preliminary study about whether LLMs are table-based fact-checkers. In detail, we design diverse prompts to explore how the in-context learning can help LLMs in TFV, i.e., zero-shot and few-shot TFV capability. Besides, we carefully design and construct TFV instructions to study the performance gain brought by the instruction tuning of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can achieve acceptable results on zero-shot and few-shot TFV with prompt engineering, while instruction-tuning can stimulate the TFV capability significantly. We also make some valuable findings about the format of zero-shot prompts and the number of in-context examples. Finally, we analyze some possible directions to promote the accuracy of TFV via LLMs, which is beneficial to further research of table reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02549v2,2024-02
"""What's my model inside of?"": Exploring the role of environments for grounded natural language understanding",Ronen Tamari,"In contrast to classical cognitive science which studied brains in isolation, ecological approaches focused on the role of the body and environment in shaping cognition. Similarly, in this thesis we adopt an ecological approach to grounded natural language understanding (NLU) research. Grounded language understanding studies language understanding systems situated in the context of events, actions and precepts in naturalistic/simulated virtual environments. Where classic research tends to focus on designing new models and optimization methods while treating environments as given, we explore the potential of environment design for improving data collection and model development. We developed novel training and annotation approaches for procedural text understanding based on text-based game environments. We also drew upon embodied cognitive linguistics literature to propose a roadmap for grounded NLP research, and to inform the development of a new benchmark for measuring the progress of large language models on challenging commonsense reasoning tasks. We leveraged the richer supervision provided by text-based game environments to develop Breakpoint Transformers, a novel approach to modeling intermediate semantic information in long narrative or procedural texts. Finally, we integrated theories on the role of environments in collective human intelligence to propose a design for AI-augmented ""social thinking environments"" for knowledge workers like scientists.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02548v1,2024-02
Integration of cognitive tasks into artificial general intelligence test for large models,"Youzhi Qu, Chen Wei, Penghui Du, Wenxin Che, Chi Zhang, Wanli Ouyang, Yatao Bian, Feiyang Xu, Bin Hu, Kai Du, Haiyan Wu, Jia Liu, Quanying Liu","During the evolution of large models, performance evaluation is necessarily performed to assess their capabilities and ensure safety before practical application. However, current model evaluations mainly rely on specific tasks and datasets, lacking a united framework for assessing the multidimensional intelligence of large models. In this perspective, we advocate for a comprehensive framework of cognitive science-inspired artificial general intelligence (AGI) tests, aimed at fulfilling the testing needs of large models with enhanced capabilities. The cognitive science-inspired AGI tests encompass the full spectrum of intelligence facets, including crystallized intelligence, fluid intelligence, social intelligence, and embodied intelligence. To assess the multidimensional intelligence of large models, the AGI tests consist of a battery of well-designed cognitive tests adopted from human intelligence tests, and then naturally encapsulates into an immersive virtual community. We propose increasing the complexity of AGI testing tasks commensurate with advancements in large models and emphasizing the necessity for the interpretation of test results to avoid false negatives and false positives. We believe that cognitive science-inspired AGI tests will effectively guide the targeted improvement of large models in specific dimensions of intelligence and accelerate the integration of large models into human society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02547v2,2024-02
Knowledge Generation for Zero-shot Knowledge-based VQA,"Rui Cao, Jing Jiang","Previous solutions to knowledge-based visual question answering~(K-VQA) retrieve knowledge from external knowledge bases and use supervised learning to train the K-VQA model. Recently pre-trained LLMs have been used as both a knowledge source and a zero-shot QA model for K-VQA and demonstrated promising results. However, these recent methods do not explicitly show the knowledge needed to answer the questions and thus lack interpretability. Inspired by recent work on knowledge generation from LLMs for text-based QA, in this work we propose and test a similar knowledge-generation-based K-VQA method, which first generates knowledge from an LLM and then incorporates the generated knowledge for K-VQA in a zero-shot manner. We evaluate our method on two K-VQA benchmarks and found that our method performs better than previous zero-shot K-VQA methods and our generated knowledge is generally relevant and helpful.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02541v1,2024-02
Absolute convergence and error thresholds in non-active adaptive sampling,"Manuel Vilares Ferro, Victor M. Darriba Bilbao, Jesús Vilares Ferro","Non-active adaptive sampling is a way of building machine learning models from a training data base which are supposed to dynamically and automatically derive guaranteed sample size. In this context and regardless of the strategy used in both scheduling and generating of weak predictors, a proposal for calculating absolute convergence and error thresholds is described. We not only make it possible to establish when the quality of the model no longer increases, but also supplies a proximity condition to estimate in absolute terms how close it is to achieving such a goal, thus supporting decision making for fine-tuning learning parameters in model selection. The technique proves its correctness and completeness with respect to our working hypotheses, in addition to strengthening the robustness of the sampling scheme. Tests meet our expectations and illustrate the proposal in the domain of natural language processing, taking the generation of part-of-speech taggers as case study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02522v1,2024-02
Adaptive scheduling for adaptive sampling in POS taggers construction,"Manuel Vilares Ferro, Victor M. Darriba Bilbao, Jesús Vilares Ferro","We introduce an adaptive scheduling for adaptive sampling as a novel way of machine learning in the construction of part-of-speech taggers. The goal is to speed up the training on large data sets, without significant loss of performance with regard to an optimal configuration. In contrast to previous methods using a random, fixed or regularly rising spacing between the instances, ours analyzes the shape of the learning curve geometrically in conjunction with a functional model to increase or decrease it at any time. The algorithm proves to be formally correct regarding our working hypotheses. Namely, given a case, the following one is the nearest ensuring a net gain of learning ability from the former, it being possible to modulate the level of requirement for this condition. We also improve the robustness of sampling by paying greater attention to those regions of the training data base subject to a temporary inflation in performance, thus preventing the learning from stopping prematurely.   The proposal has been evaluated on the basis of its reliability to identify the convergence of models, corroborating our expectations. While a concrete halting condition is used for testing, users can choose any condition whatsoever to suit their own specific needs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02516v1,2024-02
Modeling of learning curves with applications to pos tagging,"Manuel Vilares Ferro, Victor M. Darriba Bilbao, Francisco J. Ribadas Pena","An algorithm to estimate the evolution of learning curves on the whole of a training data base, based on the results obtained from a portion and using a functional strategy, is introduced. We approximate iteratively the sought value at the desired time, independently of the learning technique used and once a point in the process, called prediction level, has been passed. The proposal proves to be formally correct with respect to our working hypotheses and includes a reliable proximity condition. This allows the user to fix a convergence threshold with respect to the accuracy finally achievable, which extends the concept of stopping criterion and seems to be effective even in the presence of distorting observations.   Our aim is to evaluate the training effort, supporting decision making in order to reduce the need for both human and computational resources during the learning process. The proposal is of interest in at least three operational procedures. The first is the anticipation of accuracy gain, with the purpose of measuring how much work is needed to achieve a certain degree of performance. The second relates the comparison of efficiency between systems at training time, with the objective of completing this task only for the one that best suits our requirements. The prediction of accuracy is also a valuable item of information for customizing systems, since we can estimate in advance the impact of settings on both the performance and the development costs. Using the generation of part-of-speech taggers as an example application, the experimental results are consistent with our expectations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02515v1,2024-02
Early stopping by correlating online indicators in neural networks,"Manuel Vilares Ferro, Yerai Doval Mosquera, Francisco J. Ribadas Pena, Victor M. Darriba Bilbao","In order to minimize the generalization error in neural networks, a novel technique to identify overfitting phenomena when training the learner is formally introduced. This enables support of a reliable and trustworthy early stopping condition, thus improving the predictive power of that type of modeling. Our proposal exploits the correlation over time in a collection of online indicators, namely characteristic functions for indicating if a set of hypotheses are met, associated with a range of independent stopping conditions built from a canary judgment to evaluate the presence of overfitting. That way, we provide a formal basis for decision making in terms of interrupting the learning process.   As opposed to previous approaches focused on a single criterion, we take advantage of subsidiarities between independent assessments, thus seeking both a wider operating range and greater diagnostic reliability. With a view to illustrating the effectiveness of the halting condition described, we choose to work in the sphere of natural language processing, an operational continuum increasingly based on machine learning. As a case study, we focus on parser generation, one of the most demanding and complex tasks in the domain. The selection of cross-validation as a canary function enables an actual comparison with the most representative early stopping conditions based on overfitting identification, pointing to a promising start toward an optimal bias and variance control.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02513v1,2024-02
GeReA: Question-Aware Prompt Captions for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering,"Ziyu Ma, Shutao Li, Bin Sun, Jianfei Cai, Zuxiang Long, Fuyan Ma","Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires world knowledge beyond the image for accurate answer. Recently, instead of extra knowledge bases, a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3 is activated as an implicit knowledge engine to jointly acquire and reason the necessary knowledge for answering by converting images into textual information (e.g., captions and answer candidates). However, such conversion may introduce irrelevant information, which causes the LLM to misinterpret images and ignore visual details crucial for accurate knowledge. We argue that multimodal large language model (MLLM) is a better implicit knowledge engine than the LLM for its superior capability of visual understanding. Despite this, how to activate the capacity of MLLM as the implicit knowledge engine has not been explored yet. Therefore, we propose GeReA, a generate-reason framework that prompts a MLLM like InstructBLIP with question relevant vision and language information to generate knowledge-relevant descriptions and reasons those descriptions for knowledge-based VQA. Specifically, the question-relevant image regions and question-specific manual prompts are encoded in the MLLM to generate the knowledge relevant descriptions, referred to as question-aware prompt captions. After that, the question-aware prompt captions, image-question pair, and similar samples are sent into the multi-modal reasoning model to learn a joint knowledge-image-question representation for answer prediction. GeReA unlocks the use of MLLM as the implicit knowledge engine, surpassing all previous state-of-the-art methods on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA datasets, with test accuracies of 66.5% and 63.3% respectively. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Upper9527/GeReA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02503v1,2024-02
A Survey on Data Selection for LLM Instruction Tuning,"Jiahao Wang, Bolin Zhang, Qianlong Du, Jiajun Zhang, Dianhui Chu","Instruction tuning is a vital step of training large language models (LLM), so how to enhance the effect of instruction tuning has received increased attention. Existing works indicate that the quality of the dataset is more crucial than the quantity during instruction tuning of LLM. Therefore, recently a lot of studies focus on exploring the methods of selecting high-quality subset from instruction datasets, aiming to reduce training costs and enhance the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on data selection for LLM instruction tuning. Firstly, we introduce the wildly used instruction datasets. Then, we propose a new taxonomy of the data selection methods and provide a detailed introduction of recent advances,and the evaluation strategies and results of data selection methods are also elaborated in detail.

Navigating the Peril of Generated Alternative Facts: A ChatGPT-4 Fabricated Omega Variant Case as a Cautionary Tale in Medical Misinformation,"Malik Sallam, Jan Egger, Rainer Roehrig, Behrus Puladi","In an era where artificial intelligence (AI) intertwines with medical research, the delineation of truth becomes increasingly complex. This study ostensibly examines a purported novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, dubbed the Omega variant, showcasing 31 unique mutations in the S gene region. However, the real undercurrent of this narrative is a demonstration of the ease with which AI, specifically ChatGPT-4, can fabricate convincing yet entirely fictional scientific data. The so-called Omega variant was identified in a fully vaccinated, previously infected 35-year-old male presenting with severe COVID-19 symptoms. Through a detailed, albeit artificial, genomic analysis and contact tracing, this study mirrors the rigorous methodology of genuine case reports, thereby setting the stage for a compelling but entirely constructed narrative. The entire case study was generated by ChatGPT-4, a large language model by OpenAI. The fabricated Omega variant features an ensemble of mutations, including N501Y and E484K, known for enhancing ACE2 receptor affinity, alongside L452R and P681H, ostensibly indicative of immune evasion. This variant's contrived interaction dynamics - severe symptoms in a vaccinated individual versus mild ones in unvaccinated contacts - were designed to mimic real-world complexities, including suggestions of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). While the Omega variant is a product of AI-generated fiction, the implications of this exercise are real and profound. The ease with which AI can generate believable but false scientific information, as illustrated in this case, raises significant concerns about the potential for misinformation in medicine. This study, therefore, serves as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the necessity for critical evaluation of sources, especially in an age where AI tools like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly sophisticated and widespread in their use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09674v1,2024-02
BRAIn: Bayesian Reward-conditioned Amortized Inference for natural language generation from feedback,"Gaurav Pandey, Yatin Nandwani, Tahira Naseem, Mayank Mishra, Guangxuan Xu, Dinesh Raghu, Sachindra Joshi, Asim Munawar, Ramón Fernandez Astudillo","Distribution matching methods for language model alignment such as Generation with Distributional Control (GDC) and Distributional Policy Gradient (DPG) have not received the same level of attention in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) as contrastive methods such as Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants. We identify high variance of the gradient estimate as the primary reason for the lack of success of these methods and propose a self-normalized baseline to reduce the variance. We further generalize the target distribution in DPG, GDC and DPO by using Bayes' rule to define the reward-conditioned posterior. The resulting approach, referred to as BRAIn - Bayesian Reward-conditioned Amortized Inference acts as a bridge between distribution matching methods and DPO and significantly outperforms prior art in summarization and Antropic HH tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02479v2,2024-02
tnGPS: Discovering Unknown Tensor Network Structure Search Algorithms via Large Language Models (LLMs),"Junhua Zeng, Chao Li, Zhun Sun, Qibin Zhao, Guoxu Zhou","Tensor networks are efficient for extremely high-dimensional representation, but their model selection, known as tensor network structure search (TN-SS), is a challenging problem. Although several works have targeted TN-SS, most existing algorithms are manually crafted heuristics with poor performance, suffering from the curse of dimensionality and local convergence. In this work, we jump out of the box, studying how to harness large language models (LLMs) to automatically discover new TN-SS algorithms, replacing the involvement of human experts. By observing how human experts innovate in research, we model their common workflow and propose an automatic algorithm discovery framework called tnGPS. The proposed framework is an elaborate prompting pipeline that instruct LLMs to generate new TN-SS algorithms through iterative refinement and enhancement. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithms discovered by tnGPS exhibit superior performance in benchmarks compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02456v2,2024-02
Surfing the modeling of PoS taggers in low-resource scenarios,"Manuel Vilares Ferro, Víctor M. Darriba Bilbao, Francisco J. Ribadas-Pena, Jorge Graña Gil","The recent trend towards the application of deep structured techniques has revealed the limits of huge models in natural language processing. This has reawakened the interest in traditional machine learning algorithms, which have proved still to be competitive in certain contexts, in particular low-resource settings. In parallel, model selection has become an essential task to boost performance at reasonable cost, even more so when we talk about processes involving domains where the training and/or computational resources are scarce. Against this backdrop, we evaluate the early estimation of learning curves as a practical mechanism for selecting the most appropriate model in scenarios characterized by the use of non-deep learners in resource-lean settings. On the basis of a formal approximation model previously evaluated under conditions of wide availability of training and validation resources, we study the reliability of such an approach in a different and much more demanding operationalenvironment. Using as case study the generation of PoS taggers for Galician, a language belonging to the Western Ibero-Romance group, the experimental results are consistent with our expectations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02449v1,2024-02
Breaking MLPerf Training: A Case Study on Optimizing BERT,"Yongdeok Kim, Jaehyung Ahn, Myeongwoo Kim, Changin Choi, Heejae Kim, Narankhuu Tuvshinjargal, Seungwon Lee, Yanzi Zhang, Yuan Pei, Xiongzhan Linghu, Jingkun Ma, Lin Chen, Yuehua Dai, Sungjoo Yoo","Speeding up the large-scale distributed training is challenging in that it requires improving various components of training including load balancing, communication, optimizers, etc. We present novel approaches for fast large-scale training of BERT model which individually ameliorates each component thereby leading to a new level of BERT training performance. Load balancing is imperative in distributed BERT training since its training datasets are characterized by samples with various lengths. Communication cost, which is proportional to the scale of distributed training, needs to be hidden by useful computation. In addition, the optimizers, e.g., ADAM, LAMB, etc., need to be carefully re-evaluated in the context of large-scale distributed training. We propose two new ideas, (1) local presorting based on dataset stratification for load balancing and (2) bucket-wise gradient clipping before allreduce which allows us to benefit from the overlap of gradient computation and synchronization as well as the fast training of gradient clipping before allreduce. We also re-evaluate existing optimizers via hyperparameter optimization and utilize ADAM, which also contributes to fast training via larger batches than existing methods. Our proposed methods, all combined, give the fastest MLPerf BERT training of 25.1 (22.3) seconds on 1,024 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, which is 1.33x (1.13x) and 1.57x faster than the other top two (one) submissions to MLPerf v1.1 (v2.0).

LQER: Low-Rank Quantization Error Reconstruction for LLMs,"Cheng Zhang, Jianyi Cheng, George A. Constantinides, Yiren Zhao","Post-training quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging. In this work, we introduce Low-rank Quantization Error Reduction (LQER), which combines quantization and low-rank approximation to recover the model capability. LQER leverages an activation-induced scale matrix to drive the singular value distribution of quantization error towards a desirable distribution, which enables nearly-lossless W4A8 quantization on various LLMs and downstream tasks without the need for knowledge distillation, grid search, or gradient-base iterative optimization. Unlike existing methods, the computation pattern of LQER eliminates the need for specialized Scatter and Gather processes to collect high-precision weights from irregular memory locations. Our W4A8 LLMs achieve near-lossless performance on six popular downstream tasks, while using 1.36$\times$ fewer hardware resources than the leading state-of-the-art method.

Factuality of Large Language Models: A Survey,"Yuxia Wang, Minghan Wang, Muhammad Arslan Manzoor, Fei Liu, Georgi Georgiev, Rocktim Jyoti Das, Preslav Nakov","Large language models (LLMs), especially when instruction-tuned for chat, have become part of our daily lives, freeing people from the process of searching, extracting, and integrating information from multiple sources by offering a straightforward answer to a variety of questions in a single place. Unfortunately, in many cases, LLM responses are factually incorrect, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. As a result, research on evaluating and improving the factuality of LLMs has attracted a lot of attention recently. In this survey, we critically analyze existing work with the aim to identify the major challenges and their associated causes, pointing out to potential solutions for improving the factuality of LLMs, and analyzing the obstacles to automated factuality evaluation for open-ended text generation.

Aligner: Efficient Alignment by Learning to Correct,"Jiaming Ji, Boyuan Chen, Hantao Lou, Donghai Hong, Borong Zhang, Xuehai Pan, Juntao Dai, Tianyi Qiu, Yaodong Yang","With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and ever-evolving practical requirements, finding an efficient and effective alignment method has never been more critical. However, the tension between the complexity of current alignment methods and the need for rapid iteration in deployment scenarios necessitates the development of a model-agnostic alignment approach that can operate under these constraints. In this paper, we introduce Aligner, a novel and simple alignment paradigm that learns the correctional residuals between preferred and dispreferred answers using a small model. Designed as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, Aligner can be directly applied to various open-source and API-based models with only one-off training, making it suitable for rapid iteration. Notably, Aligner can be applied to any powerful, large-scale upstream models. Moreover, it can even iteratively bootstrap the upstream models using corrected responses as synthetic human preference data, breaking through the model's performance ceiling. Our experiments demonstrate performance improvements by deploying the same Aligner model across 11 different LLMs, evaluated on the 3H dimensions (helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty). Specifically, Aligner-7B has achieved an average improvement of 68.9% in helpfulness and 23.8% in harmlessness across the tested LLMs while also effectively reducing hallucination. In the Alpaca-Eval leaderboard, stacking Aligner-2B on GPT-4 Turbo improved its LC Win Rate from 55.0% to 58.3%, surpassing GPT-4 Omni's 57.5% Win Rate (community report).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02416v5,2024-02
GLaPE: Gold Label-agnostic Prompt Evaluation and Optimization for Large Language Model,"Xuanchang Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao","Despite the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), their task performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Recent studies have explored leveraging the LLM itself as an optimizer to identify optimal prompts that maximize task accuracy. However, when evaluating prompts, such approaches heavily rely on elusive manually annotated gold labels to calculate task accuracy for each candidate prompt, which hinders the widespread implementation and generality. To overcome the limitation, this work proposes a gold label-agnostic prompt evaluation (GLaPE) to alleviate dependence on gold labels. Motivated by the observed correlation between self-consistency and the accuracy of the answer, we adopt self-consistency as the initial evaluation score. Subsequently, we refine the scores of prompts producing identical answers to be mutually consistent. Experimental results show that GLaPE provides reliable evaluations uniform with accuracy, even in the absence of gold labels. Moreover, on six popular reasoning tasks, our GLaPE-based prompt optimization yields effective prompts comparable to accuracy-based ones. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/thunderous77/GLaPE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02408v2,2024-02
DeLLMa: Decision Making Under Uncertainty with Large Language Models,"Ollie Liu, Deqing Fu, Dani Yogatama, Willie Neiswanger","The potential of large language models (LLMs) as decision support tools is increasingly being explored in fields such as business, engineering, and medicine, which often face challenging tasks of decision-making under uncertainty. In this paper, we show that directly prompting LLMs on these types of decision-making problems can yield poor results, especially as the problem complexity increases. To aid in these tasks, we propose DeLLMa (Decision-making Large Language Model assistant), a framework designed to enhance decision-making accuracy in uncertain environments. DeLLMa involves a multi-step reasoning procedure that integrates recent best practices in scaling inference-time reasoning, drawing upon principles from decision theory and utility theory, to provide an accurate and human-auditable decision-making process. We validate our procedure on multiple realistic decision-making environments, demonstrating that DeLLMa can consistently enhance the decision-making performance of leading language models, and achieve up to a 40% increase in accuracy over competing methods. Additionally, we show how performance improves when scaling compute at test time, and carry out human evaluations to benchmark components of DeLLMa.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02392v3,2024-02
KICGPT: Large Language Model with Knowledge in Context for Knowledge Graph Completion,"Yanbin Wei, Qiushi Huang, James T. Kwok, Yu Zhang","Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is crucial for addressing knowledge graph incompleteness and supporting downstream applications. Many models have been proposed for KGC. They can be categorized into two main classes: triple-based and text-based approaches. Triple-based methods struggle with long-tail entities due to limited structural information and imbalanced entity distributions. Text-based methods alleviate this issue but require costly training for language models and specific finetuning for knowledge graphs, which limits their efficiency. To alleviate these limitations, in this paper, we propose KICGPT, a framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) and a triple-based KGC retriever. It alleviates the long-tail problem without incurring additional training overhead. KICGPT uses an in-context learning strategy called Knowledge Prompt, which encodes structural knowledge into demonstrations to guide the LLM. Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KICGPT with smaller training overhead and no finetuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02389v2,2024-02
Solution-oriented Agent-based Models Generation with Verifier-assisted Iterative In-context Learning,"Tong Niu, Weihao Zhang, Rong Zhao","Agent-based models (ABMs) stand as an essential paradigm for proposing and validating hypothetical solutions or policies aimed at addressing challenges posed by complex systems and achieving various objectives. This process demands labor-intensive endeavors and multidisciplinary expertise. Large language models (LLMs) encapsulating cross-domain knowledge and programming proficiency could potentially alleviate the difficulty of this process. However, LLMs excel in handling sequential information, making it challenging for analyzing the intricate interactions and nonlinear dynamics inherent in ABMs. Additionally, due to the lack of self-evaluation capability of LLMs, relying solely on LLMs is insufficient to effectively accomplish this process. In this paper, we present SAGE, a general solution-oriented ABM generation framework designed for automatic modeling and generating solutions for targeted problems. Unlike approaches reliant on expert handcrafting or resource-intensive neural network training, SAGE establishes a verifier-assisted iterative in-context learning process employing large language models (LLMs) to leverages their inherent cross-domain knowledge for tackling intricate demands from diverse domain scenarios. In SAGE, we introduce an semi-structured conceptual representation expliciting the intricate structures of ABMs and an objective representation to guide LLMs in modeling scenarios and proposing hypothetical solutions through in-context learning. To ensure the model executability and solution feasibility, SAGE devises a two-level verifier with chain-of-thought prompting tailored to the complex interactions and non-linear dynamics of ABMs, driving the iterative generation optimization. Moreover, we construct an evaluation dataset of solution-oriented ABMs from open sources.It contains practical models across various domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02388v1,2024-02

Recognizing the knowledge-intensive and labor-intensive nature of traditional qualitative methods in educational research, this study investigates the potential of LLM to streamline and enhance the analysis process. The study involves datasets from a middle school, encompassing classroom dialogues across mathematics and Chinese classes. These dialogues were manually coded by educational experts and then analyzed using a customised GPT-4 model. This study focuses on comparing manual annotations with the outputs of GPT-4 to evaluate its efficacy in analyzing educational dialogues. Time efficiency, inter-coder agreement, and inter-coder reliability between human coders and GPT-4 are evaluated. Results indicate substantial time savings with GPT-4, and a high degree of consistency in coding between the model and human coders, with some discrepancies in specific codes.

Rethinking the Evaluation of Pre-trained Text-and-Layout Models from an Entity-Centric Perspective,"Chong Zhang, Yixi Zhao, Chenshu Yuan, Yi Tu, Ya Guo, Qi Zhang","Recently developed pre-trained text-and-layout models (PTLMs) have shown remarkable success in multiple information extraction tasks on visually-rich documents. However, the prevailing evaluation pipeline may not be sufficiently robust for assessing the information extraction ability of PTLMs, due to inadequate annotations within the benchmarks. Therefore, we claim the necessary standards for an ideal benchmark to evaluate the information extraction ability of PTLMs. We then introduce EC-FUNSD, an entity-centric benckmark designed for the evaluation of semantic entity recognition and entity linking on visually-rich documents. This dataset contains diverse formats of document layouts and annotations of semantic-driven entities and their relations. Moreover, this dataset disentangles the falsely coupled annotation of segment and entity that arises from the block-level annotation of FUNSD. Experiment results demonstrate that state-of-the-art PTLMs exhibit overfitting tendencies on the prevailing benchmarks, as their performance sharply decrease when the dataset bias is removed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02379v1,2024-02
AutoTimes: Autoregressive Time Series Forecasters via Large Language Models,"Yong Liu, Guo Qin, Xiangdong Huang, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long","Foundation models of time series have not been fully developed due to the limited availability of time series corpora and the underexploration of scalable pre-training. Based on the similar sequential formulation of time series and natural language, increasing research demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLM) for time series. Nevertheless, the inherent autoregressive property and decoder-only architecture of LLMs have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLM abilities. To fully revitalize the general-purpose token transition and multi-step generation capability of large language models, we propose AutoTimes to repurpose LLMs as autoregressive time series forecasters, which projects time series into the embedding space of language tokens and autoregressively generates future predictions with arbitrary lengths. Compatible with any decoder-only LLMs, the consequent forecaster exhibits the flexibility of the lookback length and scalability with larger LLMs. Further, we formulate time series as prompts, extending the context for prediction beyond the lookback window, termed in-context forecasting. By introducing LLM-embedded textual timestamps, AutoTimes can utilize chronological information to align multivariate time series. Empirically, AutoTimes achieves state-of-the-art with 0.1% trainable parameters and over $5\times$ training/inference speedup compared to advanced LLM-based forecasters.

M$^3$Face: A Unified Multi-Modal Multilingual Framework for Human Face Generation and Editing,"Mohammadreza Mofayezi, Reza Alipour, Mohammad Ali Kakavand, Ehsaneddin Asgari","Human face generation and editing represent an essential task in the era of computer vision and the digital world. Recent studies have shown remarkable progress in multi-modal face generation and editing, for instance, using face segmentation to guide image generation. However, it may be challenging for some users to create these conditioning modalities manually. Thus, we introduce M3Face, a unified multi-modal multilingual framework for controllable face generation and editing. This framework enables users to utilize only text input to generate controlling modalities automatically, for instance, semantic segmentation or facial landmarks, and subsequently generate face images.

The Developmental Landscape of In-Context Learning,"Jesse Hoogland, George Wang, Matthew Farrugia-Roberts, Liam Carroll, Susan Wei, Daniel Murfet","We show that in-context learning emerges in transformers in discrete developmental stages, when they are trained on either language modeling or linear regression tasks. We introduce two methods for detecting the milestones that separate these stages, by probing the geometry of the population loss in both parameter space and function space. We study the stages revealed by these new methods using a range of behavioral and structural metrics to establish their validity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02364v1,2024-02
Advancing Graph Representation Learning with Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Techniques,"Qiheng Mao, Zemin Liu, Chenghao Liu, Zhuo Li, Jianling Sun","The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Graph Representation Learning (GRL) marks a significant evolution in analyzing complex data structures. This collaboration harnesses the sophisticated linguistic capabilities of LLMs to improve the contextual understanding and adaptability of graph models, thereby broadening the scope and potential of GRL. Despite a growing body of research dedicated to integrating LLMs into the graph domain, a comprehensive review that deeply analyzes the core components and operations within these models is notably lacking. Our survey fills this gap by proposing a novel taxonomy that breaks down these models into primary components and operation techniques from a novel technical perspective. We further dissect recent literature into two primary components including knowledge extractors and organizers, and two operation techniques including integration and training stratigies, shedding light on effective model design and training strategies. Additionally, we identify and explore potential future research avenues in this nascent yet underexplored field, proposing paths for continued progress.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05952v1,2024-02

Enhance Reasoning for Large Language Models in the Game Werewolf,"Shuang Wu, Liwen Zhu, Tao Yang, Shiwei Xu, Qiang Fu, Yang Wei, Haobo Fu","This paper presents an innovative framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with an external Thinker module to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based agents. Unlike augmenting LLMs with prompt engineering, Thinker directly harnesses knowledge from databases and employs various optimization techniques. The framework forms a reasoning hierarchy where LLMs handle intuitive System-1 tasks such as natural language processing, while the Thinker focuses on cognitive System-2 tasks that require complex logical analysis and domain-specific knowledge. Our framework is presented using a 9-player Werewolf game that demands dual-system reasoning. We introduce a communication protocol between LLMs and the Thinker, and train the Thinker using data from 18800 human sessions and reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in deductive reasoning, speech generation, and online game evaluation. Additionally, we fine-tune a 6B LLM to surpass GPT4 when integrated with the Thinker. This paper also contributes the largest dataset for social deduction games to date.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02330v2,2024-02
Diversity Measurement and Subset Selection for Instruction Tuning Datasets,"Peiqi Wang, Yikang Shen, Zhen Guo, Matthew Stallone, Yoon Kim, Polina Golland, Rameswar Panda","We aim to select data subsets for the fine-tuning of large language models to more effectively follow instructions. Prior work has emphasized the importance of diversity in dataset curation but relied on heuristics such as the number of tasks. In this paper, we use determinantal point processes to capture the diversity and quality of instruction tuning datasets for subset selection. We propose to measure dataset diversity with log determinant distance that is the distance between the dataset of interest and a maximally diverse reference dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed diversity measure in the normalized weight gradient space is correlated with downstream instruction-following performance. Consequently, it can be used to inform when data selection is the most helpful and to analyze dataset curation strategies. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on various instruction tuning datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02318v1,2024-02
A Survey of Large Language Models in Finance (FinLLMs),"Jean Lee, Nicholas Stevens, Soyeon Caren Han, Minseok Song","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across a wide variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and have attracted attention from multiple domains, including financial services. Despite the extensive research into general-domain LLMs, and their immense potential in finance, Financial LLM (FinLLM) research remains limited. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of FinLLMs, including their history, techniques, performance, and opportunities and challenges. Firstly, we present a chronological overview of general-domain Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) through to current FinLLMs, including the GPT-series, selected open-source LLMs, and financial LMs. Secondly, we compare five techniques used across financial PLMs and FinLLMs, including training methods, training data, and fine-tuning methods.

Selecting Large Language Model to Fine-tune via Rectified Scaling Law,"Haowei Lin, Baizhou Huang, Haotian Ye, Qinyu Chen, Zihao Wang, Sujian Li, Jianzhu Ma, Xiaojun Wan, James Zou, Yitao Liang","The ever-growing ecosystem of LLMs has posed a challenge in selecting the most appropriate pre-trained model to fine-tune amidst a sea of options. Given constrained resources, fine-tuning all models and making selections afterward is unrealistic. In this work, we formulate this resource-constrained selection task into predicting fine-tuning performance and illustrate its natural connection with Scaling Law. Unlike pre-training, we find that the fine-tuning scaling curve includes not just the well-known ""power phase"" but also the previously unobserved ""pre-power phase"". We also explain why existing Scaling Law fails to capture this phase transition phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. To address this, we introduce the concept of ""pre-learned data size"" into our Rectified Scaling Law, which overcomes theoretical limitations and fits experimental results much better. By leveraging our law, we propose a novel LLM selection algorithm that selects the near-optimal model with hundreds of times less resource consumption, while other methods may provide negatively correlated selection.

Jailbreaking Attack against Multimodal Large Language Model,"Zhenxing Niu, Haodong Ren, Xinbo Gao, Gang Hua, Rong Jin","This paper focuses on jailbreaking attacks against multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), seeking to elicit MLLMs to generate objectionable responses to harmful user queries. A maximum likelihood-based algorithm is proposed to find an \emph{image Jailbreaking Prompt} (imgJP), enabling jailbreaks against MLLMs across multiple unseen prompts and images (i.e., data-universal property). Our approach exhibits strong model-transferability, as the generated imgJP can be transferred to jailbreak various models, including MiniGPT-v2, LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and mPLUG-Owl2, in a black-box manner. Moreover, we reveal a connection between MLLM-jailbreaks and LLM-jailbreaks. As a result, we introduce a construction-based method to harness our approach for LLM-jailbreaks, demonstrating greater efficiency than current state-of-the-art methods.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of table-related tasks, examining both user scenarios and technical aspects. It covers traditional tasks like table question answering as well as emerging fields such as spreadsheet manipulation and table data analysis. We summarize the training techniques for LLMs and VLMs tailored for table processing.

Predicting positive transfer for improved low-resource speech recognition using acoustic pseudo-tokens,"Nay San, Georgios Paraskevopoulos, Aryaman Arora, Xiluo He, Prabhjot Kaur, Oliver Adams, Dan Jurafsky","While massively multilingual speech models like wav2vec 2.0 XLSR-128 can be directly fine-tuned for automatic speech recognition (ASR), downstream performance can still be relatively poor on languages that are under-represented in the pre-training data. Continued pre-training on 70-200 hours of untranscribed speech in these languages can help -- but what about languages without that much recorded data? For such cases, we show that supplementing the target language with data from a similar, higher-resource 'donor' language can help. For example, continued pre-training on only 10 hours of low-resource Punjabi supplemented with 60 hours of donor Hindi is almost as good as continued pretraining on 70 hours of Punjabi. By contrast, sourcing data from less similar donors like Bengali does not improve ASR performance. To inform donor language selection, we propose a novel similarity metric based on the sequence distribution of induced acoustic units: the Acoustic Token Distribution Similarity (ATDS). Across a set of typologically different target languages (Punjabi, Galician, Iban, Setswana), we show that the ATDS between the target language and its candidate donors precisely predicts target language ASR performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02302v1,2024-02
"SemPool: Simple, robust, and interpretable KG pooling for enhancing language models","Costas Mavromatis, Petros Karypis, George Karypis","Knowledge Graph (KG) powered question answering (QA) performs complex reasoning over language semantics as well as knowledge facts. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) learn to aggregate information from the underlying KG, which is combined with Language Models (LMs) for effective reasoning with the given question. However, GNN-based methods for QA rely on the graph information of the candidate answer nodes, which limits their effectiveness in more challenging settings where critical answer information is not included in the KG. We propose a simple graph pooling approach that learns useful semantics of the KG that can aid the LM's reasoning and that its effectiveness is robust under graph perturbations. Our method, termed SemPool, represents KG facts with pre-trained LMs, learns to aggregate their semantic information, and fuses it at different layers of the LM. Our experimental results show that SemPool outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based methods by 2.27% accuracy points on average when answer information is missing from the KG. In addition, SemPool offers interpretability on what type of graph information is fused at different LM layers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02289v1,2024-02
SynthDST: Synthetic Data is All You Need for Few-Shot Dialog State Tracking,"Atharva Kulkarni, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, Joel Ruben Antony Moniz, Dhivya Piraviperumal, Hong Yu, Shruti Bhargava","In-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue of research in Dialog State Tracking (DST). However, the best-performing in-context learning methods involve retrieving and adding similar examples to the prompt, requiring access to labeled training data. Procuring such training data for a wide range of domains and applications is time-consuming, expensive, and, at times, infeasible. While zero-shot learning requires no training data, it significantly lags behind the few-shot setup. Thus, `\textit{Can we efficiently generate synthetic data for any dialogue schema to enable few-shot prompting?}' Addressing this question, we propose \method, a data generation framework tailored for DST, utilizing LLMs. Our approach only requires the dialogue schema and a few hand-crafted dialogue templates to synthesize natural, coherent, and free-flowing dialogues with DST annotations. Few-shot learning using data from {\method} results in $4-5%$ improvement in Joint Goal Accuracy over the zero-shot baseline on MultiWOZ 2.1 and 2.4. Remarkably, our few-shot learning approach recovers nearly $98%$ of the performance compared to the few-shot setup using human-annotated training data.

Data Quality Matters: Suicide Intention Detection on Social Media Posts Using RoBERTa-CNN,"Emily Lin, Jian Sun, Hsingyu Chen, Mohammad H. Mahoor","Suicide remains a pressing global health concern, necessitating innovative approaches for early detection and intervention. This paper focuses on identifying suicidal intentions in posts from the SuicideWatch subreddit by proposing a novel deep-learning approach that utilizes the state-of-the-art RoBERTa-CNN model. The robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) excels at capturing textual nuances and forming semantic relationships within the text. The remaining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) head enhances RoBERTa's capacity to discern critical patterns from extensive datasets. To evaluate RoBERTa-CNN, we conducted experiments on the Suicide and Depression Detection dataset, yielding promising results. For instance, RoBERTa-CNN achieves a mean accuracy of 98% with a standard deviation (STD) of 0.0009. Additionally, we found that data quality significantly impacts the training of a robust model. To improve data quality, we removed noise from the text data while preserving its contextual content through either manually cleaning or utilizing the OpenAI API.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02262v2,2024-02
"Frequency Explains the Inverse Correlation of Large Language Models' Size, Training Data Amount, and Surprisal's Fit to Reading Times","Byung-Doh Oh, Shisen Yue, William Schuler","Recent studies have shown that as Transformer-based language models become larger and are trained on very large amounts of data, the fit of their surprisal estimates to naturalistic human reading times degrades. The current work presents a series of analyses showing that word frequency is a key explanatory factor underlying these two trends. First, residual errors from four language model families on four corpora show that the inverse correlation between model size and fit to reading times is the strongest on the subset of least frequent words, which is driven by excessively accurate predictions of larger model variants. Additionally, training dynamics reveal that during later training steps, all model variants learn to predict rare words and that larger model variants do so more accurately, which explains the detrimental effect of both training data amount and model size on fit to reading times. Finally, a feature attribution analysis demonstrates that larger model variants are able to accurately predict rare words based on both an effectively longer context window size as well as stronger local associations compared to smaller model variants. Taken together, these results indicate that Transformer-based language models' surprisal estimates diverge from human-like expectations due to the superhumanly complex associations they learn for predicting rare words.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02255v1,2024-02
Beyond the Limits: A Survey of Techniques to Extend the Context Length in Large Language Models,"Xindi Wang, Mahsa Salmani, Parsa Omidi, Xiangyu Ren, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Armaghan Eshaghi","Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities including understanding context, engaging in logical reasoning, and generating responses. However, this is achieved at the expense of stringent computational and memory requirements, hindering their ability to effectively support long input sequences. This survey provides an inclusive review of the recent techniques and methods devised to extend the sequence length in LLMs, thereby enhancing their capacity for long-context understanding. In particular, we review and categorize a wide range of techniques including architectural modifications, such as modified positional encoding and altered attention mechanisms, which are designed to enhance the processing of longer sequences while avoiding a proportional increase in computational requirements. The diverse methodologies investigated in this study can be leveraged across different phases of LLMs, i.e., training, fine-tuning and inference. This enables LLMs to efficiently process extended sequences. The limitations of the current methodologies is discussed in the last section along with the suggestions for future research directions, underscoring the importance of sequence length in the continued advancement of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02244v3,2024-02
"Language Writ Large: LLMs, ChatGPT, Grounding, Meaning and Understanding",Stevan Harnad,"Apart from what (little) OpenAI may be concealing from us, we all know (roughly) how ChatGPT works (its huge text database, its statistics, its vector representations, and their huge number of parameters, its next-word training, and so on). But none of us can say (hand on heart) that we are not surprised by what ChatGPT has proved to be able to do with these resources. This has even driven some of us to conclude that ChatGPT actually understands. It is not true that it understands. But it is also not true that we understand how it can do what it can do. I will suggest some hunches about benign biases: convergent constraints that emerge at LLM scale that may be helping ChatGPT do so much better than we would have expected. These biases are inherent in the nature of language itself, at LLM scale, and they are closely linked to what it is that ChatGPT lacks, which is direct sensorimotor grounding to connect its words to their referents and its propositions to their meanings. These convergent biases are related to (1) the parasitism of indirect verbal grounding on direct sensorimotor grounding, (2) the circularity of verbal definition, (3) the mirroring of language production and comprehension, (4) iconicity in propositions at LLM scale, (5) computational counterparts of human categorical perception in category learning by neural nets, and perhaps also (6) a conjecture by Chomsky about the laws of thought. The exposition will be in the form of a dialogue with ChatGPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02243v1,2024-02
A Data Generation Perspective to the Mechanism of In-Context Learning,"Haitao Mao, Guangliang Liu, Yao Ma, Rongrong Wang, Kristen Johnson, Jiliang Tang","In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capacity to learn in context, achieving downstream generalization without gradient updates but with a few in-context examples. Despite the encouraging empirical success, the underlying mechanism of ICL remains unclear, and existing research offers various viewpoints of understanding. These studies propose intuition-driven and ad-hoc technical solutions for interpreting ICL, illustrating an ambiguous road map. In this paper, we leverage a data generation perspective to reinterpret recent efforts and demonstrate the potential broader usage of popular technical solutions, approaching a systematic angle. For a conceptual definition, we rigorously adopt the terms of skill learning and skill recognition. The difference between them is skill learning can learn new data generation functions from in-context data. We also provide a comprehensive study on the merits and weaknesses of different solutions, and highlight the uniformity among them given the perspective of data generation, establishing a technical foundation for future research to incorporate the strengths of different lines of research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02212v2,2024-02
DE$^3$-BERT: Distance-Enhanced Early Exiting for BERT based on Prototypical Networks,"Jianing He, Qi Zhang, Weiping Ding, Duoqian Miao, Jun Zhao, Liang Hu, Longbing Cao","Early exiting has demonstrated its effectiveness in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models like BERT by dynamically adjusting the number of layers executed. However, most existing early exiting methods only consider local information from an individual test sample to determine their exiting indicators, failing to leverage the global information offered by sample population. This leads to suboptimal estimation of prediction correctness, resulting in erroneous exiting decisions. To bridge the gap, we explore the necessity of effectively combining both local and global information to ensure reliable early exiting during inference. Purposefully, we leverage prototypical networks to learn class prototypes and devise a distance metric between samples and class prototypes. This enables us to utilize global information for estimating the correctness of early predictions. On this basis, we propose a novel Distance-Enhanced Early Exiting framework for BERT (DE$^3$-BERT). DE$^3$-BERT implements a hybrid exiting strategy that supplements classic entropy-based local information with distance-based global information to enhance the estimation of prediction correctness for more reliable early exiting decisions. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that DE$^3$-BERT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models under different speed-up ratios with minimal storage or computational overhead, yielding a better trade-off between model performance and inference efficiency. Additionally, an in-depth analysis further validates the generality and interpretability of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05948v1,2024-02
Enhancing Complex Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs through Evidence Pattern Retrieval,"Wentao Ding, Jinmao Li, Liangchuan Luo, Yuzhong Qu","Information retrieval (IR) methods for KGQA consist of two stages: subgraph extraction and answer reasoning. We argue current subgraph extraction methods underestimate the importance of structural dependencies among evidence facts. We propose Evidence Pattern Retrieval (EPR) to explicitly model the structural dependencies during subgraph extraction. We implement EPR by indexing the atomic adjacency pattern of resource pairs. Given a question, we perform dense retrieval to obtain atomic patterns formed by resource pairs. We then enumerate their combinations to construct candidate evidence patterns. These evidence patterns are scored using a neural model, and the best one is selected to extract a subgraph for downstream answer reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that the EPR-based approach has significantly improved the F1 scores of IR-KGQA methods by over 10 points on ComplexWebQuestions and achieves competitive performance on WebQuestionsSP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02175v1,2024-02
Analyzing Sentiment Polarity Reduction in News Presentation through Contextual Perturbation and Large Language Models,"Alapan Kuila, Somnath Jena, Sudeshna Sarkar, Partha Pratim Chakrabarti","In today's media landscape, where news outlets play a pivotal role in shaping public opinion, it is imperative to address the issue of sentiment manipulation within news text. News writers often inject their own biases and emotional language, which can distort the objectivity of reporting. This paper introduces a novel approach to tackle this problem by reducing the polarity of latent sentiments in news content. Drawing inspiration from adversarial attack-based sentence perturbation techniques and a prompt based method using ChatGPT, we employ transformation constraints to modify sentences while preserving their core semantics. Using three perturbation methods: replacement, insertion, and deletion coupled with a context-aware masked language model, we aim to maximize the desired sentiment score for targeted news aspects through a beam search algorithm. Our experiments and human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of these two models in achieving reduced sentiment polarity with minimal modifications while maintaining textual similarity, fluency, and grammatical correctness. Comparative analysis confirms the competitive performance of the adversarial attack based perturbation methods and prompt-based methods, offering a promising solution to foster more objective news reporting and combat emotional language bias in the media.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02145v1,2024-02

Do Moral Judgment and Reasoning Capability of LLMs Change with Language? A Study using the Multilingual Defining Issues Test,"Aditi Khandelwal, Utkarsh Agarwal, Kumar Tanmay, Monojit Choudhury","This paper explores the moral judgment and moral reasoning abilities exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) across languages through the Defining Issues Test. It is a well known fact that moral judgment depends on the language in which the question is asked. We extend the work of beyond English, to 5 new languages (Chinese, Hindi, Russian, Spanish and Swahili), and probe three LLMs -- ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Llama2Chat-70B -- that shows substantial multilingual text processing and generation abilities. Our study shows that the moral reasoning ability for all models, as indicated by the post-conventional score, is substantially inferior for Hindi and Swahili, compared to Spanish, Russian, Chinese and English, while there is no clear trend for the performance of the latter four languages. The moral judgments too vary considerably by the language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02135v1,2024-02
GITA: Graph to Visual and Textual Integration for Vision-Language Graph Reasoning,"Yanbin Wei, Shuai Fu, Weisen Jiang, Zejian Zhang, Zhixiong Zeng, Qi Wu, James T.

Though LLMs can process graph information in a textual format, they overlook the rich vision modality, which is an intuitive way for humans to comprehend structural information and conduct general graph reasoning.

Zero-shot Sentiment Analysis in Low-Resource Languages Using a Multilingual Sentiment Lexicon,"Fajri Koto, Tilman Beck, Zeerak Talat, Iryna Gurevych, Timothy Baldwin","Improving multilingual language models capabilities in low-resource languages is generally difficult due to the scarcity of large-scale data in those languages. In this paper, we relax the reliance on texts in low-resource languages by using multilingual lexicons in pretraining to enhance multilingual capabilities. Specifically, we focus on zero-shot sentiment analysis tasks across 34 languages, including 6 high/medium-resource languages, 25 low-resource languages, and 3 code-switching datasets. We demonstrate that pretraining using multilingual lexicons, without using any sentence-level sentiment data, achieves superior zero-shot performance compared to models fine-tuned on English sentiment datasets, and large language models like GPT--3.5, BLOOMZ, and XGLM. These findings are observable for unseen low-resource languages to code-mixed scenarios involving high-resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02113v1,2024-02
Are Large Language Models Good Prompt Optimizers?,"Ruotian Ma, Xiaolei Wang, Xin Zhou, Jian Li, Nan Du, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","LLM-based Automatic Prompt Optimization, which typically utilizes LLMs as Prompt Optimizers to self-reflect and refine prompts, has shown promising performance in recent studies. Despite the success, the underlying mechanism of this approach remains unexplored, and the true effectiveness of LLMs as Prompt Optimizers requires further validation. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to uncover the actual mechanism of LLM-based Prompt Optimization. Our findings reveal that the LLM optimizers struggle to identify the true causes of errors during reflection, tending to be biased by their own prior knowledge rather than genuinely reflecting on the errors. Furthermore, even when the reflection is semantically valid, the LLM optimizers often fail to generate appropriate prompts for the target models with a single prompt refinement step, partly due to the unpredictable behaviors of the target models. Based on the observations, we introduce a new ""Automatic Behavior Optimization"" paradigm, which directly optimizes the target model's behavior in a more controllable manner. We hope our study can inspire new directions for automatic prompt optimization development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02101v1,2024-02
Analyzing the Evaluation of Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer in Multilingual Language Models,"Sara Rajaee, Christof Monz","Recent advances in training multilingual language models on large datasets seem to have shown promising results in knowledge transfer across languages and achieve high performance on downstream tasks. However, we question to what extent the current evaluation benchmarks and setups accurately measure zero-shot cross-lingual knowledge transfer. In this work, we challenge the assumption that high zero-shot performance on target tasks reflects high cross-lingual ability by introducing more challenging setups involving instances with multiple languages. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that the observed high performance of multilingual models can be largely attributed to factors not requiring the transfer of actual linguistic knowledge, such as task- and surface-level knowledge. More specifically, we observe what has been transferred across languages is mostly data artifacts and biases, especially for low-resource languages. Our findings highlight the overlooked drawbacks of existing cross-lingual test data and evaluation setups, calling for a more nuanced understanding of the cross-lingual capabilities of multilingual models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02099v1,2024-02

Specifically, GliDe is a modified draft model architecture that reuses the cached keys and values from the target LLM, while CaPE is a proposal expansion method that uses the draft model's confidence scores to help select additional candidate tokens for verification. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed GliDe draft model significantly reduces the expected decoding latency. Additional evaluation using walltime reveals that GliDe can accelerate Vicuna models up to 2.17x and further extend the improvement to 2.61x with CaPE. We will release our code, data, and the trained draft models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02082v1,2024-02

When creating such parallel data, it is critical to ensure high-quality translations for all target languages for an accurate characterization of cross-lingual transfer. In this work, we find that translation inconsistencies do exist and interestingly they disproportionally impact low-resource languages in XNLI. To identify such inconsistencies, we propose measuring the gap in performance between zero-shot evaluations on the human-translated and machine-translated target text across multiple target languages; relatively large gaps are indicative of translation errors. We also corroborate that translation errors exist for two target languages, namely Hindi and Urdu, by doing a manual reannotation of human-translated test instances in these two languages and finding poor agreement with the original English labels these instances were supposed to inherit.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02080v1,2024-02
Exploring the Robustness of Task-oriented Dialogue Systems for Colloquial German Varieties,"Ekaterina Artemova, Verena Blaschke, Barbara Plank","Mainstream cross-lingual task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems leverage the transfer learning paradigm by training a joint model for intent recognition and slot-filling in English and applying it, zero-shot, to other languages. We address a gap in prior research, which often overlooked the transfer to lower-resource colloquial varieties due to limited test data. Inspired by prior work on English varieties, we craft and manually evaluate perturbation rules that transform German sentences into colloquial forms and use them to synthesize test sets in four ToD datasets. Our perturbation rules cover 18 distinct language phenomena, enabling us to explore the impact of each perturbation on slot and intent performance. Using these new datasets, we conduct an experimental evaluation across six different transformers. Here, we demonstrate that when applied to colloquial varieties, ToD systems maintain their intent recognition performance, losing 6% (4.62 percentage points) in accuracy on average. However, they exhibit a significant drop in slot detection, with a decrease of 31% (21 percentage points) in slot F1 score. Our findings are further supported by a transfer experiment from Standard American English to synthetic Urban African American Vernacular English.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02078v1,2024-02
Investigating Content Planning for Navigating Trade-offs in Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue,"Kushal Chawla, Hannah Rashkin, Gaurav Singh Tomar, David Reitter","Knowledge-grounded dialogue generation is a challenging task because it requires satisfying two fundamental yet often competing constraints: being responsive in a manner that is specific to what the conversation partner has said while also being attributable to an underlying source document. In this work, we bring this trade-off between these two objectives (specificity and attribution) to light and ask the question: Can explicit content planning before the response generation help the model to address this challenge? To answer this question, we design a framework called PLEDGE, which allows us to experiment with various plan variables explored in prior work, supporting both metric-agnostic and metric-aware approaches. While content planning shows promise, our results on whether it can actually help to navigate this trade-off are mixed -- planning mechanisms that are metric-aware (use automatic metrics during training) are better at automatic evaluations but underperform in human judgment compared to metric-agnostic mechanisms. We discuss how this may be caused by over-fitting to automatic metrics and the need for future work to better calibrate these metrics towards human judgment. We hope the observations from our analysis will inform future work that aims to apply content planning in this context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02077v1,2024-02
Break the Sequential Dependency of LLM Inference Using Lookahead Decoding,"Yichao Fu, Peter Bailis, Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang","Autoregressive decoding of large language models (LLMs) is memory bandwidth bounded, resulting in high latency and significant wastes of the parallel processing power of modern accelerators. Existing methods for accelerating LLM decoding often require a draft model (e.g., speculative decoding), which is nontrivial to obtain and unable to generalize. In this paper, we introduce Lookahead decoding, an exact, parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates LLM decoding without needing auxiliary models or data stores. It allows trading per-step log(FLOPs) to reduce the number of total decoding steps, is more parallelizable on single or multiple modern accelerators, and is compatible with concurrent memory-efficient attention (e.g., FlashAttention). Our implementation of Lookahead decoding can speed up autoregressive decoding by up to 1.8x on MT-bench and 4x with strong scaling on multiple GPUs in code completion tasks. Our code is avialable at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/LookaheadDecoding",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02057v1,2024-02
AnthroScore: A Computational Linguistic Measure of Anthropomorphism,"Myra Cheng, Kristina Gligoric, Tiziano Piccardi, Dan Jurafsky","Anthropomorphism, or the attribution of human-like characteristics to non-human entities, has shaped conversations about the impacts and possibilities of technology. We present AnthroScore, an automatic metric of implicit anthropomorphism in language. We use a masked language model to quantify how non-human entities are implicitly framed as human by the surrounding context. We show that AnthroScore corresponds with human judgments of anthropomorphism and dimensions of anthropomorphism described in social science literature. Motivated by concerns of misleading anthropomorphism in computer science discourse, we use AnthroScore to analyze 15 years of research papers and downstream news articles. In research papers, we find that anthropomorphism has steadily increased over time, and that papers related to language models have the most anthropomorphism. Within ACL papers, temporal increases in anthropomorphism are correlated with key neural advancements. Building upon concerns of scientific misinformation in mass media, we identify higher levels of anthropomorphism in news headlines compared to the research papers they cite. Since AnthroScore is lexicon-free, it can be directly applied to a wide range of text sources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02056v1,2024-02
More Agents Is All You Need,"Junyou Li, Qin Zhang, Yangbin Yu, Qiang Fu, Deheng Ye","We find that, simply via a sampling-and-voting method, the performance of large language models (LLMs) scales with the number of agents instantiated. Also, this method, termed as Agent Forest, is orthogonal to existing complicated methods to further enhance LLMs, while the degree of enhancement is correlated to the task difficulty. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of LLM benchmarks to verify the presence of our finding, and to study the properties that can facilitate its occurrence.

EffiBench: Benchmarking the Efficiency of Automatically Generated Code,"Dong Huang, Yuhao Qing, Weiyi Shang, Heming Cui, Jie M. Zhang","Code generation models have increasingly become integral to aiding software development. Although current research has thoroughly examined the correctness of the code produced by code generation models, a vital aspect that plays a pivotal role in green computing and sustainability efforts has often been neglected. This paper presents EffiBench, a benchmark with 1,000 efficiency-critical coding problems to assess the efficiency of code generated by code generation models. EffiBench contains a diverse set of LeetCode coding problems. Each problem is paired with an executable human-written canonical solution, which obtains the SOTA efficiency on the LeetCode solution leaderboard. With EffiBench, we empirically examine the ability of 42 large language models (35 open-source and 7 closed-source) to generate efficient code. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the efficiency of the code generated by LLMs is generally worse than the efficiency of human-written canonical solutions. For example, GPT-4 generated code has an average \textbf{3.12} times execution time that of the human-written canonical solutions. In the most extreme cases, the execution time and total memory usage of GPT-4 generated code are \textbf{13.89} and \textbf{43.92} times that of the canonical solutions. The source code of EffiBench is released on https://github.com/huangd1999/EffiBench.

Panacea: Pareto Alignment via Preference Adaptation for LLMs,"Yifan Zhong, Chengdong Ma, Xiaoyuan Zhang, Ziran Yang, Haojun Chen, Qingfu Zhang, Siyuan Qi, Yaodong Yang","Current methods for large language model alignment typically use scalar human preference labels. However, this convention tends to oversimplify the multi-dimensional and heterogeneous nature of human preferences, leading to reduced expressivity and even misalignment. This paper presents Panacea, an innovative approach that reframes alignment as a multi-dimensional preference optimization problem. Panacea trains a single model capable of adapting online and Pareto-optimally to diverse sets of preferences without the need for further tuning. A major challenge here is using a low-dimensional preference vector to guide the model's behavior, despite it being governed by an overwhelmingly large number of parameters. To address this, Panacea is designed to use singular value decomposition (SVD)-based low-rank adaptation, which allows the preference vector to be simply injected online as singular values. Theoretically, we prove that Panacea recovers the entire Pareto front with common loss aggregation methods under mild conditions. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of aligning a single LLM to represent an exponentially vast spectrum of human preferences through various optimization methods. Our work marks a step forward in effectively and efficiently aligning models to diverse and intricate human preferences in a controllable and Pareto-optimal manner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02030v2,2024-02
A Closer Look at the Limitations of Instruction Tuning,"Sreyan Ghosh, Chandra Kiran Reddy Evuru, Sonal Kumar, Ramaneswaran S, Deepali Aneja, Zeyu Jin, Ramani Duraiswami, Dinesh Manocha","Instruction Tuning (IT), the process of training large language models (LLMs) using instruction-response pairs, has emerged as the predominant method for transforming base pre-trained LLMs into open-domain conversational agents. While IT has achieved notable success and widespread adoption, its limitations and shortcomings remain underexplored. In this paper, through rigorous experiments and an in-depth analysis of the changes LLMs undergo through IT, we reveal various limitations of IT. In particular, we show that (1) IT fails to enhance knowledge or skills in LLMs. LoRA fine-tuning is limited to learning response initiation and style tokens, and full-parameter fine-tuning leads to knowledge degradation. (2) Copying response patterns from IT datasets derived from knowledgeable sources leads to a decline in response quality. (3) Full-parameter fine-tuning increases hallucination by inaccurately borrowing tokens from conceptually similar instances in the IT dataset for generating responses. (4) Popular methods to improve IT do not lead to performance improvements over a simple LoRA fine-tuned model. Our findings reveal that responses generated solely from pre-trained knowledge consistently outperform responses by models that learn any form of new knowledge from IT on open-source datasets. We hope the insights and challenges revealed in this paper inspire future work in related directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05119v5,2024-02
How well do LLMs cite relevant medical references? An evaluation framework and analyses,"Kevin Wu, Eric Wu, Ally Cassasola, Angela Zhang, Kevin Wei, Teresa Nguyen, Sith Riantawan, Patricia Shi Riantawan, Daniel E. Ho, James Zou","Large language models (LLMs) are currently being used to answer medical questions across a variety of clinical domains. Recent top-performing commercial LLMs, in particular, are also capable of citing sources to support their responses. In this paper, we ask: do the sources that LLMs generate actually support the claims that they make? To answer this, we propose three contributions. First, as expert medical annotations are an expensive and time-consuming bottleneck for scalable evaluation, we demonstrate that GPT-4 is highly accurate in validating source relevance, agreeing 88% of the time with a panel of medical doctors. Second, we develop an end-to-end, automated pipeline called \textit{SourceCheckup} and use it to evaluate five top-performing LLMs on a dataset of 1200 generated questions, totaling over 40K pairs of statements and sources. Interestingly, we find that between ~50% to 90% of LLM responses are not fully supported by the sources they provide. We also evaluate GPT-4 with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and find that, even still, around 30\% of individual statements are unsupported, while nearly half of its responses are not fully supported. Third, we open-source our curated dataset of medical questions and expert annotations for future evaluations. Given the rapid pace of LLM development and the potential harms of incorrect or outdated medical information, it is crucial to also understand and quantify their capability to produce relevant, trustworthy medical references.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02008v1,2024-02
Self-Debiasing Large Language Models: Zero-Shot Recognition and Reduction of Stereotypes,"Isabel O. Gallegos, Ryan A. Rossi, Joe Barrow, Md Mehrab Tanjim, Tong Yu, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Ruiyi Zhang, Sungchul Kim, Franck Dernoncourt","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in language generation and understanding but are also prone to exhibiting harmful social biases. While recognition of these behaviors has generated an abundance of bias mitigation techniques, most require modifications to the training data, model parameters, or decoding strategy, which may be infeasible without access to a trainable model. In this work, we leverage the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs to reduce stereotyping in a technique we introduce as zero-shot self-debiasing. With two approaches, self-debiasing via explanation and self-debiasing via reprompting, we show that self-debiasing can significantly reduce the degree of stereotyping across nine different social groups while relying only on the LLM itself and a simple prompt, with explanations correctly identifying invalid assumptions and reprompting delivering the greatest reductions in bias. We hope this work opens inquiry into other zero-shot techniques for bias mitigation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01981v1,2024-02
SOCIALITE-LLAMA: An Instruction-Tuned Model for Social Scientific Tasks,"Gourab Dey, Adithya V Ganesan, Yash Kumar Lal, Manal Shah, Shreyashee Sinha, Matthew Matero, Salvatore Giorgi, Vivek Kulkarni, H. Andrew Schwartz","Social science NLP tasks, such as emotion or humor detection, are required to capture the semantics along with the implicit pragmatics from text, often with limited amounts of training data. Instruction tuning has been shown to improve the many capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as commonsense reasoning, reading comprehension, and computer programming. However, little is known about the effectiveness of instruction tuning on the social domain where implicit pragmatic cues are often needed to be captured. We explore the use of instruction tuning for social science NLP tasks and introduce Socialite-Llama -- an open-source, instruction-tuned Llama. On a suite of 20 social science tasks, Socialite-Llama improves upon the performance of Llama as well as matches or improves upon the performance of a state-of-the-art, multi-task finetuned model on a majority of them. Further, Socialite-Llama also leads to improvement on 5 out of 6 related social tasks as compared to Llama, suggesting instruction tuning can lead to generalized social understanding.

The task is divided into two sub-tasks: sub-task A focuses on the identification of hate speech and sub-task B focuses on the identification of targets in text-embedded images during political events. We use an XLM-roBERTa-large model for sub-task A and an ensemble approach combining XLM-roBERTa-base, BERTweet-large, and BERT-base for sub-task B.

The proposed method is an evolution of the traditional k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm which uses a large autoencoder trained to map the large label space to a reduced size latent space and to regenerate the predicted labels from this latent space. We have evaluated our proposal in a large portion of the MEDLINE biomedical document collection which uses the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus as a controlled vocabulary.

We also show that using this clean dataset can improve the model's performance, as in the case of the multilingual-to-English Speech Translation (ST) model, where, on average, we obtain a 4.65 BLEU score improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01945v1,2024-02
A Morphologically-Aware Dictionary-based Data Augmentation Technique for Machine Translation of Under-Represented Languages,"Md Mahfuz Ibn Alam, Sina Ahmadi, Antonios Anastasopoulos","The availability of parallel texts is crucial to the performance of machine translation models. However, most of the world's languages face the predominant challenge of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose strategies to synthesize parallel data relying on morpho-syntactic information and using bilingual lexicons along with a small amount of seed parallel data. Our methodology adheres to a realistic scenario backed by the small parallel seed data. It is linguistically informed, as it aims to create augmented data that is more likely to be grammatically correct. We analyze how our synthetic data can be combined with raw parallel data and demonstrate a consistent improvement in performance in our experiments on 14 languages (28 English <-> X pairs) ranging from well- to very low-resource ones. Our method leads to improvements even when using only five seed sentences and a bilingual lexicon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01939v1,2024-02
Code Representation Learning At Scale,"Dejiao Zhang, Wasi Ahmad, Ming Tan, Hantian Ding, Ramesh Nallapati, Dan Roth, Xiaofei Ma, Bing Xiang","Recent studies have shown that code language models at scale demonstrate significant performance gains on downstream tasks, i.e., code generation. However, most of the existing works on code representation learning train models at a hundred million parameter scale using very limited pretraining corpora. In this work, we fuel code representation learning with a vast amount of code data via a two-stage pretraining scheme. We first train the encoders via a mix that leverages both randomness in masking language modeling and the structure aspect of programming language. We then enhance the representations via contrastive learning with hard negative and hard positive constructed in an unsupervised manner. We establish an off-the-shelf encoder model that persistently outperforms the existing models on a wide variety of downstream tasks by large margins. To comprehend the factors contributing to successful code representation learning, we conduct detailed ablations and share our findings on (i) a customized and effective token-level denoising scheme for source code; (ii) the importance of hard negatives and hard positives; (iii) how the proposed bimodal contrastive learning boost the cross-lingual semantic search performance; and (iv) how the pretraining schemes decide the downstream task performance scales with the model size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01935v1,2024-02
Digits micro-model for accurate and secure transactions,"Chirag Chhablani, Nikhita Sharma, Jordan Hosier, Vijay K. Gurbani","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are used in the financial domain to enhance the caller experience by enabling natural language understanding and facilitating efficient and intuitive interactions. Increasing use of ASR systems requires that such systems exhibit very low error rates. The predominant ASR models to collect numeric data are large, general-purpose commercial models -- Google Speech-to-text (STT), or Amazon Transcribe -- or open source (OpenAI's Whisper). Such ASR models are trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of audio data and require considerable resources to run. Despite recent progress large speech recognition models, we highlight the potential of smaller, specialized ""micro"" models. Such light models can be trained perform well on number recognition specific tasks, competing with general models like Whisper or Google STT while using less than 80 minutes of training time and occupying at least an order of less memory resources. Also, unlike larger speech recognition models, micro-models are trained on carefully selected and curated datasets, which makes them highly accurate, agile, and easy to retrain, while using low compute resources. We present our work on creating micro models for multi-digit number recognition that handle diverse speaking styles reflecting real-world pronunciation patterns. Our work contributes to domain-specific ASR models, improving digit recognition accuracy, and privacy of data. An added advantage, their low resource consumption allows them to be hosted on-premise, keeping private data local instead uploading to an external cloud. Our results indicate that our micro-model makes less errors than the best-of-breed commercial or open-source ASRs in recognizing digits (1.8% error rate of our best micro-model versus 5.8% error rate of Whisper), and has a low memory footprint (0.66 GB VRAM for our model versus 11 GB VRAM for Whisper).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01931v1,2024-02
Preference Poisoning Attacks on Reward Model Learning,"Junlin Wu, Jiongxiao Wang, Chaowei Xiao, Chenguang Wang, Ning Zhang, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik","Learning reward models from pairwise comparisons is a fundamental component in a number of domains, including autonomous control, conversational agents, and recommendation systems, as part of a broad goal of aligning automated decisions with user preferences. These approaches entail collecting preference information from people, with feedback often provided anonymously. Since preferences are subjective, there is no gold standard to compare against; yet, reliance of high-impact systems on preference learning creates a strong motivation for malicious actors to skew data collected in this fashion to their ends. We investigate the nature and extent of this vulnerability by considering an attacker who can flip a small subset of preference comparisons to either promote or demote a target outcome. We propose two classes of algorithmic approaches for these attacks: a gradient-based framework, and several variants of rank-by-distance methods. Next, we evaluate the efficacy of best attacks in both these classes in successfully achieving malicious goals on datasets from three domains: autonomous control, recommendation system, and textual prompt-response preference learning. We find that the best attacks are often highly successful, achieving in the most extreme case 100\% success rate with only 0.3\% of the data poisoned. However, \emph{which} attack is best can vary significantly across domains. In addition, we observe that the simpler and more scalable rank-by-distance approaches are often competitive with, and on occasion significantly outperform, gradient-based methods. Finally, we show that state-of-the-art defenses against other classes of poisoning attacks exhibit limited efficacy in our setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01920v2,2024-02

Natural language guidance of high-fidelity text-to-speech with synthetic annotations,"Dan Lyth, Simon King","Text-to-speech models trained on large-scale datasets have demonstrated impressive in-context learning capabilities and naturalness. However, control of speaker identity and style in these models typically requires conditioning on reference speech recordings, limiting creative applications. Alternatively, natural language prompting of speaker identity and style has demonstrated promising results and provides an intuitive method of control. However, reliance on human-labeled descriptions prevents scaling to large datasets. Our work bridges the gap between these two approaches. We propose a scalable method for labeling various aspects of speaker identity, style, and recording conditions. We then apply this method to a 45k hour dataset, which we use to train a speech language model. Furthermore, we propose simple methods for increasing audio fidelity, significantly outperforming recent work despite relying entirely on found data. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity speech generation in a diverse range of accents, prosodic styles, channel conditions, and acoustic conditions, all accomplished with a single model and intuitive natural language conditioning.

LiPO: Listwise Preference Optimization through Learning-to-Rank,"Tianqi Liu, Zhen Qin, Junru Wu, Jiaming Shen, Misha Khalman, Rishabh Joshi, Yao Zhao, Mohammad Saleh, Simon Baumgartner, Jialu Liu, Peter J. Liu, Xuanhui Wang","Aligning language models (LMs) with curated human feedback is critical to control their behaviors in real-world applications. Several recent policy optimization methods, such as DPO and SLiC, serve as promising alternatives to the traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) approach. In practice, human feedback often comes in a format of a ranked list over multiple responses to amortize the cost of reading prompt. Multiple responses can also be ranked by reward models or AI feedback. There lacks such a thorough study on directly fitting upon a list of responses. In this work, we formulate the LM alignment as a \textit{listwise} ranking problem and describe the LiPO framework, where the policy can potentially learn more effectively from a ranked list of plausible responses given the prompt. This view draws an explicit connection to Learning-to-Rank (LTR), where most existing preference optimization work can be mapped to existing ranking objectives. Following this connection, we provide an examination of ranking objectives that are not well studied for LM alignment with DPO and SLiC as special cases when list size is two. In particular, we highlight a specific method, LiPO-$\lambda$, which leverages a state-of-the-art \textit{listwise} ranking objective and weights each preference pair in a more advanced manner. We show that LiPO-$\lambda$ can outperform DPO variants and SLiC by a clear margin on several preference alignment tasks with both curated and real rankwise preference data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01878v2,2024-02
The RL/LLM Taxonomy Tree: Reviewing Synergies Between Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models,"Moschoula Pternea, Prerna Singh, Abir Chakraborty, Yagna Oruganti, Mirco Milletari, Sayli Bapat, Kebei Jiang","In this work, we review research studies that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Large Language Models (LLMs), two areas that owe their momentum to the development of deep neural networks. We propose a novel taxonomy of three main classes based on the way that the two model types interact with each other. The first class, RL4LLM, includes studies where RL is leveraged to improve the performance of LLMs on tasks related to Natural Language Processing. L4LLM is divided into two sub-categories depending on whether RL is used to directly fine-tune an existing LLM or to improve the prompt of the LLM. In the second class, LLM4RL, an LLM assists the training of an RL model that performs a task that is not inherently related to natural language. We further break down LLM4RL based on the component of the RL training framework that the LLM assists or replaces, namely reward shaping, goal generation, and policy function. Finally, in the third class, RL+LLM, an LLM and an RL agent are embedded in a common planning framework without either of them contributing to training or fine-tuning of the other. We further branch this class to distinguish between studies with and without natural language feedback. We use this taxonomy to explore the motivations behind the synergy of LLMs and RL and explain the reasons for its success, while pinpointing potential shortcomings and areas where further research is needed, as well as alternative methodologies that serve the same goal.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01874v1,2024-02
InferCept: Efficient Intercept Support for Augmented Large Language Model Inference,"Reyna Abhyankar, Zijian He, Vikranth Srivatsa, Hao Zhang, Yiying Zhang","Large language models are increasingly integrated with external environments, tools, and agents like ChatGPT plugins to extend their capability beyond language-centric tasks. However, today's LLM inference systems are designed for standalone LLMs. They treat each external interaction as the end of LLM generation and form a new request when the interaction finishes, causing unnecessary recomputation of already computed contexts, which accounts for 37-40% of total model forwarding time. This paper presents InferCept, the first LLM inference framework targeting augmented LLMs and supporting the efficient interception of LLM generation. InferCept minimizes the GPU resource waste caused by LLM interceptions and dedicates saved memory for serving more requests. InferCept improves the overall serving throughput by 1.6x-2x and completes 2x more requests per second compared to the state-of-the-art LLM inference systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01869v2,2024-02
Leveraging Large Language Models for Structure Learning in Prompted Weak Supervision,"Jinyan Su, Peilin Yu, Jieyu Zhang, Stephen H. Bach","Prompted weak supervision (PromptedWS) applies pre-trained large language models (LLMs) as the basis for labeling functions (LFs) in a weak supervision framework to obtain large labeled datasets. We further extend the use of LLMs in the loop to address one of the key challenges in weak supervision: learning the statistical dependency structure among supervision sources. In this work, we ask the LLM how similar are these prompted LFs. We propose a Structure Refining Module, a simple yet effective first approach based on the similarities of the prompts by taking advantage of the intrinsic structure in the embedding space. At the core of Structure Refining Module are Labeling Function Removal (LaRe) and Correlation Structure Generation (CosGen). Compared to previous methods that learn the dependencies from weak labels, our method finds the dependencies which are intrinsic to the LFs and less dependent on the data. We show that our Structure Refining Module improves the PromptedWS pipeline by up to 12.7 points on the benchmark tasks. We also explore the trade-offs between efficiency and performance with comprehensive ablation experiments and analysis.

What Will My Model Forget? Forecasting Forgotten Examples in Language Model Refinement,"Xisen Jin, Xiang Ren","Language models deployed in the wild make errors. However, simply updating the model with the corrected error instances causes catastrophic forgetting -- the updated model makes errors on instances learned during the instruction tuning or upstream training phase. Randomly replaying upstream data yields unsatisfactory performance and often comes with high variance and poor controllability. To this end, we try to forecast upstream examples that will be forgotten due to a model update for improved controllability of the replay process and interpretability. We train forecasting models given a collection of online learned examples and corresponding forgotten upstream pre-training examples. We propose a partially interpretable forecasting model based on the observation that changes in pre-softmax logit scores of pretraining examples resemble that of online learned examples, which performs decently on BART but fails on T5 models. We further show a black-box classifier based on inner products of example representations achieves better forecasting performance over a series of setups. Finally, we show that we reduce forgetting of upstream pretraining examples by replaying examples that are forecasted to be forgotten, demonstrating the practical utility of forecasting example forgetting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01865v3,2024-02
Explaining latent representations of generative models with large multimodal models,"Mengdan Zhu, Zhenke Liu, Bo Pan, Abhinav Angirekula, Liang Zhao","Learning interpretable representations of data generative latent factors is an important topic for the development of artificial intelligence. With the rise of the large multimodal model, it can align images with text to generate answers. In this work, we propose a framework to comprehensively explain each latent variable in the generative models using a large multimodal model. We further measure the uncertainty of our generated explanations, quantitatively evaluate the performance of explanation generation among multiple large multimodal models, and qualitatively visualize the variations of each latent variable to learn the disentanglement effects of different generative models on explanations. Finally, we discuss the explanatory capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art large multimodal models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01858v3,2024-02
COMET: Generating Commit Messages using Delta Graph Context Representation,"Abhinav Reddy Mandli, Saurabhsingh Rajput, Tushar Sharma","Commit messages explain code changes in a commit and facilitate collaboration among developers. Several commit message generation approaches have been proposed; however, they exhibit limited success in capturing the context of code changes. We propose Comet (Context-Aware Commit Message Generation), a novel approach that captures context of code changes using a graph-based representation and leverages a transformer-based model to generate high-quality commit messages. Our proposed method utilizes delta graph that we developed to effectively represent code differences. We also introduce a customizable quality assurance module to identify optimal messages, mitigating subjectivity in commit messages. Experiments show that Comet outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of bleu-norm and meteor metrics while being comparable in terms of rogue-l. Additionally, we compare the proposed approach with the popular gpt-3.5-turbo model, along with gpt-4-turbo; the most capable GPT model, over zero-shot, one-shot, and multi-shot settings. We found Comet outperforming the GPT models, on five and four metrics respectively and provide competitive results with the two other metrics. The study has implications for researchers, tool developers, and software developers. Software developers may utilize Comet to generate context-aware commit messages. Researchers and tool developers can apply the proposed delta graph technique in similar contexts, like code review summarization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01841v1,2024-02
PiCO: Peer Review in LLMs based on the Consistency Optimization,"Kun-Peng Ning, Shuo Yang, Yu-Yang Liu, Jia-Yu Yao, Zhen-Hui Liu, Yu Wang, Ming Pang, Li Yuan","Existing large language models (LLMs) evaluation methods typically focus on testing the performance on some closed-environment and domain-specific benchmarks with human annotations. In this paper, we explore a novel unsupervised evaluation direction, utilizing peer-review mechanisms to measure LLMs automatically. In this setting, both open-source and closed-source LLMs lie in the same environment, capable of answering unlabeled questions and evaluating each other, where each LLM's response score is jointly determined by other anonymous ones. To obtain the ability hierarchy among these models, we assign each LLM a learnable capability parameter to adjust the final ranking. We formalize it as a constrained optimization problem, intending to maximize the consistency of each LLM's capabilities and scores. The key assumption behind is that high-level LLM can evaluate others' answers more accurately than low-level ones, while higher-level LLM can also achieve higher response scores. Moreover, we propose three metrics called PEN, CIN, and LIS to evaluate the gap in aligning human rankings. We perform experiments on multiple datasets with these metrics, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01830v2,2024-02
Position Paper: Generalized grammar rules and structure-based generalization beyond classical equivariance for lexical tasks and transduction,"Mircea Petrache, Shubhendu Trivedi","Compositional generalization is one of the main properties which differentiates lexical learning in humans from state-of-art neural networks. We propose a general framework for building models that can generalize compositionally using the concept of Generalized Grammar Rules (GGRs), a class of symmetry-based compositional constraints for transduction tasks, which we view as a transduction analogue of equivariance constraints in physics-inspired tasks. Besides formalizing generalized notions of symmetry for language transduction, our framework is general enough to contain many existing works as special cases. We present ideas on how GGRs might be implemented, and in the process draw connections to reinforcement learning and other areas of research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01629v1,2024-02
Predicting ATP binding sites in protein sequences using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing,"Shreyas V, Swati Agarwal","Predicting ATP-Protein Binding sites in genes is of great significance in the field of Biology and Medicine.

Over the years, researchers have been investigating computational methods computational methods to accomplish the same goals, utilising the strength of advanced Deep Learning and NLP algorithms. In this paper, we propose to develop methods to classify ATP-Protein binding sites. We conducted various experiments mainly using PSSMs and several word embeddings as features.

TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Real-World Planning with Language Agents,"Jian Xie, Kai Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Tinghui Zhu, Renze Lou, Yuandong Tian, Yanghua Xiao, Yu Su","Planning has been part of the core pursuit for artificial intelligence since its conception, but earlier AI agents mostly focused on constrained settings because many of the cognitive substrates necessary for human-level planning have been lacking. Recently, language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown interesting capabilities such as tool use and reasoning. Are these language agents capable of planning in more complex settings that are out of the reach of prior AI agents? To advance this investigation, we propose TravelPlanner, a new planning benchmark that focuses on travel planning, a common real-world planning scenario. It provides a rich sandbox environment, various tools for accessing nearly four million data records, and 1,225 meticulously curated planning intents and reference plans. Comprehensive evaluations show that the current language agents are not yet capable of handling such complex planning tasks-even GPT-4 only achieves a success rate of 0.6%. Language agents struggle to stay on task, use the right tools to collect information, or keep track of multiple constraints. However, we note that the mere possibility for language agents to tackle such a complex problem is in itself non-trivial progress. TravelPlanner provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future language agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01622v4,2024-02
MAGDi: Structured Distillation of Multi-Agent Interaction Graphs Improves Reasoning in Smaller Language Models,"Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal","Multi-agent interactions between Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown major improvements on diverse reasoning tasks. However, these involve long generations from multiple models across several rounds, making them expensive. Moreover, these multi-agent approaches fail to provide a final, single model for efficient inference. To address this, we introduce MAGDi, a new method for structured distillation of the reasoning interactions between multiple LLMs into smaller LMs. MAGDi teaches smaller models by representing multi-agent interactions as graphs, augmenting a base student model with a graph encoder, and distilling knowledge using three objective functions: next-token prediction, a contrastive loss between correct and incorrect reasoning, and a graph-based objective to model the interaction structure. Experiments on seven widely used commonsense and math reasoning benchmarks show that MAGDi improves the reasoning capabilities of smaller models, outperforming several methods that distill from a single teacher and multiple teachers. Moreover, MAGDi also demonstrates an order of magnitude higher efficiency over its teachers. We conduct extensive analyses to show that MAGDi (1) enhances the generalizability to out-of-domain tasks, (2) scales positively with the size and strength of the base student model, and (3) obtains larger improvements (via our multi-teacher training) when applying self-consistency -- an inference technique that relies on model diversity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01620v2,2024-02
KB-Plugin: A Plug-and-play Framework for Large Language Models to Induce Programs over Low-resourced Knowledge Bases,"Jiajie Zhang, Shulin Cao, Linmei Hu, Ling Feng, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li","Program induction (PI) has become a promising paradigm for using knowledge bases (KBs) to help large language models (LLMs) answer complex knowledge-intensive questions. Nonetheless, PI typically relies on a large number of parallel question-program pairs to make the LLM aware of the schema of the given KB, and is thus challenging for many low-resourced KBs that lack annotated data. To this end, we propose KB-Plugin, a plug-and-play framework that enables LLMs to induce programs over any low-resourced KB. Firstly, KB-Plugin adopts self-supervised learning to encode the detailed schema information of a given KB into a pluggable module, namely schema plugin. Secondly, KB-Plugin utilizes abundant annotated data from a rich-resourced KB to train another pluggable module, namely PI plugin, which can help the LLM extract question-relevant schema information from the schema plugin of any KB and utilize this information to induce programs over this KB. Experiments on five heterogeneous KBQA datasets show that KB-Plugin achieves better or comparable performance with 25$\times$ smaller backbone LLM compared to SoTA PI methods for low-resourced KBs, and even approaches the performance of supervised methods. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THU-KEG/KB-Plugin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01619v1,2024-02
Style Vectors for Steering Generative Large Language Model,"Kai Konen, Sophie Jentzsch, Diaoulé Diallo, Peer Schütt, Oliver Bensch, Roxanne El Baff, Dominik Opitz, Tobias Hecking","This research explores strategies for steering the output of large language models (LLMs) towards specific styles, such as sentiment, emotion, or writing style, by adding style vectors to the activations of hidden layers during text generation. We show that style vectors can be simply computed from recorded layer activations for input texts in a specific style in contrast to more complex training-based approaches. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of activation engineering using such style vectors to influence the style of generated text in a nuanced and parameterisable way, distinguishing it from prompt engineering. The presented research constitutes a significant step towards developing more adaptive and effective AI-empowered interactive systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01618v1,2024-02

Retrieval Augmented End-to-End Spoken Dialog Models,"Mingqiu Wang, Izhak Shafran, Hagen Soltau, Wei Han, Yuan Cao, Dian Yu, Laurent El Shafey","We recently developed SLM, a joint speech and language model, which fuses a pretrained foundational speech model and a large language model (LLM), while preserving the in-context learning capability intrinsic to the pretrained LLM. In this paper, we apply SLM to speech dialog applications where the dialog states are inferred directly from the audio signal.   Task-oriented dialogs often contain domain-specific entities, i.e., restaurants, hotels, train stations, and city names, which are difficult to recognize, however, critical for the downstream applications. Inspired by the RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) paradigm, we propose a retrieval augmented SLM (ReSLM) that overcomes this weakness. We first train a speech retriever to retrieve text entities mentioned in the audio. The retrieved entities are then added as text inputs to the underlying SLM to bias model predictions. We evaluated ReSLM on speech MultiWoz task (DSTC-11 challenge), and found that this retrieval augmentation boosts model performance, achieving joint goal accuracy (38.6% vs 32.7%), slot error rate (20.6% vs 24.8%) and ASR word error rate (5.5% vs 6.7%). While demonstrated on dialog state tracking, our approach is broadly applicable to other speech tasks requiring contextual information or domain-specific entities, such as contextual ASR with biasing capability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01828v1,2024-02
Leveraging Large Language Models for Analyzing Blood Pressure Variations Across Biological Sex from Scientific Literature,"Yuting Guo, Seyedeh Somayyeh Mousavi, Reza Sameni, Abeed Sarker","Hypertension, defined as blood pressure (BP) that is above normal, holds paramount significance in the realm of public health, as it serves as a critical precursor to various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and significantly contributes to elevated mortality rates worldwide. However, many existing BP measurement technologies and standards might be biased because they do not consider clinical outcomes, comorbidities, or demographic factors, making them inconclusive for diagnostic purposes. There is limited data-driven research focused on studying the variance in BP measurements across these variables. In this work, we employed GPT-35-turbo, a large language model (LLM), to automatically extract the mean and standard deviation values of BP for both males and females from a dataset comprising 25 million abstracts sourced from PubMed. 993 article abstracts met our predefined inclusion criteria (i.e., presence of references to blood pressure, units of blood pressure such as mmHg, and mention of biological sex). Based on the automatically-extracted information from these articles, we conducted an analysis of the variations of BP values across biological sex. Our results showed the viability of utilizing LLMs to study the BP variations across different demographic factors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01826v1,2024-02
Towards Sustainable Workplace Mental Health: A Novel Approach to Early Intervention and Support,"David W. Vinson, Mihael Arcan, David-Paul Niland, Fionn Delahunty","Employee well-being is a critical concern in the contemporary workplace, as highlighted by the American Psychological Association's 2021 report, indicating that 71% of employees experience stress or tension. This stress contributes significantly to workplace attrition and absenteeism, with 61% of attrition and 16% of sick days attributed to poor mental health. A major challenge for employers is that employees often remain unaware of their mental health issues until they reach a crisis point, resulting in limited utilization of corporate well-being benefits. This research addresses this challenge by presenting a groundbreaking stress detection algorithm that provides real-time support preemptively. Leveraging automated chatbot technology, the algorithm objectively measures mental health levels by analyzing chat conversations, offering personalized treatment suggestions in real-time based on linguistic biomarkers. The study explores the feasibility of integrating these innovations into practical learning applications within real-world contexts and introduces a chatbot-style system integrated into the broader employee experience platform. This platform, encompassing various features, aims to enhance overall employee well-being, detect stress in real time, and proactively engage with individuals to improve support effectiveness, demonstrating a 22% increase when assistance is provided early. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of fostering a supportive workplace environment for employees' mental health.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01592v1,2024-02
BAT: Learning to Reason about Spatial Sounds with Large Language Models,"Zhisheng Zheng, Puyuan Peng, Ziyang Ma, Xie Chen, Eunsol Choi, David Harwath","Spatial sound reasoning is a fundamental human skill, enabling us to navigate and interpret our surroundings based on sound. In this paper we present BAT, which combines the spatial sound perception ability of a binaural acoustic scene analysis model with the natural language reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to replicate this innate ability. To address the lack of existing datasets of in-the-wild spatial sounds, we synthesized a binaural audio dataset using AudioSet and SoundSpaces 2.0. Next, we developed SpatialSoundQA, a spatial sound-based question-answering dataset, offering a range of QA tasks that train BAT in various aspects of spatial sound perception and reasoning. The acoustic front end encoder of BAT is a novel spatial audio encoder named Spatial Audio Spectrogram Transformer, or Spatial-AST, which by itself achieves strong performance across sound event detection, spatial localization, and distance estimation. By integrating Spatial-AST with LLaMA-2 7B model, BAT transcends standard Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) tasks, enabling the model to reason about the relationships between the sounds in its environment. Our experiments demonstrate BAT's superior performance on both spatial sound perception and reasoning, showcasing the immense potential of LLMs in navigating and interpreting complex spatial audio environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01591v2,2024-02
TrustAgent: Towards Safe and Trustworthy LLM-based Agents,"Wenyue Hua, Xianjun Yang, Mingyu Jin, Zelong Li, Wei Cheng, Ruixiang Tang, Yongfeng Zhang","The rise of LLM-based agents shows great potential to revolutionize task planning, capturing significant attention. Given that these agents will be integrated into high-stake domains, ensuring their reliability and safety is crucial. This paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, with a particular focus on improving the LLM-based agent safety. The proposed framework ensures strict adherence to the Agent Constitution through three strategic components: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model before plan generation, in-planning strategy which enhances safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by post-planning inspection. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively enhance an LLM agent's safety across multiple domains by identifying and mitigating potential dangers during the planning. Further analysis reveals that the framework not only improves safety but also enhances the helpfulness of the agent. Additionally, we highlight the importance of the LLM reasoning ability in adhering to the Constitution. This paper sheds light on how to ensure the safe integration of LLM-based agents into human-centric environments.

Automating Sound Change Prediction for Phylogenetic Inference: A Tukanoan Case Study,"Kalvin Chang, Nathaniel R. Robinson, Anna Cai, Ting Chen, Annie Zhang, David R. Mortensen","We describe a set of new methods to partially automate linguistic phylogenetic inference given (1) cognate sets with their respective protoforms and sound laws, (2) a mapping from phones to their articulatory features and (3) a typological database of sound changes. We train a neural network on these sound change data to weight articulatory distances between phones and predict intermediate sound change steps between historical protoforms and their modern descendants, replacing a linguistic expert in part of a parsimony-based phylogenetic inference algorithm. In our best experiments on Tukanoan languages, this method produces trees with a Generalized Quartet Distance of 0.12 from a tree that used expert annotations, a significant improvement over other semi-automated baselines. We discuss potential benefits and drawbacks to our neural approach and parsimony-based tree prediction. We also experiment with a minimal generalization learner for automatic sound law induction, finding it comparably effective to sound laws from expert annotation.

Are Paralinguistic Representations all that is needed for Speech Emotion Recognition?,"Orchid Chetia Phukan, Gautam Siddharth Kashyap, Arun Balaji Buduru, Rajesh Sharma","Availability of representations from pre-trained models (PTMs) have facilitated substantial progress in speech emotion recognition (SER). Particularly, representations from PTM trained for paralinguistic speech processing have shown state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for SER. However, such paralinguistic PTM representations haven't been evaluated for SER in linguistic environments other than English. Also, paralinguistic PTM representations haven't been investigated in benchmarks such as SUPERB, EMO-SUPERB, ML-SUPERB for SER. This makes it difficult to access the efficacy of paralinguistic PTM representations for SER in multiple languages. To fill this gap, we perform a comprehensive comparative study of five SOTA PTM representations. Our results shows that paralinguistic PTM (TRILLsson) representations performs the best and this performance can be attributed to its effectiveness in capturing pitch, tone and other speech characteristics more effectively than other PTM representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01579v2,2024-02
Deep Active Learning for Data Mining from Conflict Text Corpora,Mihai Croicu,"High-resolution event data on armed conflict and related processes have revolutionized the study of political contention with datasets like UCDP GED, ACLED etc. However, most of these datasets limit themselves to collecting spatio-temporal (high-resolution) and intensity data. Information on dynamics, such as targets, tactics, purposes etc. are rarely collected owing to the extreme workload of collecting data. However, most datasets rely on a rich corpus of textual data allowing further mining of further information connected to each event. This paper proposes one such approach that is inexpensive and high performance, leveraging active learning - an iterative process of improving a machine learning model based on sequential (guided) human input. Active learning is employed to then step-wise train (fine-tuning) of a large, encoder-only language model adapted for extracting sub-classes of events relating to conflict dynamics. The approach shows performance similar to human (gold-standard) coding while reducing the amount of required human annotation by as much as 99%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01577v1,2024-02
Fractal Patterns May Illuminate the Success of Next-Token Prediction,"Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin, Vinh Q. Tran, Mostafa Dehghani","We study the fractal structure of language, aiming to provide a precise formalism for quantifying properties that may have been previously suspected but not formally shown. We establish that language is: (1) self-similar, exhibiting complexities at all levels of granularity, with no particular characteristic context length, and (2) long-range dependent (LRD), with a Hurst parameter of approximately H=0.7. Based on these findings, we argue that short-term patterns/dependencies in language, such as in paragraphs, mirror the patterns/dependencies over larger scopes, like entire documents. This may shed some light on how next-token prediction can capture the structure of text across multiple levels of granularity, from words and clauses to broader contexts and intents. In addition, we carry out an extensive analysis across different domains and architectures, showing that fractal parameters are robust. Finally, we demonstrate that the tiny variations in fractal parameters seen across LLMs improve upon perplexity-based bits-per-byte (BPB) in predicting their downstream performance. We hope these findings offer a fresh perspective on language and the mechanisms underlying the success of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01825v2,2024-02
Building Guardrails for Large Language Models,"Yi Dong, Ronghui Mu, Gaojie Jin, Yi Qi, Jinwei Hu, Xingyu Zhao, Jie Meng, Wenjie Ruan, Xiaowei Huang","As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to identify and mitigate their risks, especially when the risks can have profound impacts on human users and societies. Guardrails, which filter the inputs or outputs of LLMs, have emerged as a core safeguarding technology. This position paper takes a deep look at current open-source solutions (Llama Guard, Nvidia NeMo, Guardrails AI), and discusses the challenges and the road towards building more complete solutions. Drawing on robust evidence from previous research, we advocate for a systematic approach to construct guardrails for LLMs, based on comprehensive consideration of diverse contexts across various LLMs applications. We propose employing socio-technical methods through collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team to pinpoint precise technical requirements, exploring advanced neural-symbolic implementations to embrace the complexity of the requirements, and developing verification and testing to ensure the utmost quality of the final product.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01822v2,2024-02
An Empirical Analysis of Diversity in Argument Summarization,"Michiel van der Meer, Piek Vossen, Catholijn M. Jonker, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah","Presenting high-level arguments is a crucial task for fostering participation in online societal discussions. Current argument summarization approaches miss an important facet of this task -- capturing diversity -- which is important for accommodating multiple perspectives. We introduce three aspects of diversity: those of opinions, annotators, and sources. We evaluate approaches to a popular argument summarization task called Key Point Analysis, which shows how these approaches struggle to (1) represent arguments shared by few people, (2) deal with data from various sources, and (3) align with subjectivity in human-provided annotations. We find that both general-purpose LLMs and dedicated KPA models exhibit this behavior, but have complementary strengths. Further, we observe that diversification of training data may ameliorate generalization. Addressing diversity in argument summarization requires a mix of strategies to deal with subjectivity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01535v2,2024-02
Decoding Speculative Decoding,"Minghao Yan, Saurabh Agarwal, Shivaram Venkataraman","Speculative Decoding is a widely used technique to speed up inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing quality. When performing inference, speculative decoding uses a smaller draft model to generate speculative tokens and then uses the target LLM to verify those draft tokens. The speedup provided by speculative decoding heavily depends on the choice of the draft model. In this work, we perform a detailed study comprising over 350 experiments with LLaMA-65B and OPT-66B using speculative decoding and delineate the factors that affect the performance gain provided by speculative decoding. Our experiments indicate that the performance of speculative decoding depends heavily on the latency of the draft model, and the draft model's capability in language modeling does not correlate strongly with its performance in speculative decoding. Based on these insights we explore a new design space for draft models and design hardware-efficient draft models for speculative decoding. Our newly designed draft model for LLaMA-65B can provide 111% higher throughput than existing draft models and can generalize further to the LLaMA-2 model family and supervised fine-tuned models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01528v3,2024-02
K-Level Reasoning: Establishing Higher Order Beliefs in Large Language Models for Strategic Reasoning,"Yadong Zhang, Shaoguang Mao, Tao Ge, Xun Wang, Yan Xia, Man Lan, Furu Wei","Strategic reasoning is a complex yet essential capability for intelligent agents. It requires Large Language Model (LLM) agents to adapt their strategies dynamically in multi-agent environments. Unlike static reasoning tasks, success in these contexts depends on anticipating other agents' beliefs and actions while continuously adjusting strategies to achieve individual goals. LLMs and LLM agents often struggle with strategic reasoning due to the absence of a reasoning framework that enables them to dynamically infer others' perspectives and adapt to changing environments. Inspired by the Level-K framework from game theory and behavioral economics, which extends reasoning from simple reactions to structured strategic depth, we propose a novel framework: ""K-Level Reasoning with Large Language Models (K-R)."" This framework employs recursive mechanisms to enable LLMs to achieve varying levels of strategic depth, allowing agents to form higher order beliefs - beliefs about others' beliefs. We validate this framework through rigorous testing on four testbeds: two classical game theory problems and two social intelligence tasks. The results demonstrate the advantages of K-R in strategic reasoning. Our work presents the first recursive implementation of strategic depth in large language models (LLMs). It establishes a foundation for future research into theory of mind and strategic reasoning in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01521v2,2024-02
Multilingual Gradient Word-Order Typology from Universal Dependencies,"Emi Baylor, Esther Ploeger, Johannes Bjerva","While information from the field of linguistic typology has the potential to improve performance on NLP tasks, reliable typological data is a prerequisite. Existing typological databases, including WALS and Grambank, suffer from inconsistencies primarily caused by their categorical format. Furthermore, typological categorisations by definition differ significantly from the continuous nature of phenomena, as found in natural language corpora. In this paper, we introduce a new seed dataset made up of continuous-valued data, rather than categorical data, that can better reflect the variability of language. While this initial dataset focuses on word-order typology, we also present the methodology used to create the dataset, which can be easily adapted to generate data for a broader set of features and languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01513v1,2024-02

A Hybrid Strategy for Chat Transcript Summarization,Pratik K. Biswas,"Text summarization is the process of condensing a piece of text to fewer sentences, while still preserving its content. Chat transcript, in this context, is a textual copy of a digital or online conversation between a customer (caller) and agent(s).

Extensive testing, evaluations, comparisons, and validation have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach for large-scale deployment of chat transcript summarization, in the absence of manually generated reference (annotated) summaries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01510v2,2024-02
Code-Switched Language Identification is Harder Than You Think,"Laurie Burchell, Alexandra Birch, Robert P.

Looking to the application of building CS corpora, we explore CS language identification (LID) for corpus building. We make the task more realistic by scaling it to more languages and considering models with simpler architectures for faster inference. We also reformulate the task as a sentence-level multi-label tagging problem to make it more tractable.

A Comparative Analysis of Conversational Large Language Models in Knowledge-Based Text Generation,"Phillip Schneider, Manuel Klettner, Elena Simperl, Florian Matthes","Generating natural language text from graph-structured data is essential for conversational information seeking. Semantic triples derived from knowledge graphs can serve as a valuable source for grounding responses from conversational agents by providing a factual basis for the information they communicate. This is especially relevant in the context of large language models, which offer great potential for conversational interaction but are prone to hallucinating, omitting, or producing conflicting information. In this study, we conduct an empirical analysis of conversational large language models in generating natural language text from semantic triples. We compare four large language models of varying sizes with different prompting techniques. Through a series of benchmark experiments on the WebNLG dataset, we analyze the models' performance and identify the most common issues in the generated predictions. Our findings show that the capabilities of large language models in triple verbalization can be significantly improved through few-shot prompting, post-processing, and efficient fine-tuning techniques, particularly for smaller models that exhibit lower zero-shot performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01495v1,2024-02
AMOR: A Recipe for Building Adaptable Modular Knowledge Agents Through Process Feedback,"Jian Guan, Wei Wu, Zujie Wen, Peng Xu, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang","The notable success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked an upsurge in building language agents to complete various complex tasks. We present AMOR, an agent framework based on open-source LLMs, which reasons with external knowledge bases and adapts to specific domains through human supervision to the reasoning process. AMOR builds reasoning logic over a finite state machine (FSM) that solves problems through autonomous executions and transitions over disentangled modules. This allows humans to provide direct feedback to the individual modules, and thus naturally forms process supervision. Based on this reasoning and feedback framework, we develop AMOR through two-stage fine-tuning: warm-up and adaptation. The former fine-tunes the LLM with examples automatically constructed from various public datasets, enabling AMOR to generalize across different knowledge environments, while the latter tailors AMOR to specific domains using process feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate the advantage of AMOR to strong baselines, thanks to its FSM-based reasoning and process feedback mechanism. The code and data are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/JianGuanTHU/AMOR}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01469v2,2024-02
The Queen of England is not England's Queen: On the Lack of Factual Coherency in PLMs,"Paul Youssef, Jörg Schlötterer, Christin Seifert","Factual knowledge encoded in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) enriches their representations and justifies their use as knowledge bases. Previous work has focused on probing PLMs for factual knowledge by measuring how often they can correctly predict an object entity given a subject and a relation, and improving fact retrieval by optimizing the prompts used for querying PLMs. In this work, we consider a complementary aspect, namely the coherency of factual knowledge in PLMs, i.e., how often can PLMs predict the subject entity given its initial prediction of the object entity. This goes beyond evaluating how much PLMs know, and focuses on the internal state of knowledge inside them. Our results indicate that PLMs have low coherency using manually written, optimized and paraphrased prompts, but including an evidence paragraph leads to substantial improvement. This shows that PLMs fail to model inverse relations and need further enhancements to be able to handle retrieving facts from their parameters in a coherent manner, and to be considered as knowledge bases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01453v1,2024-02
The effect of diversity on group decision-making,"Georgi Karadzhov, Andreas Vlachos, Tom Stafford","We explore different aspects of cognitive diversity and its effect on the success of group deliberation. To evaluate this, we use 500 dialogues from small, online groups discussing the Wason Card Selection task - the DeliData corpus. Leveraging the corpus, we perform quantitative analysis evaluating three different measures of cognitive diversity. First, we analyse the effect of group size as a proxy measure for diversity. Second, we evaluate the effect of the size of the initial idea pool. Finally, we look into the content of the discussion by analysing discussed solutions, discussion patterns, and how conversational probing can improve those characteristics. Despite the reputation of groups for compounding bias, we show that small groups can, through dialogue, overcome intuitive biases and improve individual decision-making. Across a large sample and different operationalisations, we consistently find that greater cognitive diversity is associated with more successful group deliberation. Code and data used for the analysis are available in the repository: https://github.com/gkaradzhov/cognitive-diversity-groups-cogsci24.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01427v2,2024-02
Different Tastes of Entities: Investigating Human Label Variation in Named Entity Annotations,"Siyao Peng, Zihang Sun, Sebastian Loftus, Barbara Plank","Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key information extraction task with a long-standing tradition. While recent studies address and aim to correct annotation errors via re-labeling efforts, little is known about the sources of human label variation, such as text ambiguity, annotation error, or guideline divergence. This is especially the case for high-quality datasets and beyond English CoNLL03. This paper studies disagreements in expert-annotated named entity datasets for three languages: English, Danish, and Bavarian. We show that text ambiguity and artificial guideline changes are dominant factors for diverse annotations among high-quality revisions. We survey student annotations on a subset of difficult entities and substantiate the feasibility and necessity of manifold annotations for understanding named entity ambiguities from a distributional perspective.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01423v1,2024-02
Sequence Shortening for Context-Aware Machine Translation,"Paweł Mąka, Yusuf Can Semerci, Jan Scholtes, Gerasimos Spanakis","Context-aware Machine Translation aims to improve translations of sentences by incorporating surrounding sentences as context. Towards this task, two main architectures have been applied, namely single-encoder (based on concatenation) and multi-encoder models. In this study, we show that a special case of multi-encoder architecture, where the latent representation of the source sentence is cached and reused as the context in the next step, achieves higher accuracy on the contrastive datasets (where the models have to rank the correct translation among the provided sentences) and comparable BLEU and COMET scores as the single- and multi-encoder approaches. Furthermore, we investigate the application of Sequence Shortening to the cached representations. We test three pooling-based shortening techniques and introduce two novel methods - Latent Grouping and Latent Selecting, where the network learns to group tokens or selects the tokens to be cached as context. Our experiments show that the two methods achieve competitive BLEU and COMET scores and accuracies on the contrastive datasets to the other tested methods while potentially allowing for higher interpretability and reducing the growth of memory requirements with increased context size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01416v1,2024-02
On Measuring Context Utilization in Document-Level MT Systems,"Wafaa Mohammed, Vlad Niculae","Document-level translation models are usually evaluated using general metrics such as BLEU, which are not informative about the benefits of context. Current work on context-aware evaluation, such as contrastive methods, only measure translation accuracy on words that need context for disambiguation. Such measures cannot reveal whether the translation model uses the correct supporting context. We propose to complement accuracy-based evaluation with measures of context utilization. We find that perturbation-based analysis (comparing models' performance when provided with correct versus random context) is an effective measure of overall context utilization. For a finer-grained phenomenon-specific evaluation, we propose to measure how much the supporting context contributes to handling context-dependent discourse phenomena. We show that automatically-annotated supporting context gives similar conclusions to human-annotated context and can be used as alternative for cases where human annotations are not available. Finally, we highlight the importance of using discourse-rich datasets when assessing context utilization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01404v1,2024-02
Distilling LLMs' Decomposition Abilities into Compact Language Models,"Denis Tarasov, Kumar Shridhar","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in their reasoning abilities, yet their large size presents scalability challenges and limits any further customization. In contrast, compact models offer customized training but often fall short in solving complex reasoning tasks. This study focuses on distilling the LLMs' decomposition skills into compact models using offline reinforcement learning. We leverage the advancements in the LLM`s capabilities to provide feedback and generate a specialized task-specific dataset for training compact models. The development of an AI-generated dataset and the establishment of baselines constitute the primary contributions of our work, underscoring the potential of compact models in replicating complex problem-solving skills.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01812v1,2024-02
StepCoder: Improve Code Generation with Reinforcement Learning from Compiler Feedback,"Shihan Dou, Yan Liu, Haoxiang Jia, Limao Xiong, Enyu Zhou, Wei Shen, Junjie Shan, Caishuang Huang, Xiao Wang, Xiaoran Fan, Zhiheng Xi, Yuhao Zhou, Tao Ji, Rui Zheng, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang, Tao Gui","The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the field of code generation. Previous work integrated reinforcement learning (RL) with compiler feedback for exploring the output space of LLMs to enhance code generation quality. However, the lengthy code generated by LLMs in response to complex human requirements makes RL exploration a challenge. Also, since the unit tests may not cover the complicated code, optimizing LLMs by using these unexecuted code snippets is ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we introduce StepCoder, a novel RL framework for code generation, consisting of two main components: CCCS addresses the exploration challenge by breaking the long sequences code generation task into a Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks, while FGO only optimizes the model by masking the unexecuted code segments to provide Fine-Grained Optimization. In addition, we furthermore construct the APPS+ dataset for RL training, which is manually verified to ensure the correctness of unit tests. Experimental results show that our method improves the ability to explore the output space and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in corresponding benchmarks.

LLM-based NLG Evaluation: Current Status and Challenges,"Mingqi Gao, Xinyu Hu, Jie Ruan, Xiao Pu, Xiaojun Wan","Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) is a vital but challenging problem in artificial intelligence. Traditional evaluation metrics mainly capturing content (e.g. n-gram) overlap between system outputs and references are far from satisfactory, and large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated great potential in NLG evaluation in recent years. Various automatic evaluation methods based on LLMs have been proposed, including metrics derived from LLMs, prompting LLMs, and fine-tuning LLMs with labeled evaluation data. In this survey, we first give a taxonomy of LLM-based NLG evaluation methods, and discuss their pros and cons, respectively. We also discuss human-LLM collaboration for NLG evaluation.

LoTR: Low Tensor Rank Weight Adaptation,"Daniel Bershatsky, Daria Cherniuk, Talgat Daulbaev, Aleksandr Mikhalev, Ivan Oseledets","In this paper we generalize and extend an idea of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer architecture. Widely used LoRA-like methods of fine-tuning LLMs are based on matrix factorization of gradient update. We introduce LoTR, a novel approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs which represents a gradient update to parameters in a form of tensor decomposition. Low-rank adapter for each layer is constructed as a product of three matrices, and tensor structure arises from sharing left and right multipliers of this product among layers. Simultaneous compression of a sequence of layers with low-rank tensor representation allows LoTR to archive even better parameter efficiency then LoRA especially for deep models. Moreover, the core tensor does not depend on original weight dimension and can be made arbitrary small, which allows for extremely cheap and fast downstream fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01376v2,2024-02
Dive into the Chasm: Probing the Gap between In- and Cross-Topic Generalization,"Andreas Waldis, Yufang Hou, Iryna Gurevych","Pre-trained language models (LMs) perform well in In-Topic setups, where training and testing data come from the same topics. However, they face challenges in Cross-Topic scenarios where testing data is derived from distinct topics -- such as Gun Control. This study analyzes various LMs with three probing-based experiments to shed light on the reasons behind the In- vs. Cross-Topic generalization gap. Thereby, we demonstrate, for the first time, that generalization gaps and the robustness of the embedding space vary significantly across LMs. Additionally, we assess larger LMs and underscore the relevance of our analysis for recent models. Overall, diverse pre-training objectives, architectural regularization, or data deduplication contribute to more robust LMs and diminish generalization gaps. Our research contributes to a deeper understanding and comparison of language models across different generalization scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01375v1,2024-02
Continual Learning for Large Language Models: A Survey,"Tongtong Wu, Linhao Luo, Yuan-Fang Li, Shirui Pan, Thuy-Trang Vu, Gholamreza Haffari","Large language models (LLMs) are not amenable to frequent re-training, due to high training costs arising from their massive scale. However, updates are necessary to endow LLMs with new skills and keep them up-to-date with rapidly evolving human knowledge. This paper surveys recent works on continual learning for LLMs. Due to the unique nature of LLMs, we catalog continue learning techniques in a novel multi-staged categorization scheme, involving continual pretraining, instruction tuning, and alignment. We contrast continual learning for LLMs with simpler adaptation methods used in smaller models, as well as with other enhancement strategies like retrieval-augmented generation and model editing. Moreover, informed by a discussion of benchmarks and evaluation, we identify several challenges and future work directions for this crucial task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01364v2,2024-02
What Makes Medical Claims (Un)Verifiable? Analyzing Entity and Relation Properties for Fact Verification,"Amelie Wührl, Yarik Menchaca Resendiz, Lara Grimminger, Roman Klinger","Biomedical claim verification fails if no evidence can be discovered. In these cases, the fact-checking verdict remains unknown and the claim is unverifiable. To improve upon this, we have to understand if there are any claim properties that impact its verifiability. In this work we assume that entities and relations define the core variables in a biomedical claim's anatomy and analyze if their properties help us to differentiate verifiable from unverifiable claims. In a study with trained annotation experts we prompt them to find evidence for biomedical claims, and observe how they refine search queries for their evidence search. This leads to the first corpus for scientific fact verification annotated with subject-relation-object triplets, evidence documents, and fact-checking verdicts (the BEAR-Fact corpus). We find (1) that discovering evidence for negated claims (e.g., X-does-not-cause-Y) is particularly challenging. Further, we see that annotators process queries mostly by adding constraints to the search and by normalizing entities to canonical names. (2) We compare our in-house annotations with a small crowdsourcing setting where we employ medical experts and laypeople. We find that domain expertise does not have a substantial effect on the reliability of annotations. Finally, (3), we demonstrate that it is possible to reliably estimate the success of evidence retrieval purely from the claim text~(.82\F), whereas identifying unverifiable claims proves more challenging (.27\F).

Describing Images $\textit{Fast and Slow}$: Quantifying and Predicting the Variation in Human Signals during Visuo-Linguistic Processes,"Ece Takmaz, Sandro Pezzelle, Raquel Fernández","There is an intricate relation between the properties of an image and how humans behave while describing the image. This behavior shows ample variation, as manifested in human signals such as eye movements and when humans start to describe the image. Despite the value of such signals of visuo-linguistic variation, they are virtually disregarded in the training of current pretrained models, which motivates further investigation. Using a corpus of Dutch image descriptions with concurrently collected eye-tracking data, we explore the nature of the variation in visuo-linguistic signals, and find that they correlate with each other. Given this result, we hypothesize that variation stems partly from the properties of the images, and explore whether image representations encoded by pretrained vision encoders can capture such variation. Our results indicate that pretrained models do so to a weak-to-moderate degree, suggesting that the models lack biases about what makes a stimulus complex for humans and what leads to variations in human outputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01352v1,2024-02
LLMs May Perform MCQA by Selecting the Least Incorrect Option,"Haochun Wang, Sendong Zhao, Zewen Qiang, Nuwa Xi, Bing Qin, Ting Liu","In the field of NLP, Large Language Models (LLMs) have markedly enhanced performance across a variety of tasks. However, the comprehensive evaluation of LLMs remains an inevitable challenge for the community. Recently, the adoption of Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) as a benchmark for assessing LLMs has gained considerable traction. However, concerns regarding the robustness of this evaluative method persist. Building upon previous discussions on the issue of \textit{variability}, we reveal an additional dimension of concern: LLMs may perform MCQA by selecting the least incorrect option rather than distinctly correct. This observation suggests that LLMs might regard multiple options as correct, which could undermine the reliability of MCQA as a metric for evaluating LLMs. To address this challenge, we introduce an enhanced dataset augmentation method for MCQA, termed MCQA+, to provide a more accurate reflection of the model performance, thereby highlighting the necessity for more sophisticated evaluation mechanisms in the assessment of LLM capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01349v3,2024-02
Skip \n: A Simple Method to Reduce Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models,"Zongbo Han, Zechen Bai, Haiyang Mei, Qianli Xu, Changqing Zhang, Mike Zheng Shou","Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in visual information understanding with human language. Despite these advances, LVLMs still face challenges with multimodal hallucination, such as generating text descriptions of objects that are not present in the visual information. However, the underlying fundamental reasons of multimodal hallucinations remain poorly explored. In this paper, we propose a new perspective, suggesting that the inherent biases in LVLMs might be a key factor in hallucinations. Specifically, we systematically identify a semantic shift bias related to paragraph breaks (\n\n), where the content before and after '\n\n' in the training data frequently exhibit significant semantic changes. This pattern leads the model to infer that the contents following '\n\n' should be obviously different from the preceding contents with less hallucinatory descriptions, thereby increasing the probability of hallucinatory descriptions subsequent to the '\n\n'. We have validated this hypothesis on multiple publicly available LVLMs. Besides, we find that deliberately inserting '\n\n' at the generated description can induce more hallucinations. A simple method is proposed to effectively mitigate the hallucination of LVLMs by skipping the output of '\n'.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01345v6,2024-02
Rethinking the Role of Proxy Rewards in Language Model Alignment,"Sungdong Kim, Minjoon Seo","Learning from human feedback via proxy reward modeling has been studied to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, achieving reliable training through that proxy reward model (RM) is not a trivial problem, and its behavior remained as a black-box. In this paper, we study the role of proxy rewards in the LLM alignment via `reverse reward engineering' by composing interpretable features as a white-box reward function. We aim to replicate the ground truth (gold) reward signal by achieving a monotonic relationship between the proxy and gold reward signals after training the model using the proxy reward in reinforcement learning (RL). Our findings indicate that successfully emulating the gold reward requires generating responses that are relevant with enough length to open-ended questions, while also ensuring response consistency in closed-ended questions. Furthermore, resulting models optimizing our devised white-box reward show competitive performances with strong open-source RMs in alignment benchmarks. We highlight its potential usage as a simple but strong reward baseline for the LLM alignment, not requiring explicit human feedback dataset and RM training.

Two Approaches to Diachronic Normalization of Polish Texts,"Kacper Dudzic, Filip Graliński, Krzysztof Jassem, Marek Kubis, Piotr Wierzchoń","This paper discusses two approaches to the diachronic normalization of Polish texts: a rule-based solution that relies on a set of handcrafted patterns, and a neural normalization model based on the text-to-text transfer transformer architecture. The training and evaluation data prepared for the task are discussed in detail, along with experiments conducted to compare the proposed normalization solutions. A quantitative and qualitative analysis is made. It is shown that at the current stage of inquiry into the problem, the rule-based solution outperforms the neural one on 3 out of 4 variants of the prepared dataset, although in practice both approaches have distinct advantages and disadvantages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01300v1,2024-02
Can MLLMs Perform Text-to-Image In-Context Learning?,"Yuchen Zeng, Wonjun Kang, Yicong Chen, Hyung Il Koo, Kangwook Lee","The evolution from Large Language Models (LLMs) to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has spurred research into extending In-Context Learning (ICL) to its multimodal counterpart. Existing such studies have primarily concentrated on image-to-text ICL. However, the Text-to-Image ICL (T2I-ICL), with its unique characteristics and potential applications, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we formally define the task of T2I-ICL and present CoBSAT, the first T2I-ICL benchmark dataset, encompassing ten tasks. Utilizing our dataset to benchmark six state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover considerable difficulties MLLMs encounter in solving T2I-ICL. We identify the primary challenges as the inherent complexity of multimodality and image generation, and show that strategies such as fine-tuning and Chain-of-Thought prompting help to mitigate these difficulties, leading to notable improvements in performance.

HQA-Attack: Toward High Quality Black-Box Hard-Label Adversarial Attack on Text,"Han Liu, Zhi Xu, Xiaotong Zhang, Feng Zhang, Fenglong Ma, Hongyang Chen, Hong Yu, Xianchao Zhang","Black-box hard-label adversarial attack on text is a practical and challenging task, as the text data space is inherently discrete and non-differentiable, and only the predicted label is accessible. Research on this problem is still in the embryonic stage and only a few methods are available. Nevertheless, existing methods rely on the complex heuristic algorithm or unreliable gradient estimation strategy, which probably fall into the local optimum and inevitably consume numerous queries, thus are difficult to craft satisfactory adversarial examples with high semantic similarity and low perturbation rate in a limited query budget. To alleviate above issues, we propose a simple yet effective framework to generate high quality textual adversarial examples under the black-box hard-label attack scenarios, named HQA-Attack. Specifically, after initializing an adversarial example randomly, HQA-attack first constantly substitutes original words back as many as possible, thus shrinking the perturbation rate. Then it leverages the synonym set of the remaining changed words to further optimize the adversarial example with the direction which can improve the semantic similarity and satisfy the adversarial condition simultaneously. In addition, during the optimizing procedure, it searches a transition synonym word for each changed word, thus avoiding traversing the whole synonym set and reducing the query number to some extent. Extensive experimental results on five text classification datasets, three natural language inference datasets and two real-world APIs have shown that the proposed HQA-Attack method outperforms other strong baselines significantly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01806v1,2024-02
Can LLMs perform structured graph reasoning?,"Palaash Agrawal, Shavak Vasania, Cheston Tan","Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various reasoning capabilities through language-based prompts alone, particularly in unstructured task settings (tasks purely based on language semantics). However, LLMs often struggle with structured tasks, because of the inherent incompatibility of input representation. Reducing structured tasks to uni-dimensional language semantics often renders the problem trivial. Keeping the trade-off between LLM compatibility and structure complexity in mind, we design various graph reasoning tasks as a proxy to semi-structured tasks in this paper, in order to test the ability to navigate through representations beyond plain text in various LLMs. Particularly, we design 10 distinct problems of graph traversal, each representing increasing levels of complexity, and benchmark 5 different instruct-finetuned LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-2, Llama-2 and Palm-2) on the aforementioned tasks. Further, we analyse the performance of models across various settings such as varying sizes of graphs as well as different forms of k-shot prompting. We highlight various limitations, biases and properties of LLMs through this benchmarking process, such as an inverse relation to the average degrees of freedom of traversal per node in graphs, the overall negative impact of k-shot prompting on graph reasoning tasks, and a positive response bias which prevents LLMs from identifying the absence of a valid solution. Finally, we introduce a new prompting technique specially designed for graph traversal tasks (PathCompare), which demonstrates a notable increase in the performance of LLMs in comparison to standard prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01805v4,2024-02
"The Human and the Mechanical: logos, truthfulness, and ChatGPT","Anastasia Giannakidou, Alda Mari","The paper addresses the question of whether it is appropriate to talk about `mechanical minds' at all, and whether ChatGPT models can indeed be thought of as realizations of that. Our paper adds a semantic argument to the current debate. The act of human assertion requires the formation of a veridicality judgment. Modification of assertions with modals (John must be at home) and the use of subjective elements (John is obviously at home) indicate that the speaker is manipulating her judgments and, in a cooperative context, intends her epistemic state to be transparent to the addressee. Veridicality judgments are formed on the basis of two components: (i) evidence that relates to reality (exogenous evidence) and (ii) endogenous evidence, such as preferences and private beliefs. `Mechanical minds' lack these two components: (i) they do not relate to reality and (ii) do not have endogenous evidence. Therefore they lack the ability to form a belief about the world and a veridicality judgments altogether. They can only mimic that judgment, but the output is not ground in the very foundations for it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01267v1,2024-02

LINGO-Space: Language-Conditioned Incremental Grounding for Space,"Dohyun Kim, Nayoung Oh, Deokmin Hwang, Daehyung Park","We aim to solve the problem of spatially localizing composite instructions referring to space: space grounding. Compared to current instance grounding, space grounding is challenging due to the ill-posedness of identifying locations referred to by discrete expressions and the compositional ambiguity of referring expressions. Therefore, we propose a novel probabilistic space-grounding methodology (LINGO-Space) that accurately identifies a probabilistic distribution of space being referred to and incrementally updates it, given subsequent referring expressions leveraging configurable polar distributions. Our evaluations show that the estimation using polar distributions enables a robot to ground locations successfully through $20$ table-top manipulation benchmark tests. We also show that updating the distribution helps the grounding method accurately narrow the referring space.

In-Context Learning for Few-Shot Nested Named Entity Recognition,"Meishan Zhang, Bin Wang, Hao Fei, Min Zhang","In nested Named entity recognition (NER), entities are nested with each other, and thus requiring more data annotations to address.

CorpusLM: Towards a Unified Language Model on Corpus for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks,"Xiaoxi Li, Zhicheng Dou, Yujia Zhou, Fangchao Liu","Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in various fields but prone to hallucination, especially in knowledge-intensive (KI) tasks. To address this, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular solution to enhance factual accuracy. However, traditional retrieval modules often rely on large document index and disconnect with generative tasks. With the advent of generative retrieval (GR), language models can retrieve by directly generating document identifiers (DocIDs), offering superior performance in retrieval tasks. However, the potential relationship between GR and downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CorpusLM}, a unified language model that leverages external corpus to tackle various knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating generative retrieval, closed-book generation, and RAG through a unified greedy decoding process. We design the following mechanisms to facilitate effective retrieval and generation, and improve the end-to-end effectiveness of KI tasks: (1) We develop a ranking-oriented DocID list generation strategy, which refines GR by directly learning from a DocID ranking list, to improve retrieval quality. (2) We design a continuous DocIDs-References-Answer generation strategy, which facilitates effective and efficient RAG. (3) We employ well-designed unsupervised DocID understanding tasks, to comprehend DocID semantics and their relevance to downstream tasks. We evaluate our approach on the widely used KILT benchmark with two variants of backbone models, i.e., T5 and Llama2. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our models in both retrieval and downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01176v2,2024-02
Efficient Prompt Caching via Embedding Similarity,"Hanlin Zhu, Banghua Zhu, Jiantao Jiao","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success in numerous natural language process (NLP) tasks. However, it faces the challenge of significant resource consumption during inference. In this paper, we aim to improve the inference efficiency of LLMs by prompt caching, i.e., if the current prompt can be answered by the same response of a previous prompt, one can directly utilize that previous response without calling the LLM. Specifically, we focus on the prediction accuracy of prompt caching for single-round question-answering tasks via embedding similarity. The existing embeddings of prompts mostly focus on whether two prompts are semantically similar, which is not necessarily equivalent to whether the same response can answer them. Therefore, we propose a distillation-based method to fine-tune the existing embeddings for better caching prediction. Theoretically, we provide finite-sample guarantees for the convergence of our method under different types of loss functions. Empirically, we carefully construct a hard dataset based on Kwiatkowski et al. (2019) where the existing embedding model (Wang et al., 2022) only achieves an AUC of 0.51. We then fine-tune the above embedding model, which significantly improves the AUC of caching prediction from 0.51 to 0.81. We also conduct simulations demonstrating that our trained models achieve better caching efficiency than the previous embedding model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01173v1,2024-02

Faster and Lighter LLMs: A Survey on Current Challenges and Way Forward,"Arnav Chavan, Raghav Magazine, Shubham Kushwaha, Mérouane Debbah, Deepak Gupta","Despite the impressive performance of LLMs, their widespread adoption faces challenges due to substantial computational and memory requirements during inference. Recent advancements in model compression and system-level optimization methods aim to enhance LLM inference. This survey offers an overview of these methods, emphasizing recent developments. Through experiments on LLaMA(/2)-7B, we evaluate various compression techniques, providing practical insights for efficient LLM deployment in a unified setting. The empirical analysis on LLaMA(/2)-7B highlights the effectiveness of these methods.

LLM-Detector: Improving AI-Generated Chinese Text Detection with Open-Source LLM Instruction Tuning,"Rongsheng Wang, Haoming Chen, Ruizhe Zhou, Han Ma, Yaofei Duan, Yanlan Kang, Songhua Yang, Baoyu Fan, Tao Tan","ChatGPT and other general large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but they have also raised concerns about the misuse of AI-generated texts. Existing AI-generated text detection models, such as based on BERT and RoBERTa, are prone to in-domain over-fitting, leading to poor out-of-domain (OOD) detection performance. In this paper, we first collected Chinese text responses generated by human experts and 9 types of LLMs, for which to multiple domains questions, and further created a dataset that mixed human-written sentences and sentences polished by LLMs. We then proposed LLM-Detector, a novel method for both document-level and sentence-level text detection through Instruction Tuning of LLMs. Our method leverages the wealth of knowledge LLMs acquire during pre-training, enabling them to detect the text they generate. Instruction tuning aligns the model's responses with the user's expected text detection tasks. Experimental results show that previous methods struggle with sentence-level AI-generated text detection and OOD detection. In contrast, our proposed method not only significantly outperforms baseline methods in both sentence-level and document-level text detection but also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, since LLM-Detector is trained based on open-source LLMs, it is easy to customize for deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01158v1,2024-02
CABINET: Content Relevance based Noise Reduction for Table Question Answering,"Sohan Patnaik, Heril Changwal, Milan Aggarwal, Sumit Bhatia, Yaman Kumar, Balaji Krishnamurthy","Table understanding capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been extensively studied through the task of question-answering (QA) over tables. Typically, only a small part of the whole table is relevant to derive the answer for a given question. The irrelevant parts act as noise and are distracting information, resulting in sub-optimal performance due to the vulnerability of LLMs to noise. To mitigate this, we propose CABINET (Content RelevAnce-Based NoIse ReductioN for TablE QuesTion-Answering) - a framework to enable LLMs to focus on relevant tabular data by suppressing extraneous information. CABINET comprises an Unsupervised Relevance Scorer (URS), trained differentially with the QA LLM, that weighs the table content based on its relevance to the input question before feeding it to the question-answering LLM (QA LLM). To further aid the relevance scorer, CABINET employs a weakly supervised module that generates a parsing statement describing the criteria of rows and columns relevant to the question and highlights the content of corresponding table cells. CABINET significantly outperforms various tabular LLM baselines, as well as GPT3-based in-context learning methods, is more robust to noise, maintains outperformance on tables of varying sizes, and establishes new SoTA performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and WikiSQL datasets. We release our code and datasets at https://github.com/Sohanpatnaik106/CABINET_QA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01155v3,2024-02
AccentFold: A Journey through African Accents for Zero-Shot ASR Adaptation to Target Accents,"Abraham Toluwase Owodunni, Aditya Yadavalli, Chris Chinenye Emezue, Tobi Olatunji, Clinton C Mbataku","Despite advancements in speech recognition, accented speech remains challenging. While previous approaches have focused on modeling techniques or creating accented speech datasets, gathering sufficient data for the multitude of accents, particularly in the African context, remains impractical due to their sheer diversity and associated budget constraints. To address these challenges, we propose AccentFold, a method that exploits spatial relationships between learned accent embeddings to improve downstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Our exploratory analysis of speech embeddings representing 100+ African accents reveals interesting spatial accent relationships highlighting geographic and genealogical similarities, capturing consistent phonological, and morphological regularities, all learned empirically from speech. Furthermore, we discover accent relationships previously uncharacterized by the Ethnologue. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AccentFold by showing that, for out-of-distribution (OOD) accents, sampling accent subsets for training based on AccentFold information outperforms strong baselines a relative WER improvement of 4.6%. AccentFold presents a promising approach for improving ASR performance on accented speech, particularly in the context of African accents, where data scarcity and budget constraints pose significant challenges. Our findings emphasize the potential of leveraging linguistic relationships to improve zero-shot ASR adaptation to target accents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01152v2,2024-02
Speech foundation models in healthcare: Effect of layer selection on pathological speech feature prediction,"Daniela A. Wiepert, Rene L. Utianski, Joseph R. Duffy, John L. Stricker, Leland R. Barnard, David T. Jones, Hugo Botha","Accurately extracting clinical information from speech is critical to the diagnosis and treatment of many neurological conditions. As such, there is interest in leveraging AI for automatic, objective assessments of clinical speech to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of speech disorders. We explore transfer learning using foundation models, focusing on the impact of layer selection for the downstream task of predicting pathological speech features. We find that selecting an optimal layer can greatly improve performance (~15.8% increase in balanced accuracy per feature as compared to worst layer, ~13.6% increase as compared to final layer), though the best layer varies by predicted feature and does not always generalize well to unseen data. A learned weighted sum offers comparable performance to the average best layer in-distribution (only ~1.2% lower) and had strong generalization for out-of-distribution data (only 1.5% lower than the average best layer).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01796v2,2024-02
A Multi-Agent Conversational Recommender System,"Jiabao Fang, Shen Gao, Pengjie Ren, Xiuying Chen, Suzan Verberne, Zhaochun Ren","Due to strong capabilities in conducting fluent, multi-turn conversations with users, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to further improve the performance of Conversational Recommender System (CRS). Unlike the aimless chit-chat that LLM excels at, CRS has a clear target. So it is imperative to control the dialogue flow in the LLM to successfully recommend appropriate items to the users. Furthermore, user feedback in CRS can assist the system in better modeling user preferences, which has been ignored by existing studies. However, simply prompting LLM to conduct conversational recommendation cannot address the above two key challenges.   In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent Conversational Recommender System (MACRS) which contains two essential modules. First, we design a multi-agent act planning framework, which can control the dialogue flow based on four LLM-based agents. This cooperative multi-agent framework will generate various candidate responses based on different dialogue acts and then choose the most appropriate response as the system response, which can help MACRS plan suitable dialogue acts. Second, we propose a user feedback-aware reflection mechanism which leverages user feedback to reason errors made in previous turns to adjust the dialogue act planning, and higher-level user information from implicit semantics. We conduct extensive experiments based on user simulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of MACRS in recommendation and user preferences collection. Experimental results illustrate that MACRS demonstrates an improvement in user interaction experience compared to directly using LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01135v1,2024-02
PokeLLMon: A Human-Parity Agent for Pokemon Battles with Large Language Models,"Sihao Hu, Tiansheng Huang, Ling Liu","We introduce PokeLLMon, the first LLM-embodied agent that achieves human-parity performance in tactical battle games, as demonstrated in Pokemon battles. The design of PokeLLMon incorporates three key strategies: (i) In-context reinforcement learning that instantly consumes text-based feedback derived from battles to iteratively refine the policy; (ii) Knowledge-augmented generation that retrieves external knowledge to counteract hallucination and enables the agent to act timely and properly; (iii) Consistent action generation to mitigate the panic switching phenomenon when the agent faces a powerful opponent and wants to elude the battle. We show that online battles against human demonstrates PokeLLMon's human-like battle strategies and just-in-time decision making, achieving 49% of win rate in the Ladder competitions and 56% of win rate in the invited battles. Our implementation and playable battle logs are available at: https://github.com/git-disl/PokeLLMon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01118v3,2024-02
DTS-SQL: Decomposed Text-to-SQL with Small Large Language Models,"Mohammadreza Pourreza, Davood Rafiei","Leading models for the text-to-SQL task heavily rely on proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs), posing concerns over data privacy. Closing the performance gap between small open-source models and large proprietary models is crucial to mitigate this reliance. To this end, we introduce a novel two-stage fine-tuning approach that decomposes the task into two simpler tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation on two large cross-domain datasets and two small LLMs, we show that this approach improves execution accuracy by 3 to 7 percent, effectively aligning the performance of open-source models with their proprietary counterparts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01117v1,2024-02
Interpretation of Intracardiac Electrograms Through Textual Representations,"William Jongwon Han, Diana Gomez, Avi Alok, Chaojing Duan, Michael A. Rosenberg, Douglas Weber, Emerson Liu, Ding Zhao","Understanding the irregular electrical activity of atrial fibrillation (AFib) has been a key challenge in electrocardiography. For serious cases of AFib, catheter ablations are performed to collect intracardiac electrograms (EGMs). EGMs offer intricately detailed and localized electrical activity of the heart and are an ideal modality for interpretable cardiac studies. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has allowed some works to utilize deep learning frameworks to interpret EGMs during AFib. Additionally, language models (LMs) have shown exceptional performance in being able to generalize to unseen domains, especially in healthcare. In this study, we are the first to leverage pretrained LMs for finetuning of EGM interpolation and AFib classification via masked language modeling. We formulate the EGM as a textual sequence and present competitive performances on AFib classification compared against other representations. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive interpretability study to provide a multi-perspective intuition of the model's behavior, which could greatly benefit the clinical use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01115v5,2024-02
Evaluation of Google's Voice Recognition and Sentence Classification for Health Care Applications,"Majbah Uddin, Nathan Huynh, Jose M Vidal, Kevin M Taaffe, Lawrence D Fredendall, Joel S Greenstein","This study examined the use of voice recognition technology in perioperative services (Periop) to enable Periop staff to record workflow milestones using mobile technology. The use of mobile technology to improve patient flow and quality of care could be facilitated if such voice recognition technology could be made robust. The goal of this experiment was to allow the Periop staff to provide care without being interrupted with data entry and querying tasks. However, the results are generalizable to other situations where an engineering manager attempts to improve communication performance using mobile technology. This study enhanced Google's voice recognition capability by using post-processing classifiers (i.e., bag-of-sentences, support vector machine, and maximum entropy). The experiments investigated three factors (original phrasing, reduced phrasing, and personalized phrasing) at three levels (zero training repetition, 5 training repetitions, and 10 training repetitions). Results indicated that personal phrasing yielded the highest correctness and that training the device to recognize an individual's voice improved correctness as well. Although simplistic, the bag-of-sentences classifier significantly improved voice recognition correctness. The classification efficiency of the maximum entropy and support vector machine algorithms was found to be nearly identical. These results suggest that engineering managers could significantly enhance Google's voice recognition technology by using post-processing techniques, which would facilitate its use in health care and other applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03369v1,2024-02
Vaccine: Perturbation-aware Alignment for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning Attack,"Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Ling Liu","The new paradigm of finetuning-as-a-service introduces a new attack surface for Large Language Models (LLMs): a few harmful data uploaded by users can easily trick the finetuning to produce an alignment-broken model. We conduct an empirical analysis and uncover a \textit{harmful embedding drift} phenomenon, showing a probable cause of the alignment-broken effect. Inspired by our findings, we propose Vaccine, a perturbation-aware alignment technique to mitigate the security risk of users finetuning. The core idea of Vaccine is to produce invariant hidden embeddings by progressively adding crafted perturbation to them in the alignment phase. This enables the embeddings to withstand harmful perturbation from un-sanitized user data in the finetuning phase. Our results on open source mainstream LLMs (e.g., Llama2, Opt, Vicuna) demonstrate that Vaccine can boost the robustness of alignment against harmful prompts induced embedding drift while reserving reasoning ability towards benign prompts.

"Reasoning Capacity in Multi-Agent Systems: Limitations, Challenges and Human-Centered Solutions","Pouya Pezeshkpour, Eser Kandogan, Nikita Bhutani, Sajjadur Rahman, Tom Mitchell, Estevam Hruschka","Remarkable performance of large language models (LLMs) in a variety of tasks brings forth many opportunities as well as challenges of utilizing them in production settings. Towards practical adoption of LLMs, multi-agent systems hold great promise to augment, integrate, and orchestrate LLMs in the larger context of enterprise platforms that use existing proprietary data and models to tackle complex real-world tasks. Despite the tremendous success of these systems, current approaches rely on narrow, single-focus objectives for optimization and evaluation, often overlooking potential constraints in real-world scenarios, including restricted budgets, resources and time. Furthermore, interpreting, analyzing, and debugging these systems requires different components to be evaluated in relation to one another. This demand is currently not feasible with existing methodologies. In this postion paper, we introduce the concept of reasoning capacity as a unifying criterion to enable integration of constraints during optimization and establish connections among different components within the system, which also enable a more holistic and comprehensive approach to evaluation. We present a formal definition of reasoning capacity and illustrate its utility in identifying limitations within each component of the system. We then argue how these limitations can be addressed with a self-reflective process wherein human-feedback is used to alleviate shortcomings in reasoning and enhance overall consistency of the system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01108v1,2024-02
The Political Preferences of LLMs,David Rozado,"I report here a comprehensive analysis about the political preferences embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs). Namely, I administer 11 political orientation tests, designed to identify the political preferences of the test taker, to 24 state-of-the-art conversational LLMs, both closed and open source. When probed with questions/statements with political connotations, most conversational LLMs tend to generate responses that are diagnosed by most political test instruments as manifesting preferences for left-of-center viewpoints. This does not appear to be the case for five additional base (i.e. foundation) models upon which LLMs optimized for conversation with humans are built. However, the weak performance of the base models at coherently answering the tests' questions makes this subset of results inconclusive. Finally, I demonstrate that LLMs can be steered towards specific locations in the political spectrum through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with only modest amounts of politically aligned data, suggesting SFT's potential to embed political orientation in LLMs. With LLMs beginning to partially displace traditional information sources like search engines and Wikipedia, the societal implications of political biases embedded in LLMs are substantial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01789v2,2024-02
LitLLM: A Toolkit for Scientific Literature Review,"Shubham Agarwal, Issam H. Laradji, Laurent Charlin, Christopher Pal","Conducting literature reviews for scientific papers is essential for understanding research, its limitations, and building on existing work. It is a tedious task which makes an automatic literature review generator appealing. Unfortunately, many existing works that generate such reviews using Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant limitations. They tend to hallucinate-generate non-actual information-and ignore the latest research they have not been trained on. To address these limitations, we propose a toolkit that operates on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, specialized prompting and instructing techniques with the help of LLMs. Our system first initiates a web search to retrieve relevant papers by summarizing user-provided abstracts into keywords using an off-the-shelf LLM. Authors can enhance the search by supplementing it with relevant papers or keywords, contributing to a tailored retrieval process. Second, the system re-ranks the retrieved papers based on the user-provided abstract. Finally, the related work section is generated based on the re-ranked results and the abstract. There is a substantial reduction in time and effort for literature review compared to traditional methods, establishing our toolkit as an efficient alternative. Our open-source toolkit is accessible at https://github.com/shubhamagarwal92/LitLLM and Huggingface space (https://huggingface.co/spaces/shubhamagarwal92/LitLLM) with the video demo at https://youtu.be/E2ggOZBAFw0.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01788v1,2024-02

Need a Small Specialized Language Model? Plan Early!,"David Grangier, Angelos Katharopoulos, Pierre Ablin, Awni Hannun","Large language models are versatile tools but are not suitable for small inference budgets. Small models have more efficient inference, but their lower capacity means that their performance can be good only if one limits their scope to a specialized domain. This paper explores how to get good specialized small language models using a large, generic, pretraining set and a limited amount of specialized data. We consider two scenarios, depending on whether (i) one can afford pretraining a model for each specialization task, or (ii) one wants to cheaply adapt a single pretrained model for each task. In the first scenario, we propose an effective solution based on importance sampling: we resample the pretraining set to imitate the specialization data and train a small model on it. In the second scenario, we propose a novel architecture, projected networks (PN). PN is a large network whose parameters can be linearly projected into a small network for specialization. For both scenarios, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our solutions across various domains, training set sizes, and training budgets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01093v2,2024-02
Reading Between the Tweets: Deciphering Ideological Stances of Interconnected Mixed-Ideology Communities,"Zihao He, Ashwin Rao, Siyi Guo, Negar Mokhberian, Kristina Lerman","Recent advances in NLP have improved our ability to understand the nuanced worldviews of online communities. Existing research focused on probing ideological stances treats liberals and conservatives as separate groups. However, this fails to account for the nuanced views of the organically formed online communities and the connections between them. In this paper, we study discussions of the 2020 U.S. election on Twitter to identify complex interacting communities. Capitalizing on this interconnectedness, we introduce a novel approach that harnesses message passing when finetuning language models (LMs) to probe the nuanced ideologies of these communities. By comparing the responses generated by LMs and real-world survey results, our method shows higher alignment than existing baselines, highlighting the potential of using LMs in revealing complex ideologies within and across interconnected mixed-ideology communities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01091v1,2024-02

Plan-Grounded Large Language Models for Dual Goal Conversational Settings,"Diogo Glória-Silva, Rafael Ferreira, Diogo Tavares, David Semedo, João Magalhães","Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow user instructions has been shown to supply the LLM with ample capacity to converse fluently while being aligned with humans. Yet, it is not completely clear how an LLM can lead a plan-grounded conversation in mixed-initiative settings where instructions flow in both directions of the conversation, i.e. both the LLM and the user provide instructions to one another. In this paper, we tackle a dual goal mixed-initiative conversational setting where the LLM not only grounds the conversation on an arbitrary plan but also seeks to satisfy both a procedural plan and user instructions. The LLM is then responsible for guiding the user through the plan and, at the same time, adapting to new circumstances, answering questions, and activating safety guardrails when needed. We propose a novel LLM that grounds the dialogue on a procedural plan, can take the dialogue initiative, and enforces guardrails on the system's behavior, while also improving the LLM's responses to unexpected user behavior. Experiments in controlled settings and with real users show that the best-performing model, which we call PlanLLM, achieves a 2.1x improvement over a strong baseline. Moreover, experiments also show good generalization to unseen domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01053v1,2024-02
"Generation, Distillation and Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing-Style Reflections with a Foundational Language Model","Andrew Brown, Jiading Zhu, Mohamed Abdelwahab, Alec Dong, Cindy Wang, Jonathan Rose","Large Foundational Language Models are capable of performing many tasks at a high level but are difficult to deploy in many applications because of their size and proprietary ownership. Many will be motivated to distill specific capabilities of foundational models into smaller models that can be owned and controlled. In the development of a therapeutic chatbot, we wish to distill a capability known as reflective listening, in which a therapist produces reflections of client speech. These reflections either restate what a client has said, or connect what was said to a relevant observation, idea or guess that encourages and guides the client to continue contemplation. In this paper, we present a method for distilling the generation of reflections from a Foundational Language Model (GPT-4) into smaller models. We first show that GPT-4, using zero-shot prompting, can generate reflections at near 100% success rate, superior to all previous methods. Using reflections generated by GPT-4, we fine-tune different sizes of the GPT-2 family. The GPT-2-small model achieves 83% success on a hold-out test set and the GPT-2 XL achieves 90% success. We also show that GPT-4 can help in the labor-intensive task of evaluating the quality of the distilled models, using it as a zero-shot classifier. Using triple-human review as a guide, the classifier achieves a Cohen-Kappa of 0.66, a substantial inter-rater reliability figure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01051v1,2024-02
COA-GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformers for Accelerated Course of Action Development in Military Operations,"Vinicius G. Goecks, Nicholas Waytowich","The development of Courses of Action (COAs) in military operations is traditionally a time-consuming and intricate process. Addressing this challenge, this study introduces COA-GPT, a novel algorithm employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid and efficient generation of valid COAs. COA-GPT incorporates military doctrine and domain expertise to LLMs through in-context learning, allowing commanders to input mission information - in both text and image formats - and receive strategically aligned COAs for review and approval. Uniquely, COA-GPT not only accelerates COA development, producing initial COAs within seconds, but also facilitates real-time refinement based on commander feedback. This work evaluates COA-GPT in a military-relevant scenario within a militarized version of the StarCraft II game, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. Our results demonstrate COA-GPT's superiority in generating strategically sound COAs more swiftly, with added benefits of enhanced adaptability and alignment with commander intentions. COA-GPT's capability to rapidly adapt and update COAs during missions presents a transformative potential for military planning, particularly in addressing planning discrepancies and capitalizing on emergent windows of opportunities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01786v2,2024-02
Getting the most out of your tokenizer for pre-training and domain adaptation,"Gautier Dagan, Gabriel Synnaeve, Baptiste Rozière","Tokenization is an understudied and often neglected component of modern LLMs. Most published works use a single tokenizer for all experiments, often borrowed from another model, without performing ablations or analysis to optimize tokenization. Moreover, the tokenizer is generally kept unchanged when fine-tuning a base model. In this paper, we show that the size, pre-tokenization regular expression, and training data of a tokenizer can significantly impact the model's generation speed, effective context size, memory usage, and downstream performance. We train specialized Byte-Pair Encoding code tokenizers, and conduct extensive ablations on the impact of tokenizer design on the performance of LLMs for code generation tasks such as HumanEval and MBPP, and provide recommendations for tokenizer hyper-parameters selection and switching the tokenizer in a pre-trained LLM. We perform our experiments on models trained from scratch and from pre-trained models, verifying their applicability to a wide range of use-cases. We find that when fine-tuning on more than 50 billion tokens, we can specialize the tokenizer of a pre-trained LLM to obtain large gains in generation speed and effective context size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01035v2,2024-02
Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying,"Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, Sham M. Kakade, Eran Malach","Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as ""generalized state space models"" (GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01032v2,2024-02
Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents,"Xingyao Wang, Yangyi Chen, Lifan Yuan, Yizhe Zhang, Yunzhu Li, Hao Peng, Heng Ji","Large Language Model (LLM) agents, capable of performing a broad range of actions, such as invoking tools and controlling robots, show great potential in tackling real-world challenges. LLM agents are typically prompted to produce actions by generating JSON or text in a pre-defined format, which is usually limited by constrained action space (e.g., the scope of pre-defined tools) and restricted flexibility (e.g., inability to compose multiple tools). This work proposes to use executable Python code to consolidate LLM agents' actions into a unified action space (CodeAct). Integrated with a Python interpreter, CodeAct can execute code actions and dynamically revise prior actions or emit new actions upon new observations through multi-turn interactions. Our extensive analysis of 17 LLMs on API-Bank and a newly curated benchmark shows that CodeAct outperforms widely used alternatives (up to 20% higher success rate). The encouraging performance of CodeAct motivates us to build an open-source LLM agent that interacts with environments by executing interpretable code and collaborates with users using natural language. To this end, we collect an instruction-tuning dataset CodeActInstruct that consists of 7k multi-turn interactions using CodeAct. We show that it can be used with existing data to improve models in agent-oriented tasks without compromising their general capability. CodeActAgent, finetuned from Llama2 and Mistral, is integrated with Python interpreter and uniquely tailored to perform sophisticated tasks (e.g., model training) using existing libraries and autonomously self-debug.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01030v4,2024-02
Graph-based Clustering for Detecting Semantic Change Across Time and Languages,"Xianghe Ma, Michael Strube, Wei Zhao","Despite the predominance of contextualized embeddings in NLP, approaches to detect semantic change relying on these embeddings and clustering methods underperform simpler counterparts based on static word embeddings. This stems from the poor quality of the clustering methods to produce sense clusters -- which struggle to capture word senses, especially those with low frequency. This issue hinders the next step in examining how changes in word senses in one language influence another. To address this issue, we propose a graph-based clustering approach to capture nuanced changes in both high- and low-frequency word senses across time and languages, including the acquisition and loss of these senses over time. Our experimental results show that our approach substantially surpasses previous approaches in the SemEval2020 binary classification task across four languages. Moreover, we showcase the ability of our approach as a versatile visualization tool to detect semantic changes in both intra-language and inter-language setups. We make our code and data publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01025v1,2024-02

Examples such as time-off submissions, medical claims filing, and access requests are noteworthy, but they are by no means the sole instances. However, the aforementioned developments must grapple with the pivotal challenge of constructing a high-quality training dataset. On one hand, most conversation datasets are solving problems for customers not employees. On the other hand, gathering conversations with HR could raise privacy concerns. To solve it, we introduce HR-Multiwoz, a fully-labeled dataset of 550 conversations spanning 10 HR domains to evaluate LLM Agent. Our work has the following contributions: (1) It is the first labeled open-sourced conversation dataset in the HR domain for NLP research. (2) It provides a detailed recipe for the data generation procedure along with data analysis and human evaluations. The data generation pipeline is transferable and can be easily adapted for labeled conversation data generation in other domains. (3) The proposed data-collection pipeline is mostly based on LLMs with minimal human involvement for annotation, which is time and cost-efficient.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01018v1,2024-02
Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification of Online Vaccine Concerns,"Chloe Qinyu Zhu, Rickard Stureborg, Bhuwan Dhingra","Vaccine concerns are an ever-evolving target, and can shift quickly as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying longitudinal trends in vaccine concerns and misinformation might inform the healthcare space by helping public health efforts strategically allocate resources or information campaigns. We explore the task of detecting vaccine concerns in online discourse using large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot setting without the need for expensive training datasets. Since real-time monitoring of online sources requires large-scale inference, we explore cost-accuracy trade-offs of different prompting strategies and offer concrete takeaways that may inform choices in system designs for current applications. An analysis of different prompting strategies reveals that classifying the concerns over multiple passes through the LLM, each consisting a boolean question whether the text mentions a vaccine concern or not, works the best. Our results indicate that GPT-4 can strongly outperform crowdworker accuracy when compared to ground truth annotations provided by experts on the recently introduced VaxConcerns dataset, achieving an overall F1 score of 78.7%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01783v1,2024-02
An Information-Theoretic Approach to Analyze NLP Classification Tasks,"Luran Wang, Mark Gales, Vatsal Raina","Understanding the importance of the inputs on the output is useful across many tasks. This work provides an information-theoretic framework to analyse the influence of inputs for text classification tasks. Natural language processing (NLP) tasks take either a single element input or multiple element inputs to predict an output variable, where an element is a block of text. Each text element has two components: an associated semantic meaning and a linguistic realization. Multiple-choice reading comprehension (MCRC) and sentiment classification (SC) are selected to showcase the framework. For MCRC, it is found that the context influence on the output compared to the question influence reduces on more challenging datasets. In particular, more challenging contexts allow a greater variation in complexity of questions. Hence, test creators need to carefully consider the choice of the context when designing multiple-choice questions for assessment. For SC, it is found the semantic meaning of the input text dominates (above 80\% for all datasets considered) compared to its linguistic realisation when determining the sentiment. The framework is made available at: https://github.com/WangLuran/nlp-element-influence",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00978v1,2024-02
SPARQL Generation with Entity Pre-trained GPT for KG Question Answering,"Diego Bustamante, Hideaki Takeda","Knowledge Graphs popularity has been rapidly growing in last years. All that knowledge is available for people to query it through the many online databases on the internet. Though, it would be a great achievement if non-programmer users could access whatever information they want to know. There has been a lot of effort oriented to solve this task using natural language processing tools and creativity encouragement by way of many challenges. Our approach focuses on assuming a correct entity linking on the natural language questions and training a GPT model to create SPARQL queries from them. We managed to isolate which property of the task can be the most difficult to solve at few or zero-shot and we proposed pre-training on all entities (under CWA) to improve the performance. We obtained a 62.703% accuracy of exact SPARQL matches on testing at 3-shots, a F1 of 0.809 on the entity linking challenge and a F1 of 0.009 on the question answering challenge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00969v1,2024-02
Exploring Spatial Schema Intuitions in Large Language and Vision Models,"Philipp Wicke, Lennart Wachowiak","Despite the ubiquity of large language models (LLMs) in AI research, the question of embodiment in LLMs remains underexplored, distinguishing them from embodied systems in robotics where sensory perception directly informs physical action. Our investigation navigates the intriguing terrain of whether LLMs, despite their non-embodied nature, effectively capture implicit human intuitions about fundamental, spatial building blocks of language. We employ insights from spatial cognitive foundations developed through early sensorimotor experiences, guiding our exploration through the reproduction of three psycholinguistic experiments. Surprisingly, correlations between model outputs and human responses emerge, revealing adaptability without a tangible connection to embodied experiences. Notable distinctions include polarized language model responses and reduced correlations in vision language models. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the interplay between language, spatial experiences, and the computations made by large language models.

When Benchmarks are Targets: Revealing the Sensitivity of Large Language Model Leaderboards,"Norah Alzahrani, Hisham Abdullah Alyahya, Yazeed Alnumay, Sultan Alrashed, Shaykhah Alsubaie, Yusef Almushaykeh, Faisal Mirza, Nouf Alotaibi, Nora Altwairesh, Areeb Alowisheq, M Saiful Bari, Haidar Khan","Large Language Model (LLM) leaderboards based on benchmark rankings are regularly used to guide practitioners in model selection. Often, the published leaderboard rankings are taken at face value - we show this is a (potentially costly) mistake. Under existing leaderboards, the relative performance of LLMs is highly sensitive to (often minute) details. We show that for popular multiple-choice question benchmarks (e.g., MMLU), minor perturbations to the benchmark, such as changing the order of choices or the method of answer selection, result in changes in rankings up to 8 positions. We explain this phenomenon by conducting systematic experiments over three broad categories of benchmark perturbations and identifying the sources of this behavior. Our analysis results in several best-practice recommendations, including the advantage of a hybrid scoring method for answer selection. Our study highlights the dangers of relying on simple benchmark evaluations and charts the path for more robust evaluation schemes on the existing benchmarks.

Evaluating Large Language Models for Generalization and Robustness via Data Compression,"Yucheng Li, Yunhao Guo, Frank Guerin, Chenghua Lin","Existing methods for evaluating large language models face challenges such as data contamination, sensitivity to prompts, and the high cost of benchmark creation. To address this, we propose a lossless data compression based evaluation approach that tests how models' predictive abilities generalize after their training cutoff. Specifically, we collect comprehensive test data spanning 83 months from 2017 to 2023 and split the data into training and testing periods according to models' training data cutoff. We measure: 1) the compression performance on the testing period as a measure of generalization on unseen data; and 2) the performance gap between the training and testing period as a measure of robustness. Our experiments test 14 representative large language models with various sizes on sources including Wikipedia, news articles, code, arXiv papers, and multi-modal data. We find that the compression rate of many models reduces significantly after their cutoff date, but models such as Mistral and Llama-2 demonstrate a good balance between performance and robustness. Results also suggest that models struggle to generalize on news and code data, but work especially well on arXiv papers. We also find the context size and tokenization implementation have a big impact of on the overall compression performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00861v2,2024-02
Can Large Language Models Understand Context?,"Yilun Zhu, Joel Ruben Antony Moniz, Shruti Bhargava, Jiarui Lu, Dhivya Piraviperumal, Site Li, Yuan Zhang, Hong Yu, Bo-Hsiang Tseng","Understanding context is key to understanding human language, an ability which Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly seen to demonstrate to an impressive extent. However, though the evaluation of LLMs encompasses various domains within the realm of Natural Language Processing, limited attention has been paid to probing their linguistic capability of understanding contextual features. This paper introduces a context understanding benchmark by adapting existing datasets to suit the evaluation of generative models. This benchmark comprises of four distinct tasks and nine datasets, all featuring prompts designed to assess the models' ability to understand context. First, we evaluate the performance of LLMs under the in-context learning pretraining scenario. Experimental results indicate that pre-trained dense models struggle with understanding more nuanced contextual features when compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuned models. Second, as LLM compression holds growing significance in both research and real-world applications, we assess the context understanding of quantized models under in-context-learning settings. We find that 3-bit post-training quantization leads to varying degrees of performance reduction on our benchmark. We conduct an extensive analysis of these scenarios to substantiate our experimental results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00858v1,2024-02
Towards Efficient Exact Optimization of Language Model Alignment,"Haozhe Ji, Cheng Lu, Yilin Niu, Pei Ke, Hongning Wang, Jun Zhu, Jie Tang, Minlie Huang","The alignment of language models with human preferences is vital for their application in real-world tasks. The problem is formulated as optimizing the model's policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences with minimal deviation from the initial policy. While considered as a straightforward solution, reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from high variance in policy updates, which impedes efficient policy improvement. Recently, direct preference optimization (DPO) was proposed to directly optimize the policy from preference data. However, we show that DPO derived based on the optimal solution of the problem leads to a compromised mean-seeking approximation of the optimal solution in practice. In this paper, we propose efficient exact optimization (EXO) of the alignment objective. EXO is guaranteed to optimize in the same direction as RL algorithms asymptotically for arbitrary policy parametrization. This leads to the same mode-seeking solution, while enables efficient optimization by circumventing the complexities of RL. We also compare our method to DPO with both theoretical and empirical analyses, and further demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing approaches on realistic human preference data.

Tiny Titans: Can Smaller Large Language Models Punch Above Their Weight in the Real World for Meeting Summarization?,"Xue-Yong Fu, Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Elena Khasanova, Cheng Chen, Shashi Bhushan TN","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities to solve a wide range of tasks without being explicitly fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, deploying LLMs in the real world is not trivial, as it requires substantial computing resources. In this paper, we investigate whether smaller, compact LLMs are a good alternative to the comparatively Larger LLMs2 to address significant costs associated with utilizing LLMs in the real world. In this regard, we study the meeting summarization task in a real-world industrial environment and conduct extensive experiments by comparing the performance of fine-tuned compact LLMs (e.g., FLAN-T5, TinyLLaMA, LiteLLaMA) with zero-shot larger LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2, GPT-3.5, PaLM-2). We observe that most smaller LLMs, even after fine-tuning, fail to outperform larger zero-shot LLMs in meeting summarization datasets. However, a notable exception is FLAN-T5 (780M parameters), which performs on par or even better than many zero-shot Larger LLMs (from 7B to above 70B parameters), while being significantly smaller. This makes compact LLMs like FLAN-T5 a suitable cost-efficient solution for real-world industrial deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00841v2,2024-02

ALISON: Fast and Effective Stylometric Authorship Obfuscation,"Eric Xing, Saranya Venkatraman, Thai Le, Dongwon Lee","Authorship Attribution (AA) and Authorship Obfuscation (AO) are two competing tasks of increasing importance in privacy research. Modern AA leverages an author's consistent writing style to match a text to its author using an AA classifier. AO is the corresponding adversarial task, aiming to modify a text in such a way that its semantics are preserved, yet an AA model cannot correctly infer its authorship. To address privacy concerns raised by state-of-the-art (SOTA) AA methods, new AO methods have been proposed but remain largely impractical to use due to their prohibitively slow training and obfuscation speed, often taking hours. To this challenge, we propose a practical AO method, ALISON, that (1) dramatically reduces training/obfuscation time, demonstrating more than 10x faster obfuscation than SOTA AO methods, (2) achieves better obfuscation success through attacking three transformer-based AA methods on two benchmark datasets, typically performing 15% better than competing methods, (3) does not require direct signals from a target AA classifier during obfuscation, and (4) utilizes unique stylometric features, allowing sound model interpretation for explainable obfuscation. We also demonstrate that ALISON can effectively prevent four SOTA AA methods from accurately determining the authorship of ChatGPT-generated texts, all while minimally changing the original text semantics.

Formal-LLM: Integrating Formal Language and Natural Language for Controllable LLM-based Agents,"Zelong Li, Wenyue Hua, Hao Wang, He Zhu, Yongfeng Zhang","Recent advancements on Large Language Models (LLMs) enable AI Agents to automatically generate and execute multi-step plans to solve complex tasks. However, since LLM's content generation process is hardly controllable, current LLM-based agents frequently generate invalid or non-executable plans, which jeopardizes the performance of the generated plans and corrupts users' trust in LLM-based agents. In response, this paper proposes a novel ""Formal-LLM"" framework for LLM-based agents by integrating the expressiveness of natural language and the precision of formal language. Specifically, the framework allows agent developers to express their requirements or constraints for the planning process as an automaton. A stack-based LLM plan generation process is then conducted under the supervision of the automaton to ensure that the generated plan satisfies the constraints, making the planning process controllable. We conduct experiments on both benchmark tasks and practical real-life tasks, and our framework achieves over 50% overall performance increase, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of employing Formal-LLM to guide the plan generation of agents, preventing the agents from generating invalid and unsuccessful plans. Further, more controllable LLM-based agents can facilitate the broader utilization of LLM in application scenarios where high validity of planning is essential.

ReAGent: A Model-agnostic Feature Attribution Method for Generative Language Models,"Zhixue Zhao, Boxuan Shan","Feature attribution methods (FAs), such as gradients and attention, are widely employed approaches to derive the importance of all input features to the model predictions. Existing work in natural language processing has mostly focused on developing and testing FAs for encoder-only language models (LMs) in classification tasks. However, it is unknown if it is faithful to use these FAs for decoder-only models on text generation, due to the inherent differences between model architectures and task settings respectively. Moreover, previous work has demonstrated that there is no `one-wins-all' FA across models and tasks. This makes the selection of a FA computationally expensive for large LMs since input importance derivation often requires multiple forward and backward passes including gradient computations that might be prohibitive even with access to large compute. To address these issues, we present a model-agnostic FA for generative LMs called Recursive Attribution Generator (ReAGent). Our method updates the token importance distribution in a recursive manner. For each update, we compute the difference in the probability distribution over the vocabulary for predicting the next token between using the original input and using a modified version where a part of the input is replaced with RoBERTa predictions. Our intuition is that replacing an important token in the context should have resulted in a larger change in the model's confidence in predicting the token than replacing an unimportant token. Our method can be universally applied to any generative LM without accessing internal model weights or additional training and fine-tuning, as most other FAs require. We extensively compare the faithfulness of ReAGent with seven popular FAs across six decoder-only LMs of various sizes. The results show that our method consistently provides more faithful token importance distributions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00794v2,2024-02

To promote professional and personalized healthcare, we propose an innovative framework, Heath-LLM, which combines large-scale feature extraction and medical knowledge trade-off scoring. Compared to traditional health management applications, our system has three main advantages: (1) It integrates health reports and medical knowledge into a large model to ask relevant questions to large language model for disease prediction; (2) It leverages a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) mechanism to enhance feature extraction; (3) It incorporates a semi-automated feature updating framework that can merge and delete features to improve accuracy of disease prediction.

Enhancing Ethical Explanations of Large Language Models through Iterative Symbolic Refinement,"Xin Quan, Marco Valentino, Louise A. Dennis, André Freitas","An increasing amount of research in Natural Language Inference (NLI) focuses on the application and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities. Despite their success, however, LLMs are still prone to factual errors and inconsistencies in their explanations, offering limited control and interpretability for inference in complex domains. In this paper, we focus on ethical NLI, investigating how hybrid neuro-symbolic techniques can enhance the logical validity and alignment of ethical explanations produced by LLMs. Specifically, we present an abductive-deductive framework named Logic-Explainer, which integrates LLMs with an external backward-chaining solver to refine step-wise natural language explanations and jointly verify their correctness, reduce incompleteness and minimise redundancy. An extensive empirical analysis demonstrates that Logic-Explainer can improve explanations generated via in-context learning methods and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) on challenging ethical NLI tasks, while, at the same time, producing formal proofs describing and supporting models' reasoning. As ethical NLI requires commonsense reasoning to identify underlying moral violations, our results suggest the effectiveness of neuro-symbolic methods for multi-step NLI more broadly, opening new opportunities to enhance the logical consistency, reliability, and alignment of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00745v1,2024-02
BATON: Aligning Text-to-Audio Model with Human Preference Feedback,"Huan Liao, Haonan Han, Kai Yang, Tianjiao Du, Rui Yang, Zunnan Xu, Qinmei Xu, Jingquan Liu, Jiasheng Lu, Xiu Li","With the development of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), text-to-audio models are gaining widespread attention. However, it is challenging for these models to generate audio aligned with human preference due to the inherent information density of natural language and limited model understanding ability. To alleviate this issue, we formulate the BATON, a framework designed to enhance the alignment between generated audio and text prompt using human preference feedback. Our BATON comprises three key stages: Firstly, we curated a dataset containing both prompts and the corresponding generated audio, which was then annotated based on human feedback. Secondly, we introduced a reward model using the constructed dataset, which can mimic human preference by assigning rewards to input text-audio pairs. Finally, we employed the reward model to fine-tune an off-the-shelf text-to-audio model. The experiment results demonstrate that our BATON can significantly improve the generation quality of the original text-to-audio models, concerning audio integrity, temporal relationship, and alignment with human preference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00744v1,2024-02
Theoretical Understanding of In-Context Learning in Shallow Transformers with Unstructured Data,"Yue Xing, Xiaofeng Lin, Chenheng Xu, Namjoon Suh, Qifan Song, Guang Cheng","Large language models (LLMs) are powerful models that can learn concepts at the inference stage via in-context learning (ICL). While theoretical studies, e.g., \cite{zhang2023trained}, attempt to explain the mechanism of ICL, they assume the input $x_i$ and the output $y_i$ of each demonstration example are in the same token (i.e., structured data). However, in real practice, the examples are usually text input, and all words, regardless of their logic relationship, are stored in different tokens (i.e., unstructured data \cite{wibisono2023role}). To understand how LLMs learn from the unstructured data in ICL, this paper studies the role of each component in the transformer architecture and provides a theoretical understanding to explain the success of the architecture. In particular, we consider a simple transformer with one/two attention layers and linear regression tasks for the ICL prediction. We observe that (1) a transformer with two layers of (self-)attentions with a look-ahead attention mask can learn from the prompt in the unstructured data, and (2) positional encoding can match the $x_i$ and $y_i$ tokens to achieve a better ICL performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00743v2,2024-02
Transforming and Combining Rewards for Aligning Large Language Models,"Zihao Wang, Chirag Nagpal, Jonathan Berant, Jacob Eisenstein, Alex D'Amour, Sanmi Koyejo, Victor Veitch","A common approach for aligning language models to human preferences is to first learn a reward model from preference data, and then use this reward model to update the language model. We study two closely related problems that arise in this approach. First, any monotone transformation of the reward model preserves preference ranking; is there a choice that is ``better'' than others? Second, we often wish to align language models to multiple properties: how should we combine multiple reward models? Using a probabilistic interpretation of the alignment procedure, we identify a natural choice for transformation for (the common case of) rewards learned from Bradley-Terry preference models. The derived transformation is straightforward: we apply a log-sigmoid function to the centered rewards, a method we term ``LSC-transformation'' (log-sigmoid-centered transformation). This transformation has two important properties. First, it emphasizes improving poorly-performing outputs, rather than outputs that already score well. This mitigates both underfitting (where some prompts are not improved) and reward hacking (where the model learns to exploit misspecification of the reward model). Second, it enables principled aggregation of rewards by linking summation to logical conjunction: the sum of transformed rewards corresponds to the probability that the output is ``good'' in all measured properties, in a sense we make precise. Experiments aligning language models to be both helpful and harmless using RLHF show substantial improvements over the baseline (non-transformed) approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00742v2,2024-02
Improving Semantic Control in Discrete Latent Spaces with Transformer Quantized Variational Autoencoders,"Yingji Zhang, Danilo S. Carvalho, Marco Valentino, Ian Pratt-Hartmann, Andre Freitas","Achieving precise semantic control over the latent spaces of Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) holds significant value for downstream tasks in NLP as the underlying generative mechanisms could be better localised, explained and improved upon. Recent research, however, has struggled to achieve consistent results, primarily due to the inevitable loss of semantic information in the variational bottleneck and limited control over the decoding mechanism. To overcome these challenges, we investigate discrete latent spaces in Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQVAEs) to improve semantic control and generation in Transformer-based VAEs. In particular, We propose T5VQVAE, a novel model that leverages the controllability of VQVAEs to guide the self-attention mechanism in T5 at the token-level, exploiting its full generalization capabilities. Experimental results indicate that T5VQVAE outperforms existing state-of-the-art VAE models, including Optimus, in terms of controllability and preservation of semantic information across different tasks such as auto-encoding of sentences and mathematical expressions, text transfer, and inference. Moreover, T5VQVAE exhibits improved inference capabilities, suggesting potential applications for downstream natural language and symbolic reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00723v1,2024-02
