Calibrating Language Models with Adaptive Temperature Scaling,"Johnathan Xie, Annie S. Chen, Yoonho Lee, Eric Mitchell, Chelsea Finn","The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is not only measured by their ability to generate accurate outputs but also by their calibration-how well their confidence scores reflect the probability of their outputs being correct. While unsupervised pre-training has been shown to yield LLMs with well-calibrated conditional probabilities, recent studies have shown that after fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), the calibration of these models degrades significantly. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Temperature Scaling (ATS), a post-hoc calibration method that predicts a temperature scaling parameter for each token prediction. The predicted temperature values adapt based on token-level features and are fit over a standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) dataset. The adaptive nature of ATS addresses the varying degrees of calibration shift that can occur after RLHF fine-tuning. ATS improves calibration by over 10-50% across three downstream natural language evaluation benchmarks compared to prior calibration methods and does not impede performance improvements from RLHF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19817v1,2024-09
Transforming Hidden States into Binary Semantic Features,"Tomáš Musil, David Mareček","Large language models follow a lineage of many NLP applications that were directly inspired by distributional semantics, but do not seem to be closely related to it anymore. In this paper, we propose to employ the distributional theory of meaning once again. Using Independent Component Analysis to overcome some of its challenging aspects, we show that large language models represent semantic features in their hidden states.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19813v1,2024-09
Can Models Learn Skill Composition from Examples?,"Haoyu Zhao, Simran Kaur, Dingli Yu, Anirudh Goyal, Sanjeev Arora","As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly advanced, their ability to exhibit compositional generalization -- the capacity to combine learned skills in novel ways not encountered during training -- has garnered significant attention. This type of generalization, particularly in scenarios beyond training data, is also of great interest in the study of AI safety and alignment. A recent study introduced the SKILL-MIX evaluation, where models are tasked with composing a short paragraph demonstrating the use of a specified $k$-tuple of language skills. While small models struggled with composing even with $k=3$, larger models like GPT-4 performed reasonably well with $k=5$ and $6$.   In this paper, we employ a setup akin to SKILL-MIX to evaluate the capacity of smaller models to learn compositional generalization from examples. Utilizing a diverse set of language skills -- including rhetorical, literary, reasoning, theory of mind, and common sense -- GPT-4 was used to generate text samples that exhibit random subsets of $k$ skills. Subsequent fine-tuning of 7B and 13B parameter models on these combined skill texts, for increasing values of $k$, revealed the following findings: (1) Training on combinations of $k=2$ and $3$ skills results in noticeable improvements in the ability to compose texts with $k=4$ and $5$ skills, despite models never having seen such examples during training. (2) When skill categories are split into training and held-out groups, models significantly improve at composing texts with held-out skills during testing despite having only seen training skills during fine-tuning, illustrating the efficacy of the training approach even with previously unseen skills. This study also suggests that incorporating skill-rich (potentially synthetic) text into training can substantially enhance the compositional capabilities of models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19808v1,2024-09
Does RAG Introduce Unfairness in LLMs? Evaluating Fairness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems,"Xuyang Wu, Shuowei Li, Hsin-Tai Wu, Zhiqiang Tao, Yi Fang","RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) have recently gained significant attention for their enhanced ability to integrate external knowledge sources in open-domain question answering (QA) tasks. However, it remains unclear how these models address fairness concerns, particularly with respect to sensitive attributes such as gender, geographic location, and other demographic factors. First, as language models evolve to prioritize utility, like improving exact match accuracy, fairness may have been largely overlooked. Second, RAG methods are complex pipelines, making it hard to identify and address biases, as each component is optimized for different goals. In this paper, we aim to empirically evaluate fairness in several RAG methods. We propose a fairness evaluation framework tailored to RAG methods, using scenario-based questions and analyzing disparities across demographic attributes. The experimental results indicate that, despite recent advances in utility-driven optimization, fairness issues persist in both the retrieval and generation stages, highlighting the need for more targeted fairness interventions within RAG pipelines. We will release our dataset and code upon acceptance of the paper.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19804v1,2024-09
CRScore: Grounding Automated Evaluation of Code Review Comments in Code Claims and Smells,"Atharva Naik, Marcus Alenius, Daniel Fried, Carolyn Rose","The task of automated code review has recently gained a lot of attention from the machine learning community. However, current review comment evaluation metrics rely on comparisons with a human-written reference for a given code change (also called a diff), even though code review is a one-to-many problem like generation and summarization with many ""valid reviews"" for a diff. To tackle these issues we develop a CRScore - a reference-free metric to measure dimensions of review quality like conciseness, comprehensiveness, and relevance. We design CRScore to evaluate reviews in a way that is grounded in claims and potential issues detected in the code by LLMs and static analyzers. We demonstrate that CRScore can produce valid, fine-grained scores of review quality that have the greatest alignment with human judgment (0.54 Spearman correlation) and are more sensitive than reference-based metrics. We also release a corpus of 2.6k human-annotated review quality scores for machine-generated and GitHub review comments to support the development of automated metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19801v1,2024-09
Black-Box Segmentation of Electronic Medical Records,"Hongyi Yuan, Sheng Yu","Electronic medical records (EMRs) contain the majority of patients' healthcare details. It is an abundant resource for developing an automatic healthcare system. Most of the natural language processing (NLP) studies on EMR processing, such as concept extraction, are adversely affected by the inaccurate segmentation of EMR sections. At the same time, not enough attention has been given to the accurate sectioning of EMRs. The information that may occur in section structures is unvalued. This work focuses on the segmentation of EMRs and proposes a black-box segmentation method using a simple sentence embedding model and neural network, along with a proper training method. To achieve universal adaptivity, we train our model on the dataset with different section headings formats. We compare several advanced deep learning-based NLP methods, and our method achieves the best segmentation accuracies (above 98%) on various test data with a proper training corpus.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19796v1,2024-09
Adversarial Examples for DNA Classification,Hyunwoo Yoo,"Pre-trained language models such as DNABERT2 and Nucleotide Transformer, which are trained on DNA sequences, have shown promising performance in DNA sequence classification tasks. The classification ability of these models stems from language models trained on vast amounts of DNA sequence samples, followed by fine-tuning with relatively smaller classification datasets. However, these text-based systems are not robust enough and can be vulnerable to adversarial examples. While adversarial attacks have been widely studied in text classification, there is limited research in DNA sequence classification. In this paper, we adapt commonly used attack algorithms in text classification for DNA sequence classification. We evaluated the impact of various attack methods on DNA sequence classification at the character, word, and sentence levels. Our findings indicate that actual DNA language model sequence classifiers are vulnerable to these attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19788v1,2024-09
"Realtime, multimodal invasive ventilation risk monitoring using language models and BoXHED","Arash Pakbin, Aaron Su, Donald K. K. Lee, Bobak J. Mortazavi","Objective: realtime monitoring of invasive ventilation (iV) in intensive care units (ICUs) plays a crucial role in ensuring prompt interventions and better patient outcomes. However, conventional methods often overlook valuable insights embedded within clinical notes, relying solely on tabular data. In this study, we propose an innovative approach to enhance iV risk monitoring by incorporating clinical notes into the monitoring pipeline through using language models for text summarization. Results: We achieve superior performance in all metrics reported by the state-of-the-art in iV risk monitoring, namely: an AUROC of 0.86, an AUC-PR of 0.35, and an AUCt of up to 0.86. We also demonstrate that our methodology allows for more lead time in flagging iV for certain time buckets. Conclusion: Our study underscores the potential of integrating clinical notes and language models into realtime iV risk monitoring, paving the way for improved patient care and informed clinical decision-making in ICU settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03725v1,2024-09
Towards Robust Extractive Question Answering Models: Rethinking the Training Methodology,"Son Quoc Tran, Matt Kretchmar","This paper proposes a novel training method to improve the robustness of Extractive Question Answering (EQA) models. Previous research has shown that existing models, when trained on EQA datasets that include unanswerable questions, demonstrate a significant lack of robustness against distribution shifts and adversarial attacks. Despite this, the inclusion of unanswerable questions in EQA training datasets is essential for ensuring real-world reliability. Our proposed training method includes a novel loss function for the EQA problem and challenges an implicit assumption present in numerous EQA datasets. Models trained with our method maintain in-domain performance while achieving a notable improvement on out-of-domain datasets. This results in an overall F1 score improvement of 5.7 across all testing sets. Furthermore, our models exhibit significantly enhanced robustness against two types of adversarial attacks, with a performance decrease of only about a third compared to the default models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19766v1,2024-09
Balancing Cost and Effectiveness of Synthetic Data Generation Strategies for LLMs,"Yung-Chieh Chan, George Pu, Apaar Shanker, Parth Suresh, Penn Jenks, John Heyer, Sam Denton","As large language models (LLMs) are applied to more use cases, creating high quality, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning becomes a bottleneck for model improvement. Using high quality human data has been the most common approach to unlock model performance, but is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios. Several alternative methods have also emerged, such as generating synthetic or hybrid data, but the effectiveness of these approaches remain unclear, especially in resource-constrained scenarios and tasks that are not easily verified. To investigate this, we group various synthetic data generation strategies into three representative categories -- Answer Augmentation, Question Rephrase and New Question -- and study the performance of student LLMs trained under various constraints, namely seed instruction set size and query budget. We demonstrate that these strategies are not equally effective across settings. Notably, the optimal data generation strategy depends strongly on the ratio between the available teacher query budget and the size of the seed instruction set. When this ratio is low, generating new answers to existing questions proves most effective, but as this ratio increases, generating new questions becomes optimal. Across all tasks, we find that choice of augmentation method and other design choices matter substantially more in low to mid data regimes than in high data regimes. We provide a practical framework for selecting the appropriate augmentation method across settings, taking into account additional factors such as the scalability of each method, the importance of verifying synthetic data, and the use of different LLMs for synthetic data generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19759v3,2024-09
CoTKR: Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Knowledge Rewriting for Complex Knowledge Graph Question Answering,"Yike Wu, Yi Huang, Nan Hu, Yuncheng Hua, Guilin Qi, Jiaoyan Chen, Jeff Z. Pan","Recent studies have explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). They typically require rewriting retrieved subgraphs into natural language formats comprehensible to LLMs. However, when tackling complex questions, the knowledge rewritten by existing methods may include irrelevant information, omit crucial details, or fail to align with the question's semantics. To address them, we propose a novel rewriting method CoTKR, Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Knowledge Rewriting, for generating reasoning traces and corresponding knowledge in an interleaved manner, thereby mitigating the limitations of single-step knowledge rewriting. Additionally, to bridge the preference gap between the knowledge rewriter and the question answering (QA) model, we propose a training strategy PAQAF, Preference Alignment from Question Answering Feedback, for leveraging feedback from the QA model to further optimize the knowledge rewriter. We conduct experiments using various LLMs across several KGQA benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with previous knowledge rewriting methods, CoTKR generates the most beneficial knowledge representation for QA models, which significantly improves the performance of LLMs in KGQA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19753v2,2024-09
AstroMLab 2: AstroLLaMA-2-70B Model and Benchmarking Specialised LLMs for Astronomy,"Rui Pan, Tuan Dung Nguyen, Hardik Arora, Alberto Accomazzi, Tirthankar Ghosal, Yuan-Sen Ting","Continual pretraining of large language models on domain-specific data has been proposed to enhance performance on downstream tasks. In astronomy, the previous absence of astronomy-focused benchmarks has hindered objective evaluation of these specialized LLM models. Leveraging a recent initiative to curate high-quality astronomical MCQs, this study aims to quantitatively assess specialized LLMs in astronomy. We find that the previously released AstroLLaMA series, based on LLaMA-2-7B, underperforms compared to the base model. We demonstrate that this performance degradation can be partially mitigated by utilizing high-quality data for continual pretraining, such as summarized text from arXiv. Despite the observed catastrophic forgetting in smaller models, our results indicate that continual pretraining on the 70B model can yield significant improvements. However, the current supervised fine-tuning dataset still constrains the performance of instruct models. In conjunction with this study, we introduce a new set of models, AstroLLaMA-3-8B and AstroLLaMA-2-70B, building upon the previous AstroLLaMA series.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19750v1,2024-09
NeuroMax: Enhancing Neural Topic Modeling via Maximizing Mutual Information and Group Topic Regularization,"Duy-Tung Pham, Thien Trang Nguyen Vu, Tung Nguyen, Linh Ngo Van, Duc Anh Nguyen, Thien Huu Nguyen","Recent advances in neural topic models have concentrated on two primary directions: the integration of the inference network (encoder) with a pre-trained language model (PLM) and the modeling of the relationship between words and topics in the generative model (decoder). However, the use of large PLMs significantly increases inference costs, making them less practical for situations requiring low inference times. Furthermore, it is crucial to simultaneously model the relationships between topics and words as well as the interrelationships among topics themselves. In this work, we propose a novel framework called NeuroMax (Neural Topic Model with Maximizing Mutual Information with Pretrained Language Model and Group Topic Regularization) to address these challenges. NeuroMax maximizes the mutual information between the topic representation obtained from the encoder in neural topic models and the representation derived from the PLM. Additionally, NeuroMax employs optimal transport to learn the relationships between topics by analyzing how information is transported among them. Experimental results indicate that NeuroMax reduces inference time, generates more coherent topics and topic groups, and produces more representative document embeddings, thereby enhancing performance on downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19749v1,2024-09
"Natural Language Generation for Visualizations: State of the Art, Challenges and Future Directions","Enamul Hoque, Mohammed Saidul Islam","Natural language and visualization are two complementary modalities of human communication that play a crucial role in conveying information effectively. While visualizations help people discover trends, patterns, and anomalies in data, natural language descriptions help explain these insights. Thus, combining text with visualizations is a prevalent technique for effectively delivering the core message of the data. Given the rise of natural language generation (NLG), there is a growing interest in automatically creating natural language descriptions for visualizations, which can be used as chart captions, answering questions about charts, or telling data-driven stories. In this survey, we systematically review the state of the art on NLG for visualizations and introduce a taxonomy of the problem. The NLG tasks fall within the domain of Natural Language Interfaces (NLI) for visualization, an area that has garnered significant attention from both the research community and industry. To narrow down the scope of the survey, we primarily concentrate on the research works that focus on text generation for visualizations. To characterize the NLG problem and the design space of proposed solutions, we pose five Wh-questions, why and how NLG tasks are performed for visualizations, what the task inputs and outputs are, as well as where and when the generated texts are integrated with visualizations. We categorize the solutions used in the surveyed papers based on these ""five Wh-questions."" Finally, we discuss the key challenges and potential avenues for future research in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19747v1,2024-09
PEAR: Position-Embedding-Agnostic Attention Re-weighting Enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Zero Inference Overhead,"Tao Tan, Yining Qian, Ang Lv, Hongzhan Lin, Songhao Wu, Yongbo Wang, Feng Wang, Jingtong Wu, Xin Lu, Rui Yan","Large language models (LLMs) enhanced with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have introduced a new paradigm for web search. However, the limited context awareness of LLMs degrades their performance on RAG tasks. Existing methods to enhance context awareness are often inefficient, incurring time or memory overhead during inference, and many are tailored to specific position embeddings. In this paper, we propose Position-Embedding-Agnostic attention Re-weighting (PEAR), which enhances the context awareness of LLMs with zero inference overhead. Specifically, on a proxy task focused on context copying, we first detect heads which suppress the models' context awareness thereby diminishing RAG performance. To weaken the impact of these heads, we re-weight their outputs with learnable coefficients. The LLM (with frozen parameters) is optimized by adjusting these coefficients to minimize loss on the proxy task. As a result, the coefficients are optimized to values less than one, thereby reducing their tendency to suppress RAG performance. During inference, the optimized coefficients are fixed to re-weight these heads, regardless of the specific task at hand. Our proposed PEAR offers two major advantages over previous approaches: (1) It introduces zero additional inference overhead in terms of memory usage or inference time, while outperforming competitive baselines in accuracy and efficiency across various RAG tasks. (2) It is independent of position embedding algorithms, ensuring broader applicability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19745v2,2024-09
"A Systematic Review of NLP for Dementia- Tasks, Datasets and Opportunities","Lotem Peled-Cohen, Roi Reichart","The close link between cognitive decline and language has fostered long-standing collaboration between the NLP and medical communities in dementia research. To examine this, we reviewed over 200 papers applying NLP to dementia related efforts, drawing from medical, technological, and NLP-focused literature. We identify key research areas, including dementia detection, linguistic biomarker extraction, caregiver support, and patient assistance, showing that half of all papers focus solely on dementia detection using clinical data. However, many directions remain unexplored: artificially degraded language models, synthetic data, digital twins, and more. We highlight gaps and opportunities around trust, scientific rigor, applicability, and cross-community collaboration, and showcase the diverse datasets encountered throughout our review: recorded, written, structured, spontaneous, synthetic, clinical, social media based, and more. This review aims to inspire more creative approaches to dementia research within the medical and NLP communities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19737v1,2024-09
Scrambled text: training Language Models to correct OCR errors using synthetic data,Jonathan Bourne,"OCR errors are common in digitised historical archives significantly affecting their usability and value. Generative Language Models (LMs) have shown potential for correcting these errors using the context provided by the corrupted text and the broader socio-cultural context, a process called Context Leveraging OCR Correction (CLOCR-C). However, getting sufficient training data for fine-tuning such models can prove challenging. This paper shows that fine-tuning a language model on synthetic data using an LM and using a character level Markov corruption process can significantly improve the ability to correct OCR errors. Models trained on synthetic data reduce the character error rate by 55% and word error rate by 32% over the base LM and outperform models trained on real data. Key findings include; training on under-corrupted data is better than over-corrupted data; non-uniform character level corruption is better than uniform corruption; More tokens-per-observation outperforms more observations for a fixed token budget. The outputs for this paper are a set of 8 heuristics for training effective CLOCR-C models, a dataset of 11,000 synthetic 19th century newspaper articles and scrambledtext a python library for creating synthetic corrupted data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19735v1,2024-09
Revealing Personality Traits: A New Benchmark Dataset for Explainable Personality Recognition on Dialogues,"Lei Sun, Jinming Zhao, Qin Jin","Personality recognition aims to identify the personality traits implied in user data such as dialogues and social media posts. Current research predominantly treats personality recognition as a classification task, failing to reveal the supporting evidence for the recognized personality. In this paper, we propose a novel task named Explainable Personality Recognition, aiming to reveal the reasoning process as supporting evidence of the personality trait. Inspired by personality theories, personality traits are made up of stable patterns of personality state, where the states are short-term characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in a concrete situation at a specific moment in time. We propose an explainable personality recognition framework called Chain-of-Personality-Evidence (CoPE), which involves a reasoning process from specific contexts to short-term personality states to long-term personality traits. Furthermore, based on the CoPE framework, we construct an explainable personality recognition dataset from dialogues, PersonalityEvd. We introduce two explainable personality state recognition and explainable personality trait recognition tasks, which require models to recognize the personality state and trait labels and their corresponding support evidence. Our extensive experiments based on Large Language Models on the two tasks show that revealing personality traits is very challenging and we present some insights for future research. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/Lei-Sun-RUC/PersonalityEvd.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19723v1,2024-09
Coffee-Gym: An Environment for Evaluating and Improving Natural Language Feedback on Erroneous Code,"Hyungjoo Chae, Taeyoon Kwon, Seungjun Moon, Yongho Song, Dongjin Kang, Kai Tzu-iunn Ong, Beong-woo Kwak, Seonghyeon Bae, Seung-won Hwang, Jinyoung Yeo","This paper presents Coffee-Gym, a comprehensive RL environment for training models that provide feedback on code editing. Coffee-Gym includes two major components: (1) Coffee, a dataset containing humans' code edit traces for coding questions and machine-written feedback for editing erroneous code; (2) CoffeeEval, a reward function that faithfully reflects the helpfulness of feedback by assessing the performance of the revised code in unit tests. With them, Coffee-Gym addresses the unavailability of high-quality datasets for training feedback models with RL, and provides more accurate rewards than the SOTA reward model (i.e., GPT-4). By applying Coffee-Gym, we elicit feedback models that outperform baselines in enhancing open-source code LLMs' code editing, making them comparable with closed-source LLMs. We make the dataset and the model checkpoint publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19715v2,2024-09
A multimodal LLM for the non-invasive decoding of spoken text from brain recordings,"Youssef Hmamouche, Ismail Chihab, Lahoucine Kdouri, Amal El Fallah Seghrouchni","Brain-related research topics in artificial intelligence have recently gained popularity, particularly due to the expansion of what multimodal architectures can do from computer vision to natural language processing. Our main goal in this work is to explore the possibilities and limitations of these architectures in spoken text decoding from non-invasive fMRI recordings. Contrary to vision and textual data, fMRI data represent a complex modality due to the variety of brain scanners, which implies (i) the variety of the recorded signal formats, (ii) the low resolution and noise of the raw signals, and (iii) the scarcity of pretrained models that can be leveraged as foundation models for generative learning. These points make the problem of the non-invasive decoding of text from fMRI recordings very challenging. In this paper, we propose and end-to-end multimodal LLM for decoding spoken text from fMRI signals. The proposed architecture is founded on (i) an encoder derived from a specific transformer incorporating an augmented embedding layer for the encoder and a better-adjusted attention mechanism than that present in the state of the art, and (ii) a frozen large language model adapted to align the embedding of the input text and the encoded embedding of brain activity to decode the output text. A benchmark in performed on a corpus consisting of a set of interactions human-human and human-robot interactions where fMRI and conversational signals are recorded synchronously. The obtained results are very promising, as our proposal outperforms the evaluated models, and is able to generate text capturing more accurate semantics present in the ground truth. The implementation code is provided in https://github.com/Hmamouche/brain_decode.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19710v1,2024-09
2D-TPE: Two-Dimensional Positional Encoding Enhances Table Understanding for Large Language Models,"Jia-Nan Li, Jian Guan, Wei Wu, Zhengtao Yu, Rui Yan","Tables are ubiquitous across various domains for concisely representing structured information. Empowering large language models (LLMs) to reason over tabular data represents an actively explored direction. However, since typical LLMs only support one-dimensional~(1D) inputs, existing methods often flatten the two-dimensional~(2D) table structure into a sequence of tokens, which can severely disrupt the spatial relationships and result in an inevitable loss of vital contextual information. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate the detrimental impact of such flattening operations on the performance of LLMs in capturing the spatial information of tables through two elaborate proxy tasks. Subsequently, we introduce a simple yet effective positional encoding method, termed ``2D-TPE'' (Two-Dimensional Table Positional Encoding), to address this challenge. 2D-TPE enables each attention head to dynamically select a permutation order of tokens within the context for attending to them, where each permutation represents a distinct traversal mode for the table, such as column-wise or row-wise traversal. 2D-TPE effectively mitigates the risk of losing essential spatial information while preserving computational efficiency, thus better preserving the table structure. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate that 2D-TPE outperforms strong baselines, underscoring the importance of preserving the table structure for accurate table comprehension. Comprehensive analysis further reveals the substantially better scalability of 2D-TPE to large tables than baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19700v3,2024-09
CERD: A Comprehensive Chinese Rhetoric Dataset for Rhetorical Understanding and Generation in Essays,"Nuowei Liu, Xinhao Chen, Hongyi Wu, Changzhi Sun, Man Lan, Yuanbin Wu, Xiaopeng Bai, Shaoguang Mao, Yan Xia","Existing rhetorical understanding and generation datasets or corpora primarily focus on single coarse-grained categories or fine-grained categories, neglecting the common interrelations between different rhetorical devices by treating them as independent sub-tasks. In this paper, we propose the Chinese Essay Rhetoric Dataset (CERD), consisting of 4 commonly used coarse-grained categories including metaphor, personification, hyperbole and parallelism and 23 fine-grained categories across both form and content levels. CERD is a manually annotated and comprehensive Chinese rhetoric dataset with five interrelated sub-tasks. Unlike previous work, our dataset aids in understanding various rhetorical devices, recognizing corresponding rhetorical components, and generating rhetorical sentences under given conditions, thereby improving the author's writing proficiency and language usage skills. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the interrelations between multiple tasks in CERD, as well as to establish a benchmark for future research on rhetoric. The experimental results indicate that Large Language Models achieve the best performance across most tasks, and jointly fine-tuning with multiple tasks further enhances performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19691v1,2024-09
Instruction Embedding: Latent Representations of Instructions Towards Task Identification,"Yiwei Li, Jiayi Shi, Shaoxiong Feng, Peiwen Yuan, Xinglin Wang, Boyuan Pan, Heda Wang, Yao Hu, Kan Li","Instruction data is crucial for improving the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human-level performance. Recent research LIMA demonstrates that alignment is essentially a process where the model adapts instructions' interaction style or format to solve various tasks, leveraging pre-trained knowledge and skills. Therefore, for instructional data, the most important aspect is the task it represents, rather than the specific semantics and knowledge information. The latent representations of instructions play roles for some instruction-related tasks like data selection and demonstrations retrieval. However, they are always derived from text embeddings, encompass overall semantic information that influences the representation of task categories. In this work, we introduce a new concept, instruction embedding, and construct Instruction Embedding Benchmark (IEB) for its training and evaluation. Then, we propose a baseline Prompt-based Instruction Embedding (PIE) method to make the representations more attention on tasks. The evaluation of PIE, alongside other embedding methods on IEB with two designed tasks, demonstrates its superior performance in accurately identifying task categories. Moreover, the application of instruction embeddings in four downstream tasks showcases its effectiveness and suitability for instruction-related tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19680v1,2024-09
Modeling Layout Reading Order as Ordering Relations for Visually-rich Document Understanding,"Chong Zhang, Yi Tu, Yixi Zhao, Chenshu Yuan, Huan Chen, Yue Zhang, Mingxu Chai, Ya Guo, Huijia Zhu, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui","Modeling and leveraging layout reading order in visually-rich documents (VrDs) is critical in document intelligence as it captures the rich structure semantics within documents. Previous works typically formulated layout reading order as a permutation of layout elements, i.e. a sequence containing all the layout elements. However, we argue that this formulation does not adequately convey the complete reading order information in the layout, which may potentially lead to performance decline in downstream VrD tasks. To address this issue, we propose to model the layout reading order as ordering relations over the set of layout elements, which have sufficient expressive capability for the complete reading order information. To enable empirical evaluation on methods towards the improved form of reading order prediction (ROP), we establish a comprehensive benchmark dataset including the reading order annotation as relations over layout elements, together with a relation-extraction-based method that outperforms previous methods. Moreover, to highlight the practical benefits of introducing the improved form of layout reading order, we propose a reading-order-relation-enhancing pipeline to improve model performance on any arbitrary VrD task by introducing additional reading order relation inputs. Comprehensive results demonstrate that the pipeline generally benefits downstream VrD tasks: (1) with utilizing the reading order relation information, the enhanced downstream models achieve SOTA results on both two task settings of the targeted dataset; (2) with utilizing the pseudo reading order information generated by the proposed ROP model, the performance of the enhanced models has improved across all three models and eight cross-domain VrD-IE/QA task settings without targeted optimization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19672v1,2024-09
"Can Large Language Models Analyze Graphs like Professionals? A Benchmark, Datasets and Models","Xin Li, Weize Chen, Qizhi Chu, Haopeng Li, Zhaojun Sun, Ran Li, Chen Qian, Yiwei Wei, Zhiyuan Liu, Chuan Shi, Maosong Sun, Cheng Yang","The need to analyze graphs is ubiquitous across various fields, from social networks to biological research and recommendation systems. Therefore, enabling the ability of large language models (LLMs) to process graphs is an important step toward more advanced general intelligence. However, current LLM benchmarks on graph analysis require models to directly reason over the prompts describing graph topology, and are thus limited to small graphs with only a few dozens of nodes. In contrast, human experts typically write programs based on popular libraries for task solving, and can thus handle graphs with different scales. To this end, a question naturally arises: can LLMs analyze graphs like professionals? In this paper, we introduce ProGraph, a manually crafted benchmark containing 3 categories of graph tasks. The benchmark expects solutions based on programming instead of directly reasoning over raw inputs. Our findings reveal that the performance of current LLMs is unsatisfactory, with the best model achieving only 36% accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose LLM4Graph datasets, which include crawled documents and auto-generated codes based on 6 widely used graph libraries. By augmenting closed-source LLMs with document retrieval and fine-tuning open-source ones on the codes, we show 11-32% absolute improvements in their accuracies. Our results underscore that the capabilities of LLMs in handling structured data are still under-explored, and show the effectiveness of LLM4Graph in enhancing LLMs' proficiency of graph analysis. The benchmark, datasets and enhanced open-source models are available at https://github.com/BUPT-GAMMA/ProGraph.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19667v2,2024-09
Identifying Knowledge Editing Types in Large Language Models,"Xiaopeng Li, Shangwen Wang, Shezheng Song, Bin Ji, Huijun Liu, Shasha Li, Jun Ma, Jie Yu","Knowledge editing has emerged as an efficient technology for updating the knowledge of large language models (LLMs), attracting increasing attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of effective measures to prevent the malicious misuse of this technology, which could lead to harmful edits in LLMs. These malicious modifications could cause LLMs to generate toxic content, misleading users into inappropriate actions. In front of this risk, we introduce a new task, Knowledge Editing Type Identification (KETI), aimed at identifying different types of edits in LLMs, thereby providing timely alerts to users when encountering illicit edits. As part of this task, we propose KETIBench, which includes five types of harmful edits covering most popular toxic types, as well as one benign factual edit. We develop four classical classification models and three BERT-based models as baseline identifiers for both open-source and closed-source LLMs. Our experimental results, across 42 trials involving two models and three knowledge editing methods, demonstrate that all seven baseline identifiers achieve decent identification performance, highlighting the feasibility of identifying malicious edits in LLMs. Additional analyses reveal that the performance of the identifiers is independent of the reliability of the knowledge editing methods and exhibits cross-domain generalization, enabling the identification of edits from unknown sources. All data and code are available in https://github.com/xpq-tech/KETI. Warning: This paper contains examples of toxic text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19663v2,2024-09
Multimodal Misinformation Detection by Learning from Synthetic Data with Multimodal LLMs,"Fengzhu Zeng, Wenqian Li, Wei Gao, Yan Pang","Detecting multimodal misinformation, especially in the form of image-text pairs, is crucial. Obtaining large-scale, high-quality real-world fact-checking datasets for training detectors is costly, leading researchers to use synthetic datasets generated by AI technologies. However, the generalizability of detectors trained on synthetic data to real-world scenarios remains unclear due to the distribution gap. To address this, we propose learning from synthetic data for detecting real-world multimodal misinformation through two model-agnostic data selection methods that match synthetic and real-world data distributions. Experiments show that our method enhances the performance of a small MLLM (13B) on real-world fact-checking datasets, enabling it to even surpass GPT-4V~\cite{GPT-4V}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19656v1,2024-09
Assessment and manipulation of latent constructs in pre-trained language models using psychometric scales,"Maor Reuben, Ortal Slobodin, Aviad Elyshar, Idan-Chaim Cohen, Orna Braun-Lewensohn, Odeya Cohen, Rami Puzis","Human-like personality traits have recently been discovered in large language models, raising the hypothesis that their (known and as yet undiscovered) biases conform with human latent psychological constructs. While large conversational models may be tricked into answering psychometric questionnaires, the latent psychological constructs of thousands of simpler transformers, trained for other tasks, cannot be assessed because appropriate psychometric methods are currently lacking. Here, we show how standard psychological questionnaires can be reformulated into natural language inference prompts, and we provide a code library to support the psychometric assessment of arbitrary models. We demonstrate, using a sample of 88 publicly available models, the existence of human-like mental health-related constructs (including anxiety, depression, and Sense of Coherence) which conform with standard theories in human psychology and show similar correlations and mitigation strategies. The ability to interpret and rectify the performance of language models by using psychological tools can boost the development of more explainable, controllable, and trustworthy models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19655v1,2024-09
Learning Attentional Mixture of LoRAs for Language Model Continual Learning,"Jialin Liu, Jianhua Wu, Jie Liu, Yutai Duan","Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with Low-Rank adaption (LoRA) is widely acknowledged as an effective approach for continual learning for new tasks. However, it often suffers from catastrophic forgetting when dealing with multiple tasks sequentially. To this end, we propose Attentional Mixture of LoRAs (AM-LoRA), a continual learning approach tailored for LLMs. Specifically, AM-LoRA learns a sequence of LoRAs for a series of tasks to continually learn knowledge from different tasks. The key of our approach is that we devise an attention mechanism as a knowledge mixture module to adaptively integrate information from each LoRA. With the attention mechanism, AM-LoRA can efficiently leverage the distinctive contributions of each LoRA, while mitigating the risk of mutually negative interactions among them that may lead to catastrophic forgetting. Moreover, we further introduce $L1$ norm in the learning process to make the attention vector more sparse. The sparse constraints can enable the model to lean towards selecting a few highly relevant LoRAs, rather than aggregating and weighting all LoRAs collectively, which can further reduce the impact stemming from mutual interference. Experimental results on continual learning benchmarks indicate the superiority of our proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19611v1,2024-09
Federated Learning from Vision-Language Foundation Models: Theoretical Analysis and Method,"Bikang Pan, Wei Huang, Ye Shi","Integrating pretrained vision-language foundation models like CLIP into federated learning has attracted significant attention for enhancing generalization across diverse tasks. Typically, federated learning of vision-language models employs prompt learning to reduce communication and computational costs, i.e., prompt-based federated learning. However, there is limited theoretical analysis to understand the performance of prompt-based federated learning. In this work, we construct a theoretical analysis framework for prompt-based federated learning via feature learning theory. Specifically, we monitor the evolution of signal learning and noise memorization in prompt-based federated learning, demonstrating that performance can be assessed by the ratio of task-relevant to task-irrelevant coefficients. Furthermore, we draw an analogy between income and risk in portfolio optimization and the task-relevant and task-irrelevant terms in feature learning. Leveraging inspiration from portfolio optimization that combining two independent assets will maintain the income while reducing the risk, we introduce two prompts: global prompt and local prompt to construct a prompt portfolio to balance the generalization and personalization. Consequently, we showed the performance advantage of the prompt portfolio and derived the optimal mixing coefficient. These theoretical claims have been further supported by empirical experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19610v1,2024-09
Hyper-Connections,"Defa Zhu, Hongzhi Huang, Zihao Huang, Yutao Zeng, Yunyao Mao, Banggu Wu, Qiyang Min, Xun Zhou","We present hyper-connections, a simple yet effective method that can serve as an alternative to residual connections. This approach specifically addresses common drawbacks observed in residual connection variants, such as the seesaw effect between gradient vanishing and representation collapse. Theoretically, hyper-connections allow the network to adjust the strength of connections between features at different depths and dynamically rearrange layers. We conduct experiments focusing on the pre-training of large language models, including dense and sparse models, where hyper-connections show significant performance improvements over residual connections. Additional experiments conducted on vision tasks also demonstrate similar improvements. We anticipate that this method will be broadly applicable and beneficial across a wide range of AI problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19606v2,2024-09
The Crucial Role of Samplers in Online Direct Preference Optimization,"Ruizhe Shi, Runlong Zhou, Simon S. Du","Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a stable, scalable, and efficient solution for language model alignment. Despite its empirical success, the $\textit{optimization}$ properties, particularly the impact of samplers on its convergence rates, remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of DPO's $\textit{convergence rates}$ with different sampling strategies under the exact gradient setting, revealing a surprising separation: uniform sampling achieves $\textit{linear}$ convergence, while our proposed online sampler achieves $\textit{quadratic}$ convergence. We further adapt the sampler to practical settings by incorporating posterior distributions and $\textit{logit mixing}$, demonstrating significant improvements over previous approaches. On Safe-RLHF dataset, our method exhibits a $4.5$% improvement over vanilla DPO and a $3.0$% improvement over on-policy DPO; on Iterative-Prompt, our approach outperforms vanilla DPO, on-policy DPO, and Hybrid GSHF by over $4.2$%. Our results not only offer insights into the theoretical standing of DPO but also pave the way for potential algorithm designs in the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19605v2,2024-09
Two-stage Framework for Robust Speech Emotion Recognition Using Target Speaker Extraction in Human Speech Noise Conditions,"Jinyi Mi, Xiaohan Shi, Ding Ma, Jiajun He, Takuya Fujimura, Tomoki Toda","Developing a robust speech emotion recognition (SER) system in noisy conditions faces challenges posed by different noise properties. Most previous studies have not considered the impact of human speech noise, thus limiting the application scope of SER. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework for the problem by cascading target speaker extraction (TSE) method and SER. We first train a TSE model to extract the speech of target speaker from a mixture. Then, in the second stage, we utilize the extracted speech for SER training. Additionally, we explore a joint training of TSE and SER models in the second stage. Our developed system achieves a 14.33% improvement in unweighted accuracy (UA) compared to a baseline without using TSE method, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating the impact of human speech noise. Moreover, we conduct experiments considering speaker gender, showing that our framework performs particularly well in different-gender mixture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19585v2,2024-09
DiMB-RE: Mining the Scientific Literature for Diet-Microbiome Associations,"Gibong Hong, Veronica Hindle, Nadine M. Veasley, Hannah D. Holscher, Halil Kilicoglu","Motivation: The gut microbiota has recently emerged as a key factor that underpins certain connections between diet and human health. A tremendous amount of knowledge has been amassed from experimental studies on diet, human metabolism and microbiome. However, this evidence remains mostly buried in scientific publications, and biomedical literature mining in this domain remains scarce. We developed DiMB-RE, a comprehensive corpus annotated with 15 entity types (e.g., Nutrient, Microorganism) and 13 relation types (e.g., increases, improves) capturing diet-microbiome associations. We also trained and evaluated state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models for named entity, trigger, and relation extraction as well as factuality detection using DiMB-RE.   Results: DiMB-RE consists of 14,450 entities and 4,206 relationships from 165 articles. While NLP models performed reasonably well for named entity recognition (0.760 F$_{1}$), end-to-end relation extraction performance was modest (0.356 F$_{1}$), partly due to missed entities and triggers as well as cross-sentence relations.   Conclusions: To our knowledge, DiMB-RE is largest and most diverse dataset focusing on diet-microbiome interactions. It can serve as a benchmark corpus for biomedical literature mining.   Availability: DiMB-RE and the NLP models are available at https://github.com/ScienceNLP-Lab/DiMB-RE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19581v1,2024-09

Key components of this research include tasks such as lip reading, audio-visual speech recognition, and visual-to-speech synthesis. Although significant success has been achieved, theoretical analysis is still insufficient for audio-visual tasks. This paper presents a quantitative analysis based on information theory, focusing on information intersection between different modalities. Our results show that this analysis is valuable for understanding the difficulties of audio-visual processing tasks as well as the benefits that could be obtained by modality integration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19575v1,2024-09
Mitigating the Negative Impact of Over-association for Conversational Query Production,"Ante Wang, Linfeng Song, Zijun Min, Ge Xu, Xiaoli Wang, Junfeng Yao, Jinsong Su","Conversational query generation aims at producing search queries from dialogue histories, which are then used to retrieve relevant knowledge from a search engine to help knowledge-based dialogue systems. Trained to maximize the likelihood of gold queries, previous models suffer from the data hunger issue, and they tend to both drop important concepts from dialogue histories and generate irrelevant concepts at inference time. We attribute these issues to the over-association phenomenon where a large number of gold queries are indirectly related to the dialogue topics, because annotators may unconsciously perform reasoning with their background knowledge when generating these gold queries. We carefully analyze the negative effects of this phenomenon on pretrained Seq2seq query producers and then propose effective instance-level weighting strategies for training to mitigate these issues from multiple perspectives. Experiments on two benchmarks, Wizard-of-Internet and DuSinc, show that our strategies effectively alleviate the negative effects and lead to significant performance gains (2%-5% across automatic metrics and human evaluation). Further analysis shows that our model selects better concepts from dialogue histories and is 10 times more data efficient than the baseline.

Abstractive Summarization of Low resourced Nepali language using Multilingual Transformers,"Prakash Dhakal, Daya Sagar Baral","Automatic text summarization in Nepali language is an unexplored area in natural language processing (NLP). Although considerable research has been dedicated to extractive summarization, the area of abstractive summarization, especially for low-resource languages such as Nepali, remains largely unexplored. This study explores the use of multilingual transformer models, specifically mBART and mT5, for generating headlines for Nepali news articles through abstractive summarization. The research addresses key challenges associated with summarizing texts in Nepali by first creating a summarization dataset through web scraping from various Nepali news portals. These multilingual models were then fine-tuned using different strategies. The performance of the fine-tuned models were then assessed using ROUGE scores and human evaluation to ensure the generated summaries were coherent and conveyed the original meaning. During the human evaluation, the participants were asked to select the best summary among those generated by the models, based on criteria such as relevance, fluency, conciseness, informativeness, factual accuracy, and coverage. During the evaluation with ROUGE scores, the 4-bit quantized mBART with LoRA model was found to be effective in generating better Nepali news headlines in comparison to other models and also it was selected 34.05% of the time during the human evaluation, outperforming all other fine-tuned models created for Nepali News headline generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19566v1,2024-09
Human Bias in the Face of AI: The Role of Human Judgement in AI Generated Text Evaluation,"Tiffany Zhu, Iain Weissburg, Kexun Zhang, William Yang Wang","As AI advances in text generation, human trust in AI generated content remains constrained by biases that go beyond concerns of accuracy. This study explores how bias shapes the perception of AI versus human generated content. Through three experiments involving text rephrasing, news article summarization, and persuasive writing, we investigated how human raters respond to labeled and unlabeled content. While the raters could not differentiate the two types of texts in the blind test, they overwhelmingly favored content labeled as ""Human Generated,"" over those labeled ""AI Generated,"" by a preference score of over 30%. We observed the same pattern even when the labels were deliberately swapped. This human bias against AI has broader societal and cognitive implications, as it undervalues AI performance. This study highlights the limitations of human judgment in interacting with AI and offers a foundation for improving human-AI collaboration, especially in creative fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03723v1,2024-09
Unlabeled Debiasing in Downstream Tasks via Class-wise Low Variance Regularization,"Shahed Masoudian, Markus Frohmann, Navid Rekabsaz, Markus Schedl","Language models frequently inherit societal biases from their training data. Numerous techniques have been proposed to mitigate these biases during both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. However, fine-tuning a pre-trained debiased language model on a downstream task can reintroduce biases into the model. Additionally, existing debiasing methods for downstream tasks either (i) require labels of protected attributes (e.g., age, race, or political views) that are often not available or (ii) rely on indicators of bias, which restricts their applicability to gender debiasing since they rely on gender-specific words. To address this, we introduce a novel debiasing regularization technique based on the class-wise variance of embeddings. Crucially, our method does not require attribute labels and targets any attribute, thus addressing the shortcomings of existing debiasing methods. Our experiments on encoder language models and three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong debiasing baselines that rely on target attribute labels while maintaining performance on the target task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19541v3,2024-09

However, current approaches tend to provide general insights or solutions without fully understanding the help-seeker's situation. Therefore, we propose PsyMix, a chatbot that integrates the analyses of the seeker's state from the perspective of a psychotherapy approach (Chain-of-Psychotherapies, CoP) before generating the response, and learns to incorporate the strength of various psychotherapies by fine-tuning on a mixture of CoPs. Through comprehensive evaluation, we found that PsyMix can outperform the ChatGPT baseline, and demonstrate a comparable level of empathy in its responses to that of human counselors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19533v1,2024-09
Video DataFlywheel: Resolving the Impossible Data Trinity in Video-Language Understanding,"Xiao Wang, Jianlong Wu, Zijia Lin, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Liqiang Nie","Recently, video-language understanding has achieved great success through large-scale pre-training. However, data scarcity remains a prevailing challenge. This study quantitatively reveals an ""impossible trinity"" among data quantity, diversity, and quality in pre-training datasets. Recent efforts seek to refine large-scale, diverse ASR datasets compromised by low quality through synthetic annotations. These methods successfully leverage useful information in multimodal video content (frames, tags, ASR transcripts, etc.) to refine the original annotations. Nevertheless, they struggle to mitigate noise within synthetic annotations and lack scalability as the dataset size expands. To address these issues, we introduce the Video DataFlywheel framework, which iteratively refines video annotations with improved noise control methods. For iterative refinement, we first leverage a video-language model to generate synthetic annotations, resulting in a refined dataset. Then, we pre-train on it and fine-tune on human refinement examples for a stronger model. These processes are repeated for continuous improvement. For noise control, we present AdaTaiLr, a novel noise control method that requires weaker assumptions on noise distribution, thereby proving more effective in large datasets with theoretical guarantees. The combination of iterative refinement and AdaTaiLr can achieve better scalability in video-language understanding. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing data refinement baselines, delivering a 3% performance boost and improving dataset quality with minimal diversity loss. Furthermore, our refined dataset facilitates significant improvements in various video-language understanding tasks, including video question answering and text-video retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19532v1,2024-09
LANDeRMT: Detecting and Routing Language-Aware Neurons for Selectively Finetuning LLMs to Machine Translation,"Shaolin Zhu, Leiyu Pan, Bo Li, Deyi Xiong","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in multilingual translation even with limited bilingual supervision. The major challenges are catastrophic forgetting and parameter interference for finetuning LLMs when provided parallel training data. To address these challenges, we propose LANDeRMT, a \textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{N}euron \textbf{De}tecting and \textbf{R}outing framework that selectively finetunes LLMs to \textbf{M}achine \textbf{T}ranslation with diverse translation training data. In LANDeRMT, we evaluate the awareness of neurons to MT tasks and categorize them into language-general and language-specific neurons. This categorization enables selective parameter updates during finetuning, mitigating parameter interference and catastrophic forgetting issues. For the detected neurons, we further propose a conditional awareness-based routing mechanism to dynamically adjust language-general and language-specific capacity within LLMs, guided by translation signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LANDeRMT is very effective in learning translation knowledge, significantly improving translation quality over various strong baselines for multiple language pairs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19523v1,2024-09
CoT-ST: Enhancing LLM-based Speech Translation with Multimodal Chain-of-Thought,"Yexing Du, Ziyang Ma, Yifan Yang, Keqi Deng, Xie Chen, Bo Yang, Yang Xiang, Ming Liu, Bing Qin","Speech Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on speech translation tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on direct instruction fine-tuning and often overlooks the inherent reasoning capabilities of SLMs. In this paper, we introduce a three-stage training framework designed to activate the chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities of SLMs. We propose CoT-ST, a speech translation model that utilizes multimodal CoT to decompose speech translation into sequential steps of speech recognition and translation. We validated the effectiveness of our method on two datasets: the CoVoST-2 dataset and MuST-C dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that CoT-ST outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher BLEU scores (CoVoST-2 en-ja: 30.5->30.8, en-zh: 45.2->47.7, MuST-C en-zh: 19.6->21.2).

Mohammad, Iryna Gurevych","Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a transformative era in Natural Language Processing (NLP), reshaping research and extending NLP's influence to other fields of study. However, there is little to no work examining the degree to which LLMs influence other research fields. This work empirically and systematically examines the influence and use of LLMs in fields beyond NLP. We curate $106$ LLMs and analyze $\sim$$148k$ papers citing LLMs to quantify their influence and reveal trends in their usage patterns. Our analysis reveals not only the increasing prevalence of LLMs in non-CS fields but also the disparities in their usage, with some fields utilizing them more frequently than others since 2018, notably Linguistics and Engineering together accounting for $\sim$$45\%$ of LLM citations. Our findings further indicate that most of these fields predominantly employ task-agnostic LLMs, proficient in zero or few-shot learning without requiring further fine-tuning, to address their domain-specific problems. This study sheds light on the cross-disciplinary impact of NLP through LLMs, providing a better understanding of the opportunities and challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19508v1,2024-09
A Critical Look at Meta-evaluating Summarisation Evaluation Metrics,"Xiang Dai, Sarvnaz Karimi, Biaoyan Fang","Effective summarisation evaluation metrics enable researchers and practitioners to compare different summarisation systems efficiently. Estimating the effectiveness of an automatic evaluation metric, termed meta-evaluation, is a critically important research question. In this position paper, we review recent meta-evaluation practices for summarisation evaluation metrics and find that (1) evaluation metrics are primarily meta-evaluated on datasets consisting of examples from news summarisation datasets, and (2) there has been a noticeable shift in research focus towards evaluating the faithfulness of generated summaries. We argue that the time is ripe to build more diverse benchmarks that enable the development of more robust evaluation metrics and analyze the generalization ability of existing evaluation metrics. In addition, we call for research focusing on user-centric quality dimensions that consider the generated summary's communicative goal and the role of summarisation in the workflow.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19507v1,2024-09

Despite its established presence, the definition of what constitutes NLP research remains debated. In this work, we quantitatively investigate what constitutes NLP by examining research papers. For this purpose, we propose a taxonomy and introduce NLPContributions, a dataset of nearly $2k$ research paper abstracts, expertly annotated to identify scientific contributions and classify their types according to this taxonomy. We also propose a novel task to automatically identify these elements, for which we train a strong baseline on our dataset. We present experimental results from this task and apply our model to $\sim$$29k$ NLP research papers to analyze their contributions, aiding in the understanding of the nature of NLP research. Our findings reveal a rising involvement of machine learning in NLP since the early nineties, alongside a declining focus on adding knowledge about language or people; again, in post-2020, there has been a resurgence of focus on language and people.

MedHalu: Hallucinations in Responses to Healthcare Queries by Large Language Models,"Vibhor Agarwal, Yiqiao Jin, Mohit Chandra, Munmun De Choudhury, Srijan Kumar, Nishanth Sastry","The remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in language understanding and generation have not rendered them immune to hallucinations. LLMs can still generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or fabricated information. As LLM-empowered chatbots become popular, laypeople may frequently ask health-related queries and risk falling victim to these LLM hallucinations, resulting in various societal and healthcare implications. In this work, we conduct a pioneering study of hallucinations in LLM-generated responses to real-world healthcare queries from patients. We propose MedHalu, a carefully crafted first-of-its-kind medical hallucination dataset with a diverse range of health-related topics and the corresponding hallucinated responses from LLMs with labeled hallucination types and hallucinated text spans. We also introduce MedHaluDetect framework to evaluate capabilities of various LLMs in detecting hallucinations. We also employ three groups of evaluators -- medical experts, LLMs, and laypeople -- to study who are more vulnerable to these medical hallucinations. We find that LLMs are much worse than the experts. They also perform no better than laypeople and even worse in few cases in detecting hallucinations. To fill this gap, we propose expert-in-the-loop approach to improve hallucination detection through LLMs by infusing expert reasoning. We observe significant performance gains for all the LLMs with an average macro-F1 improvement of 6.3 percentage points for GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19492v1,2024-09

MedCLIP-SAMv2: Towards Universal Text-Driven Medical Image Segmentation,"Taha Koleilat, Hojat Asgariandehkordi, Hassan Rivaz, Yiming Xiao","Segmentation of anatomical structures and pathological regions in medical images is essential for modern clinical diagnosis, disease research, and treatment planning. While significant advancements have been made in deep learning-based segmentation techniques, many of these methods still suffer from limitations in data efficiency, generalizability, and interactivity. As a result, developing precise segmentation methods that require fewer labeled datasets remains a critical challenge in medical image analysis. Recently, the introduction of foundation models like CLIP and Segment-Anything-Model (SAM), with robust cross-domain representations, has paved the way for interactive and universal image segmentation. However, further exploration of these models for data-efficient segmentation in medical imaging is still needed and highly relevant. In this paper, we introduce MedCLIP-SAMv2, a novel framework that integrates the CLIP and SAM models to perform segmentation on clinical scans using text prompts, in both zero-shot and weakly supervised settings. Our approach includes fine-tuning the BiomedCLIP model with a new Decoupled Hard Negative Noise Contrastive Estimation (DHN-NCE) loss, and leveraging the Multi-modal Information Bottleneck (M2IB) to create visual prompts for generating segmentation masks from SAM in the zero-shot setting. We also investigate using zero-shot segmentation labels within a weakly supervised paradigm to enhance segmentation quality further. Extensive testing across four diverse segmentation tasks and medical imaging modalities (breast tumor ultrasound, brain tumor MRI, lung X-ray, and lung CT) demonstrates the high accuracy of our proposed framework.

Overriding Safety protections of Open-source Models,Sachin Kumar,"LLMs(Large Language Models) nowadays have widespread adoption as a tool for solving issues across various domain/tasks. These models since are susceptible to produce harmful or toxic results, inference-time adversarial attacks, therefore they do undergo safety alignment training and Red teaming for putting in safety guardrails. For using these models, usually fine-tuning is done for model alignment on the desired tasks, which can make model more aligned but also make it more susceptible to produce unsafe responses, if fine-tuned with harmful data.In this paper, we study how much of impact introduction of harmful data in fine-tuning can make, and if it can override the safety protection of those models. Conversely,it was also explored that if model is fine-tuned on safety data can make the model produce more safer responses. Further we explore if fine-tuning the model on harmful data makes it less helpful or less trustworthy because of increase in model uncertainty leading to knowledge drift. Our extensive experimental results shown that Safety protection in an open-source can be overridden, when fine-tuned with harmful data as observed by ASR increasing by 35% when compared to basemodel's ASR. Also, as observed, fine-tuning a model with harmful data made the harmful fine-tuned model highly uncertain with huge knowledge drift and less truthfulness in its responses. Furthermore, for the safe fine-tuned model, ASR decreases by 51.68% as compared to the basemodel, and Safe model also shown in minor drop in uncertainty and truthfulness as compared to basemodel.

SELP: Generating Safe and Efficient Task Plans for Robot Agents with Large Language Models,"Yi Wu, Zikang Xiong, Yiran Hu, Shreyash S. Iyengar, Nan Jiang, Aniket Bera, Lin Tan, Suresh Jagannathan","Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) that enhance robot agents' understanding and execution of natural language (NL) commands, ensuring the agents adhere to user-specified constraints remains challenging, particularly for complex commands and long-horizon tasks. To address this challenge, we present three key insights, equivalence voting, constrained decoding, and domain-specific fine-tuning, which significantly enhance LLM planners' capability in handling complex tasks. Equivalence voting ensures consistency by generating and sampling multiple Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas from NL commands, grouping equivalent LTL formulas, and selecting the majority group of formulas as the final LTL formula. Constrained decoding then uses the generated LTL formula to enforce the autoregressive inference of plans, ensuring the generated plans conform to the LTL. Domain-specific fine-tuning customizes LLMs to produce safe and efficient plans within specific task domains. Our approach, Safe Efficient LLM Planner (SELP), combines these insights to create LLM planners to generate plans adhering to user commands with high confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SELP across different robot agents and tasks, including drone navigation and robot manipulation. For drone navigation tasks, SELP outperforms state-of-the-art planners by 10.8% in safety rate (i.e., finishing tasks conforming to NL commands) and by 19.8% in plan efficiency. For robot manipulation tasks, SELP achieves 20.4% improvement in safety rate.

In this work, we investigate state-of-the-art LLMs in text mining tasks on medications and their related attributes such as dosage, route, strength, and adverse effects. In addition, we explore different ensemble learning methods (\textsc{Stack-Ensemble} and \textsc{Voting-Ensemble}) to augment the model performances from individual LLMs. Our ensemble learning result demonstrated better performances than individually fine-tuned base models BERT, RoBERTa, RoBERTa-L, BioBERT, BioClinicalBERT, BioMedRoBERTa, ClinicalBERT, and PubMedBERT across general and specific domains. Finally, we build up an entity linking function to map extracted medical terminologies into the SNOMED-CT codes and the British National Formulary (BNF) codes, which are further mapped to the Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d), and ICD. Our model's toolkit and desktop applications are publicly available (at \url{https://github.com/HECTA-UoM/ensemble-NER}).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19467v2,2024-09
Scalable Fine-tuning from Multiple Data Sources: A First-Order Approximation Approach,"Dongyue Li, Ziniu Zhang, Lu Wang, Hongyang R. Zhang","We study the problem of fine-tuning a language model (LM) for a target task by optimally using the information from $n$ auxiliary tasks. This problem has broad applications in NLP, such as targeted instruction tuning and data selection in chain-of-thought fine-tuning. The key challenge of this problem is that not all auxiliary tasks are useful to improve the performance of the target task. Thus, choosing the right subset of auxiliary tasks is crucial. Conventional subset selection methods, such as forward and backward stepwise selection, are unsuitable for LM fine-tuning because they require repeated training on subsets of auxiliary tasks. This paper introduces a new algorithm to estimate model fine-tuning performances without repeated training. Our algorithm first performs multitask training using the data of all the tasks to obtain a meta initialization. Then, we approximate the model fine-tuning loss of a subset using functional values and gradients from the meta initialization. Empirically, we find that this gradient-based approximation holds with remarkable accuracy for twelve transformer-based LMs. Thus, we can now estimate fine-tuning performances on CPUs within a few seconds. Finally, we fine-tune the pretrained base model for once on the selected subset of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments to validate this approach, delivering a speedup of $30\times$ over conventional subset selection while incurring only $1\%$ error of the true fine-tuning performances. In downstream evaluations involving both instruction tuning and chain-of-thought fine-tuning, this loss-based selection approach improves over prior gradient or representation similarity-based methods for subset selection by up to $3.8\%$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19458v2,2024-09
Investigating the Impact of Text Summarization on Topic Modeling,Trishia Khandelwal,"Topic models are used to identify and group similar themes in a set of documents. Recent advancements in deep learning based neural topic models has received significant research interest. In this paper, an approach is proposed that further enhances topic modeling performance by utilizing a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate summaries of documents before inputting them into the topic model. Few shot prompting is used to generate summaries of different lengths to compare their impact on topic modeling. This approach is particularly effective for larger documents because it helps capture the most essential information while reducing noise and irrelevant details that could obscure the overall theme. Additionally, it is observed that datasets exhibit an optimal summary length that leads to improved topic modeling performance. The proposed method yields better topic diversity and comparable coherence values compared to previous models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09063v1,2024-09
Thematic Analysis with Open-Source Generative AI and Machine Learning: A New Method for Inductive Qualitative Codebook Development,"Andrew Katz, Gabriella Coloyan Fleming, Joyce Main","This paper aims to answer one central question: to what extent can open-source generative text models be used in a workflow to approximate thematic analysis in social science research? To answer this question, we present the Generative AI-enabled Theme Organization and Structuring (GATOS) workflow, which uses open-source machine learning techniques, natural language processing tools, and generative text models to facilitate thematic analysis. To establish validity of the method, we present three case studies applying the GATOS workflow, leveraging these models and techniques to inductively create codebooks similar to traditional procedures using thematic analysis. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which a workflow comprising open-source models and tools can inductively produce codebooks that approach the known space of themes and sub-themes. To address the challenge of gleaning insights from these texts, we combine open-source generative text models, retrieval-augmented generation, and prompt engineering to identify codes and themes in large volumes of text, i.e., generate a qualitative codebook. The process mimics an inductive coding process that researchers might use in traditional thematic analysis by reading text one unit of analysis at a time, considering existing codes already in the codebook, and then deciding whether or not to generate a new code based on whether the extant codebook provides adequate thematic coverage. We demonstrate this workflow using three synthetic datasets from hypothetical organizational research settings: a study of teammate feedback in teamwork settings, a study of organizational cultures of ethical behavior, and a study of employee perspectives about returning to their offices after the pandemic. We show that the GATOS workflow is able to identify themes in the text that were used to generate the original synthetic datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03721v1,2024-09
'Simulacrum of Stories': Examining Large Language Models as Qualitative Research Participants,"Shivani Kapania, William Agnew, Motahhare Eslami, Hoda Heidari, Sarah Fox","The recent excitement around generative models has sparked a wave of proposals suggesting the replacement of human participation and labor in research and development--e.g., through surveys, experiments, and interviews--with synthetic research data generated by large language models (LLMs). We conducted interviews with 19 qualitative researchers to understand their perspectives on this paradigm shift. Initially skeptical, researchers were surprised to see similar narratives emerge in the LLM-generated data when using the interview probe. However, over several conversational turns, they went on to identify fundamental limitations, such as how LLMs foreclose participants' consent and agency, produce responses lacking in palpability and contextual depth, and risk delegitimizing qualitative research methods. We argue that the use of LLMs as proxies for participants enacts the surrogate effect, raising ethical and epistemological concerns that extend beyond the technical limitations of current models to the core of whether LLMs fit within qualitative ways of knowing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19430v1,2024-09
Crafting Personalized Agents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Editable Memory Graphs,"Zheng Wang, Zhongyang Li, Zeren Jiang, Dandan Tu, Wei Shi","In the age of mobile internet, user data, often referred to as memories, is continuously generated on personal devices. Effectively managing and utilizing this data to deliver services to users is a compelling research topic. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of crafting personalized agents powered by large language models (LLMs), which utilize a user's smartphone memories to enhance downstream applications with advanced LLM capabilities. To achieve this goal, we introduce EMG-RAG, a solution that combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with an Editable Memory Graph (EMG). This approach is further optimized using Reinforcement Learning to address three distinct challenges: data collection, editability, and selectability. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of EMG-RAG, achieving an improvement of approximately 10% over the best existing approach. Additionally, the personalized agents have been transferred into a real smartphone AI assistant, which leads to enhanced usability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19401v1,2024-09
Zero-Shot Multi-Hop Question Answering via Monte-Carlo Tree Search with Large Language Models,"Seongmin Lee, Jaewook Shin, Youngjin Ahn, Seokin Seo, Ohjoon Kwon, Kee-Eung Kim","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the domain of multi-hop question answering (MHQA), where systems are required to aggregate information and infer answers from disparate pieces of text. However, the autoregressive nature of LLMs inherently poses a challenge as errors may accumulate if mistakes are made in the intermediate reasoning steps. This paper introduces Monte-Carlo tree search for Zero-shot multi-hop Question Answering (MZQA), a framework based on Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to identify optimal reasoning paths in MHQA tasks, mitigating the error propagation from sequential reasoning processes. Unlike previous works, we propose a zero-shot prompting method, which relies solely on instructions without the support of hand-crafted few-shot examples that typically require domain expertise. We also introduce a behavioral cloning approach (MZQA-BC) trained on self-generated MCTS inference trajectories, achieving an over 10-fold increase in reasoning speed with bare compromise in performance. The efficacy of our method is validated on standard benchmarks such as HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and MuSiQue, demonstrating that it outperforms existing frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19382v2,2024-09
INC-Math: Integrating Natural Language and Code for Enhanced Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Xuyuan Xiong, Simeng Han, Ziyue Zhou, Arman Cohan","Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used to generate solutions for mathematical reasoning problems in the following formats: natural language, code, or a combination of both. In this paper, we explore fundamental questions related to solving mathematical reasoning problems using natural language and code with state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.1-8b-Turbo. Our findings show that LLMs are better at reasoning in natural language compared to code. Additionally, although natural language and code serve as complementary forms of reasoning, they can affect each other in a negative way in certain scenarios. These insights motivate our development of a new prompting method, INC-Math, which leverages an LLM to dynamically select the most appropriate reasoning form, resulting in improved performance over comparable baselines with GPT-4o-mini.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19381v3,2024-09
DOTA: Distributional Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models,"Zongbo Han, Jialong Yang, Junfan Li, Qinghua Hu, Qianli Xu, Mike Zheng Shou, Changqing Zhang","Vision-language foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models may be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between the training and test data. The training-free test-time dynamic adapter (TDA) is a promising approach to address this issue by storing representative test samples to guide the classification of subsequent ones. However, TDA only naively maintains a limited number of reference samples in the cache, leading to severe test-time catastrophic forgetting when the cache is updated by dropping samples. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation (Dota). Instead of naively memorizing representative test samples, Dota continually estimates the distributions of test samples, allowing the model to continually adapt to the deployment environment. The test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using the estimated distributions based on Bayes' theorem for adaptation purposes. To further enhance the adaptability on the uncertain samples, we introduce a new human-in-the-loop paradigm which identifies uncertain samples, collects human-feedback, and incorporates it into the Dota framework. Extensive experiments validate that Dota enables CLIP to continually learn, resulting in a significant improvement compared to current state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19375v1,2024-09
Visual Question Decomposition on Multimodal Large Language Models,"Haowei Zhang, Jianzhe Liu, Zhen Han, Shuo Chen, Bailan He, Volker Tresp, Zhiqiang Xu, Jindong Gu","Question decomposition has emerged as an effective strategy for prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer complex questions. However, while existing methods primarily focus on unimodal language models, the question decomposition capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has yet to be explored. To this end, this paper explores visual question decomposition on MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework including a dataset and several evaluation criteria to assess the quality of the decomposed sub-questions, revealing that existing MLLMs struggle to produce high-quality sub-questions. To address this limitation, we propose a specific finetuning dataset, DecoVQA+, for enhancing the model's question decomposition capability. Aiming at enabling models to perform appropriate selective decomposition, we propose an efficient finetuning pipeline. The finetuning pipeline consists of our proposed dataset and a training objective for selective decomposition. Finetuned MLLMs demonstrate significant improvements in the quality of sub-questions and the policy of selective question decomposition. Additionally, the models also achieve higher accuracy with selective decomposition on VQA benchmark datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19339v2,2024-09
Decoding Echo Chambers: LLM-Powered Simulations Revealing Polarization in Social Networks,"Chenxi Wang, Zongfang Liu, Dequan Yang, Xiuying Chen","The impact of social media on critical issues such as echo chambers needs to be addressed, as these phenomena can have disruptive consequences for our society. Traditional research often oversimplifies emotional tendencies and opinion evolution into numbers and formulas, neglecting that news and communication are conveyed through text, which limits these approaches. Hence, in this work, we propose an LLM-based simulation for the social opinion network to evaluate and counter polarization phenomena. We first construct three typical network structures to simulate different characteristics of social interactions. Then, agents interact based on recommendation algorithms and update their strategies through reasoning and analysis. By comparing these interactions with the classic Bounded Confidence Model (BCM), the Friedkin Johnsen (FJ) model, and using echo chamber-related indices, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in simulating opinion dynamics and reproducing phenomena such as opinion polarization and echo chambers. We propose two mitigation methods, active and passive nudges, that can help reduce echo chambers, specifically within language-based simulations. We hope our work will offer valuable insights and guidance for social polarization mitigation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19338v1,2024-09
A Generalized Model for Multidimensional Intransitivity,"Jiuding Duan, Jiyi Li, Yukino Baba, Hisashi Kashima","Intransitivity is a critical issue in pairwise preference modeling. It refers to the intransitive pairwise preferences between a group of players or objects that potentially form a cyclic preference chain and has been long discussed in social choice theory in the context of the dominance relationship. However, such multifaceted intransitivity between players and the corresponding player representations in high dimensions is difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model that jointly learns each player's d-dimensional representation (d>1) and a dataset-specific metric space that systematically captures the distance metric in Rd over the embedding space. Interestingly, by imposing additional constraints in the metric space, our proposed model degenerates to former models used in intransitive representation learning. Moreover, we present an extensive quantitative investigation of the vast existence of intransitive relationships between objects in various real-world benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this investigation is the first of this type. The predictive performance of our proposed method on different real-world datasets, including social choice, election, and online game datasets, shows that our proposed method outperforms several competing methods in terms of prediction accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19325v1,2024-09
Designing Domain-Specific Large Language Models: The Critical Role of Fine-Tuning in Public Opinion Simulation,Haocheng Lin,"Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet face challenges in specialized tasks such as simulating opinions on environmental policies. This paper introduces a novel fine-tuning approach that integrates socio-demographic data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, uniquely using profiling factors, such as age, gender, income, education, and region. This method enhances the accuracy and representation of generated views. By emulating diverse synthetic profiles, the fine-tuned models significantly outperform pre-trained counterparts, achieving measurable improvements in capturing demographic nuances. Evaluation metrics, including Chi-Squared, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Index, and KL-divergence, reveal a strong alignment between synthetic and real-world opinions. This work demonstrates the potential of fine-tuned LLMs tailored to societal contexts to enable more ethical and precise policy simulations. Its broader implications include deploying LLMs in domains like healthcare and education, fostering inclusive and data-driven decision-making in both research and practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19308v2,2024-09
FluentEditor2: Text-based Speech Editing by Modeling Multi-Scale Acoustic and Prosody Consistency,"Rui Liu, Jiatian Xi, Ziyue Jiang, Haizhou Li","Text-based speech editing (TSE) allows users to edit speech by modifying the corresponding text directly without altering the original recording. Current TSE techniques often focus on minimizing discrepancies between generated speech and reference within edited regions during training to achieve fluent TSE performance. However, the generated speech in the edited region should maintain acoustic and prosodic consistency with the unedited region and the original speech at both the local and global levels. To maintain speech fluency, we propose a new fluency speech editing scheme based on our previous \textit{FluentEditor} model, termed \textit{\textbf{FluentEditor2}}, by modeling the multi-scale acoustic and prosody consistency training criterion in TSE training. Specifically, for local acoustic consistency, we propose \textit{hierarchical local acoustic smoothness constraint} to align the acoustic properties of speech frames, phonemes, and words at the boundary between the generated speech in the edited region and the speech in the unedited region. For global prosody consistency, we propose \textit{contrastive global prosody consistency constraint} to keep the speech in the edited region consistent with the prosody of the original utterance. Extensive experiments on the VCTK and LibriTTS datasets show that \textit{FluentEditor2} surpasses existing neural networks-based TSE methods, including Editspeech, Campnet, A$^3$T, FluentSpeech, and our Fluenteditor, in both subjective and objective. Ablation studies further highlight the contributions of each module to the overall effectiveness of the system.

Perception Compressor:A training-free prompt compression method in long context scenarios,"Jiwei Tang, Jin Xu, Tingwei Lu, Zhicheng Zhang, Yiming Zhao, Lin Hai, Hai-Tao Zheng","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities in various scenarios. However, they suffer from much redundant information and are sensitive to the position of key information (relevant to the input question) in long context scenarios, leading to inferior performance. To address these challenges, we present Perception Compressor, a training-free prompt compression method. It includes a perception retriever that leverages guiding questions and instruction to retrieve the most relevant demonstrations, a dual-slope ratio allocator to dynamically allocate compression ratios and open-book ratios, and a semi-guided iterative compression that retains key information at the token level while removing tokens that distract the LLM. We conduct extensive experiments on long context benchmarks, i.e., NaturalQuestions, LongBench, and MuSiQue. Experiment results show that Perception Compressor outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19272v2,2024-09
LISTN: Lexicon induction with socio-temporal nuance,Christine de Kock,"In-group language is an important signifier of group dynamics. This paper proposes a novel method for inducing lexicons of in-group language, which incorporates its socio-temporal context. Existing methods for lexicon induction do not capture the evolving nature of in-group language, nor the social structure of the community. Using dynamic word and user embeddings trained on conversations from online anti-women communities, our approach outperforms prior methods for lexicon induction. We develop a test set for the task of lexicon induction and a new lexicon of manosphere language, validated by human experts, which quantifies the relevance of each term to a specific sub-community at a given point in time. Finally, we present novel insights on in-group language which illustrate the utility of this approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19257v2,2024-09
DENEB: A Hallucination-Robust Automatic Evaluation Metric for Image Captioning,"Kazuki Matsuda, Yuiga Wada, Komei Sugiura","In this work, we address the challenge of developing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning, with a particular focus on robustness against hallucinations. Existing metrics are often inadequate for handling hallucinations, primarily due to their limited ability to compare candidate captions with multifaceted reference captions. To address this shortcoming, we propose DENEB, a novel supervised automatic evaluation metric specifically robust against hallucinations. DENEB incorporates the Sim-Vec Transformer, a mechanism that processes multiple references simultaneously, thereby efficiently capturing the similarity between an image, a candidate caption, and reference captions. To train DENEB, we construct the diverse and balanced Nebula dataset comprising 32,978 images, paired with human judgments provided by 805 annotators. We demonstrated that DENEB achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing LLM-free metrics on the FOIL, Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and PASCAL-50S datasets, validating its effectiveness and robustness against hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19255v2,2024-09
Edit-Constrained Decoding for Sentence Simplification,"Tatsuya Zetsu, Yuki Arase, Tomoyuki Kajiwara","We propose edit operation based lexically constrained decoding for sentence simplification. In sentence simplification, lexical paraphrasing is one of the primary procedures for rewriting complex sentences into simpler correspondences. While previous studies have confirmed the efficacy of lexically constrained decoding on this task, their constraints can be loose and may lead to sub-optimal generation. We address this problem by designing constraints that replicate the edit operations conducted in simplification and defining stricter satisfaction conditions. Our experiments indicate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the previous studies on three English simplification corpora commonly used in this task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19247v1,2024-09
Jointly modelling the evolution of community structure and language in online extremist groups,Christine de Kock,"Group interactions take place within a particular socio-temporal context, which should be taken into account when modelling communities. We propose a method for jointly modelling community structure and language over time, and apply it in the context of extremist anti-women online groups (collectively known as the manosphere). Our model derives temporally grounded embeddings for words and users, which evolve over the training window. We show that this approach outperforms prior models which lacked one of these components (i.e. not incorporating social structure, or using static word embeddings). Using these embeddings, we investigate the evolution of users and words within these communities in three ways: (i) we model a user as a sequence of embeddings and forecast their affinity groups beyond the training window, (ii) we illustrate how word evolution is useful in the context of temporal events, and (iii) we characterise the propensity for violent language within subgroups of the manosphere.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19243v1,2024-09
SciDoc2Diagrammer-MAF: Towards Generation of Scientific Diagrams from Documents guided by Multi-Aspect Feedback Refinement,"Ishani Mondal, Zongxia Li, Yufang Hou, Anandhavelu Natarajan, Aparna Garimella, Jordan Boyd-Graber","Automating the creation of scientific diagrams from academic papers can significantly streamline the development of tutorials, presentations, and posters, thereby saving time and accelerating the process. Current text-to-image models struggle with generating accurate and visually appealing diagrams from long-context inputs. We propose SciDoc2Diagram, a task that extracts relevant information from scientific papers and generates diagrams, along with a benchmarking dataset, SciDoc2DiagramBench. We develop a multi-step pipeline SciDoc2Diagrammer that generates diagrams based on user intentions using intermediate code generation. We observed that initial diagram drafts were often incomplete or unfaithful to the source, leading us to develop SciDoc2Diagrammer-Multi-Aspect-Feedback (MAF), a refinement strategy that significantly enhances factual correctness and visual appeal and outperforms existing models on both automatic and human judgement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19242v2,2024-09
Performance Evaluation of Tokenizers in Large Language Models for the Assamese Language,"Sagar Tamang, Dibya Jyoti Bora","Training of a tokenizer plays an important role in the performance of deep learning models. This research aims to understand the performance of tokenizers in five state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs) in the Assamese language of India. The research is important to understand the multi-lingual support for a low-resourced language such as Assamese. Our research reveals that the tokenizer of SUTRA from Two AI performs the best with an average Normalized Sequence Length (NSL) value of 0.45, closely followed by the tokenizer of GPT-4o from Open AI with an average NSL value of 0.54, followed by Gemma 2, Meta Llama 3.1, and Mistral Large Instruct 2407 with an average NSL value of 0.82, 1.4, and 1.48 respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03718v1,2024-09
Test Case-Informed Knowledge Tracing for Open-ended Coding Tasks,"Zhangqi Duan, Nigel Fernandez, Alexander Hicks, Andrew Lan","Open-ended coding tasks, which ask students to construct programs according to certain specifications, are common in computer science education. Student modeling can be challenging since their open-ended nature means that student code can be diverse. Traditional knowledge tracing (KT) models that only analyze response correctness may not fully capture nuances in student knowledge from student code. In this paper, we introduce Test case-Informed Knowledge Tracing for Open-ended Coding (TIKTOC), a framework to simultaneously analyze and predict both open-ended student code and whether the code passes each test case. We augment the existing CodeWorkout dataset with the test cases used for a subset of the open-ended coding questions, and propose a multi-task learning KT method to simultaneously analyze and predict 1) whether a student's code submission passes each test case and 2) the student's open-ended code, using a large language model as the backbone. We quantitatively show that these methods outperform existing KT methods for coding that only use the overall score a code submission receives. We also qualitatively demonstrate how test case information, combined with open-ended code, helps us gain fine-grained insights into student knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10829v3,2024-09
Evidence Is All You Need: Ordering Imaging Studies via Language Model Alignment with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria,"Michael S. Yao, Allison Chae, Charles E. Kahn Jr., Walter R. Witschey, James C. Gee, Hersh Sagreiya, Osbert Bastani","Diagnostic imaging studies are an increasingly important component of the workup and management of acutely presenting patients. However, ordering appropriate imaging studies according to evidence-based medical guidelines is a challenging task with a high degree of variability between healthcare providers. To address this issue, recent work has investigated if generative AI and large language models can be leveraged to help clinicians order relevant imaging studies for patients. However, it is challenging to ensure that these tools are correctly aligned with medical guidelines, such as the American College of Radiology's Appropriateness Criteria (ACR AC). In this study, we introduce a framework to intelligently leverage language models by recommending imaging studies for patient cases that are aligned with evidence-based guidelines. We make available a novel dataset of patient ""one-liner"" scenarios to power our experiments, and optimize state-of-the-art language models to achieve an accuracy on par with clinicians in image ordering. Finally, we demonstrate that our language model-based pipeline can be used as intelligent assistants by clinicians to support image ordering workflows and improve the accuracy of imaging study ordering according to the ACR AC. Our work demonstrates and validates a strategy to leverage AI-based software to improve trustworthy clinical decision making in alignment with expert evidence-based guidelines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19177v2,2024-09
A GEN AI Framework for Medical Note Generation,"Hui Yi Leong, Yi Fan Gao, Shuai Ji, Bora Kalaycioglu, Uktu Pamuksuz","The increasing administrative burden of medical documentation, particularly through Electronic Health Records (EHR), significantly reduces the time available for direct patient care and contributes to physician burnout. To address this issue, we propose MediNotes, an advanced generative AI framework designed to automate the creation of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes from medical conversations. MediNotes integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to capture and process both text and voice inputs in real time or from recorded audio, generating structured and contextually accurate medical notes. The framework also incorporates advanced techniques like Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for efficient model fine-tuning in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, MediNotes offers a query-based retrieval system, allowing healthcare providers and patients to access relevant medical information quickly and accurately. Evaluations using the ACI-BENCH dataset demonstrate that MediNotes significantly improves the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of automated medical documentation, offering a robust solution to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals while improving the quality of clinical workflows.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01841v1,2024-09
HM3: Heterogeneous Multi-Class Model Merging,Stefan Hackmann,"Foundation language model deployments often include auxiliary guard-rail models to filter or classify text, detecting jailbreak attempts, biased or toxic output, or ensuring topic adherence. These additional models increase the complexity and cost of model inference, especially since many are also large language models. To address this issue, we explore training-free model merging techniques to consolidate these models into a single, multi-functional model. We propose Heterogeneous Multi-Class Model Merging (HM3) as a simple technique for merging multi-class classifiers with heterogeneous label spaces. Unlike parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA, which require extensive training and add complexity during inference, recent advancements allow models to be merged in a training-free manner. We report promising results for merging BERT-based guard models, some of which attain an average F1-score higher than the source models while reducing the inference time by up to 44%. We introduce self-merging to assess the impact of reduced task-vector density, finding that the more poorly performing hate speech classifier benefits from self-merging while higher-performing classifiers do not, which raises questions about using task vector reduction for model tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19173v1,2024-09
Revisiting the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis,"Mohit Raghavendra, Vaskar Nath, Sean Hendryx","The Superficial Alignment Hypothesis posits that almost all of a language model's abilities and knowledge are learned during pre-training, while post-training is about giving a model the right style and format. We re-examine these claims by empirically studying the scaling behavior of post-training with increasing finetuning examples and evaluating them using objective task-specific standardized benchmarks. Through experiments with the Llama-3, Mistral, and Llama-2 model families of multiple sizes, we observe that, similar to the pre-training scaling laws, post-training task performance scales as a power law against the number of finetuning examples. This power law relationship holds across a broad array of capabilities, including mathematical reasoning, coding, instruction following, and multihop-reasoning. In addition, for tasks like math and multihop reasoning, we observe that a handful of examples merely align the model stylistically but do not saturate performance on the benchmarks. Model performance is instead correlated with its reasoning ability and it improves significantly with more examples, illustrating the need for holistic evaluation programs leveraging objective benchmarks in addition to measurement of alignment to human preferences. We also observe that language models are not necessarily limited to using knowledge learned during pre-training. With appropriate post-training, a model's ability to integrate new knowledge greatly improves on downstream tasks like multihop question-answering. Taken together, these results shed new light on the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis, suggesting that it is, at best, an over-simplification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03717v1,2024-09
Can LLMs Really Learn to Translate a Low-Resource Language from One Grammar Book?,"Seth Aycock, David Stap, Di Wu, Christof Monz, Khalil Sima'an","Extremely low-resource (XLR) languages lack substantial corpora for training NLP models, motivating the use of all available resources such as dictionaries and grammar books. Machine Translation from One Book (Tanzer et al., 2024) suggests prompting long-context LLMs with one grammar book enables English-Kalamang translation, an unseen XLR language - a noteworthy case of linguistic knowledge helping an NLP task. We investigate whether the book's grammatical explanations or its parallel examples are most effective for learning XLR translation, finding almost all improvement stems from the parallel examples. Further, we find similar results for Nepali, a seen low-resource language, and achieve performance comparable to an LLM with a grammar book by simply fine-tuning an encoder-decoder translation model. We then investigate where grammar books help by testing two linguistic tasks, grammaticality judgment and gloss prediction, and we explore what kind of grammatical knowledge helps by introducing a typological feature prompt that achieves leading results on these more relevant tasks. We thus emphasise the importance of task-appropriate data for XLR languages: parallel examples for translation, and grammatical data for linguistic tasks. As we find no evidence that long-context LLMs can make effective use of grammatical explanations for XLR translation, we suggest data collection for multilingual XLR tasks such as translation is best focused on parallel data over linguistic description.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19151v1,2024-09
On the Power of Decision Trees in Auto-Regressive Language Modeling,"Yulu Gan, Tomer Galanti, Tomaso Poggio, Eran Malach","Originally proposed for handling time series data, Auto-regressive Decision Trees (ARDTs) have not yet been explored for language modeling. This paper delves into both the theoretical and practical applications of ARDTs in this new context. We theoretically demonstrate that ARDTs can compute complex functions, such as simulating automata, Turing machines, and sparse circuits, by leveraging ""chain-of-thought"" computations. Our analysis provides bounds on the size, depth, and computational efficiency of ARDTs, highlighting their surprising computational power. Empirically, we train ARDTs on simple language generation tasks, showing that they can learn to generate coherent and grammatically correct text on par with a smaller Transformer model. Additionally, we show that ARDTs can be used on top of transformer representations to solve complex reasoning tasks. This research reveals the unique computational abilities of ARDTs, aiming to broaden the architectural diversity in language model development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19150v1,2024-09
Uncovering Differences in Persuasive Language in Russian versus English Wikipedia,"Bryan Li, Aleksey Panasyuk, Chris Callison-Burch","We study how differences in persuasive language across Wikipedia articles, written in either English and Russian, can uncover each culture's distinct perspective on different subjects. We develop a large language model (LLM) powered system to identify instances of persuasive language in multilingual texts. Instead of directly prompting LLMs to detect persuasion, which is subjective and difficult, we propose to reframe the task to instead ask high-level questions (HLQs) which capture different persuasive aspects. Importantly, these HLQs are authored by LLMs themselves. LLMs over-generate a large set of HLQs, which are subsequently filtered to a small set aligned with human labels for the original task. We then apply our approach to a large-scale, bilingual dataset of Wikipedia articles (88K total), using a two-stage identify-then-extract prompting strategy to find instances of persuasion.   We quantify the amount of persuasion per article, and explore the differences in persuasion through several experiments on the paired articles. Notably, we generate rankings of articles by persuasion in both languages. These rankings match our intuitions on the culturally-salient subjects; Russian Wikipedia highlights subjects on Ukraine, while English Wikipedia highlights the Middle East. Grouping subjects into larger topics, we find politically-related events contain more persuasion than others. We further demonstrate that HLQs obtain similar performance when posed in either English or Russian. Our methodology enables cross-lingual, cross-cultural understanding at scale, and we release our code, prompts, and data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19148v1,2024-09
Confidential Prompting: Protecting User Prompts from Cloud LLM Providers,"In Gim, Caihua Li, Lin Zhong","Our work tackles the challenge of securing user inputs in cloud-hosted large language model (LLM) serving while ensuring output invariance, model confidentiality, and compute efficiency. We introduce secure multi-party decoding (SMD), which leverages confidential computing to confine user prompts to a trusted execution environment (TEE), namely a confidential virtual machine (CVM), while allowing service providers to generate tokens efficiently. We also introduce a novel cryptographic method, prompt obfuscation (PO), to ensure robustness against reconstruction attacks on SMD. We demonstrate that our approach preserves both prompt confidentiality and LLM serving efficiency. Our solution can enable privacy-preserving cloud LLM serving that handles sensitive prompts, such as clinical records, financial data, and personal information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19134v2,2024-09
Meta-RTL: Reinforcement-Based Meta-Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Commonsense Reasoning,"Yu Fu, Jie He, Yifan Yang, Qun Liu, Deyi Xiong","Meta learning has been widely used to exploit rich-resource source tasks to improve the performance of low-resource target tasks. Unfortunately, most existing meta learning approaches treat different source tasks equally, ignoring the relatedness of source tasks to the target task in knowledge transfer. To mitigate this issue, we propose a reinforcement-based multi-source meta-transfer learning framework (Meta-RTL) for low-resource commonsense reasoning. In this framework, we present a reinforcement-based approach to dynamically estimating source task weights that measure the contribution of the corresponding tasks to the target task in the meta-transfer learning. The differences between the general loss of the meta model and task-specific losses of source-specific temporal meta models on sampled target data are fed into the policy network of the reinforcement learning module as rewards. The policy network is built upon LSTMs that capture long-term dependencies on source task weight estimation across meta learning iterations. We evaluate the proposed Meta-RTL using both BERT and ALBERT as the backbone of the meta model on three commonsense reasoning benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta-RTL substantially outperforms strong baselines and previous task selection strategies and achieves larger improvements on extremely low-resource settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19075v1,2024-09
Show and Guide: Instructional-Plan Grounded Vision and Language Model,"Diogo Glória-Silva, David Semedo, João Magalhães","Guiding users through complex procedural plans is an inherently multimodal task in which having visually illustrated plan steps is crucial to deliver an effective plan guidance. However, existing works on plan-following language models (LMs) often are not capable of multimodal input and output. In this work, we present MM-PlanLLM, the first multimodal LLM designed to assist users in executing instructional tasks by leveraging both textual plans and visual information. Specifically, we bring cross-modality through two key tasks: Conversational Video Moment Retrieval, where the model retrieves relevant step-video segments based on user queries, and Visually-Informed Step Generation, where the model generates the next step in a plan, conditioned on an image of the user's current progress. MM-PlanLLM is trained using a novel multitask-multistage approach, designed to gradually expose the model to multimodal instructional-plans semantic layers, achieving strong performance on both multimodal and textual dialogue in a plan-grounded setting. Furthermore, we show that the model delivers cross-modal temporal and plan-structure representations aligned between textual plan steps and instructional video moments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19074v3,2024-09
CLLMate: A Multimodal LLM for Weather and Climate Events Forecasting,"Haobo Li, Zhaowei Wang, Jiachen Wang, Alexis Kai Hon Lau, Huamin Qu","Forecasting weather and climate events is crucial for making appropriate measures to mitigate environmental hazards and minimize associated losses. Previous research on environmental forecasting focuses on predicting numerical meteorological variables related to closed-set events rather than forecasting open-set events directly, which limits the comprehensiveness of event forecasting. We propose Weather and Climate Event Forecasting (WCEF), a new task that leverages meteorological raster data and textual event data to predict potential weather and climate events. However, due to difficulties in aligning multimodal data and the lack of sufficient supervised datasets, this task is challenging to accomplish. Therefore, we first propose a framework to align historical meteorological data with past weather and climate events using the large language model (LLM). In this framework, we construct a knowledge graph by using LLM to extract information about weather and climate events from a corpus of over 41k highly environment-focused news articles. Subsequently, we mapped these events with meteorological raster data, creating a supervised dataset, which is the largest and most novel for LLM tuning on the WCEF task. Finally, we introduced our aligned models, CLLMate (LLM for climate), a multimodal LLM to forecast weather and climate events using meteorological raster data. In evaluating CLLMate, we conducted extensive experiments. The results indicate that CLLMate surpasses both the baselines and other multimodal LLMs, showcasing the potential of utilizing LLM to align weather and climate events with meteorological data and highlighting the promising future for research on the WCEF task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19058v1,2024-09
LML-DAP: Language Model Learning a Dataset for Data-Augmented Prediction,Praneeth Vadlapati,"Classification tasks are typically handled using Machine Learning (ML) models, which lack a balance between accuracy and interpretability. This paper introduces a new approach for classification tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs) in an explainable method. Unlike ML models, which rely heavily on data cleaning and feature engineering, this method streamlines the process using LLMs. This paper proposes a method called ""Language Model Learning (LML)"" powered by a new method called ""Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)."" The classification is performed by LLMs using a method similar to that used by humans who manually explore and understand the data to decide classifications. In the process of LML, a dataset is summarized and evaluated to determine the features leading to each label the most. In the DAP process, the system uses the data summary and a row of the testing dataset to automatically generate a query to retrieve relevant rows from the dataset for context-aware classification. LML and DAP unlock new possibilities in areas that require explainable and context-aware decisions by ensuring satisfactory accuracy even with complex data. The system scored an accuracy above 90% in some test cases, confirming the effectiveness and potential of the system to outperform ML models in various scenarios.

On the Inductive Bias of Stacking Towards Improving Reasoning,"Nikunj Saunshi, Stefani Karp, Shankar Krishnan, Sobhan Miryoosefi, Sashank J. Reddi, Sanjiv Kumar","Given the increasing scale of model sizes, novel training strategies like gradual stacking [Gong et al., 2019, Reddi et al., 2023] have garnered interest. Stacking enables efficient training by gradually growing the depth of a model in stages and using layers from a smaller model in an earlier stage to initialize the next stage. Although efficient for training, the model biases induced by such growing approaches are largely unexplored. In this work, we examine this fundamental aspect of gradual stacking, going beyond its efficiency benefits. We propose a variant of gradual stacking called MIDAS that can speed up language model training by up to 40%. Furthermore we discover an intriguing phenomenon: MIDAS is not only training-efficient but surprisingly also has an inductive bias towards improving downstream tasks, especially tasks that require reasoning abilities like reading comprehension and math problems, despite having similar or slightly worse perplexity compared to baseline training. To further analyze this inductive bias, we construct reasoning primitives -- simple synthetic tasks that are building blocks for reasoning -- and find that a model pretrained with stacking is significantly better than standard pretraining on these primitives, with and without fine-tuning. This provides stronger and more robust evidence for this inductive bias towards reasoning. These findings of training efficiency and inductive bias towards reasoning are verified at 1B, 2B and 8B parameter language models. Finally, we conjecture the underlying reason for this inductive bias by exploring the connection of stacking to looped models and provide strong supporting empirical analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19044v1,2024-09
Ruler: A Model-Agnostic Method to Control Generated Length for Large Language Models,"Jiaming Li, Lei Zhang, Yunshui Li, Ziqiang Liu, yuelin bai, Run Luo, Longze Chen, Min Yang","The instruction-following ability of large language models enables humans to interact with AI agents in a natural way. However, when required to generate responses of a specific length, large language models often struggle to meet users' needs due to their inherent difficulty in accurately perceiving numerical constraints. To explore the ability of large language models to control the length of generated responses, we propose the Target Length Generation Task (TLG) and design two metrics, Precise Match (PM) and Flexible Match (FM) to evaluate the model's performance in adhering to specified response lengths. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach called Ruler, which employs Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the instruction-following ability of large language models under length-constrained instructions. Specifically, Ruler equips LLMs with the ability to generate responses of a specified length based on length constraints within the instructions. Moreover, Ruler can automatically generate appropriate MLT when length constraints are not explicitly provided, demonstrating excellent versatility and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of Ruler across different LLMs on Target Length Generation Task, e.g., at All Level 27.97 average gain on PM, 29.57 average gain on FM. In addition, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to further substantiate the efficacy and generalization of Ruler. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/Geaming2002/Ruler.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18943v2,2024-09

Assimes, Xin Ma, Danielle S. Bitterman, Lin Lu, Lizhou Fan","Simulated patient systems play a crucial role in modern medical education and research, providing safe, integrative learning environments and enabling clinical decision-making simulations. Large Language Models (LLM) could advance simulated patient systems by replicating medical conditions and patient-doctor interactions with high fidelity and low cost. However, ensuring the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems remains a challenge, as they require a large, diverse, and precise patient knowledgebase, along with a robust and stable knowledge diffusion to users. Here, we developed AIPatient, an advanced simulated patient system with AIPatient Knowledge Graph (AIPatient KG) as the input and the Reasoning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Reasoning RAG) agentic workflow as the generation backbone. AIPatient KG samples data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-III database, producing a clinically diverse and relevant cohort of 1,495 patients with high knowledgebase validity (F1 0.89). Reasoning RAG leverages six LLM powered agents spanning tasks including retrieval, KG query generation, abstraction, checker, rewrite, and summarization. This agentic framework reaches an overall accuracy of 94.15% in EHR-based medical Question Answering (QA), outperforming benchmarks that use either no agent or only partial agent integration. Our system also presents high readability (median Flesch Reading Ease 77.23; median Flesch Kincaid Grade 5.6), robustness (ANOVA F-value 0.6126, p>0.1), and stability (ANOVA F-value 0.782, p>0.1).

Soft Measures for Extracting Causal Collective Intelligence,"Maryam Berijanian, Spencer Dork, Kuldeep Singh, Michael Riley Millikan, Ashlin Riggs, Aadarsh Swaminathan, Sarah L. Gibbs, Scott E. Friedman, Nathan Brugnone","Understanding and modeling collective intelligence is essential for addressing complex social systems. Directed graphs called fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) offer a powerful tool for encoding causal mental models, but extracting high-integrity FCMs from text is challenging. This study presents an approach using large language models (LLMs) to automate FCM extraction. We introduce novel graph-based similarity measures and evaluate them by correlating their outputs with human judgments through the Elo rating system. Results show positive correlations with human evaluations, but even the best-performing measure exhibits limitations in capturing FCM nuances. Fine-tuning LLMs improves performance, but existing measures still fall short. This study highlights the need for soft similarity measures tailored to FCM extraction, advancing collective intelligence modeling with NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18911v1,2024-09
IDGen: Item Discrimination Induced Prompt Generation for LLM Evaluation,"Fan Lin, Shuyi Xie, Yong Dai, Wenlin Yao, Tianjiao Lang, Zishan Xu, Zhichao Hu, Xiao Xiao, Yuhong Liu, Yu Zhang","As Large Language Models (LLMs) grow increasingly adept at managing complex tasks, the evaluation set must keep pace with these advancements to ensure it remains sufficiently discriminative. Item Discrimination (ID) theory, which is widely used in educational assessment, measures the ability of individual test items to differentiate between high and low performers. Inspired by this theory, we propose an ID-induced prompt synthesis framework for evaluating LLMs to ensure the evaluation set can continually update and refine according to model abilities. Our data synthesis framework prioritizes both breadth and specificity. It can generate prompts that comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs while revealing meaningful performance differences between models, allowing for effective discrimination of their relative strengths and weaknesses across various tasks and domains. To produce high-quality data, we incorporate a self-correct mechanism into our generalization framework, and develop two models to predict prompt discrimination and difficulty score to facilitate our data synthesis framework, contributing valuable tools to evaluation data synthesis research. We apply our generated data to evaluate five SOTA models. Our data achieves an average score of 51.92, accompanied by a variance of 10.06. By contrast, previous works (i.e., SELF-INSTRUCT and WizardLM) obtain an average score exceeding 67, with a variance below 3.2. The results demonstrate that the data generated by our framework is more challenging and discriminative compared to previous works. We will release a dataset of over 3,000 carefully crafted prompts to facilitate evaluation research of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18892v2,2024-09
Suicide Phenotyping from Clinical Notes in Safety-Net Psychiatric Hospital Using Multi-Label Classification with Pre-Trained Language Models,"Zehan Li, Yan Hu, Scott Lane, Salih Selek, Lokesh Shahani, Rodrigo Machado-Vieira, Jair Soares, Hua Xu, Hongfang Liu, Ming Huang","Accurate identification and categorization of suicidal events can yield better suicide precautions, reducing operational burden, and improving care quality in high-acuity psychiatric settings. Pre-trained language models offer promise for identifying suicidality from unstructured clinical narratives. We evaluated the performance of four BERT-based models using two fine-tuning strategies (multiple single-label and single multi-label) for detecting coexisting suicidal events from 500 annotated psychiatric evaluation notes. The notes were labeled for suicidal ideation (SI), suicide attempts (SA), exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). RoBERTa outperformed other models using multiple single-label classification strategy (acc=0.86, F1=0.78). MentalBERT (acc=0.83, F1=0.74) also exceeded BioClinicalBERT (acc=0.82, F1=0.72) which outperformed BERT (acc=0.80, F1=0.70). RoBERTa fine-tuned with single multi-label classification further improved the model performance (acc=0.88, F1=0.81). The findings highlight that the model optimization, pretraining with domain-relevant data, and the single multi-label classification strategy enhance the model performance of suicide phenotyping.

Charting the Future: Using Chart Question-Answering for Scalable Evaluation of LLM-Driven Data Visualizations,"James Ford, Xingmeng Zhao, Dan Schumacher, Anthony Rios","We propose a novel framework that leverages Visual Question Answering (VQA) models to automate the evaluation of LLM-generated data visualizations. Traditional evaluation methods often rely on human judgment, which is costly and unscalable, or focus solely on data accuracy, neglecting the effectiveness of visual communication. By employing VQA models, we assess data representation quality and the general communicative clarity of charts. Experiments were conducted using two leading VQA benchmark datasets, ChartQA and PlotQA, with visualizations generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and Meta's Llama 3.1 70B-Instruct models. Our results indicate that LLM-generated charts do not match the accuracy of the original non-LLM-generated charts based on VQA performance measures. Moreover, while our results demonstrate that few-shot prompting significantly boosts the accuracy of chart generation, considerable progress remains to be made before LLMs can fully match the precision of human-generated graphs. This underscores the importance of our work, which expedites the research process by enabling rapid iteration without the need for human annotation, thus accelerating advancements in this field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18764v1,2024-09
Cross-Domain Keyword Extraction with Keyness Patterns,"Dongmei Zhou, Xuri Tang","Domain dependence and annotation subjectivity pose challenges for supervised keyword extraction. Based on the premises that second-order keyness patterns are existent at the community level and learnable from annotated keyword extraction datasets, this paper proposes a supervised ranking approach to keyword extraction that ranks keywords with keyness patterns consisting of independent features (such as sublanguage domain and term length) and three categories of dependent features -- heuristic features, specificity features, and representavity features. The approach uses two convolutional-neural-network based models to learn keyness patterns from keyword datasets and overcomes annotation subjectivity by training the two models with bootstrap sampling strategy. Experiments demonstrate that the approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten keyword datasets in general supervised keyword extraction with an average top-10-F-measure of 0.316 , but also robust cross-domain performance with an average top-10-F-measure of 0.346 on four datasets that are excluded in the training process. Such cross-domain robustness is attributed to the fact that community-level keyness patterns are limited in number and temperately independent of language domains, the distinction between independent features and dependent features, and the sampling training strategy that balances excess risk and lack of negative training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18724v1,2024-09

To bridge this gap, we propose the first multi-audio evaluation (MAE) benchmark that consists of 20 datasets from 11 multi-audio tasks encompassing both speech and sound scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on MAE demonstrate that the existing ALLMs, while being powerful in comprehending primary audio elements in individual audio inputs, struggling to handle multi-audio scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel multi-audio-LLM (MALLM) to capture audio context among multiple similar audios using discriminative learning on our proposed synthetic data.

It nests two curricula: Rhetorical Role-level Curriculum (RC) on the outer layer and Document-level Curriculum (DC) on the inner layer. DC categorizes documents based on their difficulty, utilizing metrics like deviation from a standard discourse structure and exposes the model to them in an easy-to-difficult fashion. RC progressively strengthens the model to discern coarse-to-fine-grained distinctions between rhetorical roles.

The Craft of Selective Prediction: Towards Reliable Case Outcome Classification -- An Empirical Study on European Court of Human Rights Cases,"T. Y. S. S. Santosh, Irtiza Chowdhury, Shanshan Xu, Matthias Grabmair","In high-stakes decision-making tasks within legal NLP, such as Case Outcome Classification (COC), quantifying a model's predictive confidence is crucial. Confidence estimation enables humans to make more informed decisions, particularly when the model's certainty is low, or where the consequences of a mistake are significant. However, most existing COC works prioritize high task performance over model reliability. This paper conducts an empirical investigation into how various design choices including pre-training corpus, confidence estimator and fine-tuning loss affect the reliability of COC models within the framework of selective prediction. Our experiments on the multi-label COC task, focusing on European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) cases, highlight the importance of a diverse yet domain-specific pre-training corpus for better calibration. Additionally, we demonstrate that larger models tend to exhibit overconfidence, Monte Carlo dropout methods produce reliable confidence estimates, and confident error regularization effectively mitigates overconfidence. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic exploration of selective prediction in legal NLP.

We investigate two strategies to integrate precedents: direct incorporation at inference via label interpolation based on case proximity and during training via a precedent fusion module using a stacked-cross attention model. We employ joint training of the retriever and LJP models to address latent space divergence between them. Our experiments on LJP tasks from the ECHR jurisdiction reveal that integrating precedents during training coupled with joint training of the retriever and LJP model, outperforms models without precedents or with precedents incorporated only at inference, particularly benefiting sparser articles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18644v1,2024-09
Model-based Preference Optimization in Abstractive Summarization without Human Feedback,"Jaepill Choi, Kyubyung Chae, Jiwoo Song, Yohan Jo, Taesup Kim","In abstractive summarization, the challenge of producing concise and accurate summaries arises from the vast amount of information contained in the source document. Consequently, although Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, they often introduce inaccuracies by hallucinating content not found in the original source. While supervised fine-tuning methods that maximize likelihood contribute to this issue, they do not consistently enhance the faithfulness of the summaries. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), can further refine the model to align with human preferences. However, these methods still heavily depend on costly human feedback. In this work, we introduce a novel and straightforward approach called Model-based Preference Optimization (MPO) to fine-tune LLMs for improved summarization abilities without any human feedback. By leveraging the model's inherent summarization capabilities, we create a preference dataset that is fully generated by the model using different decoding strategies. Our experiments on standard summarization datasets and various metrics demonstrate that our proposed MPO significantly enhances the quality of generated summaries without relying on human feedback.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18618v3,2024-09
Do LLMs suffer from Multi-Party Hangover? A Diagnostic Approach to Addressee Recognition and Response Selection in Conversations,"Nicolò Penzo, Maryam Sajedinia, Bruno Lepri, Sara Tonelli, Marco Guerini","Assessing the performance of systems to classify Multi-Party Conversations (MPC) is challenging due to the interconnection between linguistic and structural characteristics of conversations. Conventional evaluation methods often overlook variances in model behavior across different levels of structural complexity on interaction graphs. In this work, we propose a methodological pipeline to investigate model performance across specific structural attributes of conversations. As a proof of concept we focus on Response Selection and Addressee Recognition tasks, to diagnose model weaknesses. To this end, we extract representative diagnostic subdatasets with a fixed number of users and a good structural variety from a large and open corpus of online MPCs. We further frame our work in terms of data minimization, avoiding the use of original usernames to preserve privacy, and propose alternatives to using original text messages. Results show that response selection relies more on the textual content of conversations, while addressee recognition requires capturing their structural dimension. Using an LLM in a zero-shot setting, we further highlight how sensitivity to prompt variations is task-dependent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18602v1,2024-09
ASAG2024: A Combined Benchmark for Short Answer Grading,"Gérôme Meyer, Philip Breuer, Jonathan Fürst","Open-ended questions test a more thorough understanding than closed-ended questions and are often a preferred assessment method. However, open-ended questions are tedious to grade and subject to personal bias. Therefore, there have been efforts to speed up the grading process through automation. Short Answer Grading (SAG) systems aim to automatically score students' answers. Despite growth in SAG methods and capabilities, there exists no comprehensive short-answer grading benchmark across different subjects, grading scales, and distributions. Thus, it is hard to assess the capabilities of current automated grading methods in terms of their generalizability. In this preliminary work, we introduce the combined ASAG2024 benchmark to facilitate the comparison of automated grading systems. Combining seven commonly used short-answer grading datasets in a common structure and grading scale. For our benchmark, we evaluate a set of recent SAG methods, revealing that while LLM-based approaches reach new high scores, they still are far from reaching human performance. This opens up avenues for future research on human-machine SAG systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18596v1,2024-09
"""Oh LLM, I'm Asking Thee, Please Give Me a Decision Tree"": Zero-Shot Decision Tree Induction and Embedding with Large Language Models","Ricardo Knauer, Mario Koddenbrock, Raphael Wallsberger, Nicholas M. Brisson, Georg N. Duda, Deborah Falla, David W. Evans, Erik Rodner","Large language models (LLMs) provide powerful means to leverage prior knowledge for predictive modeling when data is limited. In this work, we demonstrate how LLMs can use their compressed world knowledge to generate intrinsically interpretable machine learning models, i.e., decision trees, without any training data. We find that these zero-shot decision trees can surpass data-driven trees on some small-sized tabular datasets and that embeddings derived from these trees perform on par with data-driven tree-based embeddings on average. Our knowledge-driven decision tree induction and embedding approaches therefore serve as strong new baselines for data-driven machine learning methods in the low-data regime.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18594v1,2024-09
Hit the Sweet Spot! Span-Level Ensemble for Large Language Models,"Yangyifan Xu, Jianghao Chen, Junhong Wu, Jiajun Zhang","Ensembling various LLMs to unlock their complementary potential and leverage their individual strengths is highly valuable. Previous studies typically focus on two main paradigms: sample-level and token-level ensembles. Sample-level ensemble methods either select or blend fully generated outputs, which hinders dynamic correction and enhancement of outputs during the generation process. On the other hand, token-level ensemble methods enable real-time correction through fine-grained ensemble at each generation step. However, the information carried by an individual token is quite limited, leading to suboptimal decisions at each step. To address these issues, we propose SweetSpan, a span-level ensemble method that effectively balances the need for real-time adjustments and the information required for accurate ensemble decisions. Our approach involves two key steps: First, we have each candidate model independently generate candidate spans based on the shared prefix. Second, we calculate perplexity scores to facilitate mutual evaluation among the candidate models and achieve robust span selection by filtering out unfaithful scores. To comprehensively evaluate ensemble methods, we propose a new challenging setting (ensemble models with significant performance gaps) in addition to the standard setting (ensemble the best-performing models) to assess the performance of model ensembles in more realistic scenarios. Experimental results in both standard and challenging settings across various language generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and versatility of our approach compared with previous ensemble methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18583v1,2024-09
Research on Predicting Public Opinion Event Heat Levels Based on Large Language Models,"Yi Ren, Tianyi Zhang, Weibin Li, DuoMu Zhou, Chenhao Qin, FangCheng Dong","In recent years, with the rapid development of large language models, serval models such as GPT-4o have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities, surpassing human performance in various language tasks. As a result, many researchers have begun exploring their potential applications in the field of public opinion analysis. This study proposes a novel large-language-models-based method for public opinion event heat level prediction. First, we preprocessed and classified 62,836 Chinese hot event data collected between July 2022 and December 2023. Then, based on each event's online dissemination heat index, we used the MiniBatchKMeans algorithm to automatically cluster the events and categorize them into four heat levels (ranging from low heat to very high heat). Next, we randomly selected 250 events from each heat level, totalling 1,000 events, to build the evaluation dataset. During the evaluation process, we employed various large language models to assess their accuracy in predicting event heat levels in two scenarios: without reference cases and with similar case references. The results showed that GPT-4o and DeepseekV2 performed the best in the latter case, achieving prediction accuracies of 41.4% and 41.5%, respectively. Although the overall prediction accuracy remains relatively low, it is worth noting that for low-heat (Level 1) events, the prediction accuracies of these two models reached 73.6% and 70.4%, respectively. Additionally, the prediction accuracy showed a downward trend from Level 1 to Level 4, which correlates with the uneven distribution of data across the heat levels in the actual dataset. This suggests that with the more robust dataset, public opinion event heat level prediction based on large language models will have significant research potential for the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18548v1,2024-09

EmoPro: A Prompt Selection Strategy for Emotional Expression in LM-based Speech Synthesis,"Haoyu Wang, Chunyu Qiang, Tianrui Wang, Cheng Gong, Qiuyu Liu, Yu Jiang, Xiaobao Wang, Chenyang Wang, Chen Zhang","Recent advancements in speech synthesis models, trained on extensive datasets, have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities. These models can control content, timbre, and emotion in generated speech based on prompt inputs. Despite these advancements, the choice of prompts significantly impacts the output quality, yet most existing selection schemes do not adequately address the control of emotional intensity. To address this question, this paper proposes a two-stage prompt selection strategy EmoPro, which is specifically designed for emotionally controllable speech synthesis. This strategy focuses on selecting highly expressive and high-quality prompts by evaluating them from four perspectives: emotional expression strength, speech quality, text-emotion consistency, and model generation performance. Experimental results show that prompts selected using the proposed method result in more emotionally expressive and engaging synthesized speech compared to those obtained through baseline.

Do We Need Domain-Specific Embedding Models? An Empirical Investigation,"Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang","Embedding models play a crucial role in representing and retrieving information across various NLP applications. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have further enhanced the performance of embedding models, which are trained on massive amounts of text covering almost every domain. These models are often benchmarked on general-purpose datasets like Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), where they demonstrate superior performance. However, a critical question arises: Is the development of domain-specific embedding models necessary when general-purpose models are trained on vast corpora that already include specialized domain texts? In this paper, we empirically investigate this question, choosing the finance domain as an example. We introduce the Finance Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (FinMTEB), a counterpart to MTEB that consists of financial domain-specific text datasets. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art embedding models on FinMTEB and observe a significant performance drop compared to their performance on MTEB. To account for the possibility that this drop is driven by FinMTEB's higher complexity, we propose four measures to quantify dataset complexity and control for this factor in our analysis. Our analysis provides compelling evidence that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle to capture domain-specific linguistic and semantic patterns. Moreover, we find that the performance of general-purpose embedding models on MTEB is not correlated with their performance on FinMTEB, indicating the need for domain-specific embedding benchmarks for domain-specific embedding models. This study sheds light on developing domain-specific embedding models in the LLM era. FinMTEB comes with open-source code at https://github.com/yixuantt/FinMTEB",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18511v3,2024-09

Leveraging Long-Context Large Language Models for Multi-Document Understanding and Summarization in Enterprise Applications,"Aditi Godbole, Jabin Geevarghese George, Smita Shandilya","The rapid increase in unstructured data across various fields has made multi-document comprehension and summarization a critical task. Traditional approaches often fail to capture relevant context, maintain logical consistency, and extract essential information from lengthy documents. This paper explores the use of Long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-document summarization, demonstrating their exceptional capacity to grasp extensive connections, provide cohesive summaries, and adapt to various industry domains and integration with enterprise applications/systems. The paper discusses the workflow of multi-document summarization for effectively deploying long-context LLMs, supported by case studies in legal applications, enterprise functions such as HR, finance, and sourcing, as well as in the medical and news domains. These case studies show notable enhancements in both efficiency and accuracy. Technical obstacles, such as dataset diversity, model scalability, and ethical considerations like bias mitigation and factual accuracy, are carefully analyzed. Prospective research avenues are suggested to augment the functionalities and applications of long-context LLMs, establishing them as pivotal tools for transforming information processing across diverse sectors and enterprise applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18454v1,2024-09

To this end, we devise a series of experiments to explain the performance gap empirically. Our findings suggest that: (a) LLMs struggle with dataset demands of closed domains such as retrieving long answer spans; (b) Certain LLMs, despite showing strong overall performance, display weaknesses in meeting basic requirements as discriminating between domain-specific senses of words which we link to pre-processing decisions; (c) Scaling model parameters is not always effective for cross domain generalization; and (d) Closed-domain datasets are quantitatively much different than open-domain EQA datasets and current LLMs struggle to deal with them.

Aiming to address this limitation, we present Easy2Hard-Bench, a consistently formatted collection of 6 benchmark datasets spanning various domains, such as mathematics and programming problems, chess puzzles, and reasoning questions. Each problem within these datasets is annotated with numerical difficulty scores. To systematically estimate problem difficulties, we collect abundant performance data on attempts to each problem by humans in the real world or LLMs on the prominent leaderboard. Leveraging the rich performance data, we apply well-established difficulty ranking systems, such as Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2 models, to uniformly assign numerical difficulty scores to problems.

Improving Multilingual ASR in the Wild Using Simple N-best Re-ranking,"Brian Yan, Vineel Pratap, Shinji Watanabe, Michael Auli","Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are typically evaluated in a setting where the ground-truth language of the speech utterance is known, however, this is often not the case for most practical settings. Automatic Spoken Language Identification (SLID) models are not perfect and misclassifications have a substantial impact on the final ASR accuracy. In this paper, we present a simple and effective N-best re-ranking approach to improve multilingual ASR accuracy for several prominent acoustic models by employing external features such as language models and text-based language identification models.

VickreyFeedback: Cost-efficient Data Construction for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback,"Guoxi Zhang, Jiuding Duan","This paper addresses the cost-efficiency aspect of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over outputs of large language models (LLM)s to instill human expectations into LLMs. Although preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic utility of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What exacerbates this situation is that, given complex intransitive or cyclic relationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs are still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe cost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data accumulate over time. In this paper, we discuss the fine-tuning of LLMs as a monetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency of preference data collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an auction mechanism can play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency of RLHF, while maintaining satisfactory model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed auction-based protocol is cost-effective for fine-tuning LLMs concentrating on high-quality feedback.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18417v2,2024-09
SciDFM: A Large Language Model with Mixture-of-Experts for Science,"Liangtai Sun, Danyu Luo, Da Ma, Zihan Zhao, Baocai Chen, Zhennan Shen, Su Zhu, Lu Chen, Xin Chen, Kai Yu","Recently, there has been a significant upsurge of interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist scientific discovery. However, most LLMs only focus on general science, while they lack domain-specific knowledge, such as chemical molecules and amino acid sequences. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SciDFM, a mixture-of-experts LLM, which is trained from scratch and is able to conduct college-level scientific reasoning and understand molecules and amino acid sequences. We collect a large-scale training corpus containing numerous scientific papers and books from different disciplines as well as data from domain-specific databases. We further fine-tune the pre-trained model on lots of instruction data to improve performances on downstream benchmarks. From experiment results, we show that SciDFM achieves strong performance on general scientific benchmarks such as SciEval and SciQ, and it reaches a SOTA performance on domain-specific benchmarks among models of similar size. We further analyze the expert layers and show that the results of expert selection vary with data from different disciplines.

Defect Prediction with Content-based Features,"Hung Viet Pham, Tung Thanh Nguyen","Traditional defect prediction approaches often use metrics that measure the complexity of the design or implementing code of a software system, such as the number of lines of code in a source file. In this paper, we explore a different approach based on content of source code. Our key assumption is that source code of a software system contains information about its technical aspects and those aspects might have different levels of defect-proneness. Thus, content-based features such as words, topics, data types, and package names extracted from a source code file could be used to predict its defects. We have performed an extensive empirical evaluation and found that: i) such content-based features have higher predictive power than code complexity metrics and ii) the use of feature selection, reduction, and combination further improves the prediction performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18365v1,2024-09
LCMDC: Large-scale Chinese Medical Dialogue Corpora for Automatic Triage and Medical Consultation,"Xinyuan Wang, Haozhou Li, Dingfang Zheng, Qinke Peng","The global COVID-19 pandemic underscored major deficiencies in traditional healthcare systems, hastening the advancement of online medical services, especially in medical triage and consultation. However, existing studies face two main challenges. First, the scarcity of large-scale, publicly available, domain-specific medical datasets due to privacy concerns, with current datasets being small and limited to a few diseases, limiting the effectiveness of triage methods based on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Second, existing methods lack medical knowledge and struggle to accurately understand professional terms and expressions in patient-doctor consultations. To overcome these obstacles, we construct the Large-scale Chinese Medical Dialogue Corpora (LCMDC), comprising a Coarse-grained Triage dataset with 439,630 samples, a Fine-grained Diagnosis dataset with 199,600 samples, and a Medical Consultation dataset with 472,418 items, thereby addressing the data shortage in this field. Moreover, we further propose a novel triage system that combines BERT-based supervised learning with prompt learning, as well as a GPT-based medical consultation model using reinforcement learning.

A Generalized LLM-Augmented BIM Framework: Application to a Speech-to-BIM system,"Ghang Lee, Suhyung Jang, Seokho Hyun","Performing building information modeling (BIM) tasks is a complex process that imposes a steep learning curve and a heavy cognitive load due to the necessity of remembering sequences of numerous commands. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), it is foreseeable that BIM tasks, including querying and managing BIM data, 4D and 5D BIM, design compliance checking, or authoring a design, using written or spoken natural language (i.e., text-to-BIM or speech-to-BIM), will soon supplant traditional graphical user interfaces. This paper proposes a generalized LLM-augmented BIM framework to expedite the development of LLM-enhanced BIM applications by providing a step-by-step development process. The proposed framework consists of six steps: interpret-fill-match-structure-execute-check.

AER-LLM: Ambiguity-aware Emotion Recognition Leveraging Large Language Models,"Xin Hong, Yuan Gong, Vidhyasaharan Sethu, Ting Dang","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great success in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In addition to their cognitive intelligence, exploring their capabilities in emotional intelligence is also crucial, as it enables more natural and empathetic conversational AI. Recent studies have shown LLMs' capability in recognizing emotions, but they often focus on single emotion labels and overlook the complex and ambiguous nature of human emotions. This study is the first to address this gap by exploring the potential of LLMs in recognizing ambiguous emotions, leveraging their strong generalization capabilities and in-context learning. We design zero-shot and few-shot prompting and incorporate past dialogue as context information for ambiguous emotion recognition. Experiments conducted using three datasets indicate significant potential for LLMs in recognizing ambiguous emotions, and highlight the substantial benefits of including context information. Furthermore, our findings indicate that LLMs demonstrate a high degree of effectiveness in recognizing less ambiguous emotions and exhibit potential for identifying more ambiguous emotions, paralleling human perceptual capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18339v1,2024-09
A Fairness-Driven Method for Learning Human-Compatible Negotiation Strategies,"Ryan Shea, Zhou Yu","Despite recent advancements in AI and NLP, negotiation remains a difficult domain for AI agents. Traditional game theoretic approaches that have worked well for two-player zero-sum games struggle in the context of negotiation due to their inability to learn human-compatible strategies. On the other hand, approaches that only use human data tend to be domain-specific and lack the theoretical guarantees provided by strategies grounded in game theory. Motivated by the notion of fairness as a criterion for optimality in general sum games, we propose a negotiation framework called FDHC which incorporates fairness into both the reward design and search to learn human-compatible negotiation strategies. Our method includes a novel, RL+search technique called LGM-Zero which leverages a pre-trained language model to retrieve human-compatible offers from large action spaces. Our results show that our method is able to achieve more egalitarian negotiation outcomes and improve negotiation quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18335v1,2024-09
Development and Validation of a Dynamic-Template-Constrained Large Language Model for Generating Fully-Structured Radiology Reports,"Chuang Niu, Parisa Kaviani, Qing Lyu, Mannudeep K. Kalra, Christopher T. Whitlow, Ge Wang","Current LLMs for creating fully-structured reports face the challenges of formatting errors, content hallucinations, and privacy leakage issues when uploading data to external servers.We aim to develop an open-source, accurate LLM for creating fully-structured and standardized LCS reports from varying free-text reports across institutions and demonstrate its utility in automatic statistical analysis and individual lung nodule retrieval. With IRB approvals, our retrospective study included 5,442 de-identified LDCT LCS radiology reports from two institutions. We constructed two evaluation datasets by labeling 500 pairs of free-text and fully-structured radiology reports and one large-scale consecutive dataset from January 2021 to December 2023. Two radiologists created a standardized template for recording 27 lung nodule features on LCS. We designed a dynamic-template-constrained decoding method to enhance existing LLMs for creating fully-structured reports from free-text radiology reports. Using consecutive structured reports, we automated descriptive statistical analyses and a nodule retrieval prototype. Our best LLM for creating fully-structured reports achieved high performance on cross-institutional datasets with an F1 score of about 97%, with neither formatting errors nor content hallucinations. Our method consistently improved the best open-source LLMs by up to 10.42%, and outperformed GPT-4o by 17.19%. The automatically derived statistical distributions were consistent with prior findings regarding attenuation, location, size, stability, and Lung-RADS. The retrieval system with structured reports allowed flexible nodule-level search and complex statistical analysis.

Realistic Evaluation of Model Merging for Compositional Generalization,"Derek Tam, Yash Kant, Brian Lester, Igor Gilitschenski, Colin Raffel","Merging has become a widespread way to cheaply combine individual models into a single model that inherits their capabilities and attains better performance. This popularity has spurred rapid development of many new merging methods, which are typically validated in disparate experimental settings and frequently differ in the assumptions made about model architecture, data availability, and computational budget. In this work, we characterize the relative merits of different merging methods by evaluating them in a shared experimental setting and precisely identifying the practical requirements of each method. Specifically, our setting focuses on using merging for compositional generalization of capabilities in image classification, image generation, and natural language processing. Additionally, we measure the computational costs of different merging methods as well as how they perform when scaling the number of models being merged. Taken together, our results clarify the state of the field of model merging and provide a comprehensive and rigorous experimental setup to test new methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18314v1,2024-09
Advancing Object Detection in Transportation with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): A Comprehensive Review and Empirical Testing,"Huthaifa I. Ashqar, Ahmed Jaber, Taqwa I. Alhadidi, Mohammed Elhenawy","This study aims to comprehensively review and empirically evaluate the application of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and Large Vision Models (VLMs) in object detection for transportation systems. In the first fold, we provide a background about the potential benefits of MLLMs in transportation applications and conduct a comprehensive review of current MLLM technologies in previous studies. We highlight their effectiveness and limitations in object detection within various transportation scenarios. The second fold involves providing an overview of the taxonomy of end-to-end object detection in transportation applications and future directions. Building on this, we proposed empirical analysis for testing MLLMs on three real-world transportation problems that include object detection tasks namely, road safety attributes extraction, safety-critical event detection, and visual reasoning of thermal images. Our findings provide a detailed assessment of MLLM performance, uncovering both strengths and areas for improvement. Finally, we discuss practical limitations and challenges of MLLMs in enhancing object detection in transportation, thereby offering a roadmap for future research and development in this critical area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18286v1,2024-09
DisGeM: Distractor Generation for Multiple Choice Questions with Span Masking,"Devrim Cavusoglu, Secil Sen, Ulas Sert","Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have impacted numerous sub-fields such as natural language generation, natural language inference, question answering, and more. However, in the field of question generation, the creation of distractors for multiple-choice questions (MCQ) remains a challenging task. In this work, we present a simple, generic framework for distractor generation using readily available Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Unlike previous methods, our framework relies solely on pre-trained language models and does not require additional training on specific datasets. Building upon previous research, we introduce a two-stage framework consisting of candidate generation and candidate selection. Our proposed distractor generation framework outperforms previous methods without the need for training or fine-tuning. Human evaluations confirm that our approach produces more effective and engaging distractors.

MMMT-IF: A Challenging Multimodal Multi-Turn Instruction Following Benchmark,"Elliot L. Epstein, Kaisheng Yao, Jing Li, Xinyi Bai, Hamid Palangi","Evaluating instruction following capabilities for multimodal, multi-turn dialogue is challenging. With potentially multiple instructions in the input model context, the task is time-consuming for human raters and we show LLM based judges are biased towards answers from the same model. We propose MMMT-IF, an image based multi-turn Q$\&$A evaluation set with added global instructions between questions, constraining the answer format. This challenges models to retrieve instructions dispersed across long dialogues and reason under instruction constraints. All instructions are objectively verifiable through code execution. We introduce the Programmatic Instruction Following ($\operatorname{PIF}$) metric to measure the fraction of the instructions that are correctly followed while performing a reasoning task. The $\operatorname{PIF-N-K}$ set of metrics further evaluates robustness by measuring the fraction of samples in a corpus where, for each sample, at least K out of N generated model responses achieve a $\operatorname{PIF}$ score of one. The $\operatorname{PIF}$ metric aligns with human instruction following ratings, showing 60 percent correlation. Experiments show Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, have a $\operatorname{PIF}$ metric that drops from 0.81 on average at turn 1 across the models, to 0.64 at turn 20. Across all turns, when each response is repeated 4 times ($\operatorname{PIF-4-4}$), GPT-4o and Gemini successfully follow all instructions only $11\%$ of the time. When all the instructions are also appended to the end of the model input context, the $\operatorname{PIF}$ metric improves by 22.3 points on average, showing that the challenge with the task lies not only in following the instructions, but also in retrieving the instructions spread out in the model context. We plan to open source the MMMT-IF dataset and metric computation code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18216v1,2024-09
AI Policy Projector: Grounding LLM Policy Design in Iterative Mapmaking,"Michelle S. Lam, Fred Hohman, Dominik Moritz, Jeffrey P. Bigham, Kenneth Holstein, Mary Beth Kery","Whether a large language model policy is an explicit constitution or an implicit reward model, it is challenging to assess coverage over the unbounded set of real-world situations that a policy must contend with. We introduce an AI policy design process inspired by mapmaking, which has developed tactics for visualizing and iterating on maps even when full coverage is not possible. With Policy Projector, policy designers can survey the landscape of model input-output pairs, define custom regions (e.g., ""violence""), and navigate these regions with rules that can be applied to LLM outputs (e.g., if output contains ""violence"" and ""graphic details,"" then rewrite without ""graphic details""). Policy Projector supports interactive policy authoring using LLM classification and steering and a map visualization reflecting the policy designer's work. In an evaluation with 12 AI safety experts, our system helps policy designers to address problematic model behaviors extending beyond an existing, comprehensive harm taxonomy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18203v1,2024-09
LangSAMP: Language-Script Aware Multilingual Pretraining,"Yihong Liu, Haotian Ye, Chunlan Ma, Mingyang Wang, Hinrich Schütze","Recent multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) often avoid using language embeddings -- learnable vectors assigned to different languages. These embeddings are discarded for two main reasons: (1) mPLMs are expected to have a single, unified parameter set across all languages, and (2) they need to function seamlessly as universal text encoders without requiring language IDs as input. However, this removal increases the burden on token embeddings to encode all language-specific information, which may hinder the model's ability to produce more language-neutral representations. To address this challenge, we propose Language-Script Aware Multilingual Pretraining (LangSAMP), a method that incorporates both language and script embeddings to enhance representation learning while maintaining a simple architecture. Specifically, we integrate these embeddings into the output of the transformer blocks before passing the final representations to the language modeling head for prediction. We apply LangSAMP to the continual pretraining of XLM-R on a highly multilingual corpus covering more than 500 languages. The resulting model consistently outperforms the baseline. Extensive analysis further shows that language/script embeddings encode language/script-specific information, which improves the selection of source languages for crosslingual transfer. We make our code and models publicly available at \url{https://github.com/cisnlp/LangSAMP}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18199v1,2024-09
Exploring LLM-Driven Explanations for Quantum Algorithms,"Giordano d'Aloisio, Sophie Fortz, Carol Hanna, Daniel Fortunato, Avner Bensoussan, Eñaut Mendiluze Usandizaga, Federica Sarro","Background: Quantum computing is a rapidly growing new programming paradigm that brings significant changes to the design and implementation of algorithms. Understanding quantum algorithms requires knowledge of physics and mathematics, which can be challenging for software developers.   Aims: In this work, we provide a first analysis of how LLMs can support developers' understanding of quantum code. Method: We empirically analyse and compare the quality of explanations provided by three widely adopted LLMs (Gpt3.5, Llama2, and Tinyllama) using two different human-written prompt styles for seven state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. We also analyse how consistent LLM explanations are over multiple rounds and how LLMs can improve existing descriptions of quantum algorithms.   Results: Llama2 provides the highest quality explanations from scratch, while Gpt3.5 emerged as the LLM best suited to improve existing explanations. In addition, we show that adding a small amount of context to the prompt significantly improves the quality of explanations. Finally, we observe how explanations are qualitatively and syntactically consistent over multiple rounds.   Conclusions: This work highlights promising results, and opens challenges for future research in the field of LLMs for quantum code explanation. Future work includes refining the methods through prompt optimisation and parsing of quantum code explanations, as well as carrying out a systematic assessment of the quality of explanations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19028v1,2024-09
GrEmLIn: A Repository of Green Baseline Embeddings for 87 Low-Resource Languages Injected with Multilingual Graph Knowledge,"Daniil Gurgurov, Rishu Kumar, Simon Ostermann","Contextualized embeddings based on large language models (LLMs) are available for various languages, but their coverage is often limited for lower resourced languages. Using LLMs for such languages is often difficult due to a high computational cost; not only during training, but also during inference. Static word embeddings are much more resource-efficient (""green""), and thus still provide value, particularly for very low-resource languages. There is, however, a notable lack of comprehensive repositories with such embeddings for diverse languages. To address this gap, we present GrEmLIn, a centralized repository of green, static baseline embeddings for 87 mid- and low-resource languages. We compute GrEmLIn embeddings with a novel method that enhances GloVe embeddings by integrating multilingual graph knowledge, which makes our static embeddings competitive with LLM representations, while being parameter-free at inference time. Our experiments demonstrate that GrEmLIn embeddings outperform state-of-the-art contextualized embeddings from E5 on the task of lexical similarity. They remain competitive in extrinsic evaluation tasks like sentiment analysis and natural language inference, with average performance gaps of just 5-10\% or less compared to state-of-the-art models, given a sufficient vocabulary overlap with the target task, and underperform only on topic classification. Our code and embeddings are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/DFKI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18193v2,2024-09

Open-World Evaluation for Retrieving Diverse Perspectives,"Hung-Ting Chen, Eunsol Choi","We study retrieving a set of documents that covers various perspectives on a complex and contentious question (e.g., will ChatGPT do more harm than good?). We curate a Benchmark for Retrieval Diversity for Subjective questions (BERDS), where each example consists of a question and diverse perspectives associated with the question, sourced from survey questions and debate websites. On this data, retrievers paired with a corpus are evaluated to surface a document set that contains diverse perspectives. Our framing diverges from most retrieval tasks in that document relevancy cannot be decided by simple string matches to references. Instead, we build a language model based automatic evaluator that decides whether each retrieved document contains a perspective. This allows us to evaluate the performance of three different types of corpus (Wikipedia, web snapshot, and corpus constructed on the fly with retrieved pages from the search engine) paired with retrievers. Retrieving diverse documents remains challenging, with the outputs from existing retrievers covering all perspectives on only 33.74% of the examples. We further study the impact of query expansion and diversity-focused reranking approaches and analyze retriever sycophancy. Together, we lay the foundation for future studies in retrieval diversity handling complex queries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18110v1,2024-09

This paper introduces an easy-to-use, extensible, and scale-flexible open-source data preparation toolkit called Data Prep Kit (DPK). DPK is architected and designed to enable users to scale their data preparation to their needs. With DPK they can prepare data on a local machine or effortlessly scale to run on a cluster with thousands of CPU Cores. DPK comes with a highly scalable, yet extensible set of modules that transform natural language and code data. If the user needs additional transforms, they can be easily developed using extensive DPK support for transform creation. These modules can be used independently or pipelined to perform a series of operations. In this paper, we describe DPK architecture and show its performance from a small scale to a very large number of CPUs. The modules from DPK have been used for the preparation of Granite Models [1] [2]. We believe DPK is a valuable contribution to the AI community to easily prepare data to enhance the performance of their LLM models or to fine-tune models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18164v2,2024-09
Infer Human's Intentions Before Following Natural Language Instructions,"Yanming Wan, Yue Wu, Yiping Wang, Jiayuan Mao, Natasha Jaques","For AI agents to be helpful to humans, they should be able to follow natural language instructions to complete everyday cooperative tasks in human environments. However, real human instructions inherently possess ambiguity, because the human speakers assume sufficient prior knowledge about their hidden goals and intentions. Standard language grounding and planning methods fail to address such ambiguities because they do not model human internal goals as additional partially observable factors in the environment. We propose a new framework, Follow Instructions with Social and Embodied Reasoning (FISER), aiming for better natural language instruction following in collaborative embodied tasks. Our framework makes explicit inferences about human goals and intentions as intermediate reasoning steps. We implement a set of Transformer-based models and evaluate them over a challenging benchmark, HandMeThat. We empirically demonstrate that using social reasoning to explicitly infer human intentions before making action plans surpasses purely end-to-end approaches. We also compare our implementation with strong baselines, including Chain of Thought prompting on the largest available pre-trained language models, and find that FISER provides better performance on the embodied social reasoning tasks under investigation, reaching the state-of-the-art on HandMeThat.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18073v1,2024-09
IFCap: Image-like Retrieval and Frequency-based Entity Filtering for Zero-shot Captioning,"Soeun Lee, Si-Woo Kim, Taewhan Kim, Dong-Jin Kim","Recent advancements in image captioning have explored text-only training methods to overcome the limitations of paired image-text data. However, existing text-only training methods often overlook the modality gap between using text data during training and employing images during inference. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Image-like Retrieval, which aligns text features with visually relevant features to mitigate the modality gap. Our method further enhances the accuracy of generated captions by designing a Fusion Module that integrates retrieved captions with input features. Additionally, we introduce a Frequency-based Entity Filtering technique that significantly improves caption quality. We integrate these methods into a unified framework, which we refer to as IFCap ($\textbf{I}$mage-like Retrieval and $\textbf{F}$requency-based Entity Filtering for Zero-shot $\textbf{Cap}$tioning). Through extensive experimentation, our straightforward yet powerful approach has demonstrated its efficacy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in both image captioning and video captioning compared to zero-shot captioning based on text-only training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18046v1,2024-09
Unveiling the Role of Pretraining in Direct Speech Translation,"Belen Alastruey, Gerard I. Gállego, Marta R. Costa-jussà","Direct speech-to-text translation systems encounter an important drawback in data scarcity. A common solution consists on pretraining the encoder on automatic speech recognition, hence losing efficiency in the training process. In this study, we compare the training dynamics of a system using a pretrained encoder, the conventional approach, and one trained from scratch. We observe that, throughout the training, the randomly initialized model struggles to incorporate information from the speech inputs for its predictions. Hence, we hypothesize that this issue stems from the difficulty of effectively training an encoder for direct speech translation. While a model trained from scratch needs to learn acoustic and semantic modeling simultaneously, a pretrained one can just focus on the latter. Based on these findings, we propose a subtle change in the decoder cross-attention to integrate source information from earlier steps in training. We show that with this change, the model trained from scratch can achieve comparable performance to the pretrained one, while reducing the training time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18044v1,2024-09

Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for the speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or even without vision-understanding abilities. To address this gap, we propose EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech capabilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we notice surprisingly that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the corresponding bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is proposed for flexible speech style controls (e.g., emotions and pitches). For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18042v2,2024-09
Automated Detection and Analysis of Power Words in Persuasive Text Using Natural Language Processing,Sahil Garje,"Power words are terms that evoke strong emotional responses and significantly influence readers' behavior, playing a crucial role in fields like marketing, politics, and motivational writing.

A specialized Python package, The Text Monger, is created and employed to identify the presence and frequency of power words within a given text. By analyzing diverse datasets, including fictional excerpts, speeches, and marketing materials,the aim is to classify and assess the impact of power words on sentiment and reader engagement.

Compositional Hardness of Code in Large Language Models -- A Probabilistic Perspective,"Yotam Wolf, Binyamin Rothberg, Dorin Shteyman, Amnon Shashua","A common practice in large language model (LLM) usage for complex analytical tasks such as code generation, is to sample a solution for the entire task within the model's context window. Previous works have shown that subtask decomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial for solving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to perform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context hardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed problem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is quantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM generations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gap between the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within the same context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increases exponentially with the solution's length. We prove our results theoretically and demonstrate them empirically.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18028v2,2024-09
An Adversarial Perspective on Machine Unlearning for AI Safety,"Jakub Łucki, Boyi Wei, Yangsibo Huang, Peter Henderson, Florian Tramèr, Javier Rando","Large language models are finetuned to refuse questions about hazardous knowledge, but these protections can often be bypassed. Unlearning methods aim at completely removing hazardous capabilities from models and make them inaccessible to adversaries. This work challenges the fundamental differences between unlearning and traditional safety post-training from an adversarial perspective. We demonstrate that existing jailbreak methods, previously reported as ineffective against unlearning, can be successful when applied carefully. Furthermore, we develop a variety of adaptive methods that recover most supposedly unlearned capabilities. For instance, we show that finetuning on 10 unrelated examples or removing specific directions in the activation space can recover most hazardous capabilities for models edited with RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method. Our findings challenge the robustness of current unlearning approaches and question their advantages over safety training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18025v3,2024-09
DARE: Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation,"Hannah Sterz, Jonas Pfeiffer, Ivan Vulić","Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend remarkable capabilities of text-only large language models and vision-only models, and are able to learn from and process multi-modal vision-text input. While modern VLMs perform well on a number of standard image classification and image-text matching tasks, they still struggle with a number of crucial vision-language (VL) reasoning abilities such as counting and spatial reasoning. Moreover, while they might be very brittle to small variations in instructions and/or evaluation protocols, existing benchmarks fail to evaluate their robustness (or rather the lack of it). In order to couple challenging VL scenarios with comprehensive robustness evaluation, we introduce DARE, Diverse Visual Question Answering with Robustness Evaluation, a carefully created and curated multiple-choice VQA benchmark. DARE evaluates VLM performance on five diverse categories and includes four robustness-oriented evaluations based on the variations of: prompts, the subsets of answer options, the output format and the number of correct answers. Among a spectrum of other findings, we report that state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle with questions in most categories and are unable to consistently deliver their peak performance across the tested robustness evaluations. The worst case performance across the subsets of options is up to 34% below the performance in the standard case. The robustness of the open-source VLMs such as LLaVA 1.6 and Idefics2 cannot match the closed-source models such as GPT-4 and Gemini, but even the latter remain very brittle to different variations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18023v1,2024-09
Evaluating Multilingual Long-Context Models for Retrieval and Reasoning,"Ameeta Agrawal, Andy Dang, Sina Bagheri Nezhad, Rhitabrat Pokharel, Russell Scheinberg","Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in handling long contexts, some exhibiting near-perfect recall on synthetic retrieval tasks. However, these evaluations have mainly focused on English text and involved a single target sentence within lengthy contexts. Our work investigates how LLM performance generalizes to multilingual settings with multiple hidden target sentences. We create a new dataset -- mLongRR -- to comprehensively evaluate several multilingual long-context LLMs on retrieval and reasoning tasks across five languages: English, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Swahili, and Somali. These languages share the Latin script but belong to distinct language families and resource levels. Our analysis reveals a significant performance gap between languages. The best-performing models such as Gemini-1.5 and GPT-4o, achieve around 96% accuracy in English to around 36% in Somali with a single target sentence. However, this accuracy drops to 40% in English and 0% in Somali when dealing with three target sentences.

Extracting Affect Aggregates from Longitudinal Social Media Data with Temporal Adapters for Large Language Models,"Georg Ahnert, Max Pellert, David Garcia, Markus Strohmaier","This paper proposes temporally aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) as a tool for longitudinal analysis of social media data. We fine-tune Temporal Adapters for Llama 3 8B on full timelines from a panel of British Twitter users, and extract longitudinal aggregates of emotions and attitudes with established questionnaires. We focus our analysis on the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic that had a strong impact on public opinion and collective emotions. We validate our estimates against representative British survey data and find strong positive, significant correlations for several collective emotions. The obtained estimates are robust across multiple training seeds and prompt formulations, and in line with collective emotions extracted using a traditional classification model trained on labeled data. We demonstrate the flexibility of our method on questions of public opinion for which no pre-trained classifier is available.

BEATS: Optimizing LLM Mathematical Capabilities with BackVerify and Adaptive Disambiguate based Efficient Tree Search,"Linzhuang Sun, Hao Liang, Jingxuan Wei, Bihui Yu, Conghui He, Zenan Zhou, Wentao Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across a broad range of tasks and domains. However, they still encounter difficulties in solving mathematical problems due to the rigorous and logical nature of mathematics. Previous studies have employed techniques such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), prompt engineering, and search-based methods to improve the mathematical problem-solving abilities of LLMs. Despite these efforts, their performance remains suboptimal and demands substantial computational resources. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, BEATS, to enhance mathematical problem-solving abilities. Our method leverages newly designed prompts that guide the model to iteratively rewrite, advance by one step, and generate answers based on previous steps. Additionally, we introduce a new back-verification technique that uses LLMs to validate the correctness of the generated answers. Furthermore, we employ a pruning tree search to optimize search time while achieving strong performance. Notably, our method improves Qwen2-7b-Instruct's score from 36.94 to 61.52, outperforming GPT4's 42.5 on the MATH benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17972v2,2024-09
The Hard Positive Truth about Vision-Language Compositionality,"Amita Kamath, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Kai-Wei Chang, Ranjay Krishna","Several benchmarks have concluded that our best vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) are lacking in compositionality. Given an image, these benchmarks probe a model's ability to identify its associated caption amongst a set of compositional distractors. In response, a surge of recent proposals show improvements by finetuning CLIP with distractors as hard negatives. Our investigations reveal that these improvements have, in fact, been significantly overstated -- because existing benchmarks do not probe whether finetuned vision-language models remain invariant to hard positives. By curating an evaluation dataset with 112,382 hard negatives and hard positives, we uncover that including hard positives decreases CLIP's performance by 12.9%, while humans perform effortlessly at 99%. CLIP finetuned with hard negatives results in an even larger decrease, up to 38.7%. With this finding, we then produce a 1,775,259 image-text training set with both hard negative and hard positive captions. By training with both, we see improvements on existing benchmarks while simultaneously improving performance on hard positives, indicating a more robust improvement in compositionality. Our work suggests the need for future research to rigorously test and improve CLIP's understanding of semantic relationships between related ""positive"" concepts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17958v1,2024-09
Weak-to-Strong Backdoor Attack for Large Language Models,"Shuai Zhao, Leilei Gan, Zhongliang Guo, Xiaobao Wu, Luwei Xiao, Xiaoyu Xu, Cong-Duy Nguyen, Luu Anh Tuan","Despite being widely applied due to their exceptional capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. These attacks introduce targeted vulnerabilities into LLMs by poisoning training samples and full-parameter fine-tuning. However, this kind of backdoor attack is limited since they require significant computational resources, especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted parameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In this study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter challenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and improve the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel backdoor attack algorithm from weak to strong based on feature alignment-enhanced knowledge distillation (W2SAttack). Specifically, we poison small-scale language models through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the teacher model. The teacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student model through feature alignment-enhanced knowledge distillation, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that W2SAttack has the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We demonstrate the superior performance of W2SAttack on classification tasks across four language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different architectures of teacher models. Experimental results indicate success rates close to 100% for backdoor attacks targeting PEFT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17946v3,2024-09
On Translating Technical Terminology: A Translation Workflow for Machine-Translated Acronyms,"Richard Yue, John E. Ortega, Kenneth Ward Church","The typical workflow for a professional translator to translate a document from its source language (SL) to a target language (TL) is not always focused on what many language models in natural language processing (NLP) do - predict the next word in a series of words. While high-resource languages like English and French are reported to achieve near human parity using common metrics for measurement such as BLEU and COMET, we find that an important step is being missed: the translation of technical terms, specifically acronyms. Some state-of-the art machine translation systems like Google Translate which are publicly available can be erroneous when dealing with acronyms - as much as 50% in our findings. This article addresses acronym disambiguation for MT systems by proposing an additional step to the SL-TL (FR-EN) translation workflow where we first offer a new acronym corpus for public consumption and then experiment with a search-based thresholding algorithm that achieves nearly 10% increase when compared to Google Translate and OpusMT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17943v1,2024-09
Predicting Anchored Text from Translation Memories for Machine Translation Using Deep Learning Methods,"Richard Yue, John E. Ortega","Translation memories (TMs) are the backbone for professional translation tools called computer-aided translation (CAT) tools. In order to perform a translation using a CAT tool, a translator uses the TM to gather translations similar to the desired segment to translate (s'). Many CAT tools offer a fuzzy-match algorithm to locate segments (s) in the TM that are close in distance to s'. After locating two similar segments, the CAT tool will present parallel segments (s, t) that contain one segment in the source language along with its translation in the target language. Additionally, CAT tools contain fuzzy-match repair (FMR) techniques that will automatically use the parallel segments from the TM to create new TM entries containing a modified version of the original with the idea in mind that it will be the translation of s'. Most FMR techniques use machine translation as a way of ""repairing"" those words that have to be modified. In this article, we show that for a large part of those words which are anchored, we can use other techniques that are based on machine learning approaches such as Word2Vec. BERT, and even ChatGPT. Specifically, we show that for anchored words that follow the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) paradigm, Word2Vec, BERT, and GPT-4 can be used to achieve similar and, for some cases, better results than neural machine translation for translating anchored words from French to English.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17939v1,2024-09
The Lou Dataset -- Exploring the Impact of Gender-Fair Language in German Text Classification,"Andreas Waldis, Joel Birrer, Anne Lauscher, Iryna Gurevych","Gender-fair language, an evolving German linguistic variation, fosters inclusion by addressing all genders or using neutral forms. Nevertheless, there is a significant lack of resources to assess the impact of this linguistic shift on classification using language models (LMs), which are probably not trained on such variations. To address this gap, we present Lou, the first dataset featuring high-quality reformulations for German text classification covering seven tasks, like stance detection and toxicity classification. Evaluating 16 mono- and multi-lingual LMs on Lou shows that gender-fair language substantially impacts predictions by flipping labels, reducing certainty, and altering attention patterns. However, existing evaluations remain valid, as LM rankings of original and reformulated instances do not significantly differ. While we offer initial insights on the effect on German text classification, the findings likely apply to other languages, as consistent patterns were observed in multi-lingual and English LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17929v1,2024-09
Pioneering Reliable Assessment in Text-to-Image Knowledge Editing: Leveraging a Fine-Grained Dataset and an Innovative Criterion,"Hengrui Gu, Kaixiong Zhou, Yili Wang, Ruobing Wang, Xin Wang","During pre-training, the Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models encode factual knowledge into their parameters. These parameterized facts enable realistic image generation, but they may become obsolete over time, thereby misrepresenting the current state of the world. Knowledge editing techniques aim to update model knowledge in a targeted way. However, facing the dual challenges posed by inadequate editing datasets and unreliable evaluation criterion, the development of T2I knowledge editing encounter difficulties in effectively generalizing injected knowledge. In this work, we design a T2I knowledge editing framework by comprehensively spanning on three phases: First, we curate a dataset \textbf{CAKE}, comprising paraphrase and multi-object test, to enable more fine-grained assessment on knowledge generalization. Second, we propose a novel criterion, \textbf{adaptive CLIP threshold}, to effectively filter out false successful images under the current criterion and achieve reliable editing evaluation. Finally, we introduce \textbf{MPE}, a simple but effective approach for T2I knowledge editing. Instead of tuning parameters, MPE precisely recognizes and edits the outdated part of the conditioning text-prompt to accommodate the up-to-date knowledge. A straightforward implementation of MPE (Based on in-context learning) exhibits better overall performance than previous model editors. We hope these efforts can further promote faithful evaluation of T2I knowledge editing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17928v2,2024-09
Atlas-Chat: Adapting Large Language Models for Low-Resource Moroccan Arabic Dialect,"Guokan Shang, Hadi Abdine, Yousef Khoubrane, Amr Mohamed, Yassine Abbahaddou, Sofiane Ennadir, Imane Momayiz, Xuguang Ren, Eric Moulines, Preslav Nakov, Michalis Vazirgiannis, Eric Xing","We introduce Atlas-Chat, the first-ever collection of LLMs specifically developed for dialectal Arabic. Focusing on Moroccan Arabic, also known as Darija, we construct our instruction dataset by consolidating existing Darija language resources, creating novel datasets both manually and synthetically, and translating English instructions with stringent quality control. Atlas-Chat-2B, 9B, and 27B models, fine-tuned on the dataset, exhibit superior ability in following Darija instructions and performing standard NLP tasks. Notably, our models outperform both state-of-the-art and Arabic-specialized LLMs like LLaMa, Jais, and AceGPT, e.g., our 9B model gains a 13% performance boost over a larger 13B model on DarijaMMLU, in our newly introduced evaluation suite for Darija covering both discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, we perform an experimental analysis of various fine-tuning strategies and base model choices to determine optimal configurations. All our resources are publicly accessible, and we believe our work offers comprehensive design methodologies of instruction-tuning for low-resource languages, which are often neglected in favor of data-rich languages by contemporary LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17912v2,2024-09
Revisiting Acoustic Similarity in Emotional Speech and Music via Self-Supervised Representations,"Yujia Sun, Zeyu Zhao, Korin Richmond, Yuanchao Li","Emotion recognition from speech and music shares similarities due to their acoustic overlap, which has led to interest in transferring knowledge between these domains. However, the shared acoustic cues between speech and music, particularly those encoded by Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models, remain largely unexplored, given the fact that SSL models for speech and music have rarely been applied in cross-domain research. In this work, we revisit the acoustic similarity between emotion speech and music, starting with an analysis of the layerwise behavior of SSL models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Music Emotion Recognition (MER). Furthermore, we perform cross-domain adaptation by comparing several approaches in a two-stage fine-tuning process, examining effective ways to utilize music for SER and speech for MER. Lastly, we explore the acoustic similarities between emotional speech and music using Frechet audio distance for individual emotions, uncovering the issue of emotion bias in both speech and music SSL models. Our findings reveal that while speech and music SSL models do capture shared acoustic features, their behaviors can vary depending on different emotions due to their training strategies and domain-specificities. Additionally, parameter-efficient fine-tuning can enhance SER and MER performance by leveraging knowledge from each other. This study provides new insights into the acoustic similarity between emotional speech and music, and highlights the potential for cross-domain generalization to improve SER and MER systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17899v1,2024-09

PEDRO: Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning with Prompt DEpenDent Representation MOdification,"Tianfang Xie, Tianjing Li, Wei Zhu, Wei Han, Yi Zhao","Due to their substantial sizes, large language models (LLMs) are typically deployed within a single-backbone multi-tenant framework. In this setup, a single instance of an LLM backbone must cater to multiple users or tasks through the application of various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) models. Despite the availability of numerous effective PEFT techniques such as LoRA, there remains a need for a PEFT approach that achieves both high efficiency during inference and competitive performance on downstream tasks. In this research, we introduce a new and straightforward PEFT methodology named \underline{P}rompt D\underline{E}pen\underline{D}ent \underline{R}epresentation M\underline{O}dification (PEDRO). The proposed method involves integrating a lightweight vector generator into each Transformer layer, which generates vectors contingent upon the input prompts. These vectors then modify the hidden representations created by the LLM through a dot product operation, thereby influencing the semantic output and generated content of the model. Extensive experimentation across a variety of tasks indicates that: (a) PEDRO surpasses recent PEFT benchmarks when using a similar number of tunable parameters. (b) Under the single-backbone multi-tenant deployment model, PEDRO exhibits superior efficiency compared to LoRA, indicating significant industrial potential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17834v1,2024-09

Key features include contextual awareness, multi-language support, and enhanced debugging and optimization functionalities. By examining these aspects, we illustrate how Llama can serve as a versatile tool for developers of all skill levels, improving productivity and efficiency in software development. The potential implications for education, industry, and the future of coding practices are also discussed, underscoring the transformative impact of AI in programming. Experimentation shows that while Llama 3.1 405B performs well with simple algorithmic and data structure based problems, it still struggles with problems on Quantum Computing, Bioinformatics, and Artificial Intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19027v1,2024-09
"BeanCounter: A low-toxicity, large-scale, and open dataset of business-oriented text","Siyan Wang, Bradford Levy","Many of the recent breakthroughs in language modeling have resulted from scaling effectively the same model architecture to larger datasets. In this vein, recent work has highlighted performance gains from increasing training dataset size and quality, suggesting a need for novel sources of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce BeanCounter, a public dataset consisting of more than 159B tokens extracted from businesses' disclosures. We show that this data is indeed novel: less than 0.1% of BeanCounter appears in Common Crawl-based datasets and it is an order of magnitude larger than datasets relying on similar sources. Given the data's provenance, we hypothesize that BeanCounter is comparatively more factual and less toxic than web-based datasets. Exploring this hypothesis, we find that many demographic identities occur with similar prevalence in BeanCounter but with significantly less toxic context relative to other datasets. To demonstrate the utility of BeanCounter, we evaluate and compare two LLMs continually pre-trained on BeanCounter with their base models. We find an 18-33% reduction in toxic generation and improved performance within the finance domain for the continually pretrained models. Collectively, our work suggests that BeanCounter is a novel source of low-toxicity and high-quality domain-specific data with sufficient scale to train multi-billion parameter LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17827v2,2024-09
Inference-Time Language Model Alignment via Integrated Value Guidance,"Zhixuan Liu, Zhanhui Zhou, Yuanfu Wang, Chao Yang, Yu Qiao","Large language models are typically fine-tuned to align with human preferences, but tuning large models is computationally intensive and complex. In this work, we introduce $\textit{Integrated Value Guidance}$ (IVG), a method that uses implicit and explicit value functions to guide language model decoding at token and chunk-level respectively, efficiently aligning large language models purely at inference time. This approach circumvents the complexities of direct fine-tuning and outperforms traditional methods. Empirically, we demonstrate the versatility of IVG across various tasks. In controlled sentiment generation and summarization tasks, our method significantly improves the alignment of large models using inference-time guidance from $\texttt{gpt2}$-based value functions. Moreover, in a more challenging instruction-following benchmark AlpacaEval 2.0, we show that both specifically tuned and off-the-shelf value functions greatly improve the length-controlled win rates of large models against $\texttt{gpt-4-turbo}$ (e.g., $19.51\% \rightarrow 26.51\%$ for $\texttt{Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2}$ and $25.58\% \rightarrow 33.75\%$ for $\texttt{Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1}$ with Tulu guidance).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17819v1,2024-09
Self-supervised Preference Optimization: Enhance Your Language Model with Preference Degree Awareness,"Jian Li, Haojing Huang, Yujia Zhang, Pengfei Xu, Xi Chen, Rui Song, Lida Shi, Jingwen Wang, Hao Xu","Recently, there has been significant interest in replacing the reward model in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants. These approaches commonly use a binary cross-entropy mechanism on pairwise samples, i.e., minimizing and maximizing the loss based on preferred or dis-preferred responses, respectively. However, while this training strategy omits the reward model, it also overlooks the varying preference degrees within different responses. We hypothesize that this is a key factor hindering LLMs from sufficiently understanding human preferences. To address this problem, we propose a novel Self-supervised Preference Optimization (SPO) framework, which constructs a self-supervised preference degree loss combined with the alignment loss, thereby helping LLMs improve their ability to understand the degree of preference. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely used datasets of different tasks. The results demonstrate that SPO can be seamlessly integrated with existing preference optimization methods and significantly boost their performance to achieve state-of-the-art performance. We also conduct detailed analyses to offer comprehensive insights into SPO, which verifies its effectiveness.

Faithfulness and the Notion of Adversarial Sensitivity in NLP Explanations,"Supriya Manna, Niladri Sett","Faithfulness is arguably the most critical metric to assess the reliability of explainable AI. In NLP, current methods for faithfulness evaluation are fraught with discrepancies and biases, often failing to capture the true reasoning of models. We introduce Adversarial Sensitivity as a novel approach to faithfulness evaluation, focusing on the explainer's response when the model is under adversarial attack. Our method accounts for the faithfulness of explainers by capturing sensitivity to adversarial input changes. This work addresses significant limitations in existing evaluation techniques, and furthermore, quantifies faithfulness from a crucial yet underexplored paradigm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17774v2,2024-09
Integrating Hierarchical Semantic into Iterative Generation Model for Entailment Tree Explanation,"Qin Wang, Jianzhou Feng, Yiming Xu","Manifestly and logically displaying the line of reasoning from evidence to answer is significant to explainable question answering (QA). The entailment tree exhibits the lines structurally, which is different from the self-explanation principle in large-scale language models. Existing methods rarely consider the semantic association of sentences between and within hierarchies within the tree structure, which is prone to apparent mistakes in combinations. In this work, we propose an architecture of integrating the Hierarchical Semantics of sentences under the framework of Controller-Generator (HiSCG) to explain answers. The HiSCG designs a hierarchical mapping between hypotheses and facts, discriminates the facts involved in tree constructions, and optimizes single-step entailments. To the best of our knowledge, We are the first to notice hierarchical semantics of sentences between the same layer and adjacent layers to yield improvements. The proposed method achieves comparable performance on all three settings of the EntailmentBank dataset. The generalization results on two out-of-domain datasets also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17757v1,2024-09
SECURE: Semantics-aware Embodied Conversation under Unawareness for Lifelong Robot Learning,"Rimvydas Rubavicius, Peter David Fagan, Alex Lascarides, Subramanian Ramamoorthy","This paper addresses a challenging interactive task learning scenario we call rearrangement under unawareness: to manipulate a rigid-body environment in a context where the robot is unaware of a concept that's key to solving the instructed task. We propose SECURE, an interactive task learning framework designed to solve such problems by fixing a deficient domain model using embodied conversation. Through dialogue, the robot discovers and then learns to exploit unforeseen possibilities. Using SECURE, the robot not only learns from the user's corrective feedback when it makes a mistake, but it also learns to make strategic dialogue decisions for revealing useful evidence about novel concepts for solving the instructed task. Together, these abilities allow the robot to generalise to subsequent tasks using newly acquired knowledge. We demonstrate that a robot that is semantics-aware -- that is, it exploits the logical consequences of both sentence and discourse semantics in the learning and inference process -- learns to solve rearrangement under unawareness more effectively than a robot that lacks such capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17755v1,2024-09
Are Transformers in Pre-trained LM A Good ASR Encoder? An Empirical Study,"Keyu An, Shiliang Zhang, Zhijie Yan","In this study, we delve into the efficacy of transformers within pre-trained language models (PLMs) when repurposed as encoders for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Our underlying hypothesis posits that, despite being initially trained on text-based corpora, these transformers possess a remarkable capacity to extract effective features from the input sequence. This inherent capability, we argue, is transferrable to speech data, thereby augmenting the acoustic modeling ability of ASR. Through rigorous empirical analysis, our findings reveal a notable improvement in Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) across diverse ASR tasks when transformers from pre-trained LMs are incorporated. Particularly, they serve as an advantageous starting point for initializing ASR encoders. Furthermore, we uncover that these transformers, when integrated into a well-established ASR encoder, can significantly boost performance, especially in scenarios where profound semantic comprehension is pivotal. This underscores the potential of leveraging the semantic prowess embedded within pre-trained transformers to advance ASR systems' capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17750v1,2024-09
Few-shot Prompting for Pairwise Ranking: An Effective Non-Parametric Retrieval Model,"Nilanjan Sinhababu, Andrew Parry, Debasis Ganguly, Debasis Samanta, Pabitra Mitra","A supervised ranking model, despite its advantage of being effective, usually involves complex processing - typically multiple stages of task-specific pre-training and fine-tuning. This has motivated researchers to explore simpler pipelines leveraging large language models (LLMs) that are capable of working in a zero-shot manner. However, since zero-shot inference does not make use of a training set of pairs of queries and their relevant documents, its performance is mostly worse than that of supervised models, which are trained on such example pairs. Motivated by the existing findings that training examples generally improve zero-shot performance, in our work, we explore if this also applies to ranking models. More specifically, given a query and a pair of documents, the preference prediction task is improved by augmenting examples of preferences for similar queries from a training set. Our proposed pairwise few-shot ranker demonstrates consistent improvements over the zero-shot baseline on both in-domain (TREC DL) and out-domain (BEIR subset) retrieval benchmarks. Our method also achieves a close performance to that of a supervised model without requiring any complex training pipeline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17745v3,2024-09
MIO: A Foundation Model on Multimodal Tokens,"Zekun Wang, King Zhu, Chunpu Xu, Wangchunshu Zhou, Jiaheng Liu, Yibo Zhang, Jiashuo Wang, Ning Shi, Siyu Li, Yizhi Li, Haoran Que, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Yuanxing Zhang, Ge Zhang, Ke Xu, Jie Fu, Wenhao Huang","In this paper, we introduce MIO, a novel foundation model built on multimodal tokens, capable of understanding and generating speech, text, images, and videos in an end-to-end, autoregressive manner. While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17692v2,2024-09
Zero- and Few-shot Named Entity Recognition and Text Expansion in Medication Prescriptions using ChatGPT,"Natthanaphop Isaradech, Andrea Riedel, Wachiranun Sirikul, Markus Kreuzthaler, Stefan Schulz","Introduction: Medication prescriptions are often in free text and include a mix of two languages, local brand names, and a wide range of idiosyncratic formats and abbreviations. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising ability to generate text in response to input prompts. We use ChatGPT 3.5 to automatically structure and expand medication statements in discharge summaries and thus make them easier to interpret for people and machines. Methods: Named-entity Recognition (NER) and Text Expansion (EX) are used in a zero- and few-shot setting with different prompt strategies. 100 medication statements were manually annotated and curated. NER performance was measured by using strict and partial matching. For the task EX, two experts interpreted the results by assessing semantic equivalence between original and expanded statements. The model performance was measured by precision, recall, and F1 score. Results: For NER, the best-performing prompt reached an average F1 score of 0.94 in the test set. For EX, the few-shot prompt showed superior performance among other prompts, with an average F1 score of 0.87. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates good performance for NER and EX tasks in free-text medication statements using ChatGPT. Compared to a zero-shot baseline, a few-shot approach prevented the system from hallucinating, which would be unacceptable when processing safety-relevant medication data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17683v1,2024-09

This paper introduces a novel digital twin framework specifically designed to enhance oncology clinical operations. We propose the integration of multiple specialized digital twins, such as the Medical Necessity Twin, Care Navigator Twin, and Clinical History Twin, to enhance workflow efficiency and personalize care for each patient based on their unique data.

Efficient In-Domain Question Answering for Resource-Constrained Environments,"Isaac Chung, Phat Vo, Arman C. Kizilkale, Aaron Reite","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a common method for integrating external knowledge into pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance accuracy and relevancy in question answering (QA) tasks. However, prompt engineering and resource efficiency remain significant bottlenecks in developing optimal and robust RAG solutions for real-world QA applications. Recent studies have shown success in using fine tuning to address these problems; in particular, Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT) applied to smaller 7B models has demonstrated superior performance compared to RAG setups with much larger models such as GPT-3.5. The combination of RAFT with parameter-efficient fine tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), promises an even more efficient solution, yet remains an unexplored area. In this work, we combine RAFT with LoRA to reduce fine tuning and storage requirements and gain faster inference times while maintaining comparable RAG performance.

In our online medical consultation scenario, a doctor responds to the texts and images provided by a patient in multiple rounds to diagnose her/his health condition, forming a multi-turn multimodal medical dialogue format. Unlike high-quality images captured by professional equipment in traditional medical visual question answering (Med-VQA), the images in our case are taken by patients' mobile phones. These images have poor quality control, with issues such as excessive background elements and the lesion area being significantly off-center, leading to degradation of vision-language alignment in the model training phase. In this paper, we propose ZALM3, a Zero-shot strategy to improve vision-language ALignment in Multi-turn Multimodal Medical dialogue. Since we observe that the preceding text conversations before an image can infer the regions of interest (RoIs) in the image, ZALM3 employs an LLM to summarize the keywords from the preceding context and a visual grounding model to extract the RoIs. The updated images eliminate unnecessary background noise and provide more effective vision-language alignment. To better evaluate our proposed method, we design a new subjective assessment metric for multi-turn unimodal/multimodal medical dialogue to provide a fine-grained performance comparison.

DualCoTs: Dual Chain-of-Thoughts Prompting for Sentiment Lexicon Expansion of Idioms,"Fuqiang Niu, Minghuan Tan, Bowen Zhang, Min Yang, Ruifeng Xu","Idioms represent a ubiquitous vehicle for conveying sentiments in the realm of everyday discourse, rendering the nuanced analysis of idiom sentiment crucial for a comprehensive understanding of emotional expression within real-world texts. Nevertheless, the existing corpora dedicated to idiom sentiment analysis considerably limit research in text sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to automatically expand the sentiment lexicon for idioms, leveraging the capabilities of large language models through the application of Chain-of-Thought prompting. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we integrate multiple existing resources and construct an emotional idiom lexicon expansion dataset (called EmoIdiomE), which encompasses a comprehensive repository of Chinese and English idioms. Then we designed the Dual Chain-of-Thoughts (DualCoTs) method, which combines insights from linguistics and psycholinguistics, to demonstrate the effectiveness of using large models to automatically expand the sentiment lexicon for idioms.

Dealing with Controversy: An Emotion and Coping Strategy Corpus Based on Role Playing,"Enrica Troiano, Sofie Labat, Marco Antonio Stranisci, Viviana Patti, Rossana Damiano, Roman Klinger","There is a mismatch between psychological and computational studies on emotions. Psychological research aims at explaining and documenting internal mechanisms of these phenomena, while computational work often simplifies them into labels. Many emotion fundamentals remain under-explored in natural language processing, particularly how emotions develop and how people cope with them. To help reduce this gap, we follow theories on coping, and treat emotions as strategies to cope with salient situations (i.e., how people deal with emotion-eliciting events). This approach allows us to investigate the link between emotions and behavior, which also emerges in language. We introduce the task of coping identification, together with a corpus to do so, constructed via role-playing. We find that coping strategies realize in text even though they are challenging to recognize, both for humans and automatic systems trained and prompted on the same task. We thus open up a promising research direction to enhance the capability of models to better capture emotion mechanisms from text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19025v1,2024-09
Leveraging Annotator Disagreement for Text Classification,"Jin Xu, Mariët Theune, Daniel Braun","It is common practice in text classification to only use one majority label for model training even if a dataset has been annotated by multiple annotators. Doing so can remove valuable nuances and diverse perspectives inherent in the annotators' assessments. This paper proposes and compares three different strategies to leverage annotator disagreement for text classification: a probability-based multi-label method, an ensemble system, and instruction tuning. All three approaches are evaluated on the tasks of hate speech and abusive conversation detection, which inherently entail a high degree of subjectivity. Moreover, to evaluate the effectiveness of embracing annotation disagreements for model training, we conduct an online survey that compares the performance of the multi-label model against a baseline model, which is trained with the majority label.   The results show that in hate speech detection, the multi-label method outperforms the other two approaches, while in abusive conversation detection, instruction tuning achieves the best performance. The results of the survey also show that the outputs from the multi-label models are considered a better representation of the texts than the single-label model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17577v1,2024-09
GPT's Judgements Under Uncertainty,"Payam Saeedi, Mahsa Goodarzi","We investigate whether biases inherent in human cognition, such as loss aversion, framing effects, and conjunction fallacy, manifest in how GPT-4o judges and makes decisions in probabilistic scenarios. By conducting 1350 experiments across nine cognitive biases and analyzing the responses for statistical versus heuristic reasoning, we demonstrate GPT-4o's contradicting approach while responding to prompts with similar underlying probability notations. Our findings also reveal mixed performances with the AI demonstrating both human-like heuristic errors and statistically sound decisions, even as it goes through identical iterations of the same prompt.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02820v1,2024-09
"Modulated Intervention Preference Optimization (MIPO): Keep the Easy, Refine the Difficult",Cheolhun Jang,"Preference optimization methods typically begin training with a well-trained SFT model as a reference model. In RLHF and DPO, a regularization term is used during the preference optimization process to prevent the policy model from deviating too far from the reference model's distribution, thereby avoiding the generation of anomalous responses. When the reference model is already well-aligned with the given data or only requires slight adjustments, this approach can produce a well-aligned model. However, if the reference model is not aligned with the given data and requires significant deviation from its current state, a regularization term may actually hinder the model alignment. In this study, we propose \textbf{Modulated Intervention Preference Optimization (MIPO)} to address this issue. MIPO modulates the degree of intervention from the reference model based on how well the given data is aligned with it. If the data is well-aligned, the intervention is increased to prevent the policy model from diverging significantly from reference model. Conversely, if the alignment is poor, the interference is reduced to facilitate more extensive training. We compare the performance of MIPO and DPO using Mistral-7B and Llama3-8B in Alpaca Eval 2.0 and MT-Bench. The experimental results demonstrate that MIPO consistently outperforms DPO across various evaluation scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17545v2,2024-09
Logic-of-Thought: Injecting Logic into Contexts for Full Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Tongxuan Liu, Wenjiang Xu, Weizhe Huang, Xingyu Wang, Jiaxing Wang, Hailong Yang, Jing Li","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks but their performance in complex logical reasoning tasks remains unsatisfactory. Although some prompting methods, such as Chain-of-Thought, can improve the reasoning ability of LLMs to some extent, they suffer from an unfaithful issue where derived conclusions may not align with the generated reasoning chain. To address this issue, some studies employ the approach of propositional logic to further enhance logical reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, the potential omissions in the extraction of logical expressions in these methods can cause information loss in the logical reasoning process, thereby generating incorrect results. To this end, we propose Logic-of-Thought (LoT) prompting which employs propositional logic to generate expanded logical information from input context, and utilizes the generated logical information as an additional augmentation to the input prompts, thereby enhancing the capability of logical reasoning. The LoT is orthogonal to existing prompting methods and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoT boosts the performance of various prompting methods with a striking margin across five logical reasoning tasks. In particular, the LoT enhances Chain-of-Thought's performance on the ReClor dataset by +4.35%; moreover, it improves Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency's performance on LogiQA by +5%; additionally, it boosts performance of Tree-of-Thoughts on ProofWriter dataset by +8%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17539v1,2024-09
On the Implicit Relation Between Low-Rank Adaptation and Differential Privacy,"Saber Malekmohammadi, Golnoosh Farnadi","A significant approach in natural language processing involves large-scale pre-training models on general domain data followed by their adaptation to specific tasks or domains. As models grow in size, full fine-tuning all of their parameters becomes increasingly impractical. To address this, some methods for low-rank task adaptation of language models have been proposed, e.g., LoRA and FLoRA. These methods keep the pre-trained model weights fixed and incorporate trainable low-rank decomposition matrices into some layers of the transformer architecture, called adapters. This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for downstream tasks compared to full fine-tuning all parameters. In this work, we look at low-rank adaptation from the lens of data privacy. We show theoretically that the low-rank adaptation used in LoRA and FLoRA is equivalent to injecting some random noise into the batch gradients w.r.t the adapter parameters, and we quantify the variance of the injected noise. By establishing a Berry-Esseen type bound on the total variation distance between distribution of the injected noise and a Gaussian distribution with the same variance, we show that the dynamics of low-rank adaptation is close to that of differentially private fine-tuning of the adapters. Finally, using Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, we show that when augmented with gradient scaling, low-rank adaptation is very close to performing DPSGD algorithm with a fixed noise scale to fine-tune the adapters. These theoretical findings suggest that unlike other existing fine-tuning algorithms, low-rank adaptation provides privacy w.r.t the fine-tuning data implicitly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17538v3,2024-09
MUSE: Integrating Multi-Knowledge for Knowledge Graph Completion,Pengjie Liu,"Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) aims to predict the missing [relation] part of (head entity)--[relation]->(tail entity) triplet. Most existing KGC methods focus on single features (e.g., relation types) or sub-graph aggregation. However, they do not fully explore the Knowledge Graph (KG) features and neglect the guidance of external semantic knowledge. To address these shortcomings, we propose a knowledge-aware reasoning model (MUSE), which designs a novel multi-knowledge representation learning mechanism for missing relation prediction. Our model develops a tailored embedding space through three parallel components: 1) Prior Knowledge Learning for enhancing the triplets' semantic representation by fine-tuning BERT; 2) Context Message Passing for enhancing the context messages of KG; 3) Relational Path Aggregation for enhancing the path representation from the head entity to the tail entity. The experimental results show that MUSE significantly outperforms other baselines on four public datasets, achieving over 5.50% H@1 improvement and 4.20% MRR improvement on the NELL995 dataset.

Data Proportion Detection for Optimized Data Management for Large Language Models,"Hao Liang, Keshi Zhao, Yajie Yang, Bin Cui, Guosheng Dong, Zenan Zhou, Wentao Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks and domains, with data preparation playing a critical role in achieving these results. Pre-training data typically combines information from multiple domains. To maximize performance when integrating data from various domains, determining the optimal data proportion is essential. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs rarely disclose details about their pre-training data, making it difficult for researchers to identify ideal data proportions. In this paper, we introduce a new topic, \textit{data proportion detection}, which enables the automatic estimation of pre-training data proportions by analyzing the generated outputs of LLMs. We provide rigorous theoretical proofs, practical algorithms, and preliminary experimental results for data proportion detection. Based on these findings, we offer valuable insights into the challenges and future directions for effective data proportion detection and data management.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17527v1,2024-09
Elephant in the Room: Unveiling the Impact of Reward Model Quality in Alignment,"Yan Liu, Xiaoyuan Yi, Xiaokang Chen, Jing Yao, Jingwei Yi, Daoguang Zan, Zheng Liu, Xing Xie, Tsung-Yi Ho","The demand for regulating potentially risky behaviors of large language models (LLMs) has ignited research on alignment methods. Since LLM alignment heavily relies on reward models for optimization or evaluation, neglecting the quality of reward models may cause unreliable results or even misalignment. Despite the vital role reward models play in alignment, previous works have consistently overlooked their performance and used off-the-shelf reward models arbitrarily without verification, rendering the reward model ``\emph{an elephant in the room}''. To this end, this work first investigates the quality of the widely-used preference dataset, HH-RLHF, and curates a clean version, CHH-RLHF. Based on CHH-RLHF, we benchmark the accuracy of a broad range of reward models used in previous alignment works, unveiling the unreliability of using them both for optimization and evaluation. Furthermore, we systematically study the impact of reward model quality on alignment performance in three reward utilization paradigms. Extensive experiments reveal that better reward models perform as better human preference proxies. This work aims to awaken people to notice this huge elephant in alignment research. We call attention to the following issues: (1) The reward model needs to be rigorously evaluated, whether for alignment optimization or evaluation. (2) Considering the role of reward models, research efforts should not only concentrate on alignment algorithm, but also on developing more reliable human proxy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19024v1,2024-09
When A Man Says He Is Pregnant: ERP Evidence for A Rational Account of Speaker-contextualized Language Comprehension,"Hanlin Wu, Zhenguang G. Cai","Spoken language is often, if not always, understood in a context that includes the identities of speakers. For instance, we can easily make sense of an utterance such as ""I'm going to have a manicure this weekend"" or ""The first time I got pregnant I had a hard time"" when the utterance is spoken by a woman, but it would be harder to understand when it is spoken by a man. Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown mixed results regarding the neurophysiological responses to such speaker-mismatched utterances, with some reporting an N400 effect and others a P600 effect. In an experiment involving 64 participants, we showed that these different ERP effects reflect distinct cognitive processes employed to resolve the speaker-message mismatch. When possible, the message is integrated with the speaker context to arrive at an interpretation, as in the case of violations of social stereotypes (e.g., men getting a manicure), resulting in an N400 effect. However, when such integration is impossible due to violations of biological knowledge (e.g., men getting pregnant), listeners engage in an error correction process to revise either the perceived utterance or the speaker context, resulting in a P600 effect. Additionally, we found that the social N400 effect decreased as a function of the listener's personality trait of openness, while the biological P600 effect remained robust. Our findings help to reconcile the empirical inconsistencies in the literature and provide a rational account of speaker-contextualized language comprehension.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17525v1,2024-09
"Comparing Unidirectional, Bidirectional, and Word2vec Models for Discovering Vulnerabilities in Compiled Lifted Code","Gary A. McCully, John D. Hastings, Shengjie Xu, Adam Fortier","Ransomware and other forms of malware cause significant financial and operational damage to organizations by exploiting long-standing and often difficult-to-detect software vulnerabilities. To detect vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows in compiled code, this research investigates the application of unidirectional transformer-based embeddings, specifically GPT-2. Using a dataset of LLVM functions, we trained a GPT-2 model to generate embeddings, which were subsequently used to build LSTM neural networks to differentiate between vulnerable and non-vulnerable code. Our study reveals that embeddings from the GPT-2 model significantly outperform those from bidirectional models of BERT and RoBERTa, achieving an accuracy of 92.5% and an F1-score of 89.7%. LSTM neural networks were developed with both frozen and unfrozen embedding model layers. The model with the highest performance was achieved when the embedding layers were unfrozen. Further, the research finds that, in exploring the impact of different optimizers within this domain, the SGD optimizer demonstrates superior performance over Adam. Overall, these findings reveal important insights into the potential of unidirectional transformer-based approaches in enhancing cybersecurity defenses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17513v1,2024-09
HaloScope: Harnessing Unlabeled LLM Generations for Hallucination Detection,"Xuefeng Du, Chaowei Xiao, Yixuan Li","The surge in applications of large language models (LLMs) has prompted concerns about the generation of misleading or fabricated information, known as hallucinations. Therefore, detecting hallucinations has become critical to maintaining trust in LLM-generated content. A primary challenge in learning a truthfulness classifier is the lack of a large amount of labeled truthful and hallucinated data. To address the challenge, we introduce HaloScope, a novel learning framework that leverages the unlabeled LLM generations in the wild for hallucination detection. Such unlabeled data arises freely upon deploying LLMs in the open world, and consists of both truthful and hallucinated information. To harness the unlabeled data, we present an automated membership estimation score for distinguishing between truthful and untruthful generations within unlabeled mixture data, thereby enabling the training of a binary truthfulness classifier on top. Importantly, our framework does not require extra data collection and human annotations, offering strong flexibility and practicality for real-world applications. Extensive experiments show that HaloScope can achieve superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the competitive rivals by a significant margin.

MaskLLM: Learnable Semi-Structured Sparsity for Large Language Models,"Gongfan Fang, Hongxu Yin, Saurav Muralidharan, Greg Heinrich, Jeff Pool, Jan Kautz, Pavlo Molchanov, Xinchao Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) are distinguished by their massive parameter counts, which typically result in significant redundancy. This work introduces MaskLLM, a learnable pruning method that establishes Semi-structured (or ``N:M'') Sparsity in LLMs, aimed at reducing computational overhead during inference. Instead of developing a new importance criterion, MaskLLM explicitly models N:M patterns as a learnable distribution through Gumbel Softmax sampling. This approach facilitates end-to-end training on large-scale datasets and offers two notable advantages: 1) High-quality Masks - our method effectively scales to large datasets and learns accurate masks; 2) Transferability - the probabilistic modeling of mask distribution enables the transfer learning of sparsity across domains or tasks. We assessed MaskLLM using 2:4 sparsity on various LLMs, including LLaMA-2, Nemotron-4, and GPT-3, with sizes ranging from 843M to 15B parameters, and our empirical results show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. For instance, leading approaches achieve a perplexity (PPL) of 10 or greater on Wikitext compared to the dense model's 5.12 PPL, but MaskLLM achieves a significantly lower 6.72 PPL solely by learning the masks with frozen weights. Furthermore, MaskLLM's learnable nature allows customized masks for lossless application of 2:4 sparsity to downstream tasks or domains.

Reducing and Exploiting Data Augmentation Noise through Meta Reweighting Contrastive Learning for Text Classification,"Guanyi Mou, Yichuan Li, Kyumin Lee","Data augmentation has shown its effectiveness in resolving the data-hungry problem and improving model's generalization ability. However, the quality of augmented data can be varied, especially compared with the raw/original data. To boost deep learning models' performance given augmented data/samples in text classification tasks, we propose a novel framework, which leverages both meta learning and contrastive learning techniques as parts of our design for reweighting the augmented samples and refining their feature representations based on their quality. As part of the framework, we propose novel weight-dependent enqueue and dequeue algorithms to utilize augmented samples' weight/quality information effectively. Through experiments, we show that our framework can reasonably cooperate with existing deep learning models (e.g., RoBERTa-base and Text-CNN) and augmentation techniques (e.g., Wordnet and Easydata) for specific supervised learning tasks. Experiment results show that our framework achieves an average of 1.6%, up to 4.3% absolute improvement on Text-CNN encoders and an average of 1.4%, up to 4.4% absolute improvement on RoBERTa-base encoders on seven GLUE benchmark datasets compared with the best baseline. We present an indepth analysis of our framework design, revealing the non-trivial contributions of our network components.

Autoregressive Multi-trait Essay Scoring via Reinforcement Learning with Scoring-aware Multiple Rewards,"Heejin Do, Sangwon Ryu, Gary Geunbae Lee","Recent advances in automated essay scoring (AES) have shifted towards evaluating multiple traits to provide enriched feedback. Like typical AES systems, multi-trait AES employs the quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) to measure agreement with human raters, aligning closely with the rating schema; however, its non-differentiable nature prevents its direct use in neural network training. In this paper, we propose Scoring-aware Multi-reward Reinforcement Learning (SaMRL), which integrates actual evaluation schemes into the training process by designing QWK-based rewards with a mean-squared error penalty for multi-trait AES. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) applications in AES are limited to classification models despite associated performance degradation, as RL requires probability distributions; instead, we adopt an autoregressive score generation framework to leverage token generation probabilities for robust multi-trait score predictions. Empirical analyses demonstrate that SaMRL facilitates model training, notably enhancing scoring of previously inferior prompts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17472v1,2024-09

RED QUEEN: Safeguarding Large Language Models against Concealed Multi-Turn Jailbreaking,"Yifan Jiang, Kriti Aggarwal, Tanmay Laud, Kashif Munir, Jay Pujara, Subhabrata Mukherjee","The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities across various domains and applications; yet it also presents challenges related to potential misuse. To mitigate such risks, red teaming has been employed as a proactive security measure to probe language models for harmful outputs via jailbreak attacks. However, current jailbreak attack approaches are single-turn with explicit malicious queries that do not fully capture the complexity of real-world interactions. In reality, users can engage in multi-turn interactions with LLM-based chat assistants, allowing them to conceal their true intentions in a more covert manner. To bridge this gap, we, first, propose a new jailbreak approach, RED QUEEN ATTACK. This method constructs a multi-turn scenario, concealing the malicious intent under the guise of preventing harm. We craft 40 scenarios that vary in turns and select 14 harmful categories to generate 56k multi-turn attack data points. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the RED QUEEN ATTACK with four representative LLM families of different sizes. Our experiments reveal that all LLMs are vulnerable to RED QUEEN ATTACK, reaching 87.62% attack success rate on GPT-4o and 75.4% on Llama3-70B. Further analysis reveals that larger models are more susceptible to the RED QUEEN ATTACK, with multi-turn structures and concealment strategies contributing to its success. To prioritize safety, we introduce a straightforward mitigation strategy called RED QUEEN GUARD, which aligns LLMs to effectively counter adversarial attacks. This approach reduces the attack success rate to below 1% while maintaining the model's performance across standard benchmarks. Full implementation and dataset are publicly accessible at https://github.com/kriti-hippo/red_queen.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17458v1,2024-09

Description-based Controllable Text-to-Speech with Cross-Lingual Voice Control,"Ryuichi Yamamoto, Yuma Shirahata, Masaya Kawamura, Kentaro Tachibana","We propose a novel description-based controllable text-to-speech (TTS) method with cross-lingual control capability. To address the lack of audio-description paired data in the target language, we combine a TTS model trained on the target language with a description control model trained on another language, which maps input text descriptions to the conditional features of the TTS model. These two models share disentangled timbre and style representations based on self-supervised learning (SSL), allowing for disentangled voice control, such as controlling speaking styles while retaining the original timbre. Furthermore, because the SSL-based timbre and style representations are language-agnostic, combining the TTS and description control models while sharing the same embedding space effectively enables cross-lingual control of voice characteristics. Experiments on English and Japanese TTS demonstrate that our method achieves high naturalness and controllability for both languages, even though no Japanese audio-description pairs are used.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17452v1,2024-09

Further analysis on tweets containing different types of numerical data demonstrates that the inclusion of expert-designed hint leads to notable improvements in sentiment analysis performance, especially for tweets with monetary-related numbers.

HDFlow: Enhancing LLM Complex Problem-Solving with Hybrid Thinking and Dynamic Workflows,"Wenlin Yao, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu","Despite recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), their performance on complex reasoning problems requiring multi-step thinking and combining various skills is still limited. To address this, we propose a novel framework HDFlow for complex reasoning with LLMs that combines fast and slow thinking modes in an adaptive manner. Our approach consists of two key components: 1) a new approach for slow, deliberate reasoning called Dynamic Workflow, which automatically decomposes complex problems into more manageable sub-tasks and dynamically designs a workflow to assemble specialized LLM or symbolic reasoning tools to solve sub-tasks; 2) Hybrid Thinking, a general framework that dynamically combines fast and slow thinking based on problem complexity. Finally, we propose an easy-to-scale method for automatically synthesizing a large-scale dataset of 27K challenging reasoning problems for complex reasoning and a hybrid thinking tuning method that trains smaller LLMs on this dataset to internalize the fast/slow hybrid reasoning strategies. Experiments on four reasoning benchmark datasets demonstrate that our slow thinking with dynamic workflows significantly outperforms Chain-of-Thought, and hybrid thinking achieves the highest accuracy while providing an effective balance between computational efficiency and performance. Fine-tuning using our hybrid thinking approach also significantly boosts the complex reasoning capabilities of open-source language models. The results showcase the promise of slow thinking, dynamic workflows, and hybrid thinking in expanding the frontier of complex problem-solving with LLMs\footnote{Code and data will be released at \url{https://github.com/wenlinyao/HDFlow}.}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17433v1,2024-09
On Extending Direct Preference Optimization to Accommodate Ties,"Jinghong Chen, Guangyu Yang, Weizhe Lin, Jingbiao Mei, Bill Byrne","We derive and investigate two DPO variants that explicitly model the possibility of declaring a tie in pair-wise comparisons. We replace the Bradley-Terry model in DPO with two well-known modeling extensions, by Rao and Kupper and by Davidson, that assign probability to ties as alternatives to clear preferences. Our experiments in neural machine translation and summarization show that explicitly labeled ties can be added to the datasets for these DPO variants without the degradation in task performance that is observed when the same tied pairs are presented to DPO. We find empirically that the inclusion of ties leads to stronger regularization with respect to the reference policy as measured by KL divergence, and we see this even for DPO in its original form. These findings motivate and enable the inclusion of tied pairs in preference optimization as opposed to simply discarding them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17431v1,2024-09
Discovering the Gems in Early Layers: Accelerating Long-Context LLMs with 1000x Input Token Reduction,"Zhenmei Shi, Yifei Ming, Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Yingyu Liang, Shafiq Joty","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling long context inputs, but this comes at the cost of increased computational resources and latency. Our research introduces a novel approach for the long context bottleneck to accelerate LLM inference and reduce GPU memory consumption. Our research demonstrates that LLMs can identify relevant tokens in the early layers before generating answers to a query. Leveraging this insight, we propose an algorithm that uses early layers of an LLM as filters to select and compress input tokens, significantly reducing the context length for subsequent processing. Our method, GemFilter, demonstrates substantial improvements in both speed and memory efficiency compared to existing techniques, such as standard attention and SnapKV/H2O. Notably, it achieves a 2.4$\times$ speedup and 30\% reduction in GPU memory usage compared to SOTA methods. Evaluation on the Needle in a Haystack task shows that GemFilter significantly outperforms standard attention, SnapKV and demonstrates comparable performance on the LongBench challenge. GemFilter is simple, training-free, and broadly applicable across different LLMs. Crucially, it provides interpretability by allowing humans to inspect the selected input sequence. These findings not only offer practical benefits for LLM deployment, but also enhance our understanding of LLM internal mechanisms, paving the way for further optimizations in LLM design and inference.

From Deception to Detection: The Dual Roles of Large Language Models in Fake News,"Dorsaf Sallami, Yuan-Chen Chang, Esma Aïmeur","Fake news poses a significant threat to the integrity of information ecosystems and public trust. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) holds considerable promise for transforming the battle against fake news. Generally, LLMs represent a double-edged sword in this struggle. One major concern is that LLMs can be readily used to craft and disseminate misleading information on a large scale. This raises the pressing questions: Can LLMs easily generate biased fake news? Do all LLMs have this capability? Conversely, LLMs offer valuable prospects for countering fake news, thanks to their extensive knowledge of the world and robust reasoning capabilities. This leads to other critical inquiries: Can we use LLMs to detect fake news, and do they outperform typical detection models? In this paper, we aim to address these pivotal questions by exploring the performance of various LLMs. Our objective is to explore the capability of various LLMs in effectively combating fake news, marking this as the first investigation to analyze seven such models. Our results reveal that while some models adhere strictly to safety protocols, refusing to generate biased or misleading content, other models can readily produce fake news across a spectrum of biases. Additionally, our results show that larger models generally exhibit superior detection abilities and that LLM-generated fake news are less likely to be detected than human-written ones. Finally, our findings demonstrate that users can benefit from LLM-generated explanations in identifying fake news.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17416v1,2024-09
Post-hoc Reward Calibration: A Case Study on Length Bias,"Zeyu Huang, Zihan Qiu, Zili Wang, Edoardo M. Ponti, Ivan Titov","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback aligns the outputs of Large Language Models with human values and preferences. Central to this process is the reward model (RM), which translates human feedback into training signals for optimising LLM behaviour. However, RMs can develop biases by exploiting spurious correlations in their training data, such as favouring outputs based on length or style rather than true quality. These biases can lead to incorrect output rankings, sub-optimal model evaluations, and the amplification of undesirable behaviours in LLMs alignment. This paper addresses the challenge of correcting such biases without additional data and training, introducing the concept of Post-hoc Reward Calibration. We first propose an intuitive approach to estimate the bias term and, thus, remove it to approximate the underlying true reward. We then extend the approach to a more general and robust form with the Locally Weighted Regression. Focusing on the prevalent length bias, we validate our proposed approaches across three experimental settings, demonstrating consistent improvements: (1) a 3.11 average performance gain across 33 reward models on the RewardBench dataset; (2) enhanced alignment of RM rankings with GPT-4 evaluations and human preferences based on the AlpacaEval benchmark; and (3) improved Length-Controlled win rate of the RLHF process in multiple LLM--RM combinations. Our method is computationally efficient and generalisable to other types of bias and RMs, offering a scalable and robust solution for mitigating biases in LLM alignment.

However, there is a gap in research regarding the effectiveness of LLMs in non-English mental health support applications. To address this problem, we present a novel multilingual adaptation of widely-used mental health datasets, translated from English into six languages (Greek, Turkish, French, Portuguese, German, and Finnish). This dataset enables a comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance in detecting mental health conditions and assessing their severity across multiple languages. By experimenting with GPT and Llama, we observe considerable variability in performance across languages, despite being evaluated on the same translated dataset. This inconsistency underscores the complexities inherent in multilingual mental health support, where language-specific nuances and mental health data coverage can affect the accuracy of the models. Through comprehensive error analysis, we emphasize the risks of relying exclusively on large language models (LLMs) in medical settings (e.g., their potential to contribute to misdiagnoses). Moreover, our proposed approach offers significant cost savings for multilingual tasks, presenting a major advantage for broad-scale implementation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17397v1,2024-09
Scaling Behavior for Large Language Models regarding Numeral Systems: An Example using Pythia,"Zhejian Zhou, Jiayu Wang, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen","Though Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in mathematics reasoning, they are still struggling with performing numeric operations accurately, such as addition and multiplication. Numbers can be tokenized into tokens in various ways by different LLMs and affect the numeric operations performance. Currently, there are two representatives: 1) Tokenize into $1$-digit, and 2) Tokenize into $1\sim 3$ digit. The difference is roughly equivalent to using different numeral systems (namely base $10$ or base $10^{3}$). In light of this, we study the scaling behavior of different numeral systems in the context of transformer-based large language models. We empirically show that a base $10$ system is consistently more data-efficient than a base $10^{2}$ or $10^{3}$ system across training data scale, model sizes under from-scratch training settings, while different number systems have very similar fine-tuning performances. We attribute this to higher token frequencies of a base $10$ system. Additionally, we reveal extrapolation behavior patterns on addition and multiplication. We identify that base $100$ and base $1000$ systems struggle on token-level discernment and token-level operations. We also sheds light on the mechanism learnt by the models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17391v2,2024-09
data2lang2vec: Data Driven Typological Features Completion,"Hamidreza Amirzadeh, Sadegh Jafari, Anika Harju, Rob van der Goot","Language typology databases enhance multi-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) by improving model adaptability to diverse linguistic structures. The widely-used lang2vec toolkit integrates several such databases, but its coverage remains limited at 28.9\%. Previous work on automatically increasing coverage predicts missing values based on features from other languages or focuses on single features, we propose to use textual data for better-informed feature prediction. To this end, we introduce a multi-lingual Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger, achieving over 70\% accuracy across 1,749 languages, and experiment with external statistical features and a variety of machine learning algorithms. We also introduce a more realistic evaluation setup, focusing on likely to be missing typology features, and show that our approach outperforms previous work in both setups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17373v1,2024-09
Internalizing ASR with Implicit Chain of Thought for Efficient Speech-to-Speech Conversational LLM,"Robin Shing-Hei Yuen, Timothy Tin-Long Tse, Jian Zhu","Current speech-based LLMs are predominantly trained on extensive ASR and TTS datasets, excelling in tasks related to these domains. However, their ability to handle direct speech-to-speech conversations remains notably constrained. These models often rely on an ASR-to-TTS chain-of-thought pipeline, converting speech into text for processing before generating audio responses, which introduces latency and loses audio features. We propose a method that implicitly internalizes ASR chain of thought into a speech LLM, enhancing its native speech understanding capabilities. Our approach reduces latency and improves the model's native understanding of speech, paving the way for more efficient and natural real-time audio interactions. We also release a large-scale synthetic conversational dataset to facilitate further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17353v3,2024-09
How Transliterations Improve Crosslingual Alignment,"Yihong Liu, Mingyang Wang, Amir Hossein Kargaran, Ayyoob Imani, Orgest Xhelili, Haotian Ye, Chunlan Ma, François Yvon, Hinrich Schütze","Recent studies have shown that post-aligning multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) using alignment objectives on both original and transliterated data can improve crosslingual alignment. This improvement further leads to better crosslingual transfer performance. However, it remains unclear how and why a better crosslingual alignment is achieved, as this technique only involves transliterations, and does not use any parallel data. This paper attempts to explicitly evaluate the crosslingual alignment and identify the key elements in transliteration-based approaches that contribute to better performance. For this, we train multiple models under varying setups for two pairs of related languages: (1) Polish and Ukrainian and (2) Hindi and Urdu. To assess alignment, we define four types of similarities based on sentence representations. Our experimental results show that adding transliterations alone improves the overall similarities, even for random sentence pairs. With the help of auxiliary transliteration-based alignment objectives, especially the contrastive objective, the model learns to distinguish matched from random pairs, leading to better crosslingual alignment. However, we also show that better alignment does not always yield better downstream performance, suggesting that further research is needed to clarify the connection between alignment and performance. The code implementation is based on \url{https://github.com/cisnlp/Transliteration-PPA}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17326v2,2024-09
Navigating the Nuances: A Fine-grained Evaluation of Vision-Language Navigation,"Zehao Wang, Minye Wu, Yixin Cao, Yubo Ma, Meiqi Chen, Tinne Tuytelaars","This study presents a novel evaluation framework for the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task. It aims to diagnose current models for various instruction categories at a finer-grained level. The framework is structured around the context-free grammar (CFG) of the task. The CFG serves as the basis for the problem decomposition and the core premise of the instruction categories design. We propose a semi-automatic method for CFG construction with the help of Large-Language Models (LLMs). Then, we induct and generate data spanning five principal instruction categories (i.e. direction change, landmark recognition, region recognition, vertical movement, and numerical comprehension). Our analysis of different models reveals notable performance discrepancies and recurrent issues. The stagnation of numerical comprehension, heavy selective biases over directional concepts, and other interesting findings contribute to the development of future language-guided navigation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17313v1,2024-09
BabyLlama-2: Ensemble-Distilled Models Consistently Outperform Teachers With Limited Data,"Jean-Loup Tastet, Inar Timiryasov","We present BabyLlama-2, a 345 million parameter model distillation-pretrained from two teachers on a 10 million word corpus for the BabyLM competition. On BLiMP and SuperGLUE benchmarks, BabyLlama-2 outperforms baselines trained on both 10 and 100 million word datasets with the same data mix, as well as its teacher models. Through an extensive hyperparameter sweep, we demonstrate that the advantages of distillation cannot be attributed to suboptimal hyperparameter selection of the teachers. Our findings underscore the need for further investigation into distillation techniques, particularly in data-limited settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17312v1,2024-09
Proof of Thought : Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis allows Robust and Interpretable Reasoning,"Debargha Ganguly, Srinivasan Iyengar, Vipin Chaudhary, Shivkumar Kalyanaraman","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they struggle with inconsistent reasoning, particularly in novel domains and complex logical sequences. This research introduces Proof of Thought, a framework that enhances the reliability and transparency of LLM outputs. Our approach bridges LLM-generated ideas with formal logic verification, employing a custom interpreter to convert LLM outputs into First Order Logic constructs for theorem prover scrutiny. Central to our method is an intermediary JSON-based Domain-Specific Language, which by design balances precise logical structures with intuitive human concepts. This hybrid representation enables both rigorous validation and accessible human comprehension of LLM reasoning processes. Key contributions include a robust type system with sort management for enhanced logical integrity, explicit representation of rules for clear distinction between factual and inferential knowledge, and a flexible architecture that allows for easy extension to various domain-specific applications. We demonstrate Proof of Thought's effectiveness through benchmarking on StrategyQA and a novel multimodal reasoning task, showing improved performance in open-ended scenarios. By providing verifiable and interpretable results, our technique addresses critical needs for AI system accountability and sets a foundation for human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17270v2,2024-09

Smith, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Ross Girshick, Ali Farhadi, Aniruddha Kembhavi","Today's most advanced vision-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models rely heavily on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs to achieve good performance, effectively distilling these closed VLMs into open ones. As a result, the community has been missing foundational knowledge about how to build performant VLMs from scratch. We present Molmo, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art in their class of openness. Our key contribution is a collection of new datasets called PixMo, including a dataset of highly detailed image captions for pre-training, a free-form image Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, and an innovative 2D pointing dataset, all collected without the use of external VLMs. The success of our approach relies on careful modeling choices, a well-tuned training pipeline, and, most critically, the quality of our newly collected datasets. Our best-in-class 72B model not only outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models, but also outperforms larger proprietary models including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash, second only to GPT-4o based on both academic benchmarks and on a large human evaluation.

FineZip : Pushing the Limits of Large Language Models for Practical Lossless Text Compression,"Fazal Mittu, Yihuan Bu, Akshat Gupta, Ashok Devireddy, Alp Eren Ozdarendeli, Anant Singh, Gopala Anumanchipalli","While the language modeling objective has been shown to be deeply connected with compression, it is surprising that modern LLMs are not employed in practical text compression systems. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of neural network and transformer-based compression techniques to answer this question. We compare traditional text compression systems with neural network and LLM-based text compression methods. Although LLM-based systems significantly outperform conventional compression methods, they are highly impractical. Specifically, LLMZip, a recent text compression system using Llama3-8B requires 9.5 days to compress just 10 MB of text, although with huge improvements in compression ratios. To overcome this, we present FineZip - a novel LLM-based text compression system that combines ideas of online memorization and dynamic context to reduce the compression time immensely. FineZip can compress the above corpus in approximately 4 hours compared to 9.5 days, a 54 times improvement over LLMZip and comparable performance. FineZip outperforms traditional algorithmic compression methods with a large margin, improving compression ratios by approximately 50\%. With this work, we take the first step towards making lossless text compression with LLMs a reality. While FineZip presents a significant step in that direction, LLMs are still not a viable solution for large-scale text compression. We hope our work paves the way for future research and innovation to solve this problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17141v1,2024-09
Assessing the Level of Toxicity Against Distinct Groups in Bangla Social Media Comments: A Comprehensive Investigation,"Mukaffi Bin Moin, Pronay Debnath, Usafa Akther Rifa, Rijeet Bin Anis","Social media platforms have a vital role in the modern world, serving as conduits for communication, the exchange of ideas, and the establishment of networks. However, the misuse of these platforms through toxic comments, which can range from offensive remarks to hate speech, is a concerning issue. This study focuses on identifying toxic comments in the Bengali language targeting three specific groups: transgender people, indigenous people, and migrant people, from multiple social media sources. The study delves into the intricate process of identifying and categorizing toxic language while considering the varying degrees of toxicity: high, medium, and low. The methodology involves creating a dataset, manual annotation, and employing pre-trained transformer models like Bangla-BERT, bangla-bert-base, distil-BERT, and Bert-base-multilingual-cased for classification. Diverse assessment metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score are employed to evaluate the model's effectiveness. The experimental findings reveal that Bangla-BERT surpasses alternative models, achieving an F1-score of 0.8903. This research exposes the complexity of toxicity in Bangla social media dialogues, revealing its differing impacts on diverse demographic groups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17130v1,2024-09
Plurals: A System for Guiding LLMs Via Simulated Social Ensembles,"Joshua Ashkinaze, Emily Fry, Narendra Edara, Eric Gilbert, Ceren Budak","Recent debates raised concerns that language models may favor certain viewpoints. But what if the solution is not to aim for a 'view from nowhere' but rather to leverage different viewpoints? We introduce Plurals, a system and Python library for pluralistic AI deliberation. Plurals consists of Agents (LLMs, optionally with personas) which deliberate within customizable Structures, with Moderators overseeing deliberation. Plurals is a generator of simulated social ensembles. Plurals integrates with government datasets to create nationally representative personas, includes deliberation templates inspired by deliberative democracy, and allows users to customize both information-sharing structures and deliberation behavior within Structures. Six case studies demonstrate fidelity to theoretical constructs and efficacy. Three randomized experiments show simulated focus groups produced output resonant with an online sample of the relevant audiences (chosen over zero-shot generation in 75% of trials). Plurals is both a paradigm and a concrete system for pluralistic AI.

Programming Every Example: Lifting Pre-training Data Quality like Experts at Scale,"Fan Zhou, Zengzhi Wang, Qian Liu, Junlong Li, Pengfei Liu","Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, and FineWeb. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training.We are open-sourcing ProX with >100B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation.

Can Vision Language Models Learn from Visual Demonstrations of Ambiguous Spatial Reasoning?,"Bowen Zhao, Leo Parker Dirac, Paulina Varshavskaya","Large vision-language models (VLMs) have become state-of-the-art for many computer vision tasks, with in-context learning (ICL) as a popular adaptation strategy for new ones. But can VLMs learn novel concepts purely from visual demonstrations, or are they limited to adapting to the output format of ICL examples? We propose a new benchmark we call Spatial Visual Ambiguity Tasks (SVAT) that challenges state-of-the-art VLMs to learn new visuospatial tasks in-context. We find that VLMs fail to do this zero-shot, and sometimes continue to fail after finetuning. However, adding simpler data to the training by curriculum learning leads to improved ICL performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17080v1,2024-09
Enhancing Post-Hoc Attributions in Long Document Comprehension via Coarse Grained Answer Decomposition,"Pritika Ramu, Koustava Goswami, Apoorv Saxena, Balaji Vasan Srinivasan","Accurately attributing answer text to its source document is crucial for developing a reliable question-answering system. However, attribution for long documents remains largely unexplored. Post-hoc attribution systems are designed to map answer text back to the source document, yet the granularity of this mapping has not been addressed. Furthermore, a critical question arises: What exactly should be attributed? This involves identifying the specific information units within an answer that require grounding. In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel approach to the factual decomposition of generated answers for attribution, employing template-based in-context learning. To accomplish this, we utilize the question and integrate negative sampling during few-shot in-context learning for decomposition. This approach enhances the semantic understanding of both abstractive and extractive answers. We examine the impact of answer decomposition by providing a thorough examination of various attribution approaches, ranging from retrieval-based techniques to LLM-based attributors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17073v4,2024-09
Using LLM for Real-Time Transcription and Summarization of Doctor-Patient Interactions into ePuskesmas in Indonesia,"Azmul Asmar Irfan, Nur Ahmad Khatim, Mansur M. Arief","One of the key issues contributing to inefficiency in Puskesmas is the time-consuming nature of doctor-patient interactions. Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking. By leveraging this solution for real-time transcription, translation, and summarization, doctors can improve the turnaround time for patient care while enhancing the quality of records, which become more detailed and insightful for future visits. This innovation addresses challenges like overcrowded facilities and the administrative burden on healthcare providers in Indonesia. We believe this solution will help doctors save time, provide better care, and produce more accurate medical records, representing a significant step toward modernizing healthcare and ensuring patients receive timely, high-quality care, even in resource-constrained settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17054v1,2024-09

In this paper, we introduce TEMPAMBIQA, a manually annotated temporally ambiguous QA dataset consisting of 8,162 open-domain questions derived from existing datasets. Our annotations focus on capturing temporal ambiguity to study the task of detecting temporally ambiguous questions.

How to Connect Speech Foundation Models and Large Language Models?

In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17044v2,2024-09
Counterfactual Token Generation in Large Language Models,"Ivi Chatzi, Nina Corvelo Benz, Eleni Straitouri, Stratis Tsirtsis, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez","""Sure, I am happy to generate a story for you: Captain Lyra stood at the helm of her trusty ship, the Maelstrom's Fury, gazing out at the endless sea. [...] Lyra's eyes welled up with tears as she realized the bitter truth - she had sacrificed everything for fleeting riches, and lost the love of her crew, her family, and herself."" Although this story, generated by a large language model, is captivating, one may wonder -- how would the story have unfolded if the model had chosen ""Captain Maeve"" as the protagonist instead? We cannot know. State-of-the-art large language models are stateless -- they maintain no internal memory or state. Given a prompt, they generate a sequence of tokens as an output using an autoregressive process. As a consequence, they cannot reason about counterfactual alternatives to tokens they have generated in the past. In this work, our goal is to enhance them with this functionality. To this end, we develop a causal model of token generation that builds upon the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Our model allows any large language model to perform counterfactual token generation at almost no cost in comparison with vanilla token generation, it is embarrassingly simple to implement, and it does not require any fine-tuning nor prompt engineering. We implement our model on Llama 3 8B-Instruct and Ministral-8B-Instruct and conduct a qualitative and a quantitative analysis of counterfactually generated text. We conclude with a demonstrative application of counterfactual token generation for bias detection, unveiling interesting insights about the model of the world constructed by large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17027v2,2024-09
AutoLLM-CARD: Towards a Description and Landscape of Large Language Models,"Shengwei Tian, Lifeng Han, Goran Nenadic","With the rapid growth of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, a vast variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to emerge for diverse NLP tasks. As more papers are published, researchers and developers face the challenge of information overload. Thus, developing a system that can automatically extract and organise key information about LLMs from academic papers is particularly important. The standard format for documenting information about LLMs is the LLM model card (\textbf{LLM-Card}). We propose a method for automatically generating LLM model cards from scientific publications. We use Named Entity Recognition (\textbf{NER}) and Relation Extraction (\textbf{RE}) methods that automatically extract key information about LLMs from the papers, helping researchers to access information about LLMs efficiently. These features include model \textit{licence}, model \textit{name}, and model \textit{application}. With these features, we can form a model card for each paper. We processed 106 academic papers by defining three dictionaries -- LLM's name, licence, and application. 11,051 sentences were extracted through dictionary lookup, and the dataset was constructed through manual review of the final selection of 129 sentences with a link between the name and the \textit{licence}, and 106 sentences with a link between the model name and the \textit{application}. The resulting resource is relevant for LLM card illustrations using relational knowledge graphs. Our code and findings can contribute to automatic LLM card generation. Data and code in \textsc{autoLLM-Card} will be shared and freely available at \url{https://github.com/shengwei-tian/dependency-parser-visualization}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17011v3,2024-09
Models Can and Should Embrace the Communicative Nature of Human-Generated Math,"Sasha Boguraev, Ben Lipkin, Leonie Weissweiler, Kyle Mahowald","Math is constructed by people for people: just as natural language corpora reflect not just propositions but the communicative goals of language users, the math data that models are trained on reflects not just idealized mathematical entities but rich communicative intentions. While there are important advantages to treating math in a purely symbolic manner, we here hypothesize that there are benefits to treating math as situated linguistic communication and that language models are well suited for this goal, in ways that are not fully appreciated. We illustrate these points with two case studies. First, we ran an experiment in which we found that language models interpret the equals sign in a humanlike way -- generating systematically different word problems for the same underlying equation arranged in different ways. Second, we found that language models prefer proofs to be ordered in naturalistic ways, even though other orders would be logically equivalent. We advocate for AI systems that learn from and represent the communicative intentions latent in human-generated math.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17005v2,2024-09
Application of AI-based Models for Online Fraud Detection and Analysis,"Antonis Papasavva, Shane Johnson, Ed Lowther, Samantha Lundrigan, Enrico Mariconti, Anna Markovska, Nilufer Tuptuk","Fraud is a prevalent offence that extends beyond financial loss, causing psychological and physical harm to victims. The advancements in online communication technologies alowed for online fraud to thrive in this vast network, with fraudsters increasingly using these channels for deception. With the progression of technologies like AI, there is a growing concern that fraud will scale up, using sophisticated methods, like deep-fakes in phishing campaigns, all generated by language generation models like ChatGPT. However, the application of AI in detecting and analyzing online fraud remains understudied. We conduct a Systematic Literature Review on AI and NLP techniques for online fraud detection. The review adhered the PRISMA-ScR protocol, with eligibility criteria including relevance to online fraud, use of text data, and AI methodologies. We screened 2,457 academic records, 350 met our eligibility criteria, and included 223. We report the state-of-the-art NLP techniques for analysing various online fraud categories; the training data sources; the NLP algorithms and models built; and the performance metrics employed for model evaluation. We find that current research on online fraud is divided into various scam activitiesand identify 16 different frauds that researchers focus on. This SLR enhances the academic understanding of AI-based detection methods for online fraud and offers insights for policymakers, law enforcement, and businesses on safeguarding against such activities. We conclude that focusing on specific scams lacks generalization, as multiple models are required for different fraud types. The evolving nature of scams limits the effectiveness of models trained on outdated data. We also identify issues in data limitations, training bias reporting, and selective presentation of metrics in model performance reporting, which can lead to potential biases in model evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19022v1,2024-09
AXCEL: Automated eXplainable Consistency Evaluation using LLMs,"P Aditya Sreekar, Sahil Verma, Suransh Chopra, Sarik Ghazarian, Abhishek Persad, Narayanan Sadagopan","Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in both industry and academia for various tasks, yet evaluating the consistency of generated text responses continues to be a challenge. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU show a weak correlation with human judgment. More sophisticated metrics using Natural Language Inference (NLI) have shown improved correlations but are complex to implement, require domain-specific training due to poor cross-domain generalization, and lack explainability. More recently, prompt-based metrics using LLMs as evaluators have emerged; while they are easier to implement, they still lack explainability and depend on task-specific prompts, which limits their generalizability. This work introduces Automated eXplainable Consistency Evaluation using LLMs (AXCEL), a prompt-based consistency metric which offers explanations for the consistency scores by providing detailed reasoning and pinpointing inconsistent text spans. AXCEL is also a generalizable metric which can be adopted to multiple tasks without changing the prompt. AXCEL outperforms both non-prompt and prompt-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics in detecting inconsistencies across summarization by 8.7%, free text generation by 6.2%, and data-to-text conversion tasks by 29.4%. We also evaluate the influence of underlying LLMs on prompt based metric performance and recalibrate the SOTA prompt-based metrics with the latest LLMs for fair comparison. Further, we show that AXCEL demonstrates strong performance using open source LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16984v1,2024-09

Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning Strategies for Dynamic On-Device LLM Personalization,"Rafael Mendoza, Isabella Cruz, Richard Liu, Aarav Deshmukh, David Williams, Jesscia Peng, Rohan Iyer","Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with technology, but their personalization to individual user preferences remains a significant challenge, particularly in on-device applications. Traditional methods often depend heavily on labeled datasets and can be resource-intensive. To address these issues, we present Adaptive Self-Supervised Learning Strategies (ASLS), which utilizes self-supervised learning techniques to personalize LLMs dynamically. The framework comprises a user profiling layer for collecting interaction data and a neural adaptation layer for real-time model fine-tuning. This innovative approach enables continuous learning from user feedback, allowing the model to generate responses that align closely with user-specific contexts. The adaptive mechanisms of ASLS minimize computational demands and enhance personalization efficiency. Experimental results across various user scenarios illustrate the superior performance of ASLS in boosting user engagement and satisfaction, highlighting its potential to redefine LLMs as highly responsive and context-aware systems on-device.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16973v1,2024-09
Weighted Cross-entropy for Low-Resource Languages in Multilingual Speech Recognition,"Andrés Piñeiro-Martín, Carmen García-Mateo, Laura Docío-Fernández, María del Carmen López-Pérez, Georg Rehm","This paper addresses the challenge of integrating low-resource languages into multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. We introduce a novel application of weighted cross-entropy, typically used for unbalanced datasets, to facilitate the integration of low-resource languages into pre-trained multilingual ASR models within the context of continual multilingual learning. We fine-tune the Whisper multilingual ASR model on five high-resource languages and one low-resource language, employing language-weighted dynamic cross-entropy and data augmentation. The results show a remarkable 6.69% word error rate (WER) reduction for the low-resource language compared to the fine-tuned model without applying our approach, and a 48.86% WER reduction compared to the original Whisper model. In addition, our approach yields an average WER reduction of 3.29% across the six languages, showing no degradation for the high-resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16954v1,2024-09
Semi-Supervised Cognitive State Classification from Speech with Multi-View Pseudo-Labeling,"Yuanchao Li, Zixing Zhang, Jing Han, Peter Bell, Catherine Lai","The lack of labeled data is a common challenge in speech classification tasks, particularly those requiring extensive subjective assessment, such as cognitive state classification. In this work, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) framework, introducing a novel multi-view pseudo-labeling method that leverages both acoustic and linguistic characteristics to select the most confident data for training the classification model. Acoustically, unlabeled data are compared to labeled data using the Frechet audio distance, calculated from embeddings generated by multiple audio encoders. Linguistically, large language models are prompted to revise automatic speech recognition transcriptions and predict labels based on our proposed task-specific knowledge. High-confidence data are identified when pseudo-labels from both sources align, while mismatches are treated as low-confidence data. A bimodal classifier is then trained to iteratively label the low-confidence data until a predefined criterion is met. We evaluate our SSL framework on emotion recognition and dementia detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised learning using only 30% of the labeled data and significantly outperforms two selected baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16937v2,2024-09
Investigating OCR-Sensitive Neurons to Improve Entity Recognition in Historical Documents,"Emanuela Boros, Maud Ehrmann","This paper investigates the presence of OCR-sensitive neurons within the Transformer architecture and their influence on named entity recognition (NER) performance on historical documents. By analysing neuron activation patterns in response to clean and noisy text inputs, we identify and then neutralise OCR-sensitive neurons to improve model performance. Based on two open access large language models (Llama2 and Mistral), experiments demonstrate the existence of OCR-sensitive regions and show improvements in NER performance on historical newspapers and classical commentaries, highlighting the potential of targeted neuron modulation to improve models' performance on noisy text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16934v3,2024-09
Cross-lingual Speech Emotion Recognition: Humans vs. Self-Supervised Models,"Zhichen Han, Tianqi Geng, Hui Feng, Jiahong Yuan, Korin Richmond, Yuanchao Li","Utilizing Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has proven effective, yet limited research has explored cross-lingual scenarios. This study presents a comparative analysis between human performance and SSL models, beginning with a layer-wise analysis and an exploration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies in monolingual, cross-lingual, and transfer learning contexts. We further compare the SER ability of models and humans at both utterance- and segment-levels. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dialect on cross-lingual SER through human evaluation. Our findings reveal that models, with appropriate knowledge transfer, can adapt to the target language and achieve performance comparable to native speakers. We also demonstrate the significant effect of dialect on SER for individuals without prior linguistic and paralinguistic background. Moreover, both humans and models exhibit distinct behaviors across different emotions. These results offer new insights into the cross-lingual SER capabilities of SSL models, underscoring both their similarities to and differences from human emotion perception.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16920v1,2024-09
Zero-Shot Detection of LLM-Generated Text using Token Cohesiveness,"Shixuan Ma, Quan Wang","The increasing capability and widespread usage of large language models (LLMs) highlight the desirability of automatic detection of LLM-generated text. Zero-shot detectors, due to their training-free nature, have received considerable attention and notable success. In this paper, we identify a new feature, token cohesiveness, that is useful for zero-shot detection, and we demonstrate that LLM-generated text tends to exhibit higher token cohesiveness than human-written text. Based on this observation, we devise TOCSIN, a generic dual-channel detection paradigm that uses token cohesiveness as a plug-and-play module to improve existing zero-shot detectors. To calculate token cohesiveness, TOCSIN only requires a few rounds of random token deletion and semantic difference measurement, making it particularly suitable for a practical black-box setting where the source model used for generation is not accessible. Extensive experiments with four state-of-the-art base detectors on various datasets, source models, and evaluation settings demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

Pruning Multilingual Large Language Models for Multilingual Inference,"Hwichan Kim, Jun Suzuki, Tosho Hirasawa, Mamoru Komachi","Multilingual large language models (MLLMs), trained on multilingual balanced data, demonstrate better zero-shot learning performance in non-English languages compared to large language models trained on English-dominant data. However, the disparity in performance between English and non-English languages remains a challenge yet to be fully addressed. A distinctive characteristic of MLLMs is their high-quality translation capabilities, indicating an acquired proficiency in aligning between languages. This study explores how to enhance the zero-shot performance of MLLMs in non-English languages by leveraging their alignment capability between English and non-English languages. To achieve this, we first analyze the behavior of MLLMs when performing translation and reveal that there are large magnitude features that play a critical role in the translation process. Inspired by these findings, we retain the weights associated with operations involving the large magnitude features and prune other weights to force MLLMs to rely on these features for tasks beyond translation. We empirically demonstrate that this pruning strategy can enhance the MLLMs' performance in non-English language.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16911v2,2024-09
Enhancing Temporal Sensitivity and Reasoning for Time-Sensitive Question Answering,"Wanqi Yang, Yanda Li, Meng Fang, Ling Chen","Time-Sensitive Question Answering (TSQA) demands the effective utilization of specific temporal contexts, encompassing multiple time-evolving facts, to address time-sensitive questions. This necessitates not only the parsing of temporal information within questions but also the identification and understanding of time-evolving facts to generate accurate answers. However, current large language models still have limited sensitivity to temporal information and their inadequate temporal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances temporal awareness and reasoning through Temporal Information-Aware Embedding and Granular Contrastive Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results on four TSQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing LLMs in TSQA tasks, marking a step forward in bridging the performance gap between machine and human temporal understanding and reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16909v2,2024-09
A Roadmap for Embodied and Social Grounding in LLMs,"Sara Incao, Carlo Mazzola, Giulia Belgiovine, Alessandra Sciutti","The fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotic systems has led to a transformative paradigm in the robotic field, offering unparalleled capabilities not only in the communication domain but also in skills like multimodal input handling, high-level reasoning, and plan generation. The grounding of LLMs knowledge into the empirical world has been considered a crucial pathway to exploit the efficiency of LLMs in robotics. Nevertheless, connecting LLMs' representations to the external world with multimodal approaches or with robots' bodies is not enough to let them understand the meaning of the language they are manipulating. Taking inspiration from humans, this work draws attention to three necessary elements for an agent to grasp and experience the world. The roadmap for LLMs grounding is envisaged in an active bodily system as the reference point for experiencing the environment, a temporally structured experience for a coherent, self-related interaction with the external world, and social skills to acquire a common-grounded shared experience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16900v1,2024-09
Robotic Backchanneling in Online Conversation Facilitation: A Cross-Generational Study,"Sota Kobuki, Katie Seaborn, Seiki Tokunaga, Kosuke Fukumori, Shun Hidaka, Kazuhiro Tamura, Koji Inoue, Tatsuya Kawahara, Mihoko Otake-Mastuura","Japan faces many challenges related to its aging society, including increasing rates of cognitive decline in the population and a shortage of caregivers. Efforts have begun to explore solutions using artificial intelligence (AI), especially socially embodied intelligent agents and robots that can communicate with people. Yet, there has been little research on the compatibility of these agents with older adults in various everyday situations. To this end, we conducted a user study to evaluate a robot that functions as a facilitator for a group conversation protocol designed to prevent cognitive decline. We modified the robot to use backchannelling, a natural human way of speaking, to increase receptiveness of the robot and enjoyment of the group conversation experience. We conducted a cross-generational study with young adults and older adults. Qualitative analyses indicated that younger adults perceived the backchannelling version of the robot as kinder, more trustworthy, and more acceptable than the non-backchannelling robot. Finally, we found that the robot's backchannelling elicited nonverbal backchanneling in older participants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16899v1,2024-09
Shifting from endangerment to rebirth in the Artificial Intelligence Age: An Ensemble Machine Learning Approach for Hawrami Text Classification,"Aram Khaksar, Hossein Hassani","Hawrami, a dialect of Kurdish, is classified as an endangered language as it suffers from the scarcity of data and the gradual loss of its speakers. Natural Language Processing projects can be used to partially compensate for data availability for endangered languages/dialects through a variety of approaches, such as machine translation, language model building, and corpora development. Similarly, NLP projects such as text classification are in language documentation. Several text classification studies have been conducted for Kurdish, but they were mainly dedicated to two particular dialects: Sorani (Central Kurdish) and Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish). In this paper, we introduce various text classification models using a dataset of 6,854 articles in Hawrami labeled into 15 categories by two native speakers. We use K-nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Support Vector Machine (Linear SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT) to evaluate how well those methods perform the classification task. The results indicate that the Linear SVM achieves a 96% of accuracy and outperforms the other approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16884v1,2024-09

Exposing Assumptions in AI Benchmarks through Cognitive Modelling,"Jonathan H. Rystrøm, Kenneth C.

We propose exposing these assumptions using explicit cognitive models formulated as Structural Equation Models. Using cross-lingual alignment transfer as an example, we show how this approach can answer key research questions and identify missing datasets. This framework grounds benchmark construction theoretically and guides dataset development to improve construct measurement. By embracing transparency, we move towards more rigorous, cumulative AI evaluation science, challenging researchers to critically examine their assessment foundations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16849v1,2024-09
CodeInsight: A Curated Dataset of Practical Coding Solutions from Stack Overflow,"Nathanaël Beau, Benoît Crabbé","We introduce a novel dataset tailored for code generation, aimed at aiding developers in common tasks. Our dataset provides examples that include a clarified intent, code snippets associated, and an average of three related unit tests. It encompasses a range of libraries such as \texttt{Pandas}, \texttt{Numpy}, and \texttt{Regex}, along with more than 70 standard libraries in Python code derived from Stack Overflow. Comprising 3,409 crafted examples by Python experts, our dataset is designed for both model finetuning and standalone evaluation. To complete unit tests evaluation, we categorize examples in order to get more fine grained analysis, enhancing the understanding of models' strengths and weaknesses in specific coding tasks. The examples have been refined to reduce data contamination, a process confirmed by the performance of three leading models: Mistral 7B, CodeLLaMa 13B, and Starcoder 15B.

A Few Hypocrites: Few-Shot Learning and Subtype Definitions for Detecting Hypocrisy Accusations in Online Climate Change Debates,"Paulina Garcia Corral, Avishai Green, Hendrik Meyer, Anke Stoll, Xiaoyue Yan, Myrthe Reuver","The climate crisis is a salient issue in online discussions, and hypocrisy accusations are a central rhetorical element in these debates. However, for large-scale text analysis, hypocrisy accusation detection is an understudied tool, most often defined as a smaller subtask of fallacious argument detection. In this paper, we define hypocrisy accusation detection as an independent task in NLP, and identify different relevant subtypes of hypocrisy accusations. Our Climate Hypocrisy Accusation Corpus (CHAC) consists of 420 Reddit climate debate comments, expert-annotated into two different types of hypocrisy accusations: personal versus political hypocrisy. We evaluate few-shot in-context learning with 6 shots and 3 instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting hypocrisy accusations in this dataset. Results indicate that the GPT-4o and Llama-3 models in particular show promise in detecting hypocrisy accusations (F1 reaching 0.68, while previous work shows F1 of 0.44). However, context matters for a complex semantic concept such as hypocrisy accusations, and we find models struggle especially at identifying political hypocrisy accusations compared to personal moral hypocrisy. Our study contributes new insights in hypocrisy detection and climate change discourse, and is a stepping stone for large-scale analysis of hypocrisy accusation in online climate debates.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16807v1,2024-09
Mitigating the Bias of Large Language Model Evaluation,"Hongli Zhou, Hui Huang, Yunfei Long, Bing Xu, Conghui Zhu, Hailong Cao, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao","Recently, there has been a trend of evaluating the Large Language Model (LLM) quality in the flavor of LLM-as-a-Judge, namely leveraging another LLM to evaluate the current output quality. However, existing judges are proven to be biased, namely they would favor answers which present better superficial quality (such as verbosity, fluency) while ignoring the instruction following ability. In this work, we propose systematic research about the bias of LLM-as-a-Judge. Specifically, for closed-source judge models, we apply calibration to mitigate the significance of superficial quality, both on probability level and prompt level. For open-source judge models, we propose to mitigate the bias by contrastive training, with curated negative samples that deviate from instruction but present better superficial quality. We apply our methods on the bias evaluation benchmark, and experiment results show our methods mitigate the bias by a large margin while maintaining a satisfactory evaluation accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16788v1,2024-09
Holistic Automated Red Teaming for Large Language Models through Top-Down Test Case Generation and Multi-turn Interaction,"Jinchuan Zhang, Yan Zhou, Yaxin Liu, Ziming Li, Songlin Hu","Automated red teaming is an effective method for identifying misaligned behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches, however, often focus primarily on improving attack success rates while overlooking the need for comprehensive test case coverage. Additionally, most of these methods are limited to single-turn red teaming, failing to capture the multi-turn dynamics of real-world human-machine interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose HARM (Holistic Automated Red teaMing), which scales up the diversity of test cases using a top-down approach based on an extensible, fine-grained risk taxonomy. Our method also leverages a novel fine-tuning strategy and reinforcement learning techniques to facilitate multi-turn adversarial probing in a human-like manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables a more systematic understanding of model vulnerabilities and offers more targeted guidance for the alignment process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16783v1,2024-09
E-SQL: Direct Schema Linking via Question Enrichment in Text-to-SQL,"Hasan Alp Caferoğlu, Özgür Ulusoy","Translating Natural Language Queries into Structured Query Language (Text-to-SQL or NLQ-to-SQL) is a critical task extensively studied by both the natural language processing and database communities, aimed at providing a natural language interface to databases (NLIDB) and lowering the barrier for non-experts. Despite recent advancements made through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant challenges remain. These include handling complex database schemas, resolving ambiguity in user queries, and generating SQL queries with intricate structures that accurately reflect the user's intent. In this work, we introduce E-SQL, a novel pipeline specifically designed to address these challenges through direct schema linking and candidate predicate augmentation. E-SQL enhances the natural language query by incorporating relevant database items (i.e., tables, columns, and values) and conditions directly into the question, bridging the gap between the query and the database structure. The pipeline leverages candidate predicate augmentation to mitigate erroneous or incomplete predicates in generated SQLs. We further investigate the impact of schema filtering, a technique widely explored in previous work, and demonstrate its diminishing returns when applied alongside advanced large language models. Comprehensive evaluations on the BIRD benchmark illustrate that E-SQL achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling in complex queries with a 66.29% execution accuracy on the test set. All code required to reproduce the reported results is publicly available on our GitHub repository.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16751v1,2024-09
RoleBreak: Character Hallucination as a Jailbreak Attack in Role-Playing Systems,"Yihong Tang, Bo Wang, Xu Wang, Dongming Zhao, Jing Liu, Jijun Zhang, Ruifang He, Yuexian Hou","Role-playing systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly influential in emotional communication applications. However, these systems are susceptible to character hallucinations, where the model deviates from predefined character roles and generates responses that are inconsistent with the intended persona. This paper presents the first systematic analysis of character hallucination from an attack perspective, introducing the RoleBreak framework. Our framework identifies two core mechanisms-query sparsity and role-query conflict-as key factors driving character hallucination. Leveraging these insights, we construct a novel dataset, RoleBreakEval, to evaluate existing hallucination mitigation techniques. Our experiments reveal that even enhanced models trained to minimize hallucination remain vulnerable to attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel defence strategy, the Narrator Mode, which generates supplemental context through narration to mitigate role-query conflicts and improve query generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that Narrator Mode significantly outperforms traditional refusal-based strategies by reducing hallucinations, enhancing fidelity to character roles and queries, and improving overall narrative coherence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16727v1,2024-09
PMSS: Pretrained Matrices Skeleton Selection for LLM Fine-tuning,"Qibin Wang, Xiaolin Hu, Weikai Xu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang","Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have recently gained much interest due to their ability to avoid excessive inference costs. However, LoRA still encounters the following challenges: (1) Limitation of low-rank assumption; and (2) Its initialization method may be suboptimal. To this end, we propose PMSS(Pre-trained Matrices Skeleton Selection), which enables high-rank updates with low costs while leveraging semantic and linguistic information inherent in pre-trained weight. It achieves this by selecting skeletons from the pre-trained weight matrix and only learning a small matrix instead. Experiments demonstrate that PMSS outperforms LoRA and other fine-tuning methods across tasks with much less trainable parameters. We demonstrate its effectiveness, especially in handling complex tasks such as DROP benchmark(+3.4%/+5.9% on LLaMA2-7B/13B) and math reasoning(+12.89%/+5.61%/+3.11% on LLaMA2-7B, Mistral-7B and Gemma-7B of GSM8K).

Vision-Language Model Fine-Tuning via Simple Parameter-Efficient Modification,"Ming Li, Jike Zhong, Chenxin Li, Liuzhuozheng Li, Nie Lin, Masashi Sugiyama","Recent advances in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have witnessed the success of prompt tuning and adapter tuning, while the classic model fine-tuning on inherent parameters seems to be overlooked. It is believed that fine-tuning the parameters of VLMs with few-shot samples corrupts the pre-trained knowledge since fine-tuning the CLIP model even degrades performance. In this paper, we revisit this viewpoint, and propose a new perspective: fine-tuning the specific parameters instead of all will uncover the power of classic model fine-tuning on VLMs. Through our meticulous study, we propose ClipFit, a simple yet effective method to fine-tune CLIP without introducing any overhead of extra parameters. We demonstrate that by only fine-tuning the specific bias terms and normalization layers, ClipFit can improve the performance of zero-shot CLIP by 7.27\% average harmonic mean accuracy. Lastly, to understand how fine-tuning in CLIPFit affects the pre-trained models, we conducted extensive experimental analyses w.r.t. changes in internal parameters and representations. We found that low-level text bias layers and the first layer normalization layer change much more than other layers.

Beyond Turing Test: Can GPT-4 Sway Experts' Decisions?,"Takehiro Takayanagi, Hiroya Takamura, Kiyoshi Izumi, Chung-Chi Chen","In the post-Turing era, evaluating large language models (LLMs) involves assessing generated text based on readers' reactions rather than merely its indistinguishability from human-produced content. This paper explores how LLM-generated text impacts readers' decisions, focusing on both amateur and expert audiences. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 can generate persuasive analyses affecting the decisions of both amateurs and professionals. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated text from the aspects of grammar, convincingness, logical coherence, and usefulness. The results highlight a high correlation between real-world evaluation through audience reactions and the current multi-dimensional evaluators commonly used for generative models. Overall, this paper shows the potential and risk of using generated text to sway human decisions and also points out a new direction for evaluating generated text, i.e., leveraging the reactions and decisions of readers.

Probing Omissions and Distortions in Transformer-based RDF-to-Text Models,"Juliette Faille, Albert Gatt, Claire Gardent","In Natural Language Generation (NLG), important information is sometimes omitted in the output text. To better understand and analyse how this type of mistake arises, we focus on RDF-to-Text generation and explore two methods of probing omissions in the encoder output of BART (Lewis et al, 2020) and of T5 (Raffel et al, 2019): (i) a novel parameter-free probing method based on the computation of cosine similarity between embeddings of RDF graphs and of RDF graphs in which we removed some entities and (ii) a parametric probe which performs binary classification on the encoder embeddings to detect omitted entities. We also extend our analysis to distorted entities, i.e. entities that are not fully correctly mentioned in the generated text (e.g. misspelling of entity, wrong units of measurement). We found that both omitted and distorted entities can be probed in the encoder's output embeddings. This suggests that the encoder emits a weaker signal for these entities and therefore is responsible for some loss of information. This also shows that probing methods can be used to detect mistakes in the output of NLG models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16707v1,2024-09

MSI-Agent: Incorporating Multi-Scale Insight into Embodied Agents for Superior Planning and Decision-Making,"Dayuan Fu, Biqing Qi, Yihuai Gao, Che Jiang, Guanting Dong, Bowen Zhou","Long-term memory is significant for agents, in which insights play a crucial role. However, the emergence of irrelevant insight and the lack of general insight can greatly undermine the effectiveness of insight. To solve this problem, in this paper, we introduce Multi-Scale Insight Agent (MSI-Agent), an embodied agent designed to improve LLMs' planning and decision-making ability by summarizing and utilizing insight effectively across different scales. MSI achieves this through the experience selector, insight generator, and insight selector. Leveraging a three-part pipeline, MSI can generate task-specific and high-level insight, store it in a database, and then use relevant insight from it to aid in decision-making. Our experiments show that MSI outperforms another insight strategy when planning by GPT3.5. Moreover, We delve into the strategies for selecting seed experience and insight, aiming to provide LLM with more useful and relevant insight for better decision-making.

Despite success on multiple benchmarks, they have yet to be compared and their synergy remains unexplored. In this paper, we identify different strengths and weaknesses through evaluating state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets: Text-to-SQL demonstrates superiority in handling questions involving arithmetic operations and long tables; E2E TQA excels in addressing ambiguous questions, non-standard table schema, and complex table contents. To combine both strengths, we propose a Synergistic Table-based Question Answering approach that integrate different models via answer selection, which is agnostic to any model types. Further experiments validate that ensembling models by either feature-based or LLM-based answer selector significantly improves the performance over individual models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16682v2,2024-09
Emotional Dimension Control in Language Model-Based Text-to-Speech: Spanning a Broad Spectrum of Human Emotions,"Kun Zhou, You Zhang, Shengkui Zhao, Hao Wang, Zexu Pan, Dianwen Ng, Chong Zhang, Chongjia Ni, Yukun Ma, Trung Hieu Nguyen, Jia Qi Yip, Bin Ma","Current emotional text-to-speech (TTS) systems face challenges in mimicking a broad spectrum of human emotions due to the inherent complexity of emotions and limitations in emotional speech datasets and models. This paper proposes a TTS framework that facilitates control over pleasure, arousal, and dominance, and can synthesize a diversity of emotional styles without requiring any emotional speech data during TTS training. We train an emotional attribute predictor using only categorical labels from speech data, aligning with psychological research and incorporating anchored dimensionality reduction on self-supervised learning (SSL) features. The TTS framework converts text inputs into phonetic tokens via an autoregressive language model and uses pseudo-emotional dimensions to guide the parallel prediction of fine-grained acoustic details. Experiments conducted on the LibriTTS dataset demonstrate that our framework can synthesize speech with enhanced naturalness and a variety of emotional styles by effectively controlling emotional dimensions, even without the inclusion of any emotional speech during TTS training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16681v1,2024-09
SWE2: SubWord Enriched and Significant Word Emphasized Framework for Hate Speech Detection,"Guanyi Mou, Pengyi Ye, Kyumin Lee","Hate speech detection on online social networks has become one of the emerging hot topics in recent years. With the broad spread and fast propagation speed across online social networks, hate speech makes significant impacts on society by increasing prejudice and hurting people. Therefore, there are aroused attention and concern from both industry and academia. In this paper, we address the hate speech problem and propose a novel hate speech detection framework called SWE2, which only relies on the content of messages and automatically identifies hate speech. In particular, our framework exploits both word-level semantic information and sub-word knowledge. It is intuitively persuasive and also practically performs well under a situation with/without character-level adversarial attack. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves 0.975 accuracy and 0.953 macro F1, outperforming 7 state-of-the-art baselines under no adversarial attack.

DiaSynth: Synthetic Dialogue Generation Framework for Low Resource Dialogue Applications,"Sathya Krishnan Suresh, Wu Mengjun, Tushar Pranav, Eng Siong Chng","The scarcity of domain-specific dialogue datasets limits the development of dialogue systems across applications. Existing research is constrained by general or niche datasets that lack sufficient scale for training dialogue systems. To address this gap, we introduce DiaSynth - a synthetic dialogue generation framework capable of generating high-quality, contextually rich dialogues across a wide range of domains. Unlike existing frameworks, DiaSynth uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to generate dynamic, domain-specific dialogues with simulated personas and diverse conversational features. We perform our experiments by generating synthetic data using different LLMs and few-shot examples from DialogSum and SAMSum. The pretrained language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data outperform the base models by 16.47% on dialogue summarization, while the comparison between models fine-tuned on in-domain data and synthetic data shows that the synthetic data is able to capture 90.48% of the performance distribution of the in-domain data on dialogue summarization. The quality of the data generated also increases as we increase the size of LLM from 3B to 8B. These results validate DiaSynth's potential as a robust alternative to traditional data collection methods. We open source the code and data generated for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19020v2,2024-09
"An Effective, Robust and Fairness-aware Hate Speech Detection Framework","Guanyi Mou, Kyumin Lee","With the widespread online social networks, hate speeches are spreading faster and causing more damage than ever before. Existing hate speech detection methods have limitations in several aspects, such as handling data insufficiency, estimating model uncertainty, improving robustness against malicious attacks, and handling unintended bias (i.e., fairness). There is an urgent need for accurate, robust, and fair hate speech classification in online social networks. To bridge the gap, we design a data-augmented, fairness addressed, and uncertainty estimated novel framework. As parts of the framework, we propose Bidirectional Quaternion-Quasi-LSTM layers to balance effectiveness and efficiency. To build a generalized model, we combine five datasets collected from three platforms. Experiment results show that our model outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods under both no attack scenario and various attack scenarios, indicating the effectiveness and robustness of our model. We share our code along with combined dataset for better future research",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17191v1,2024-09
Topic-aware Causal Intervention for Counterfactual Detection,"Thong Nguyen, Truc-My Nguyen","Counterfactual statements, which describe events that did not or cannot take place, are beneficial to numerous NLP applications. Hence, we consider the problem of counterfactual detection (CFD) and seek to enhance the CFD models. Previous models are reliant on clue phrases to predict counterfactuality, so they suffer from significant performance drop when clue phrase hints do not exist during testing. Moreover, these models tend to predict non-counterfactuals over counterfactuals. To address these issues, we propose to integrate neural topic model into the CFD model to capture the global semantics of the input statement. We continue to causally intervene the hidden representations of the CFD model to balance the effect of the class labels. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art CFD and bias-resolving methods in both the CFD and other bias-sensitive tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16668v2,2024-09
A Character-Centric Creative Story Generation via Imagination,"Kyeongman Park, Minbeom Kim, Kyomin Jung","Creative story generation has long been a goal of NLP research. While existing methodologies have aimed to generate long and coherent stories, they fall significantly short of human capabilities in terms of diversity and character depth. To address this, we introduce a novel story generation framework called CCI (Character-centric Creative story generation via Imagination). CCI features two modules for creative story generation: IG (Image-Guided Imagination) and MW (Multi-Writer model). In the IG module, we utilize a text-to-image model to create visual representations of key story elements, such as characters, backgrounds, and main plots, in a more novel and concrete manner than text-only approaches. The MW module uses these story elements to generate multiple persona-description candidates and selects the best one to insert into the story, thereby enhancing the richness and depth of the narrative. We compared the stories generated by CCI and baseline models through statistical analysis, as well as human and LLM evaluations. The results showed that the IG and MW modules significantly improve various aspects of the stories' creativity. Furthermore, our framework enables interactive multi-modal story generation with users, opening up new possibilities for human-LLM integration in cultural development.

Pre-trained Language Models Return Distinguishable Probability Distributions to Unfaithfully Hallucinated Texts,"Taehun Cha, Donghun Lee","In this work, we show the pre-trained language models return distinguishable generation probability and uncertainty distribution to unfaithfully hallucinated texts, regardless of their size and structure. By examining 24 models on 6 data sets, we find out that 88-98% of cases return statistically significantly distinguishable generation probability and uncertainty distributions. Using this general phenomenon, we showcase a hallucination-reducing training algorithm. Our algorithm outperforms other baselines by achieving higher faithfulness metrics while maintaining sound general text quality measures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16658v1,2024-09
Speech Recognition Rescoring with Large Speech-Text Foundation Models,"Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar, Jari Kolehmainen, Aditya Gourav, Yi Gu, Ankur Gandhe, Ariya Rastrow, Ivan Bulyko","Large language models (LLM) have demonstrated the ability to understand human language by leveraging large amount of text data. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are often limited by available transcribed speech data and benefit from a second pass rescoring using LLM. Recently multi-modal large language models, particularly speech and text foundational models have demonstrated strong spoken language understanding. Speech-Text foundational models leverage large amounts of unlabelled and labelled data both in speech and text modalities to model human language. In this work, we propose novel techniques to use multi-modal LLM for ASR rescoring. We also explore discriminative training to further improve the foundational model rescoring performance. We demonstrate cross-modal knowledge transfer in speech-text LLM can benefit rescoring. Our experiments demonstrate up-to 20% relative improvements over Whisper large ASR and up-to 15% relative improvements over text-only LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16654v1,2024-09
Domain-Independent Automatic Generation of Descriptive Texts for Time-Series Data,"Kota Dohi, Aoi Ito, Harsh Purohit, Tomoya Nishida, Takashi Endo, Yohei Kawaguchi","Due to scarcity of time-series data annotated with descriptive texts, training a model to generate descriptive texts for time-series data is challenging. In this study, we propose a method to systematically generate domain-independent descriptive texts from time-series data. We identify two distinct approaches for creating pairs of time-series data and descriptive texts: the forward approach and the backward approach. By implementing the novel backward approach, we create the Temporal Automated Captions for Observations (TACO) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that a contrastive learning based model trained using the TACO dataset is capable of generating descriptive texts for time-series data in novel domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16647v1,2024-09
Cross-Lingual and Cross-Cultural Variation in Image Descriptions,"Uri Berger, Edoardo M. Ponti","Do speakers of different languages talk differently about what they see? Behavioural and cognitive studies report cultural effects on perception; however, these are mostly limited in scope and hard to replicate. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of cross-lingual variation in image descriptions. Using a multimodal dataset with 31 languages and images from diverse locations, we develop a method to accurately identify entities mentioned in captions and present in the images, then measure how they vary across languages. Our analysis reveals that pairs of languages that are geographically or genetically closer tend to mention the same entities more frequently. We also identify entity categories whose saliency is universally high (such as animate beings), low (clothing accessories) or displaying high variance across languages (landscape). In a case study, we measure the differences in a specific language pair (e.g., Japanese mentions clothing far more frequently than English). Furthermore, our method corroborates previous small-scale studies, including 1) Rosch et al. (1976)'s theory of basic-level categories, demonstrating a preference for entities that are neither too generic nor too specific, and 2) Miyamoto et al. (2006)'s hypothesis that environments afford patterns of perception, such as entity counts. Overall, our work reveals the presence of both universal and culture-specific patterns in entity mentions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16646v3,2024-09
Enabling Auditory Large Language Models for Automatic Speech Quality Evaluation,"Siyin Wang, Wenyi Yu, Yudong Yang, Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Jimin Zhuang, Xianzhao Chen, Xiaohai Tian, Jun Zhang, Guangzhi Sun, Lu Lu, Chao Zhang","Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions. Our data processing scripts and finetuned model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16644v1,2024-09
Training Language Models to Win Debates with Self-Play Improves Judge Accuracy,"Samuel Arnesen, David Rein, Julian Michael","We test the robustness of debate as a method of scalable oversight by training models to debate with data generated via self-play. In a long-context reading comprehension task, we find that language model based evaluators answer questions more accurately when judging models optimized to win debates. By contrast, we find no such relationship for consultancy models trained to persuade a judge without an opposing debater present. In quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our debate models and novel consultancy baselines, we find evidence that debate training encourages stronger and more informative arguments, showing promise that it can help provide high-quality supervision for tasks that are difficult to directly evaluate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16636v1,2024-09
Claim-Guided Textual Backdoor Attack for Practical Applications,"Minkyoo Song, Hanna Kim, Jaehan Kim, Youngjin Jin, Seungwon Shin","Recent advances in natural language processing and the increased use of large language models have exposed new security vulnerabilities, such as backdoor attacks. Previous backdoor attacks require input manipulation after model distribution to activate the backdoor, posing limitations in real-world applicability. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel Claim-Guided Backdoor Attack (CGBA), which eliminates the need for such manipulations by utilizing inherent textual claims as triggers. CGBA leverages claim extraction, clustering, and targeted training to trick models to misbehave on targeted claims without affecting their performance on clean data. CGBA demonstrates its effectiveness and stealthiness across various datasets and models, significantly enhancing the feasibility of practical backdoor attacks. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/PaperCGBA/CGBA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16618v1,2024-09
Evaluating and Enhancing Large Language Models for Novelty Assessment in Scholarly Publications,"Ethan Lin, Zhiyuan Peng, Yi Fang","Recent studies have evaluated the creativity/novelty of large language models (LLMs) primarily from a semantic perspective, using benchmarks from cognitive science. However, accessing the novelty in scholarly publications is a largely unexplored area in evaluating LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a scholarly novelty benchmark (SchNovel) to evaluate LLMs' ability to assess novelty in scholarly papers. SchNovel consists of 15000 pairs of papers across six fields sampled from the arXiv dataset with publication dates spanning 2 to 10 years apart. In each pair, the more recently published paper is assumed to be more novel. Additionally, we propose RAG-Novelty, which simulates the review process taken by human reviewers by leveraging the retrieval of similar papers to assess novelty. Extensive experiments provide insights into the capabilities of different LLMs to assess novelty and demonstrate that RAG-Novelty outperforms recent baseline models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16605v1,2024-09

Collins, Ankit Modi, Robert Lloyd, Benjamin Hopkins, Curtis Langlotz, Jean-Benoit Delbrouck","Recent developments in natural language generation have tremendous implications for healthcare. For instance, state-of-the-art systems could automate the generation of sections in clinical reports to alleviate physician workload and streamline hospital documentation. To explore these applications, we present a shared task consisting of two subtasks: (1) Radiology Report Generation (RRG24) and (2) Discharge Summary Generation (""Discharge Me!""). RRG24 involves generating the 'Findings' and 'Impression' sections of radiology reports given chest X-rays. ""Discharge Me!"" involves generating the 'Brief Hospital Course' and 'Discharge Instructions' sections of discharge summaries for patients admitted through the emergency department. ""Discharge Me!"" submissions were subsequently reviewed by a team of clinicians. Both tasks emphasize the goal of reducing clinician burnout and repetitive workloads by generating documentation. We received 201 submissions from across 8 teams for RRG24, and 211 submissions from across 16 teams for ""Discharge Me!"".",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16603v1,2024-09
Disentangling Questions from Query Generation for Task-Adaptive Retrieval,"Yoonsang Lee, Minsoo Kim, Seung-won Hwang","This paper studies the problem of information retrieval, to adapt to unseen tasks. Existing work generates synthetic queries from domain-specific documents to jointly train the retriever. However, the conventional query generator assumes the query as a question, thus failing to accommodate general search intents. A more lenient approach incorporates task-adaptive elements, such as few-shot learning with an 137B LLM. In this paper, we challenge a trend equating query and question, and instead conceptualize query generation task as a ""compilation"" of high-level intent into task-adaptive query. Specifically, we propose EGG, a query generator that better adapts to wide search intents expressed in the BeIR benchmark. Our method outperforms baselines and existing models on four tasks with underexplored intents, while utilizing a query generator 47 times smaller than the previous state-of-the-art. Our findings reveal that instructing the LM with explicit search intent is a key aspect of modeling an effective query generator.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16570v1,2024-09
Understanding the Cognitive Complexity in Language Elicited by Product Images,"Yan-Ying Chen, Shabnam Hakimi, Monica Van, Francine Chen, Matthew Hong, Matt Klenk, Charlene Wu","Product images (e.g., a phone) can be used to elicit a diverse set of consumer-reported features expressed through language, including surface-level perceptual attributes (e.g., ""white"") and more complex ones, like perceived utility (e.g., ""battery""). The cognitive complexity of elicited language reveals the nature of cognitive processes and the context required to understand them; cognitive complexity also predicts consumers' subsequent choices. This work offers an approach for measuring and validating the cognitive complexity of human language elicited by product images, providing a tool for understanding the cognitive processes of human as well as virtual respondents simulated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We also introduce a large dataset that includes diverse descriptive labels for product images, including human-rated complexity. We demonstrate that human-rated cognitive complexity can be approximated using a set of natural language models that, combined, roughly capture the complexity construct. Moreover, this approach is minimally supervised and scalable, even in use cases with limited human assessment of complexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16521v1,2024-09
RAGProbe: An Automated Approach for Evaluating RAG Applications,"Shangeetha Sivasothy, Scott Barnett, Stefanus Kurniawan, Zafaryab Rasool, Rajesh Vasa","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is increasingly being used when building Generative AI applications. Evaluating these applications and RAG pipelines is mostly done manually, via a trial and error process. Automating evaluation of RAG pipelines requires overcoming challenges such as context misunderstanding, wrong format, incorrect specificity, and missing content. Prior works therefore focused on improving evaluation metrics as well as enhancing components within the pipeline using available question and answer datasets. However, they have not focused on 1) providing a schema for capturing different types of question-answer pairs or 2) creating a set of templates for generating question-answer pairs that can support automation of RAG pipeline evaluation. In this paper, we present a technique for generating variations in question-answer pairs to trigger failures in RAG pipelines. We validate 5 open-source RAG pipelines using 3 datasets. Our approach revealed the highest failure rates when prompts combine multiple questions: 91% for questions when spanning multiple documents and 78% for questions from a single document; indicating a need for developers to prioritise handling these combined questions. 60% failure rate was observed in academic domain dataset and 53% and 62% failure rates were observed in open-domain datasets. Our automated approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, by increasing the failure rate by 51% on average per dataset. Our work presents an automated approach for continuously monitoring the health of RAG pipelines, which can be integrated into existing CI/CD pipelines, allowing for improved quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19019v1,2024-09
A Unified Hallucination Mitigation Framework for Large Vision-Language Models,"Yue Chang, Liqiang Jing, Xiaopeng Zhang, Yue Zhang","Hallucination is a common problem for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with long generations which is difficult to eradicate. The generation with hallucinations is partially inconsistent with the image content. To mitigate hallucination, current studies either focus on the process of model inference or the results of model generation, but the solutions they design sometimes do not deal appropriately with various types of queries and the hallucinations of the generations about these queries. To accurately deal with various hallucinations, we present a unified framework, Dentist, for hallucination mitigation. The core step is to first classify the queries, then perform different processes of hallucination mitigation based on the classification result, just like a dentist first observes the teeth and then makes a plan. In a simple deployment, Dentist can classify queries as perception or reasoning and easily mitigate potential hallucinations in answers which has been demonstrated in our experiments. On MMbench, we achieve a 13.44%/10.2%/15.8% improvement in accuracy on Image Quality, a Coarse Perception visual question answering (VQA) task, over the baseline InstructBLIP/LLaVA/VisualGLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16494v1,2024-09
Exploring Knowledge Tracing in Tutor-Student Dialogues using LLMs,"Alexander Scarlatos, Ryan S. Baker, Andrew Lan","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tutoring chatbots, showing promise in providing broad access to high-quality personalized education. Existing works have studied how to make LLMs follow tutoring principles, but have not studied broader uses of LLMs for supporting tutoring. Up until now, tracing student knowledge and analyzing misconceptions has been difficult and time-consuming to implement for open-ended dialogue tutoring. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can be supportive of this task: we first use LLM prompting methods to identify the knowledge components/skills involved in each dialogue turn, i.e., a tutor utterance posing a task or a student utterance that responds to it. We also evaluate whether the student responds correctly to the tutor and verify the LLM's accuracy using human expert annotations. We then apply a range of knowledge tracing (KT) methods on the resulting labeled data to track student knowledge levels over an entire dialogue. We conduct experiments on two tutoring dialogue datasets, and show that a novel yet simple LLM-based method, LLMKT, significantly outperforms existing KT methods in predicting student response correctness in dialogues. We perform extensive qualitative analyses to highlight the challenges in dialogueKT and outline multiple avenues for future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16490v2,2024-09
Spelling Correction through Rewriting of Non-Autoregressive ASR Lattices,"Leonid Velikovich, Christopher Li, Diamantino Caseiro, Shankar Kumar, Pat Rondon, Kandarp Joshi, Xavier Velez","For end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models, recognizing personal or rare phrases can be hard. A promising way to improve accuracy is through spelling correction (or rewriting) of the ASR lattice, where potentially misrecognized phrases are replaced with acoustically similar and contextually relevant alternatives. However, rewriting is challenging for ASR models trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) due to noisy hypotheses produced by a non-autoregressive, context-independent beam search.   We present a finite-state transducer (FST) technique for rewriting wordpiece lattices generated by Transformer-based CTC models. Our algorithm performs grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion directly from wordpieces into phonemes, avoiding explicit word representations and exploiting the richness of the CTC lattice. Our approach requires no retraining or modification of the ASR model. We achieved up to a 15.2% relative reduction in sentence error rate (SER) on a test set with contextually relevant entities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16469v1,2024-09
"Strategies for Improving NL-to-FOL Translation with LLMs: Data Generation, Incremental Fine-Tuning, and Verification","Ramya Keerthy Thatikonda, Jiuzhou Han, Wray Buntine, Ehsan Shareghi","Logical reasoning is a fundamental task in natural language processing that presents significant challenges to Large Language Models (LLMs). The inherent characteristics of logical reasoning makes it well-suited for symbolic representations such as first-order logic (FOL). Research in symbolic logical reasoning explored FOL generation using state-of-the-art LLMs (i.e., GPT-4) to produce FOL translations of natural language (NL) statements, but errors in translation are usually not the focus. We address this by categorizing the translation errors in FOL statements generated by LLMs. To make progress towards improving the quality of FOL translations for smaller language models such as LLaMA-2 13B and Mistral 7B, we create ProofFOL, a high-quality FOL-annotated subset of ProofWriter dataset using GPT-4o. The models fine-tuned on this silver standard data achieve a significant gain in performance when compared to larger language models such as LLaMA-2 70B. In addition to improving the model using large data, we also tackle the issue of data scarcity and introduce an incremental framework encompassing of data augmentation and verification steps. In the augmentation process, a single pair of (premises, conclusion) is split into multiple new instances based on the predicates and FOLs. This data is used for fine-tuning, and the inference on this model generates FOLs with fewer errors over the model trained on the original data. Our investigation on the translation errors leads to generation of a perturbation dataset, which is used to train a verifier that corrects potential syntactic and semantic FOL translation errors. We demonstrate an efficient method for making the most of a limited existing human-annotated dataset. Our results show state-of-the-art performance for ProofWriter and ProntoQA datasets using ProofFOL on LLaMA-2 and Mistral models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16461v1,2024-09
FMDLlama: Financial Misinformation Detection based on Large Language Models,"Zhiwei Liu, Xin Zhang, Kailai Yang, Qianqian Xie, Jimin Huang, Sophia Ananiadou","The emergence of social media has made the spread of misinformation easier. In the financial domain, the accuracy of information is crucial for various aspects of financial market, which has made financial misinformation detection (FMD) an urgent problem that needs to be addressed. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various fields. However, current studies mostly rely on traditional methods and have not explored the application of LLMs in the field of FMD. The main reason is the lack of FMD instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks. In this paper, we propose FMDLlama, the first open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for FMD task based on fine-tuning Llama3.1 with instruction data, the first multi-task FMD instruction dataset (FMDID) to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive FMD evaluation benchmark (FMD-B) with classification and explanation generation tasks to test the FMD ability of LLMs. We compare our models with a variety of LLMs on FMD-B, where our model outperforms all other open-sourced LLMs as well as ChatGPT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16452v1,2024-09

Revisiting Acoustic Features for Robust ASR,"Muhammad A. Shah, Bhiksha Raj","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems must be robust to the myriad types of noises present in real-world environments including environmental noise, room impulse response, special effects as well as attacks by malicious actors (adversarial attacks). Recent works seek to improve accuracy and robustness by developing novel Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and curating diverse training datasets for them, while using relatively simple acoustic features. While this approach improves robustness to the types of noise present in the training data, it confers limited robustness against unseen noises and negligible robustness to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we revisit the approach of earlier works that developed acoustic features inspired by biological auditory perception that could be used to perform accurate and robust ASR. In contrast, Specifically, we evaluate the ASR accuracy and robustness of several biologically inspired acoustic features. In addition to several features from prior works, such as gammatone filterbank features (GammSpec), we also propose two new acoustic features called frequency masked spectrogram (FreqMask) and difference of gammatones spectrogram (DoGSpec) to simulate the neuro-psychological phenomena of frequency masking and lateral suppression. Experiments on diverse models and datasets show that (1) DoGSpec achieves significantly better robustness than the highly popular log mel spectrogram (LogMelSpec) with minimal accuracy degradation, and (2) GammSpec achieves better accuracy and robustness to non-adversarial noises from the Speech Robust Bench benchmark, but it is outperformed by DoGSpec against adversarial attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16399v1,2024-09

To enhance results, we introduce RISCORE (RIddle Solving with COntext REcontruciton) a novel fully automated prompting method that generates and utilizes contextually reconstructed sentence-based puzzles in conjunction with the original examples to create few-shot exemplars. Our experiments demonstrate that RISCORE significantly improves the performance of language models in both vertical and lateral thinking tasks, surpassing traditional exemplar selection strategies across a variety of few-shot settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16383v4,2024-09

Quality Matters: Evaluating Synthetic Data for Tool-Using LLMs,"Shadi Iskander, Nachshon Cohen, Zohar Karnin, Ori Shapira, Sofia Tolmach","Training large language models (LLMs) for external tool usage is a rapidly expanding field, with recent research focusing on generating synthetic data to address the shortage of available data. However, the absence of systematic data quality checks poses complications for properly training and testing models. To that end, we propose two approaches for assessing the reliability of data for training LLMs to use external tools. The first approach uses intuitive, human-defined correctness criteria. The second approach uses a model-driven assessment with in-context evaluation. We conduct a thorough evaluation of data quality on two popular benchmarks, followed by an extrinsic evaluation that showcases the impact of data quality on model performance. Our results demonstrate that models trained on high-quality data outperform those trained on unvalidated data, even when trained with a smaller quantity of data. These findings empirically support the significance of assessing and ensuring the reliability of training data for tool-using LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16341v2,2024-09

Towards Enhancing Linked Data Retrieval in Conversational UIs using Large Language Models,"Omar Mussa, Omer Rana, Benoît Goossens, Pablo Orozco-Terwengel, Charith Perera","Despite the recent broad adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, their potential for enriching information systems in extracting and exploring Linked Data (LD) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplestores has not been extensively explored. This paper examines the integration of LLMs within existing systems, emphasising the enhancement of conversational user interfaces (UIs) and their capabilities for data extraction by producing more accurate SPARQL queries without the requirement for model retraining. Typically, conversational UI models necessitate retraining with the introduction of new datasets or updates, limiting their functionality as general-purpose extraction tools. Our approach addresses this limitation by incorporating LLMs into the conversational UI workflow, significantly enhancing their ability to comprehend and process user queries effectively. By leveraging the advanced natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, our method improves RDF entity extraction within web systems employing conventional chatbots. This integration facilitates a more nuanced and context-aware interaction model, critical for handling the complex query patterns often encountered in RDF datasets and Linked Open Data (LOD) endpoints. The evaluation of this methodology shows a marked enhancement in system expressivity and the accuracy of responses to user queries, indicating a promising direction for future research in this area. This investigation not only underscores the versatility of LLMs in enhancing existing information systems but also sets the stage for further explorations into their potential applications within more specialised domains of web information systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16220v1,2024-09
HelloBench: Evaluating Long Text Generation Capabilities of Large Language Models,"Haoran Que, Feiyu Duan, Liqun He, Yutao Mou, Wangchunshu Zhou, Jiaheng Liu, Wenge Rong, Zekun Moore Wang, Jian Yang, Ge Zhang, Junran Peng, Zhaoxiang Zhang, Songyang Zhang, Kai Chen","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks (e.g., long-context understanding), and many benchmarks have been proposed. However, we observe that long text generation capabilities are not well investigated. Therefore, we introduce the Hierarchical Long Text Generation Benchmark (HelloBench), a comprehensive, in-the-wild, and open-ended benchmark to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating long text. Based on Bloom's Taxonomy, HelloBench categorizes long text generation tasks into five subtasks: open-ended QA, summarization, chat, text completion, and heuristic text generation. Besides, we propose Hierarchical Long Text Evaluation (HelloEval), a human-aligned evaluation method that significantly reduces the time and effort required for human evaluation while maintaining a high correlation with human evaluation. We have conducted extensive experiments across around 30 mainstream LLMs and observed that the current LLMs lack long text generation capabilities. Specifically, first, regardless of whether the instructions include explicit or implicit length constraints, we observe that most LLMs cannot generate text that is longer than 4000 words. Second, we observe that while some LLMs can generate longer text, many issues exist (e.g., severe repetition and quality degradation). Third, to demonstrate the effectiveness of HelloEval, we compare HelloEval with traditional metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU, etc.) and LLM-as-a-Judge methods, which show that HelloEval has the highest correlation with human evaluation. We release our code in https://github.com/Quehry/HelloBench.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16191v1,2024-09
Merging LoRAs like Playing LEGO: Pushing the Modularity of LoRA to Extremes Through Rank-Wise Clustering,"Ziyu Zhao, Tao Shen, Didi Zhu, Zexi Li, Jing Su, Xuwu Wang, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu","Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to various domains due to its modular design and widespread availability on platforms like Huggingface. This modularity has sparked interest in combining multiple LoRAs to enhance LLM capabilities. However, existing methods for LoRA composition primarily focus on task-specific adaptations that require additional training, and current model merging techniques often fail to fully leverage LoRA's modular nature, leading to parameter interference and performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of disassembling and reassembling multiple LoRAs at a finer granularity, analogous to assembling LEGO blocks. We introduce the concept of Minimal Semantic Units (MSUs), where the parameters corresponding to each rank in LoRA function as independent units. These MSUs demonstrate permutation invariance and concatenation-summation equivalence properties, enabling flexible combinations to create new LoRAs. Building on these insights, we propose the LoRA-LEGO framework. This framework conducts rank-wise parameter clustering by grouping MSUs from different LoRAs into $k$ clusters. The centroid of each cluster serves as a representative MSU, enabling the assembly of a merged LoRA with an adjusted rank of $k$. Additionally, we apply a dual reweighting strategy to optimize the scale of the merged LoRA. Experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in LoRA merging.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16167v3,2024-09
Controlling Risk of Retrieval-augmented Generation: A Counterfactual Prompting Framework,"Lu Chen, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a popular solution to mitigate the hallucination issues of large language models. However, existing studies on RAG seldom address the issue of predictive uncertainty, i.e., how likely it is that a RAG model's prediction is incorrect, resulting in uncontrollable risks in real-world applications. In this work, we emphasize the importance of risk control, ensuring that RAG models proactively refuse to answer questions with low confidence. Our research identifies two critical latent factors affecting RAG's confidence in its predictions: the quality of the retrieved results and the manner in which these results are utilized. To guide RAG models in assessing their own confidence based on these two latent factors, we develop a counterfactual prompting framework that induces the models to alter these factors and analyzes the effect on their answers. We also introduce a benchmarking procedure to collect answers with the option to abstain, facilitating a series of experiments. For evaluation, we introduce several risk-related metrics and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and benchmark dataset are available at https://github.com/ict-bigdatalab/RC-RAG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16146v2,2024-09
HA-FGOVD: Highlighting Fine-grained Attributes via Explicit Linear Composition for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection,"Yuqi Ma, Mengyin Liu, Chao Zhu, Xu-Cheng Yin","Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models are considered to be Large Multi-modal Models (LMM), due to their extensive training data and a large number of parameters. Mainstream OVD models prioritize object coarse-grained category rather than focus on their fine-grained attributes, e.g., colors or materials, thus failed to identify objects specified with certain attributes. However, OVD models are pretrained on large-scale image-text pairs with rich attribute words, whose latent feature space can represent the global text feature as a linear composition of fine-grained attribute tokens without highlighting them. Therefore, we propose in this paper a universal and explicit approach for frozen mainstream OVD models that boosts their attribute-level detection capabilities by highlighting fine-grained attributes in explicit linear space. Firstly, a LLM is leveraged to highlight attribute words within the input text as a zero-shot prompted task. Secondly, by strategically adjusting the token masks, the text encoders of OVD models extract both global text and attribute-specific features, which are then explicitly composited as two vectors in linear space to form the new attribute-highlighted feature for detection tasks, where corresponding scalars are hand-crafted or learned to reweight both two vectors. Notably, these scalars can be seamlessly transferred among different OVD models, which proves that such an explicit linear composition is universal. Empirical evaluation on the FG-OVD dataset demonstrates that our proposed method uniformly improves fine-grained attribute-level OVD of various mainstream models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16136v1,2024-09
Implicit assessment of language learning during practice as accurate as explicit testing,"Jue Hou, Anisia Katinskaia, Anh-Duc Vu, Roman Yangarber","Assessment of proficiency of the learner is an essential part of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). We use Item Response Theory (IRT) in computer-aided language learning for assessment of student ability in two contexts: in test sessions, and in exercises during practice sessions. Exhaustive testing across a wide range of skills can provide a detailed picture of proficiency, but may be undesirable for a number of reasons. Therefore, we first aim to replace exhaustive tests with efficient but accurate adaptive tests. We use learner data collected from exhaustive tests under imperfect conditions, to train an IRT model to guide adaptive tests. Simulations and experiments with real learner data confirm that this approach is efficient and accurate. Second, we explore whether we can accurately estimate learner ability directly from the context of practice with exercises, without testing. We transform learner data collected from exercise sessions into a form that can be used for IRT modeling. This is done by linking the exercises to {\em linguistic constructs}; the constructs are then treated as ""items"" within IRT. We present results from large-scale studies with thousands of learners. Using teacher assessments of student ability as ""ground truth,"" we compare the estimates obtained from tests vs. those from exercises. The experiments confirm that the IRT models can produce accurate ability estimation based on exercises.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16133v1,2024-09
MOSS: Enabling Code-Driven Evolution and Context Management for AI Agents,"Ming Zhu, Yi Zhou","Developing AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) faces significant challenges in achieving true Turing completeness and adaptive, code-driven evolution. Current approaches often generate code independently of its runtime context, relying heavily on the LLM's memory, which results in inefficiencies and limits adaptability. Manual protocol development in sandbox environments further constrains the agent's autonomous adaptability. Crucially, achieving consistency in code and context across multi-turn interactions and ensuring isolation of local variables within each interaction remains an unsolved problem.   We introduce MOSS (llM-oriented Operating System Simulation), a novel framework that addresses these challenges by integrating code generation with a dynamic context management system. MOSS ensures consistency and adaptability by using a mechanism that maintains the Python context across interactions, including isolation of local variables and preservation of runtime integrity. At its core, the framework employs an Inversion of Control (IoC) container in conjunction with decorators to enforce the least knowledge principle, allowing agents to focus on abstract interfaces rather than concrete implementations. This facilitates seamless integration of new tools and libraries, enables runtime instance replacement, and reduces prompt complexity, providing a ""what you see is what you get"" environment for the agent.   Through a series of case studies, we show how this framework can enhance the efficiency and capabilities of agent development and highlight its advantages in moving towards Turing-complete agents capable of evolving through code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16120v1,2024-09
Exploring Hint Generation Approaches in Open-Domain Question Answering,"Jamshid Mozafari, Abdelrahman Abdallah, Bhawna Piryani, Adam Jatowt","Automatic Question Answering (QA) systems rely on contextual information to provide accurate answers. Commonly, contexts are prepared through either retrieval-based or generation-based methods. The former involves retrieving relevant documents from a corpus like Wikipedia, whereas the latter uses generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the context. In this paper, we introduce a novel context preparation approach called HINTQA, which employs Automatic Hint Generation (HG) techniques. Unlike traditional methods, HINTQA prompts LLMs to produce hints about potential answers for the question rather than generating relevant context. We evaluate our approach across three QA datasets including TriviaQA, NaturalQuestions, and Web Questions, examining how the number and order of hints impact performance. Our findings show that the HINTQA surpasses both retrieval-based and generation-based approaches. We demonstrate that hints enhance the accuracy of answers more than retrieved and generated contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16096v1,2024-09
Unlocking Markets: A Multilingual Benchmark to Cross-Market Question Answering,"Yifei Yuan, Yang Deng, Anders Søgaard, Mohammad Aliannejadi","Users post numerous product-related questions on e-commerce platforms, affecting their purchase decisions. Product-related question answering (PQA) entails utilizing product-related resources to provide precise responses to users. We propose a novel task of Multilingual Cross-market Product-based Question Answering (MCPQA) and define the task as providing answers to product-related questions in a main marketplace by utilizing information from another resource-rich auxiliary marketplace in a multilingual context. We introduce a large-scale dataset comprising over 7 million questions from 17 marketplaces across 11 languages. We then perform automatic translation on the Electronics category of our dataset, naming it as McMarket. We focus on two subtasks: review-based answer generation and product-related question ranking. For each subtask, we label a subset of McMarket using an LLM and further evaluate the quality of the annotations via human assessment. We then conduct experiments to benchmark our dataset, using models ranging from traditional lexical models to LLMs in both single-market and cross-market scenarios across McMarket and the corresponding LLM subset. Results show that incorporating cross-market information significantly enhances performance in both tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16025v1,2024-09
AI Can Be Cognitively Biased: An Exploratory Study on Threshold Priming in LLM-Based Batch Relevance Assessment,"Nuo Chen, Jiqun Liu, Xiaoyu Dong, Qijiong Liu, Tetsuya Sakai, Xiao-Ming Wu","Cognitive biases are systematic deviations in thinking that lead to irrational judgments and problematic decision-making, extensively studied across various fields. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown advanced understanding capabilities but may inherit human biases from their training data. While social biases in LLMs have been well-studied, cognitive biases have received less attention, with existing research focusing on specific scenarios. The broader impact of cognitive biases on LLMs in various decision-making contexts remains underexplored. We investigated whether LLMs are influenced by the threshold priming effect in relevance judgments, a core task and widely-discussed research topic in the Information Retrieval (IR) coummunity. The priming effect occurs when exposure to certain stimuli unconsciously affects subsequent behavior and decisions. Our experiment employed 10 topics from the TREC 2019 Deep Learning passage track collection, and tested AI judgments under different document relevance scores, batch lengths, and LLM models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa2-13B and LLaMa2-70B. Results showed that LLMs tend to give lower scores to later documents if earlier ones have high relevance, and vice versa, regardless of the combination and model used. Our finding demonstrates that LLM%u2019s judgments, similar to human judgments, are also influenced by threshold priming biases, and suggests that researchers and system engineers should take into account potential human-like cognitive biases in designing, evaluating, and auditing LLMs in IR tasks and beyond.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16022v2,2024-09
Bridging Speech and Text: Enhancing ASR with Pinyin-to-Character Pre-training in LLMs,"Yang Yuhang, Peng Yizhou, Eng Siong Chng, Xionghu Zhong","The integration of large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained speech models has opened up new avenues in automatic speech recognition (ASR). While LLMs excel in multimodal understanding tasks, effectively leveraging their capabilities for ASR remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel training approach to enhance LLM performance in ASR tasks. We propose pre-training LLMs on Pinyin embedding sequences, which represent pronunciation features, to generate corresponding Chinese characters. This step enables the LLM to adapt to generating text from pronunciation features before encountering real speech data. Furthermore, we fine-tune the LoRA parameters to enhance the LLM's understanding of speech modality information. In AISHELL-1 corpus, our approach yields a 9.5% relative improvement in ASR tasks compared to the baseline without Pinyi-to-Character pre-training. Additionally, incorporating auxiliary text data for Pinyi-to-Character pre-training further boosts performance, achieving a 19.0% relative improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16005v1,2024-09
Finetuning LLMs for Comparative Assessment Tasks,"Vatsal Raina, Adian Liusie, Mark Gales","Automated assessment in natural language generation is a challenging task. Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in reference-free evaluation, particularly through comparative assessment. However, the quadratic computational complexity of pairwise comparisons limits its scalability. To address this, efficient comparative assessment has been explored by applying comparative strategies on zero-shot LLM probabilities. We propose a framework for finetuning LLMs for comparative assessment to align the model's output with the target distribution of comparative probabilities. By training on soft probabilities, our approach improves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high performance with an efficient subset of comparisons.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15979v1,2024-09
TCSinger: Zero-Shot Singing Voice Synthesis with Style Transfer and Multi-Level Style Control,"Yu Zhang, Ziyue Jiang, Ruiqi Li, Changhao Pan, Jinzheng He, Rongjie Huang, Chuxin Wang, Zhou Zhao","Zero-shot singing voice synthesis (SVS) with style transfer and style control aims to generate high-quality singing voices with unseen timbres and styles (including singing method, emotion, rhythm, technique, and pronunciation) from audio and text prompts. However, the multifaceted nature of singing styles poses a significant challenge for effective modeling, transfer, and control. Furthermore, current SVS models often fail to generate singing voices rich in stylistic nuances for unseen singers. To address these challenges, we introduce TCSinger, the first zero-shot SVS model for style transfer across cross-lingual speech and singing styles, along with multi-level style control. Specifically, TCSinger proposes three primary modules: 1) the clustering style encoder employs a clustering vector quantization model to stably condense style information into a compact latent space; 2) the Style and Duration Language Model (S\&D-LM) concurrently predicts style information and phoneme duration, which benefits both; 3) the style adaptive decoder uses a novel mel-style adaptive normalization method to generate singing voices with enhanced details. Experimental results show that TCSinger outperforms all baseline models in synthesis quality, singer similarity, and style controllability across various tasks, including zero-shot style transfer, multi-level style control, cross-lingual style transfer, and speech-to-singing style transfer.

Beats of Bias: Analyzing Lyrics with Topic Modeling and Gender Bias Measurements,"Danqing Chen, Adithi Satish, Rasul Khanbayov, Carolin M. Schuster, Georg Groh","This paper uses topic modeling and bias measurement techniques to analyze and determine gender bias in English song lyrics. We utilize BERTopic to cluster 537,553 English songs into distinct topics and chart their development over time. Our analysis shows the thematic shift in song lyrics over the years, from themes of romance to the increasing sexualization of women in songs. We observe large amounts of profanity and misogynistic lyrics on various topics, especially in the overall biggest cluster. Furthermore, to analyze gender bias across topics and genres, we employ the Single Category Word Embedding Association Test (SC-WEAT) to compute bias scores for the word embeddings trained on the most popular topics as well as for each genre. We find that words related to intelligence and strength tend to show a male bias across genres, as opposed to appearance and weakness words, which are more female-biased; however, a closer look also reveals differences in biases across topics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15949v1,2024-09
Automated test generation to evaluate tool-augmented LLMs as conversational AI agents,"Samuel Arcadinho, David Aparicio, Mariana Almeida","Tool-augmented LLMs are a promising approach to create AI agents that can have realistic conversations, follow procedures, and call appropriate functions. However, evaluating them is challenging due to the diversity of possible conversations, and existing datasets focus only on single interactions and function-calling. We present a test generation pipeline to evaluate LLMs as conversational AI agents. Our framework uses LLMs to generate diverse tests grounded on user-defined procedures. For that, we use intermediate graphs to limit the LLM test generator's tendency to hallucinate content that is not grounded on input procedures, and enforces high coverage of the possible conversations. Additionally, we put forward ALMITA, a manually curated dataset for evaluating AI agents in customer support, and use it to evaluate existing LLMs. Our results show that while tool-augmented LLMs perform well in single interactions, they often struggle to handle complete conversations. While our focus is on customer support, our method is general and capable of AI agents for different domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15934v2,2024-09
SLIMER-IT: Zero-Shot NER on Italian Language,"Andrew Zamai, Leonardo Rigutini, Marco Maggini, Andrea Zugarini","Traditional approaches to Named Entity Recognition (NER) frame the task into a BIO sequence labeling problem. Although these systems often excel in the downstream task at hand, they require extensive annotated data and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution input domains and unseen entity types. On the contrary, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities. While several works address Zero-Shot NER in English, little has been done in other languages. In this paper, we define an evaluation framework for Zero-Shot NER, applying it to the Italian language. Furthermore, we introduce SLIMER-IT, the Italian version of SLIMER, an instruction-tuning approach for zero-shot NER leveraging prompts enriched with definition and guidelines. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art models, demonstrate the superiority of SLIMER-IT on never-seen-before entity tags.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15933v2,2024-09

Explaining word embeddings with perfect fidelity: Case study in research impact prediction,"Lucie Dvorackova, Marcin P. Joachimiak, Michal Cerny, Adriana Kubecova, Vilem Sklenak, Tomas Kliegr","Best performing approaches for scholarly document quality prediction are based on embedding models, which do not allow direct explanation of classifiers as distinct words no longer correspond to the input features for model training. Although model-agnostic explanation methods such as Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) can be applied, these produce results with questionable correspondence to the ML model. We introduce a new feature importance method, Self-model Rated Entities (SMER), for logistic regression-based classification models trained on word embeddings. We show that SMER has theoretically perfect fidelity with the explained model, as its prediction corresponds exactly to the average of predictions for individual words in the text. SMER allows us to reliably determine which words or entities positively contribute to predicting impactful articles. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation is performed through five diverse experiments conducted on 50.000 research papers from the CORD-19 corpus. Through an AOPC curve analysis, we experimentally demonstrate that SMER produces better explanations than LIME for logistic regression.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15912v1,2024-09
A Modular-based Strategy for Mitigating Gradient Conflicts in Simultaneous Speech Translation,"Xiaoqian Liu, Yangfan Du, Jianjin Wang, Yuan Ge, Chen Xu, Tong Xiao, Guocheng Chen, Jingbo Zhu","Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) involves generating target language text while continuously processing streaming speech input, presenting significant real-time challenges. Multi-task learning is often employed to enhance SimulST performance but introduces optimization conflicts between primary and auxiliary tasks, potentially compromising overall efficiency. The existing model-level conflict resolution methods are not well-suited for this task which exacerbates inefficiencies and leads to high GPU memory consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a Modular Gradient Conflict Mitigation (MGCM) strategy that detects conflicts at a finer-grained modular level and resolves them utilizing gradient projection. Experimental results demonstrate that MGCM significantly improves SimulST performance, particularly under medium and high latency conditions, achieving a 0.68 BLEU score gain in offline tasks. Additionally, MGCM reduces GPU memory consumption by over 95\% compared to other conflict mitigation methods, establishing it as a robust solution for SimulST tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15911v3,2024-09
Enhancing Text-to-SQL Capabilities of Large Language Models via Domain Database Knowledge Injection,"Xingyu Ma, Xin Tian, Lingxiang Wu, Xuepeng Wang, Xueming Tang, Jinqiao Wang","Text-to-SQL is a subtask in semantic parsing that has seen rapid progress with the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, LLMs face challenges due to hallucination issues and a lack of domain-specific database knowledge(such as table schema and cell values). As a result, they can make errors in generating table names, columns, and matching values to the correct columns in SQL statements. This paper introduces a method of knowledge injection to enhance LLMs' ability to understand schema contents by incorporating prior knowledge. This approach improves their performance in Text-to-SQL tasks. Experimental results show that pre-training LLMs on domain-specific database knowledge and fine-tuning them on downstream Text-to-SQL tasks significantly improves the Execution Match (EX) and Exact Match (EM) metrics across various models. This effectively reduces errors in generating column names and matching values to the columns. Furthermore, the knowledge-injected models can be applied to many downstream Text-to-SQL tasks, demonstrating the generalizability of the approach presented in this paper.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15907v1,2024-09
Konstruktor: A Strong Baseline for Simple Knowledge Graph Question Answering,"Maria Lysyuk, Mikhail Salnikov, Pavel Braslavski, Alexander Panchenko","While being one of the most popular question types, simple questions such as ""Who is the author of Cinderella?"", are still not completely solved. Surprisingly, even the most powerful modern Large Language Models are prone to errors when dealing with such questions, especially when dealing with rare entities. At the same time, as an answer may be one hop away from the question entity, one can try to develop a method that uses structured knowledge graphs (KGs) to answer such questions. In this paper, we introduce Konstruktor - an efficient and robust approach that breaks down the problem into three steps: (i) entity extraction and entity linking, (ii) relation prediction, and (iii) querying the knowledge graph. Our approach integrates language models and knowledge graphs, exploiting the power of the former and the interpretability of the latter. We experiment with two named entity recognition and entity linking methods and several relation detection techniques. We show that for relation detection, the most challenging step of the workflow, a combination of relation classification/generation and ranking outperforms other methods.

HLB: Benchmarking LLMs' Humanlikeness in Language Use,"Xufeng Duan, Bei Xiao, Xuemei Tang, Zhenguang G. Cai","As synthetic data becomes increasingly prevalent in training language models, particularly through generated dialogue, concerns have emerged that these models may deviate from authentic human language patterns, potentially losing the richness and creativity inherent in human communication. This highlights the critical need to assess the humanlikeness of language models in real-world language use. In this paper, we present a comprehensive humanlikeness benchmark (HLB) evaluating 20 large language models (LLMs) using 10 psycholinguistic experiments designed to probe core linguistic aspects, including sound, word, syntax, semantics, and discourse (see https://huggingface.co/spaces/XufengDuan/HumanLikeness). To anchor these comparisons, we collected responses from over 2,000 human participants and compared them to outputs from the LLMs in these experiments.   For rigorous evaluation, we developed a coding algorithm that accurately identified language use patterns, enabling the extraction of response distributions for each task. By comparing the response distributions between human participants and LLMs, we quantified humanlikeness through distributional similarity. Our results reveal fine-grained differences in how well LLMs replicate human responses across various linguistic levels. Importantly, we found that improvements in other performance metrics did not necessarily lead to greater humanlikeness, and in some cases, even resulted in a decline. By introducing psycholinguistic methods to model evaluation, this benchmark offers the first framework for systematically assessing the humanlikeness of LLMs in language use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15890v1,2024-09

Privacy Evaluation Benchmarks for NLP Models,"Wei Huang, Yinggui Wang, Cen Chen","By inducing privacy attacks on NLP models, attackers can obtain sensitive information such as training data and model parameters, etc. Although researchers have studied, in-depth, several kinds of attacks in NLP models, they are non-systematic analyses. It lacks a comprehensive understanding of the impact caused by the attacks. For example, we must consider which scenarios can apply to which attacks, what the common factors are that affect the performance of different attacks, the nature of the relationships between different attacks, and the influence of various datasets and models on the effectiveness of the attacks, etc. Therefore, we need a benchmark to holistically assess the privacy risks faced by NLP models. In this paper, we present a privacy attack and defense evaluation benchmark in the field of NLP, which includes the conventional/small models and large language models (LLMs). This benchmark supports a variety of models, datasets, and protocols, along with standardized modules for comprehensive evaluation of attacks and defense strategies. Based on the above framework, we present a study on the association between auxiliary data from different domains and the strength of privacy attacks.

While Large Language Models (LLMs)-based systems show promising zero-shot DST performance, they either require extensive computational resources or they underperform existing fully-trained systems, limiting their practicality. To address these limitations, we propose a zero-shot, open-vocabulary system that integrates domain classification and DST in a single pipeline. Our approach includes reformulating DST as a question-answering task for less capable models and employing self-refining prompts for more adaptable ones. Our system does not rely on fixed slot values defined in the ontology allowing the system to adapt dynamically. We compare our approach with existing SOTA, and show that it provides up to 20% better Joint Goal Accuracy (JGA) over previous methods on datasets like Multi-WOZ 2.1, with up to 90% fewer requests to the LLM API.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15861v2,2024-09
iGAiVA: Integrated Generative AI and Visual Analytics in a Machine Learning Workflow for Text Classification,"Yuanzhe Jin, Adrian Carrasco-Revilla, Min Chen","In developing machine learning (ML) models for text classification, one common challenge is that the collected data is often not ideally distributed, especially when new classes are introduced in response to changes of data and tasks. In this paper, we present a solution for using visual analytics (VA) to guide the generation of synthetic data using large language models. As VA enables model developers to identify data-related deficiency, data synthesis can be targeted to address such deficiency. We discuss different types of data deficiency, describe different VA techniques for supporting their identification, and demonstrate the effectiveness of targeted data synthesis in improving model accuracy. In addition, we present a software tool, iGAiVA, which maps four groups of ML tasks into four VA views, integrating generative AI and VA into an ML workflow for developing and improving text classification models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15848v1,2024-09
Textless NLP -- Zero Resource Challenge with Low Resource Compute,"Krithiga Ramadass, Abrit Pal Singh, Srihari J, Sheetal Kalyani","This work addresses the persistent challenges of substantial training time and GPU resource requirements even when training lightweight encoder-vocoder models for Textless NLP. We reduce training steps significantly while improving performance by a) leveraging learning rate schedulers for efficient and faster convergence b) optimizing hop length and c) tuning the interpolation scale factors for better audio quality. Additionally, we explore the latent space representation for Indian languages such as Tamil and Bengali for the acoustic unit discovery and voice conversion task. Our approach leverages a quantized encoder architecture, in conjunction with a vocoder which utilizes the proposed mixture of optimized hop length, tuned interpolation scale factors and a cyclic learning rate scheduler. We obtain consistently good results across English, Tamil and Bengali datasets. The proposed method excels in capturing complex linguistic patterns, resulting in clear reconstructed audio during voice conversion with significantly reduced training time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19015v1,2024-09
Unveiling Language Competence Neurons: A Psycholinguistic Approach to Model Interpretability,"Xufeng Duan, Xinyu Zhou, Bei Xiao, Zhenguang G. Cai","As large language models (LLMs) advance in their linguistic capacity, understanding how they capture aspects of language competence remains a significant challenge. This study therefore employs psycholinguistic paradigms in English, which are well-suited for probing deeper cognitive aspects of language processing, to explore neuron-level representations in language model across three tasks: sound-shape association, sound-gender association, and implicit causality. Our findings indicate that while GPT-2-XL struggles with the sound-shape task, it demonstrates human-like abilities in both sound-gender association and implicit causality. Targeted neuron ablation and activation manipulation reveal a crucial relationship: When GPT-2-XL displays a linguistic ability, specific neurons correspond to that competence; conversely, the absence of such an ability indicates a lack of specialized neurons. This study is the first to utilize psycholinguistic experiments to investigate deep language competence at the neuron level, providing a new level of granularity in model interpretability and insights into the internal mechanisms driving language ability in the transformer-based LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15827v2,2024-09
Empirical Insights on Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Question-Answering,"Junjie Ye, Yuming Yang, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang, Peng Wang, Zhongchao Shi, Jianping Fan","Large language models (LLMs) encode extensive world knowledge through pre-training on massive datasets, which can then be fine-tuned for the question-answering (QA) task. However, effective strategies for fine-tuning LLMs for the QA task remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we categorize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data based on the extent of knowledge memorized by the pretrained LLMs and conduct a series of empirical analyses. Our experiments, involving four LLMs from three different model families, focus on three key factors: the amount of data required for SFT, the impact of different SFT datasets on model performance, and how data requirements vary across LLMs. The results show that as few as 60 data points during the SFT stage can activate the knowledge encoded during pre-training, enabling LLMs to perform the QA task. Additionally, SFT with data of varying memory levels has a significant impact on LLM performance, with the optimal dataset differing based on the specific model being fine-tuned. Future research will delve deeper into the mechanisms underlying these phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15825v1,2024-09
Supervised Fine-Tuning Achieve Rapid Task Adaption Via Alternating Attention Head Activation Patterns,"Yang Zhao, Li Du, Xiao Ding, Kai Xiong, Ting Liu, Bing Qin","LLMs' performance on complex tasks is still unsatisfactory. A key issue is that presently LLMs learn in a data-driven schema, while the instructions about these complex tasks are both scarce and hard to collect or construct. On the contrary, a prominent phenomenon is that LLMs can learn rather fast on simpler tasks with adequate prior knowledge captured during pretraining stage. Thus, if the prerequisite and mechanism of such rapid generalization could be elucidated, it could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the LLM's ability to learn complex tasks. Thus, in this paper, we employ a gradient-based method, to dissect the process that the SFT process adapts LLMs to downstream tasks via the perspective of attention patterns. We find that: (1) LLMs selectively activate task-specific attention heads during SFT; (2) activation patterns for complex tasks are combinations of basic task patterns; and (3) changes in a few parameters can significantly impact activation patterns after SFT on a small number of samples.Based on these insights, experiments are conducted to actually enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of SFT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15820v2,2024-09

In this work, we introduce a taxonomy of 36+ entity types with a luxury-oriented annotation scheme, and create a dataset of more than 40K sentences respecting a clear hierarchical classification. We also present five supervised fine-tuned models NER-Luxury for fashion, beauty, watches, jewelry, fragrances, cosmetics, and overall luxury, focusing equally on the aesthetic side and the quantitative side.

It is critical that these models provide accurate and trustworthy health information, as their application in real-world contexts--where misinformation can have serious consequences for individuals seeking medical advice and support--depends on their reliability. In this work, we present CHBench, the first comprehensive Chinese Health-related Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in understanding physical and mental health across diverse scenarios. CHBench includes 6,493 entries related to mental health and 2,999 entries focused on physical health, covering a broad spectrum of topics.

XTRUST: On the Multilingual Trustworthiness of Large Language Models,"Yahan Li, Yi Wang, Yi Chang, Yuan Wu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, capturing the attention of both practitioners and the broader public. A key question that now preoccupies the AI community concerns the capabilities and limitations of these models, with trustworthiness emerging as a central issue, particularly as LLMs are increasingly applied in sensitive fields like healthcare and finance, where errors can have serious consequences. However, most previous studies on the trustworthiness of LLMs have been limited to a single language, typically the predominant one in the dataset, such as English. In response to the growing global deployment of LLMs, we introduce XTRUST, the first comprehensive multilingual trustworthiness benchmark. XTRUST encompasses a diverse range of topics, including illegal activities, hallucination, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, physical and mental health, toxicity, fairness, misinformation, privacy, and machine ethics, across 10 different languages. Using XTRUST, we conduct an empirical evaluation of the multilingual trustworthiness of five widely used LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of their performance across languages and tasks.

Hypothesis Clustering and Merging: Novel MultiTalker Speech Recognition with Speaker Tokens,"Yosuke Kashiwagi, Hayato Futami, Emiru Tsunoo, Siddhant Arora, Shinji Watanabe","In many real-world scenarios, such as meetings, multiple speakers are present with an unknown number of participants, and their utterances often overlap. We address these multi-speaker challenges by a novel attention-based encoder-decoder method augmented with special speaker class tokens obtained by speaker clustering. During inference, we select multiple recognition hypotheses conditioned on predicted speaker cluster tokens, and these hypotheses are merged by agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) based on the normalized edit distance. The clustered hypotheses result in the multi-speaker transcriptions with the appropriate number of speakers determined by AHC.

Making Text Embedders Few-Shot Learners,"Chaofan Li, MingHao Qin, Shitao Xiao, Jianlyu Chen, Kun Luo, Yingxia Shao, Defu Lian, Zheng Liu","Large language models (LLMs) with decoder-only architectures demonstrate remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities.

Lighter And Better: Towards Flexible Context Adaptation For Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Zheng Liu, Chenyuan Wu, Ninglu Shao, Shitao Xiao, Chaozhuo Li, Defu Lian","The existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges in terms of cost and effectiveness. On one hand, they need to encode the lengthy retrieved contexts before responding to the input tasks, which imposes substantial computational overhead. On the other hand, directly using generic Large Language Models (LLMs) often leads to sub-optimal answers, while task-specific fine-tuning may compromise the LLMs' general capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called FlexRAG (Flexible Context Adaptation for RAG). In this approach, the retrieved contexts are compressed into compact embeddings before being encoded by the LLMs. Simultaneously, these compressed embeddings are optimized to enhance downstream RAG performance. A key feature of FlexRAG is its flexibility, which enables effective support for diverse compression ratios and selective preservation of important contexts. Thanks to these technical designs, FlexRAG achieves superior generation quality while significantly reducing running costs. Comprehensive experiments on various question-answering datasets validate our approach as a cost-effective and flexible solution for RAG systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15699v1,2024-09
dnaGrinder: a lightweight and high-capacity genomic foundation model,"Qihang Zhao, Chi Zhang, Weixiong Zhang","The task of understanding and interpreting the complex information encoded within genomic sequences remains a grand challenge in biological research and clinical applications. In this context, recent advancements in large language model research have led to the development of both encoder-only and decoder-only foundation models designed to decode intricate information in DNA sequences. However, several issues persist, particularly regarding the efficient management of long-range dependencies inherent in genomic sequences, the effective representation of nucleotide variations, and the considerable computational costs associated with large model architectures and extensive pretraining datasets. Current genomic foundation models often face a critical tradeoff: smaller models with mediocre performance versus large models with improved performance. To address these challenges, we introduce dnaGrinder, a unique and efficient genomic foundation model. dnaGrinder excels at managing long-range dependencies within genomic sequences while minimizing computational costs without compromising performance. It achieves results that are not just comparable but often superior to leading DNA models such as Nucleotide Transformer and DNABERT-2.

A Survey of Stance Detection on Social Media: New Directions and Perspectives,"Bowen Zhang, Genan Dai, Fuqiang Niu, Nan Yin, Xiaomao Fan, Senzhang Wang, Xiaochun Cao, Hu Huang","In modern digital environments, users frequently express opinions on contentious topics, providing a wealth of information on prevailing attitudes. The systematic analysis of these opinions offers valuable insights for decision-making in various sectors, including marketing and politics. As a result, stance detection has emerged as a crucial subfield within affective computing, enabling the automatic detection of user stances in social media conversations and providing a nuanced understanding of public sentiment on complex issues.

Language-based Audio Moment Retrieval,"Hokuto Munakata, Taichi Nishimura, Shota Nakada, Tatsuya Komatsu","In this paper, we propose and design a new task called audio moment retrieval (AMR). Unlike conventional language-based audio retrieval tasks that search for short audio clips from an audio database, AMR aims to predict relevant moments in untrimmed long audio based on a text query. Given the lack of prior work in AMR, we first build a dedicated dataset, Clotho-Moment, consisting of large-scale simulated audio recordings with moment annotations. We then propose a DETR-based model, named Audio Moment DETR (AM-DETR), as a fundamental framework for AMR tasks. This model captures temporal dependencies within audio features, inspired by similar video moment retrieval tasks, thus surpassing conventional clip-level audio retrieval methods. Additionally, we provide manually annotated datasets to properly measure the effectiveness and robustness of our methods on real data. Experimental results show that AM-DETR, trained with Clotho-Moment, outperforms a baseline model that applies a clip-level audio retrieval method with a sliding window on all metrics, particularly improving Recall1@0.7 by 9.00 points.

Mitigating Semantic Leakage in Cross-lingual Embeddings via Orthogonality Constraint,"Dayeon Ki, Cheonbok Park, Hyunjoong Kim","Accurately aligning contextual representations in cross-lingual sentence embeddings is key for effective parallel data mining. A common strategy for achieving this alignment involves disentangling semantics and language in sentence embeddings derived from multilingual pre-trained models. However, we discover that current disentangled representation learning methods suffer from semantic leakage - a term we introduce to describe when a substantial amount of language-specific information is unintentionally leaked into semantic representations. This hinders the effective disentanglement of semantic and language representations, making it difficult to retrieve embeddings that distinctively represent the meaning of the sentence. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training objective, ORthogonAlity Constraint LEarning (ORACLE), tailored to enforce orthogonality between semantic and language embeddings. ORACLE builds upon two components: intra-class clustering and inter-class separation. Through experiments on cross-lingual retrieval and semantic textual similarity tasks, we demonstrate that training with the ORACLE objective effectively reduces semantic leakage and enhances semantic alignment within the embedding space.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15664v1,2024-09

The need for accurate evaluation methods has increased as these systems have grown more sophisticated. However, the Execution Accuracy (EX), the most prevalent evaluation metric, still shows many false positives and negatives. Thus, this paper introduces FLEX (False-Less EXecution), a novel approach to evaluating text-to-SQL systems using large language models (LLMs) to emulate human expert-level evaluation of SQL queries. Our metric improves agreement with human experts (from 62 to 87.04 in Cohen's kappa) with comprehensive context and sophisticated criteria. Our extensive experiments yield several key insights: (1) Models' performance increases by over 2.6 points on average, substantially affecting rankings on Spider and BIRD benchmarks; (2) The underestimation of models in EX primarily stems from annotation quality issues; and (3) Model performance on particularly challenging questions tends to be overestimated.

Beyond Turn-Based Interfaces: Synchronous LLMs as Full-Duplex Dialogue Agents,"Bandhav Veluri, Benjamin N Peloquin, Bokai Yu, Hongyu Gong, Shyamnath Gollakota","Despite broad interest in modeling spoken dialogue agents, most approaches are inherently ""half-duplex"" -- restricted to turn-based interaction with responses requiring explicit prompting by the user or implicit tracking of interruption or silence events. Human dialogue, by contrast, is ""full-duplex"" allowing for rich synchronicity in the form of quick and dynamic turn-taking, overlapping speech, and backchanneling. Technically, the challenge of achieving full-duplex dialogue with LLMs lies in modeling synchrony as pre-trained LLMs do not have a sense of ""time"". To bridge this gap, we propose Synchronous LLMs for full-duplex spoken dialogue modeling. We design a novel mechanism to integrate time information into Llama3-8b so that they run synchronously with the real-world clock. We also introduce a training recipe that uses 212k hours of synthetic spoken dialogue data generated from text dialogue data to create a model that generates meaningful and natural spoken dialogue, with just 2k hours of real-world spoken dialogue data. Synchronous LLMs outperform state-of-the-art in dialogue meaningfulness while maintaining naturalness. Finally, we demonstrate the model's ability to participate in full-duplex dialogue by simulating interaction between two agents trained on different datasets, while considering Internet-scale latencies of up to 240 ms.

The main research work includes: Firstly, based on the experience of predecessors, we selected 29 enterprise financial data indicators, abstracted each indicator as a vertex, deeply analyzed the relationships between the indicators, constructed a similarity matrix of indicators, and used the maximum spanning tree algorithm to achieve the graph structure mapping of enterprises; secondly, in the representation learning phase of the mapped graph, a graph neural network model was built to obtain its embedded representation. The feature vector of each node was expanded to 32 dimensions, and three GraphSAGE operations were performed on the graph, with the results pooled using the Pool operation, and the final output of three feature vectors was averaged to obtain the graph's embedded representation; finally, a classifier was constructed using a two-layer fully connected network to complete the prediction task. Experimental results on real enterprise data show that the model proposed in this paper can well complete the multi-level credit level estimation of enterprises.

Asking an AI for salary negotiation advice is a matter of concern: Controlled experimental perturbation of ChatGPT for protected and non-protected group discrimination on a contextual task with no clear ground truth answers,"R. Stuart Geiger, Flynn O'Sullivan, Elsie Wang, Jonathan Lo","We conducted controlled experimental bias audits for four versions of ChatGPT, which we asked to recommend an opening offer in salary negotiations for a new hire. We submitted 98,800 prompts to each version, systematically varying the employee's gender, university, and major, and tested prompts in voice of each side of the negotiation: the employee versus employer. We find ChatGPT as a multi-model platform is not robust and consistent enough to be trusted for such a task. We observed statistically significant salary offers when varying gender for all four models, although with smaller gaps than for other attributes tested. The largest gaps were different model versions and between the employee- vs employer-voiced prompts. We also observed substantial gaps when varying university and major, but many of the biases were not consistent across model versions. We tested for fictional and fraudulent universities and found wildly inconsistent results across cases and model versions. We make broader contributions to the AI/ML fairness literature. Our scenario and our experimental design differ from mainstream AI/ML auditing efforts in key ways. Bias audits typically test discrimination for protected classes like gender, which we contrast with testing non-protected classes of university and major. Asking for negotiation advice includes how aggressive one ought to be in a negotiation relative to known empirical salary distributions and scales, which is a deeply contextual and personalized task that has no objective ground truth to validate. These results raise concerns for the specific model versions we tested and ChatGPT as a multi-model platform in continuous development. Our epistemology does not permit us to definitively certify these models as either generally biased or unbiased on the attributes we test, but our study raises matters of concern for stakeholders to further investigate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15567v3,2024-09
GEM-RAG: Graphical Eigen Memories For Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Brendan Hogan Rappazzo, Yingheng Wang, Aaron Ferber, Carla Gomes","The ability to form, retrieve, and reason about memories in response to stimuli serves as the cornerstone for general intelligence - shaping entities capable of learning, adaptation, and intuitive insight. Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven their ability, given the proper memories or context, to reason and respond meaningfully to stimuli. However, they are still unable to optimally encode, store, and retrieve memories - the ability to do this would unlock their full ability to operate as AI agents, and to specialize to niche domains. To remedy this, one promising area of research is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which aims to augment LLMs by providing them with rich in-context examples and information. In question-answering (QA) applications, RAG methods embed the text of interest in chunks, and retrieve the most relevant chunks for a prompt using text embeddings. Motivated by human memory encoding and retrieval, we aim to improve over standard RAG methods by generating and encoding higher-level information and tagging the chunks by their utility to answer questions. We introduce Graphical Eigen Memories For Retrieval Augmented Generation (GEM-RAG). GEM-RAG works by tagging each chunk of text in a given text corpus with LLM generated ``utility'' questions, connecting chunks in a graph based on the similarity of both their text and utility questions, and then using the eigendecomposition of the memory graph to build higher level summary nodes that capture the main themes of the text. We evaluate GEM-RAG, using both UnifiedQA and GPT-3.5 Turbo as the LLMs, with SBERT, and OpenAI's text encoders on two standard QA tasks, showing that GEM-RAG outperforms other state-of-the-art RAG methods on these tasks. We also discuss the implications of having a robust RAG system and future directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15566v1,2024-09
Lost in the Logic: An Evaluation of Large Language Models' Reasoning Capabilities on LSAT Logic Games,Saumya Malik,"In this thesis, I evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT), specifically the Logic Games section of the test. I focus on this section because it presents a complex logical reasoning task and thus is a valuable source of data for evaluating how modern, increasingly capable LLMs can handle hard logical reasoning tasks. I construct a dataset of LSAT logic games and their associated metadata, and extensively evaluate LLMs' performance in a Chain-of-Thought prompting setting. Given the weak performance in this setting, I explore other prompting frameworks on a smaller subset of the dataset, adapting ideas from Reflexion to this task. This results in a substantially improved accuracy of 70 percent for GPT-4 and 46 percent for GPT-3.5 on this data subset, highlighting the capacity of LLMs to revise their logical errors, despite initially weak performance. Finally, I analyze the types of logic games that models perform better or worse on, as well as the types of logical errors I observe from human annotation, providing detailed insights on the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19012v1,2024-09
"Revise, Reason, and Recognize: LLM-Based Emotion Recognition via Emotion-Specific Prompts and ASR Error Correction","Yuanchao Li, Yuan Gong, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Peter Bell, Catherine Lai","Annotating and recognizing speech emotion using prompt engineering has recently emerged with the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its efficacy and reliability remain questionable. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on this topic, beginning with the proposal of novel prompts that incorporate emotion-specific knowledge from acoustics, linguistics, and psychology. Subsequently, we examine the effectiveness of LLM-based prompting on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcription, contrasting it with ground-truth transcription. Furthermore, we propose a Revise-Reason-Recognize prompting pipeline for robust LLM-based emotion recognition from spoken language with ASR errors. Additionally, experiments on context-aware learning, in-context learning, and instruction tuning are performed to examine the usefulness of LLM training schemes in this direction. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs to minor prompt variations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the emotion-specific prompts, ASR error correction, and LLM training schemes for LLM-based emotion recognition. Our study aims to refine the use of LLMs in emotion recognition and related domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15551v1,2024-09
Rethinking Emotion Bias in Music via Frechet Audio Distance,"Yuanchao Li, Azalea Gui, Dimitra Emmanouilidou, Hannes Gamper","The subjective nature of music emotion introduces inherent bias in both recognition and generation, especially when relying on a single audio encoder, emotion classifier, or evaluation metric. In this work, we conduct a study on Music Emotion Recognition (MER) and Emotional Music Generation (EMG), employing diverse audio encoders alongside the Frechet Audio Distance (FAD), a reference-free evaluation metric. Our study begins with a benchmark evaluation of MER, highlighting the limitations associated with using a single audio encoder and the disparities observed across different measurements. We then propose assessing MER performance using FAD from multiple encoders to provide a more objective measure of music emotion. Furthermore, we introduce an enhanced EMG approach designed to improve both the variation and prominence of generated music emotion, thus enhancing realism. Additionally, we investigate the realism disparities between the emotions conveyed in real and synthetic music, comparing our EMG model against two baseline models. Experimental results underscore the emotion bias problem in both MER and EMG and demonstrate the potential of using FAD and diverse audio encoders to evaluate music emotion objectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15545v2,2024-09
"Learning When to Retrieve, What to Rewrite, and How to Respond in Conversational QA","Nirmal Roy, Leonardo F. R. Ribeiro, Rexhina Blloshmi, Kevin Small","Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with information retrieval capabilities (i.e., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)) has proven beneficial for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, understanding users' contextual search intent when generating responses is an understudied topic for conversational question answering (QA). This conversational extension leads to additional concerns when compared to single-turn QA as it is more challenging for systems to comprehend conversational context and manage retrieved passages over multiple turns. In this work, we propose a method for enabling LLMs to decide when to retrieve in RAG settings given a conversational context. When retrieval is deemed necessary, the LLM then rewrites the conversation for passage retrieval and judges the relevance of returned passages before response generation. Operationally, we build on the single-turn SELF-RAG framework (Asai et al., 2023) and propose SELF-multi-RAG for conversational settings. SELF-multi-RAG demonstrates improved capabilities over single-turn variants with respect to retrieving relevant passages (by using summarized conversational context) and assessing the quality of generated responses. Experiments on three conversational QA datasets validate the enhanced response generation capabilities of SELF-multi-RAG, with improvements of ~13% measured by human annotation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15515v1,2024-09
"A comprehensive study of on-device NLP applications -- VQA, automated Form filling, Smart Replies for Linguistic Codeswitching",Naman Goyal,"Recent improvement in large language models, open doors for certain new experiences for on-device applications which were not possible before. In this work, we propose 3 such new experiences in 2 categories. First we discuss experiences which can be powered in screen understanding i.e. understanding whats on user screen namely - (1) visual question answering, and (2) automated form filling based on previous screen. The second category of experience which can be extended are smart replies to support for multilingual speakers with code-switching. Code-switching occurs when a speaker alternates between two or more languages. To the best of our knowledge, this is first such work to propose these tasks and solutions to each of them, to bridge the gap between latest research and real world impact of the research in on-device applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19010v1,2024-09
RAM2C: A Liberal Arts Educational Chatbot based on Retrieval-augmented Multi-role Multi-expert Collaboration,"Haoyu Huang, Tong Niu, Rui Yang, Luping Shi","Recently, many studies focus on utilizing large language models (LLMs) into educational dialogues. Especially, within liberal arts dialogues, educators must balance \textbf{H}umanized communication, \textbf{T}eaching expertise, and \textbf{S}afety-ethics (\textbf{HTS}), besides the subject knowledge itself. However, due to collecting massive amounts of HTS-compliant teaching dialogues from real world as training corpus is expensive, the outputs of existing LLMs in teaching dialogues fall short of human standards. To address this, we design a Retrieval-augmented Multi-role Multi-expert Collaboration (RAM2C) framework to automatically generate such dialogues data. Specifically, we first establish HTS-guided knowledge bases, encompassing three domain knowledge in teaching skills, psychology, and safety ethics. Then, RAM2C organizes LLMs, which are retrieval-augmented by the above different knowledge bases, into multi-experts groups with distinct roles to generate the HTS-compliant educational dialogues dataset. We then fine-tuned the LLMs using this dataset. Empirical evaluations indicate that RM2C-empowered LLMs excel in Chinese reading teaching, offering more personalized, and ethically safe teaching response, demonstrating RAM2C's practicality and high quality. We release the experiments at \hyperlink{https://github.com/ram2c/ram2c}{https://github.com/ram2c/ram2c}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15461v1,2024-09
In-Context Learning May Not Elicit Trustworthy Reasoning: A-Not-B Errors in Pretrained Language Models,"Pengrui Han, Peiyang Song, Haofei Yu, Jiaxuan You","Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have led to the creation of highly capable large language models (LLMs) that can perform tasks in a human-like manner. However, LLMs exhibit only infant-level cognitive abilities in certain areas. One such area is the A-Not-B error, a phenomenon seen in infants where they repeat a previously rewarded behavior despite well-observed changed conditions. This highlights their lack of inhibitory control -- the ability to stop a habitual or impulsive response. In our work, we design a text-based multi-choice QA scenario similar to the A-Not-B experimental settings to systematically test the inhibitory control abilities of LLMs. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs (like Llama3-8b) perform consistently well with in-context learning (ICL) but make errors and show a significant drop of as many as 83.3% in reasoning tasks when the context changes trivially. This suggests that LLMs only have inhibitory control abilities on par with human infants in this regard, often failing to suppress the previously established response pattern during ICL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15454v1,2024-09
CUTE: Measuring LLMs' Understanding of Their Tokens,"Lukas Edman, Helmut Schmid, Alexander Fraser","Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable performance on a wide variety of tasks. Most LLMs split text into multi-character tokens and process them as atomic units without direct access to individual characters. This raises the question: To what extent can LLMs learn orthographic information? To answer this, we propose a new benchmark, CUTE, which features a collection of tasks designed to test the orthographic knowledge of LLMs. We evaluate popular LLMs on CUTE, finding that most of them seem to know the spelling of their tokens, yet fail to use this information effectively to manipulate text, calling into question how much of this knowledge is generalizable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15452v2,2024-09
A Preliminary Study of o1 in Medicine: Are We Closer to an AI Doctor?,"Yunfei Xie, Juncheng Wu, Haoqin Tu, Siwei Yang, Bingchen Zhao, Yongshuo Zong, Qiao Jin, Cihang Xie, Yuyin Zhou","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains and tasks, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge in learning and cognition. The latest model, OpenAI's o1, stands out as the first LLM with an internalized chain-of-thought technique using reinforcement learning strategies. While it has demonstrated surprisingly strong capabilities on various general language tasks, its performance in specialized fields such as medicine remains unknown. To this end, this report provides a comprehensive exploration of o1 on different medical scenarios, examining 3 key aspects: understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality. Specifically, our evaluation encompasses 6 tasks using data from 37 medical datasets, including two newly constructed and more challenging question-answering (QA) tasks based on professional medical quizzes from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and The Lancet. These datasets offer greater clinical relevance compared to standard medical QA benchmarks such as MedQA, translating more effectively into real-world clinical utility. Our analysis of o1 suggests that the enhanced reasoning ability of LLMs may (significantly) benefit their capability to understand various medical instructions and reason through complex clinical scenarios. Notably, o1 surpasses the previous GPT-4 in accuracy by an average of 6.2% and 6.6% across 19 datasets and two newly created complex QA scenarios. But meanwhile, we identify several weaknesses in both the model capability and the existing evaluation protocols, including hallucination, inconsistent multilingual ability, and discrepant metrics for evaluation.

However, the capacity of these models to concurrently process and reason about multiple modalities remains inadequately explored, partly due to the lack of comprehensive modality-wise benchmarks. We introduce OmniBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate models' ability to recognize, interpret, and reason across visual, acoustic, and textual inputs simultaneously. We define models capable of such tri-modal processing as omni-language models (OLMs). OmniBench is distinguished by high-quality human annotations, ensuring that accurate responses require integrated understanding and reasoning across all three modalities. Our main findings reveal that: i) most OLMs exhibit critical limitations in instruction-following and reasoning capabilities within tri-modal contexts; and ii) most baselines models perform poorly (below 50\% accuracy) even when provided with alternative textual representations of images or/and audio. These results suggest that the ability to construct a consistent context from text, image, and audio is often overlooked in existing MLLM training paradigms. To address this gap, we curate an instruction tuning dataset of 84.5K training samples, OmniInstruct, for training OLMs to adapt to multimodal contexts. We advocate for future research to focus on developing more robust tri-modal integration techniques and training strategies to enhance OLM performance across diverse modalities.

Behavioral Bias of Vision-Language Models: A Behavioral Finance View,"Yuhang Xiao, Yudi Lin, Ming-Chang Chiu","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) evolve rapidly as Large Language Models (LLMs) was equipped with vision modules to create more human-like models. However, we should carefully evaluate their applications in different domains, as they may possess undesired biases. Our work studies the potential behavioral biases of LVLMs from a behavioral finance perspective, an interdisciplinary subject that jointly considers finance and psychology. We propose an end-to-end framework, from data collection to new evaluation metrics, to assess LVLMs' reasoning capabilities and the dynamic behaviors manifested in two established human financial behavioral biases: recency bias and authority bias. Our evaluations find that recent open-source LVLMs such as LLaVA-NeXT, MobileVLM-V2, Mini-Gemini, MiniCPM-Llama3-V 2.5 and Phi-3-vision-128k suffer significantly from these two biases, while the proprietary model GPT-4o is negligibly impacted.

Archon: An Architecture Search Framework for Inference-Time Techniques,"Jon Saad-Falcon, Adrian Gamarra Lafuente, Shlok Natarajan, Nahum Maru, Hristo Todorov, Etash Guha, E. Kelly Buchanan, Mayee Chen, Neel Guha, Christopher Ré, Azalia Mirhoseini","Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to enhance large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, best practices for developing systems that combine these techniques remain underdeveloped due to our limited understanding of the utility of individual inference-time techniques and the interactions between them. Additionally, efficiently and automatically searching the space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their compositions is challenging due to the large design space. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, a modular framework for selecting, combining, and stacking layers of inference-time techniques to construct optimized LLM systems for target benchmarks. Rather than relying on a single LLM called once, we leverage a diverse set of LLMs and inference-time techniques, creating LLM systems greater than the sum of their parts. Archon defines an extensible design space, encompassing techniques such as generation ensembling, repeated sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It transforms the problem of building LLM systems into a hyperparameter optimization objective. Given the available LLMs, inference-time techniques, and compute budget, Archon utilizes hyperparameter search techniques to discover optimized architectures for target benchmark(s). We evaluate Archon architectures across a range of instruction-following, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval, MixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. Archon architectures outperform frontier models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on these benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy increase of 15.1 percentage points by using all available LLMs. We make our code and datasets available publicly on Github: https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/Archon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15254v5,2024-09
Fully automatic extraction of morphological traits from the Web: utopia or reality?,"Diego Marcos, Robert van de Vlasakker, Ioannis N. Athanasiadis, Pierre Bonnet, Hervé Goeau, Alexis Joly, W. Daniel Kissling, César Leblanc, André S. J. van Proosdij, Konstantinos P. Panousis","Plant morphological traits, their observable characteristics, are fundamental to understand the role played by each species within their ecosystem. However, compiling trait information for even a moderate number of species is a demanding task that may take experts years to accomplish. At the same time, massive amounts of information about species descriptions is available online in the form of text, although the lack of structure makes this source of data impossible to use at scale. To overcome this, we propose to leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and devise a mechanism for gathering and processing information on plant traits in the form of unstructured textual descriptions, without manual curation. We evaluate our approach by automatically replicating three manually created species-trait matrices. Our method managed to find values for over half of all species-trait pairs, with an F1-score of over 75%. Our results suggest that large-scale creation of structured trait databases from unstructured online text is currently feasible thanks to the information extraction capabilities of LLMs, being limited by the availability of textual descriptions covering all the traits of interest.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17179v1,2024-09
MADial-Bench: Towards Real-world Evaluation of Memory-Augmented Dialogue Generation,"Junqing He, Liang Zhu, Rui Wang, Xi Wang, Reza Haffari, Jiaxing Zhang","Long-term memory is important for chatbots and dialogue systems (DS) to create consistent and human-like conversations, evidenced by numerous developed memory-augmented DS (MADS). To evaluate the effectiveness of such MADS, existing commonly used evaluation metrics, like retrieval accuracy and perplexity (PPL), mainly focus on query-oriented factualness and language quality assessment. However, these metrics often lack practical value. Moreover, the evaluation dimensions are insufficient for human-like assessment in DS. Regarding memory-recalling paradigms, current evaluation schemes only consider passive memory retrieval while ignoring diverse memory recall with rich triggering factors, e.g., emotions and surroundings, which can be essential in emotional support scenarios. To bridge the gap, we construct a novel Memory-Augmented Dialogue Benchmark (MADail-Bench) covering various memory-recalling paradigms based on cognitive science and psychology theories. The benchmark assesses two tasks separately: memory retrieval and memory recognition with the incorporation of both passive and proactive memory recall data. We introduce new scoring criteria to the evaluation, including memory injection, emotion support (ES) proficiency, and intimacy, to comprehensively assess generated responses. Results from cutting-edge embedding models and large language models on this benchmark indicate the potential for further advancement. Extensive testing further reveals correlations between memory injection, ES proficiency, and intimacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15240v2,2024-09
ASTE Transformer Modelling Dependencies in Aspect-Sentiment Triplet Extraction,"Iwo Naglik, Mateusz Lango","Aspect-Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a recently proposed task of aspect-based sentiment analysis that consists in extracting (aspect phrase, opinion phrase, sentiment polarity) triples from a given sentence. Recent state-of-the-art methods approach this task by first extracting all possible text spans from a given text, then filtering the potential aspect and opinion phrases with a classifier, and finally considering all their pairs with another classifier that additionally assigns sentiment polarity to them. Although several variations of the above scheme have been proposed, the common feature is that the final result is constructed by a sequence of independent classifier decisions. This hinders the exploitation of dependencies between extracted phrases and prevents the use of knowledge about the interrelationships between classifier predictions to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a new ASTE approach consisting of three transformer-inspired layers, which enables the modelling of dependencies both between phrases and between the final classifier decisions. Experimental results show that the method achieves higher performance in terms of F1 measure than other methods studied on popular benchmarks. In addition, we show that a simple pre-training technique further improves the performance of the model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15202v2,2024-09
Learning from Contrastive Prompts: Automated Optimization and Adaptation,"Mingqi Li, Karan Aggarwal, Yong Xie, Aitzaz Ahmad, Stephen Lau","As LLMs evolve, significant effort is spent on manually crafting prompts. While existing prompt optimization methods automate this process, they rely solely on learning from incorrect samples, leading to a sub-optimal performance. Additionally, an unexplored challenge in the literature is prompts effective for prior models may not perform well on newer versions or different languages. We propose the Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP) framework to address these gaps, enhancing both prompt optimization and adaptation. LCP employs contrastive learning to generate effective prompts by analyzing patterns in good and bad prompt examples. Our evaluation on the Big-Bench Hard dataset shows that LCP has a win rate of over 76% over existing methods in prompt optimization and demonstrates strong adaptability across different model versions, families, and languages. LCP offers a systematic approach to prompt engineering, reducing manual effort in deploying LLMs across varied contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15199v1,2024-09
PALLM: Evaluating and Enhancing PALLiative Care Conversations with Large Language Models,"Zhiyuan Wang, Fangxu Yuan, Virginia LeBaron, Tabor Flickinger, Laura E. Barnes","Effective patient-provider communication is crucial in clinical care, directly impacting patient outcomes and quality of life. Traditional evaluation methods, such as human ratings, patient feedback, and provider self-assessments, are often limited by high costs and scalability issues. Although existing natural language processing (NLP) techniques show promise, they struggle with the nuances of clinical communication and require sensitive clinical data for training, reducing their effectiveness in real-world applications. Emerging large language models (LLMs) offer a new approach to assessing complex communication metrics, with the potential to advance the field through integration into passive sensing and just-in-time intervention systems. This study explores LLMs as evaluators of palliative care communication quality, leveraging their linguistic, in-context learning, and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, using simulated scripts crafted and labeled by healthcare professionals, we test proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) and fine-tune open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA2) with a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4 to evaluate clinical conversations, to identify key metrics such as `understanding' and `empathy'. Our findings demonstrated LLMs' superior performance in evaluating clinical communication, providing actionable feedback with reasoning, and demonstrating the feasibility and practical viability of developing in-house LLMs. This research highlights LLMs' potential to enhance patient-provider interactions and lays the groundwork for downstream steps in developing LLM-empowered clinical health systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15188v2,2024-09
Lessons Learned on Information Retrieval in Electronic Health Records: A Comparison of Embedding Models and Pooling Strategies,"Skatje Myers, Timothy A. Miller, Yanjun Gao, Matthew M. Churpek, Anoop Mayampurath, Dmitriy Dligach, Majid Afshar","Objective: Applying large language models (LLMs) to the clinical domain is challenging due to the context-heavy nature of processing medical records. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution by facilitating reasoning over large text sources. However, there are many parameters to optimize in just the retrieval system alone. This paper presents an ablation study exploring how different embedding models and pooling methods affect information retrieval for the clinical domain.   Methods: Evaluating on three retrieval tasks on two electronic health record (EHR) data sources, we compared seven models, including medical- and general-domain models, specialized encoder embedding models, and off-the-shelf decoder LLMs. We also examine the choice of embedding pooling strategy for each model, independently on the query and the text to retrieve.   Results: We found that the choice of embedding model significantly impacts retrieval performance, with BGE, a comparatively small general-domain model, consistently outperforming all others, including medical-specific models. However, our findings also revealed substantial variability across datasets and query text phrasings. We also determined the best pooling methods for each of these models to guide future design of retrieval systems.   Discussion: The choice of embedding model, pooling strategy, and query formulation can significantly impact retrieval performance and the performance of these models on other public benchmarks does not necessarily transfer to new domains. Further studies such as this one are vital for guiding empirically-grounded development of retrieval frameworks, such as in the context of RAG, for the clinical domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15163v1,2024-09
Inferring Scientific Cross-Document Coreference and Hierarchy with Definition-Augmented Relational Reasoning,"Lior Forer, Tom Hope","We address the fundamental task of inferring cross-document coreference and hierarchy in scientific texts, which has important applications in knowledge graph construction, search, recommendation and discovery. LLMs can struggle when faced with many long-tail technical concepts with nuanced variations. We present a novel method which generates context-dependent definitions of concept mentions by retrieving full-text literature, and uses the definitions to enhance detection of cross-document relations. We further generate relational definitions, which describe how two concept mentions are related or different, and design an efficient re-ranking approach to address the combinatorial explosion involved in inferring links across papers. In both fine-tuning and in-context learning settings we achieve large gains in performance. We provide analysis of generated definitions, shedding light on the relational reasoning ability of LLMs over fine-grained scientific concepts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15113v2,2024-09
Efficiently Dispatching Flash Attention For Partially Filled Attention Masks,"Agniv Sharma, Jonas Geiping","Transformers are widely used across various applications, many of which yield sparse or partially filled attention matrices. Examples include attention masks designed to reduce the quadratic complexity of attention, sequence packing techniques, and recent innovations like tree masking for fast validation in MEDUSA. Despite the inherent sparsity in these matrices, the state-of-the-art algorithm Flash Attention still processes them with quadratic complexity as though they were dense. In this paper, we introduce Binary Block Masking, a highly efficient modification that enhances Flash Attention by making it mask-aware. We further propose two optimizations: one tailored for masks with contiguous non-zero patterns and another for extremely sparse masks. Our experiments on attention masks derived from real-world scenarios demonstrate up to a 9x runtime improvement. The implementation will be publicly released to foster further research and application.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15097v2,2024-09
Using Similarity to Evaluate Factual Consistency in Summaries,"Yuxuan Ye, Edwin Simpson, Raul Santos Rodriguez","Cutting-edge abstractive summarisers generate fluent summaries, but the factuality of the generated text is not guaranteed. Early summary factuality evaluation metrics are usually based on n-gram overlap and embedding similarity, but are reported fail to align with human annotations. Therefore, many techniques for detecting factual inconsistencies build pipelines around natural language inference (NLI) or question-answering (QA) models with additional supervised learning steps. In this paper, we revisit similarity-based metrics, showing that this failure stems from the comparison text selection and its granularity. We propose a new zero-shot factuality evaluation metric, Sentence-BERT Score (SBERTScore), which compares sentences between the summary and the source document. It outperforms widely-used word-word metrics including BERTScore and can compete with existing NLI and QA-based factuality metrics on the benchmark without needing any fine-tuning. Our experiments indicate that each technique has different strengths, with SBERTScore particularly effective in identifying correct summaries. We demonstrate how a combination of techniques is more effective in detecting various types of error.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15090v1,2024-09
Enhancing Scientific Reproducibility Through Automated BioCompute Object Creation Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation from Publications,"Sean Kim, Raja Mazumder","The exponential growth in computational power and accessibility has transformed the complexity and scale of bioinformatics research, necessitating standardized documentation for transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance. The IEEE BioCompute Object (BCO) standard addresses this need but faces adoption challenges due to the overhead of creating compliant documentation, especially for legacy research. This paper presents a novel approach to automate the creation of BCOs from scientific papers using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). We describe the development of the BCO assistant tool that leverages RAG to extract relevant information from source papers and associated code repositories, addressing key challenges such as LLM hallucination and long-context understanding. The implementation incorporates optimized retrieval processes, including a two-pass retrieval with re-ranking, and employs carefully engineered prompts for each BCO domain. We discuss the tool's architecture, extensibility, and evaluation methods, including automated and manual assessment approaches. The BCO assistant demonstrates the potential to significantly reduce the time and effort required for retroactive documentation of bioinformatics research while maintaining compliance with the standard. This approach opens avenues for AI-assisted scientific documentation and knowledge extraction from publications thereby enhancing scientific reproducibility.

Our approach utilizes instruction-tuned prompting to generate rich, contextual conversations about cropped images, using their English captions as additional context. These synthetic conversations are then translated into the target languages. Finally, we employ a weighted prompting strategy, balancing the original English caption with the translated conversation to generate captions in the target language. This method achieved competitive results, scoring 37.90 BLEU on the English-Hindi Challenge Set and ranking first and second for English-Hausa on the Challenge and Evaluation Leaderboards, respectively. We conduct additional experiments on a subset of 250 images, exploring the trade-offs between BLEU scores and semantic similarity across various weighting schemes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15052v1,2024-09
Scaling Laws of Decoder-Only Models on the Multilingual Machine Translation Task,"Gaëtan Caillaut, Raheel Qader, Mariam Nakhlé, Jingshu Liu, Jean-Gabriel Barthélemy","Recent studies have showcased remarkable capabilities of decoder-only models in many NLP tasks, including translation. Yet, the machine translation field has been largely dominated by encoder-decoder models based on the Transformer architecture. As a consequence, scaling laws of encoder-decoder models for neural machine translation have already been well studied, but decoder-only models have received less attention. This work explores the scaling laws of decoder-only models on the multilingual and multidomain translation task. We trained a collection of six decoder-only models, ranging from 70M to 7B parameters, on a sentence-level, multilingual and multidomain dataset. We conducted a series of experiments showing that the loss of decoder-only models can be estimated using a scaling law similar to the one discovered for large language models, but we also show that this scaling law has difficulties to generalize to too large models or to a different data distribution. We also study different scaling methods and show that scaling the depth and the width of a model lead to similar test loss improvements, but with different impact on the model's efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15051v1,2024-09
Can CLIP Count Stars? An Empirical Study on Quantity Bias in CLIP,"Zeliang Zhang, Zhuo Liu, Mingqian Feng, Chenliang Xu","CLIP has demonstrated great versatility in adapting to various downstream tasks, such as image editing and generation, visual question answering, and video understanding. However, CLIP-based applications often suffer from misunderstandings regarding user intent, leading to discrepancies between the required number of objects and the actual outputs in image generation tasks. In this work, we empirically investigate the quantity bias in CLIP. By carefully designing different experimental settings and datasets, we comprehensively evaluate CLIP's understanding of quantity from text, image, and cross-modal perspectives. Our experimental results reveal a quantity bias in CLIP embeddings, impacting the reliability of downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15035v1,2024-09
Generative LLM Powered Conversational AI Application for Personalized Risk Assessment: A Case Study in COVID-19,"Mohammad Amin Roshani, Xiangyu Zhou, Yao Qiang, Srinivasan Suresh, Steve Hicks, Usha Sethuraman, Dongxiao Zhu","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language tasks and are increasingly being applied in healthcare domains. This work demonstrates a new LLM-powered disease risk assessment approach via streaming human-AI conversation, eliminating the need for programming required by traditional machine learning approaches. In a COVID-19 severity risk assessment case study, we fine-tune pre-trained generative LLMs (e.g., Llama2-7b and Flan-t5-xl) using a few shots of natural language examples, comparing their performance with traditional classifiers (i.e., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest) that are trained de novo using tabular data across various experimental settings. We develop a mobile application that uses these fine-tuned LLMs as its generative AI (GenAI) core to facilitate real-time interaction between clinicians and patients, providing no-code risk assessment through conversational interfaces. This integration not only allows for the use of streaming Questions and Answers (QA) as inputs but also offers personalized feature importance analysis derived from the LLM's attention layers, enhancing the interpretability of risk assessments. By achieving high Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores with a limited number of fine-tuning samples, our results demonstrate the potential of generative LLMs to outperform discriminative classification methods in low-data regimes, highlighting their real-world adaptability and effectiveness. This work aims to fill the existing gap in leveraging generative LLMs for interactive no-code risk assessment and to encourage further research in this emerging field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15027v1,2024-09
Inference-Friendly Models With MixAttention,"Shashank Rajput, Ying Sheng, Sean Owen, Vitaliy Chiley","The size of the key-value (KV) cache plays a critical role in determining both the maximum context length and the number of concurrent requests supported during inference in modern language models. The KV cache size grows proportionally with the number of attention heads and the tokens processed, leading to increased memory consumption and slower inference for long inputs. In this work, we explore the use of MixAttention, a model architecture modification closely related to a blog published by Character.AI. MixAttention combines sliding window attention, where only a small subset of recent tokens is stored in the KV cache, with KV cache sharing across layers. Our experiments demonstrate that MixAttention significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed without sacrificing model performance in both short and long-context tasks. We also explore various configurations of this architecture, identifying those that maintain quality across evaluation metrics while optimizing resource efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15012v1,2024-09
ViBERTgrid BiLSTM-CRF: Multimodal Key Information Extraction from Unstructured Financial Documents,"Furkan Pala, Mehmet Yasin Akpınar, Onur Deniz, Gülşen Eryiğit","Multimodal key information extraction (KIE) models have been studied extensively on semi-structured documents. However, their investigation on unstructured documents is an emerging research topic. The paper presents an approach to adapt a multimodal transformer (i.e., ViBERTgrid previously explored on semi-structured documents) for unstructured financial documents, by incorporating a BiLSTM-CRF layer. The proposed ViBERTgrid BiLSTM-CRF model demonstrates a significant improvement in performance (up to 2 percentage points) on named entity recognition from unstructured documents in financial domain, while maintaining its KIE performance on semi-structured documents. As an additional contribution, we publicly released token-level annotations for the SROIE dataset in order to pave the way for its use in multimodal sequence labeling models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15004v1,2024-09
Enhancing Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis in Tourism Using Large Language Models and Positional Information,"Chun Xu, Mengmeng Wang, Yan Ren, Shaolin Zhu","Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) in tourism plays a significant role in understanding tourists' evaluations of specific aspects of attractions, which is crucial for driving innovation and development in the tourism industry. However, traditional pipeline models are afflicted by issues such as error propagation and incomplete extraction of sentiment elements. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes an aspect-based sentiment analysis model, ACOS_LLM, for Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (ACOSQE). The model comprises two key stages: auxiliary knowledge generation and ACOSQE. Firstly, Adalora is used to fine-tune large language models for generating high-quality auxiliary knowledge. To enhance model efficiency, Sparsegpt is utilized to compress the fine-tuned model to 50% sparsity. Subsequently, Positional information and sequence modeling are employed to achieve the ACOSQE task, with auxiliary knowledge and the original text as inputs. Experiments are conducted on both self-created tourism datasets and publicly available datasets, Rest15 and Rest16. Results demonstrate the model's superior performance, with an F1 improvement of 7.49% compared to other models on the tourism dataset. Additionally, there is an F1 improvement of 0.05% and 1.06% on the Rest15 and Rest16 datasets, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14997v1,2024-09
Beyond Fine-tuning: Unleashing the Potential of Continuous Pretraining for Clinical LLMs,"Clément Christophe, Tathagata Raha, Svetlana Maslenkova, Muhammad Umar Salman, Praveen K Kanithi, Marco AF Pimentel, Shadab Khan","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in transforming clinical applications. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of four techniques in adapting LLMs for clinical use-cases: continuous pretraining, instruct fine-tuning, NEFTune, and prompt engineering. We employ these methods on Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B models, leveraging a large-scale clinical pretraining dataset of 50 billion tokens and an instruct fine-tuning dataset of 500 million tokens. Our evaluation across various clinical tasks reveals the impact of each technique. While continuous pretraining beyond 250 billion tokens yields marginal improvements on its own, it establishes a strong foundation for instruct fine-tuning. Notably, NEFTune, designed primarily to enhance generation quality, surprisingly demonstrates additional gains on our benchmark. Complex prompt engineering methods further enhance performance. These findings show the importance of tailoring fine-tuning strategies and exploring innovative techniques to optimize LLM performance in the clinical domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14988v1,2024-09
Evaluating Theory of (an uncertain) Mind: Predicting the Uncertain Beliefs of Others in Conversation Forecasting,"Anthony Sicilia, Malihe Alikhani","Typically, when evaluating Theory of Mind, we consider the beliefs of others to be binary: held or not held. But what if someone is unsure about their own beliefs? How can we quantify this uncertainty? We propose a new suite of tasks, challenging language models (LMs) to model the uncertainty of others in dialogue. We design these tasks around conversation forecasting, wherein an agent forecasts an unobserved outcome to a conversation. Uniquely, we view interlocutors themselves as forecasters, asking an LM to predict the uncertainty of the interlocutors (a probability). We experiment with re-scaling methods, variance reduction strategies, and demographic context, for this regression task, conducting experiments on three dialogue corpora (social, negotiation, task-oriented) with eight LMs. While LMs can explain up to 7% variance in the uncertainty of others, we highlight the difficulty of the tasks and room for future work, especially in practical applications, like anticipating ``false",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14986v1,2024-09
Bilingual Rhetorical Structure Parsing with Large Parallel Annotations,Elena Chistova,"Discourse parsing is a crucial task in natural language processing that aims to reveal the higher-level relations in a text. Despite growing interest in cross-lingual discourse parsing, challenges persist due to limited parallel data and inconsistencies in the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) application across languages and corpora. To address this, we introduce a parallel Russian annotation for the large and diverse English GUM RST corpus. Leveraging recent advances, our end-to-end RST parser achieves state-of-the-art results on both English and Russian corpora. It demonstrates effectiveness in both monolingual and bilingual settings, successfully transferring even with limited second-language annotation. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to evaluate the potential of cross-lingual end-to-end RST parsing on a manually annotated parallel corpus.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14969v1,2024-09
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Beyond: A Comprehensive Survey on How to Make your LLMs use External Data More Wisely,"Siyun Zhao, Yuqing Yang, Zilong Wang, Zhiyuan He, Luna K. Qiu, Lili Qiu","Large language models (LLMs) augmented with external data have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in completing real-world tasks. Techniques for integrating external data into LLMs, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and fine-tuning, are gaining increasing attention and widespread application. Nonetheless, the effective deployment of data-augmented LLMs across various specialized fields presents substantial challenges. These challenges encompass a wide range of issues, from retrieving relevant data and accurately interpreting user intent to fully harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for complex tasks. We believe that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for data-augmented LLM applications. In practice, underperformance often arises from a failure to correctly identify the core focus of a task or because the task inherently requires a blend of multiple capabilities that must be disentangled for better resolution. In this survey, we propose a RAG task categorization method, classifying user queries into four levels based on the type of external data required and primary focus of the task: explicit fact queries, implicit fact queries, interpretable rationale queries, and hidden rationale queries. We define these levels of queries, provide relevant datasets, and summarize the key challenges and most effective techniques for addressing these challenges. Finally, we discuss three main forms of integrating external data into LLMs: context, small model, and fine-tuning, highlighting their respective strengths, limitations, and the types of problems they are suited to solve. This work aims to help readers thoroughly understand and decompose the data requirements and key bottlenecks in building LLM applications, offering solutions to the different challenges and serving as a guide to systematically developing such applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14924v1,2024-09
With Ears to See and Eyes to Hear: Sound Symbolism Experiments with Multimodal Large Language Models,"Tyler Loakman, Yucheng Li, Chenghua Lin","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated aptitude as potential substitutes for human participants in experiments testing psycholinguistic phenomena. However, an understudied question is to what extent models that only have access to vision and text modalities are able to implicitly understand sound-based phenomena via abstract reasoning from orthography and imagery alone. To investigate this, we analyse the ability of VLMs and LLMs to demonstrate sound symbolism (i.e., to recognise a non-arbitrary link between sounds and concepts) as well as their ability to ""hear"" via the interplay of the language and vision modules of open and closed-source multimodal models. We perform multiple experiments, including replicating the classic Kiki-Bouba and Mil-Mal shape and magnitude symbolism tasks, and comparing human judgements of linguistic iconicity with that of LLMs. Our results show that VLMs demonstrate varying levels of agreement with human labels, and more task information may be required for VLMs versus their human counterparts for in silico experimentation. We additionally see through higher maximum agreement levels that Magnitude Symbolism is an easier pattern for VLMs to identify than Shape Symbolism, and that an understanding of linguistic iconicity is highly dependent on model size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14917v2,2024-09
Towards a Realistic Long-Term Benchmark for Open-Web Research Agents,"Peter Mühlbacher, Nikos I. Bosse, Lawrence Phillips","We present initial results of a forthcoming benchmark for evaluating LLM agents on white-collar tasks of economic value. We evaluate agents on real-world ""messy"" open-web research tasks of the type that are routine in finance and consulting. In doing so, we lay the groundwork for an LLM agent evaluation suite where good performance directly corresponds to a large economic and societal impact. We built and tested several agent architectures with o1-preview, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 (405b), and GPT-4o-mini. On average, LLM agents powered by Claude-3.5 Sonnet and o1-preview substantially outperformed agents using GPT-4o, with agents based on Llama 3.1 (405b) and GPT-4o-mini lagging noticeably behind. Across LLMs, a ReAct architecture with the ability to delegate subtasks to subagents performed best. In addition to quantitative evaluations, we qualitatively assessed the performance of the LLM agents by inspecting their traces and reflecting on their observations. Our evaluation represents the first in-depth assessment of agents' abilities to conduct challenging, economically valuable analyst-style research on the real open web.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14913v2,2024-09
Knowledge Planning in Large Language Models for Domain-Aligned Counseling Summarization,"Aseem Srivastava, Smriti Joshi, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Md Shad Akhtar","In mental health counseling, condensing dialogues into concise and relevant summaries (aka counseling notes) holds pivotal significance. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in various generative tasks; however, their adaptation to domain-specific intricacies remains challenging, especially within mental health contexts. Unlike standard LLMs, mental health experts first plan to apply domain knowledge in writing summaries. Our work enhances LLMs' ability by introducing a novel planning engine to orchestrate structuring knowledge alignment. To achieve high-order planning, we divide knowledge encapsulation into two major phases: (i) holding dialogue structure and (ii) incorporating domain-specific knowledge. We employ a planning engine on Llama-2, resulting in a novel framework, PIECE. Our proposed system employs knowledge filtering-cum-scaffolding to encapsulate domain knowledge. Additionally, PIECE leverages sheaf convolution learning to enhance its understanding of the dialogue's structural nuances. We compare PIECE with 14 baseline methods and observe a significant improvement across ROUGE and Bleurt scores. Further, expert evaluation and analyses validate the generation quality to be effective, sometimes even surpassing the gold standard. We further benchmark PIECE with other LLMs and report improvement, including Llama-2 (+2.72%), Mistral (+2.04%), and Zephyr (+1.59%), to justify the generalizability of the planning engine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14907v1,2024-09
DSG-KD: Knowledge Distillation from Domain-Specific to General Language Models,"Sangyeon Cho, Jangyeong Jeon, Dongjoon Lee, Changhee Lee, Junyeong Kim","The use of pre-trained language models fine-tuned to address specific downstream tasks is a common approach in natural language processing (NLP). However, acquiring domain-specific knowledge via fine-tuning is challenging. Traditional methods involve pretraining language models using vast amounts of domain-specific data before fine-tuning for particular tasks. This study investigates emergency/non-emergency classification tasks based on electronic medical record (EMR) data obtained from pediatric emergency departments (PEDs) in Korea. Our findings reveal that existing domain-specific pre-trained language models underperform compared to general language models in handling N-lingual free-text data characteristics of non-English-speaking regions. To address these limitations, we propose a domain knowledge transfer methodology that leverages knowledge distillation to infuse general language models with domain-specific knowledge via fine-tuning. This study demonstrates the effective transfer of specialized knowledge between models by defining a general language model as the student model and a domain-specific pre-trained model as the teacher model. In particular, we address the complexities of EMR data obtained from PEDs in non-English-speaking regions, such as Korea, and demonstrate that the proposed method enhances classification performance in such contexts. The proposed methodology not only outperforms baseline models on Korean PED EMR data, but also promises broader applicability in various professional and technical domains. In future works, we intend to extend this methodology to include diverse non-English-speaking regions and address additional downstream tasks, with the aim of developing advanced model architectures using state-of-the-art KD techniques.

End-to-End Graph Flattening Method for Large Language Models,"Bin Hong, Jinze Wu, Jiayu Liu, Liang Ding, Jing Sha, Kai Zhang, Shijin Wang, Zhenya Huang","In recent years, the breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new ideas for achieving universal methods on graph data. The common practice of converting graphs into natural language for LLMs, which refers to graph flattening, exhibits good generalizability and interpretability. However, the poor organization of the textual format results in poor performance in long-distance scenario understanding. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning habits, we propose a novel method for graph flattening to fit LLMs, termed as End-to-End DAG-Path prompting (EEDP). Experiments on real-world datasets show that EEDP enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs in long-distance scenarios while maintaining excellent performance in short-distance scenarios, demonstrating good robustness in the face of distance variations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14880v1,2024-09
Privacy Policy Analysis through Prompt Engineering for LLMs,"Arda Goknil, Femke B. Gelderblom, Simeon Tverdal, Shukun Tokas, Hui Song","Privacy policies are often obfuscated by their complexity, which impedes transparency and informed consent. Conventional machine learning approaches for automatically analyzing these policies demand significant resources and substantial domain-specific training, causing adaptability issues. Moreover, they depend on extensive datasets that may require regular maintenance due to changing privacy concerns.   In this paper, we propose, apply, and assess PAPEL (Privacy Policy Analysis through Prompt Engineering for LLMs), a framework harnessing the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) through prompt engineering to automate the analysis of privacy policies. PAPEL aims to streamline the extraction, annotation, and summarization of information from these policies, enhancing their accessibility and comprehensibility without requiring additional model training. By integrating zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning approaches and the chain-of-thought prompting in creating predefined prompts and prompt templates, PAPEL guides LLMs to efficiently dissect, interpret, and synthesize the critical aspects of privacy policies into user-friendly summaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PAPEL with two applications: (i) annotation and (ii) contradiction analysis. We assess the ability of several LLaMa and GPT models to identify and articulate data handling practices, offering insights comparable to existing automated analysis approaches while reducing training efforts and increasing the adaptability to new analytical needs. The experiments demonstrate that the LLMs PAPEL utilizes (LLaMA and Chat GPT models) achieve robust performance in privacy policy annotation, with F1 scores reaching 0.8 and above (using the OPP-115 gold standard), underscoring the effectiveness of simpler prompts across various advanced language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14879v1,2024-09
The ParlaSpeech Collection of Automatically Generated Speech and Text Datasets from Parliamentary Proceedings,"Nikola Ljubešić, Peter Rupnik, Danijel Koržinek","Recent significant improvements in speech and language technologies come both from self-supervised approaches over raw language data as well as various types of explicit supervision. To ensure high-quality processing of spoken data, the most useful type of explicit supervision is still the alignment between the speech signal and its corresponding text transcript, which is a data type that is not available for many languages. In this paper, we present our approach to building large and open speech-and-text-aligned datasets of less-resourced languages based on transcripts of parliamentary proceedings and their recordings. Our starting point are the ParlaMint comparable corpora of transcripts of parliamentary proceedings of 26 national European parliaments. In the pilot run on expanding the ParlaMint corpora with aligned publicly available recordings, we focus on three Slavic languages, namely Croatian, Polish, and Serbian. The main challenge of our approach is the lack of any global alignment between the ParlaMint texts and the available recordings, as well as the sometimes varying data order in each of the modalities, which requires a novel approach in aligning long sequences of text and audio in a large search space. The results of this pilot run are three high-quality datasets that span more than 5,000 hours of speech and accompanying text transcripts. Although these datasets already make a huge difference in the availability of spoken and textual data for the three languages, we want to emphasize the potential of the presented approach in building similar datasets for many more languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15397v2,2024-09

We participate in the bilingual machine translation task and multi-domain machine translation task. For these two translation tasks, we use training strategies such as regularized dropout, bidirectional training, data diversification, forward translation, back translation, alternated training, curriculum learning, and transductive ensemble learning to train neural machine translation (NMT) models based on the deep Transformer-big architecture. Furthermore, to explore whether large language model (LLM) can help improve the translation quality of NMT systems, we use supervised fine-tuning to train llama2-13b as an Automatic post-editing (APE) model to improve the translation results of the NMT model on the multi-domain machine translation task.

Orthogonal Finetuning for Direct Preference Optimization,"Chenxu Yang, Ruipeng Jia, Naibin Gu, Zheng Lin, Siyuan Chen, Chao Pang, Weichong Yin, Yu Sun, Hua Wu, Weiping Wang","DPO is an effective preference optimization algorithm. However, the DPO-tuned models tend to overfit on the dispreferred samples, manifested as overly long generations lacking diversity. While recent regularization approaches have endeavored to alleviate this issue by modifying the objective function, they achieved that at the cost of alignment performance degradation. In this paper, we innovatively incorporate regularization from the perspective of weight updating to curb alignment overfitting. Through the pilot experiment, we discovered that there exists a positive correlation between overfitting and the hyperspherical energy fluctuation. Hence, we introduce orthogonal finetuning for DPO via a weight-Rotated Preference Optimization (RoPO) method, which merely conducts rotational and magnitude-stretching updates on the weight parameters to maintain the hyperspherical energy invariant, thereby preserving the knowledge encoded in the angle between neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model aligns perfectly with human preferences while retaining the original expressive capacity using only 0.0086% of the trainable parameters, suggesting an effective regularization against overfitting. Specifically, RoPO outperforms DPO by up to 10 points on MT-Bench and by up to 2.8 points on AlpacaEval 2, while enhancing the generation diversity by an average of 6 points.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14836v2,2024-09
ToolPlanner: A Tool Augmented LLM for Multi Granularity Instructions with Path Planning and Feedback,"Qinzhuo Wu, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang","Recently, tool-augmented LLMs have gained increasing attention. Given an instruction, tool-augmented LLMs can interact with various external tools in multiple rounds and provide a final answer. However, previous LLMs were trained on overly detailed instructions, which included API names or parameters, while real users would not explicitly mention these API details. This leads to a gap between trained LLMs and real-world scenarios. In addition, most works ignore whether the interaction process follows the instruction. To address these issues, we constructed a training dataset called MGToolBench, which contains statement and category-level instructions to better reflect real-world scenarios. In addition, we propose ToolPlanner, a two-stage reinforcement learning framework that utilizes path planning and two feedback mechanisms to enhance the LLM's task completion and instruction-following capabilities. Experimental results show that ToolPlanner significantly improves the Match Rate, Pass Rate and Win Rate by 26.8%, 20.2%, and 5.6% compared to the SOTA model. Human evaluation verifies that the multi-granularity instructions can better align with users' usage habits.

Past Meets Present: Creating Historical Analogy with Large Language Models,"Nianqi Li, Siyu Yuan, Jiangjie Chen, Jiaqing Liang, Feng Wei, Zujie Liang, Deqing Yang, Yanghua Xiao","Historical analogies, which compare known past events with contemporary but unfamiliar events, are important abilities that help people make decisions and understand the world. However, research in applied history suggests that people have difficulty finding appropriate analogies. And previous studies in the AI community have also overlooked historical analogies. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on the historical analogy acquisition task, which aims to acquire analogous historical events for a given event. We explore retrieval and generation methods for acquiring historical analogies based on different large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we propose a self-reflection method to mitigate hallucinations and stereotypes when LLMs generate historical analogies. Through human evaluations and our specially designed automatic multi-dimensional assessment, we find that LLMs generally have a good potential for historical analogies. And the performance of the models can be further improved by using our self-reflection method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14820v1,2024-09
MobileVLM: A Vision-Language Model for Better Intra- and Inter-UI Understanding,"Qinzhuo Wu, Weikai Xu, Wei Liu, Tao Tan, Jianfeng Liu, Ang Li, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Shuo Shang","Recently, mobile AI agents based on VLMs have been gaining increasing attention. These works typically utilize VLM as a foundation, fine-tuning it with instruction-based mobile datasets. However, these VLMs are typically pre-trained on general-domain data, which often results in a lack of fundamental capabilities specific to the mobile domain. Therefore, they may struggle to recognize specific UI elements and understand intra-UI fine-grained information. In addition, the current fine-tuning task focuses on interacting with the most relevant element for the given instruction. These fine-tuned VLMs may still ignore the relationships between UI pages, neglect the roles of elements in page transitions and lack inter-UI understanding. To address issues, we propose a VLM called MobileVLM, which includes two additional pre-training stages to enhance both intra- and inter-UI understanding. We defined four UI-based pre-training tasks, enabling the model to better perceive fine-grained elements and capture page transition actions. To address the lack of mobile pre-training data, we built a large Chinese mobile dataset Mobile3M from scratch, which contains 3 million UI pages, and real-world transition actions, forming a directed graph structure. Experimental results show MobileVLM excels on both our test set and public mobile benchmarks, outperforming existing VLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14818v2,2024-09

Our work introduces a novel problem setting focusing on these moments as turning points (TPs), accompanied by a meticulously curated, high-consensus, human-annotated multi-modal dataset. We provide precise timestamps, descriptions, and visual-textual evidence high-lighting changes in emotions, behaviors, perspectives, and decisions at these turning points. We also propose a framework, TPMaven, utilizing state-of-the-art vision-language models to construct a narrative from the videos and large language models to classify and detect turning points in our multi-modal dataset. Evaluation results show that TPMaven achieves an F1-score of 0.88 in classification and 0.61 in detection, with additional explanations aligning with human expectations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14801v1,2024-09
Towards Efficient and Robust VQA-NLE Data Generation with Large Vision-Language Models,"Patrick Amadeus Irawan, Genta Indra Winata, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Ayu Purwarianti","Natural Language Explanation (NLE) aims to elucidate the decision-making process by providing detailed, human-friendly explanations in natural language. It helps demystify the decision-making processes of large vision-language models (LVLMs) through the use of language models. While existing methods for creating a Vision Question-Answering with Natural Language Explanation (VQA-NLE) datasets can provide explanations, they heavily rely on human annotations that are time-consuming and costly. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages LVLMs to efficiently generate high-quality synthetic VQA-NLE datasets. By evaluating our synthetic data, we showcase how advanced prompting techniques can lead to the production of high-quality VQA-NLE data. Our findings indicate that this proposed method achieves up to 20x faster than human annotation, with only a minimal decrease in qualitative metrics, achieving robust quality that is nearly equivalent to human-annotated data. Furthermore, we show that incorporating visual prompts significantly enhances the relevance of text generation.

Pretraining Data Detection for Large Language Models: A Divergence-based Calibration Method,"Weichao Zhang, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng","As the scale of training corpora for large language models (LLMs) grows, model developers become increasingly reluctant to disclose details on their data. This lack of transparency poses challenges to scientific evaluation and ethical deployment. Recently, pretraining data detection approaches, which infer whether a given text was part of an LLM's training data through black-box access, have been explored. The Min-K\% Prob method, which has achieved state-of-the-art results, assumes that a non-training example tends to contain a few outlier words with low token probabilities. However, the effectiveness may be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many common words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue, we introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for pretraining data detection. We compute the cross-entropy (i.e., the divergence) between the token probability distribution and the token frequency distribution to derive a detection score. We have developed a Chinese-language benchmark, PatentMIA, to assess the performance of detection approaches for LLMs on Chinese text. Experimental results on English-language benchmarks and PatentMIA demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods. Our code and PatentMIA benchmark are available at \url{https://github.com/zhang-wei-chao/DC-PDD}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14781v4,2024-09

OMPar integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) through two key components: OMPify, which assesses loop parallelization potential, and MonoCoder-OMP, a new fine-tuned model which generates precise OpenMP pragmas. The evaluation of OMPar follows the same rigorous process applied to traditional tools like source-to-source AutoPar and ICPC compilers: (1) ensuring the generated code compiles and runs correctly in serial form, (2) assessing performance with the gradual addition of threads and corresponding physical cores, and (3) verifying and validating the correctness of the code's output. Benchmarks from HeCBench and ParEval are used to evaluate accuracy and performance. Experimental results demonstrate that OMPar significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving higher accuracy in identifying parallelizable loops and generating efficient pragmas. Beyond accuracy, OMPar offers advantages such as the ability to work on partial or incomplete codebases and the capacity to continuously learn from new code patterns, enhancing its parallelization capabilities over time. These results underscore the potential of LLMs in revolutionizing automatic parallelization techniques, paving the way for more efficient and scalable parallel computing systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14771v1,2024-09
Language-Agnostic Analysis of Speech Depression Detection,"Sona Binu, Jismi Jose, Fathima Shimna K V, Alino Luke Hans, Reni K. Cherian, Starlet Ben Alex, Priyanka Srivastava, Chiranjeevi Yarra","The people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) exhibit the symptoms of tonal variations in their speech compared to the healthy counterparts. However, these tonal variations not only confine to the state of MDD but also on the language, which has unique tonal patterns. This work analyzes automatic speech-based depression detection across two languages, English and Malayalam, which exhibits distinctive prosodic and phonemic characteristics. We propose an approach that utilizes speech data collected along with self-reported labels from participants reading sentences from IViE corpus, in both English and Malayalam. The IViE corpus consists of five sets of sentences: simple sentences, WH-questions, questions without morphosyntactic markers, inversion questions and coordinations, that can naturally prompt speakers to speak in different tonal patterns. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed for detecting depression from speech. The CNN model is trained to identify acoustic features associated with depression in speech, focusing on both languages. The model's performance is evaluated on the collected dataset containing recordings from both depressed and non-depressed speakers, analyzing its effectiveness in detecting depression across the two languages. Our findings and collected data could contribute to the development of language-agnostic speech-based depression detection systems, thereby enhancing accessibility for diverse populations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14769v1,2024-09
Do Large Language Models have Problem-Solving Capability under Incomplete Information Scenarios?,"Yuyan Chen, Tianhao Yu, Yueze Li, Songzhou Yan, Sijia Liu, Jiaqing Liang, Yanghua Xiao","The evaluation of the problem-solving capability under incomplete information scenarios of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important, encompassing capabilities such as questioning, knowledge search, error detection, and path planning. Current research mainly focus on LLMs' problem-solving capability such as ``Twenty Questions''. However, these kinds of games do not require recognizing misleading cues which are necessary in the incomplete information scenario. Moreover, the existing game such as ``Who is undercover'' are highly subjective, making it challenging for evaluation. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel game named BrainKing based on the ``Who is undercover'' and ``Twenty Questions'' for evaluating LLM capabilities under incomplete information scenarios. It requires LLMs to identify target entities with limited yes-or-no questions and potential misleading answers. By setting up easy, medium, and hard difficulty modes, we comprehensively assess the performance of LLMs across various aspects. Our results reveal the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in BrainKing, providing significant insights of LLM problem-solving levels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14762v1,2024-09
FineCops-Ref: A new Dataset and Task for Fine-Grained Compositional Referring Expression Comprehension,"Junzhuo Liu, Xuzheng Yang, Weiwei Li, Peng Wang","Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a crucial cross-modal task that objectively evaluates the capabilities of language understanding, image comprehension, and language-to-image grounding. Consequently, it serves as an ideal testing ground for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In pursuit of this goal, we have established a new REC dataset characterized by two key features: Firstly, it is designed with controllable varying levels of difficulty, necessitating multi-level fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and multi-hop relationships. Secondly, it includes negative text and images created through fine-grained editing and generation based on existing data, thereby testing the model's ability to correctly reject scenarios where the target object is not visible in the image--an essential aspect often overlooked in existing datasets and approaches. Utilizing this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive evaluations of both state-of-the-art specialist models and MLLMs. Our findings indicate that there remains a significant gap in achieving satisfactory grounding performance. We anticipate that our dataset will inspire new approaches to enhance visual reasoning and develop more advanced cross-modal interaction strategies, ultimately unlocking the full potential of MLLMs. Our code and the datasets are available at https://github.com/liujunzhuo/FineCops-Ref.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14750v1,2024-09
LINKAGE: Listwise Ranking among Varied-Quality References for Non-Factoid QA Evaluation via LLMs,"Sihui Yang, Keping Bi, Wanqing Cui, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng","Non-Factoid (NF) Question Answering (QA) is challenging to evaluate due to diverse potential answers and no objective criterion. The commonly used automatic evaluation metrics like ROUGE or BERTScore cannot accurately measure semantic similarities or answers from different perspectives. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been resorted to for NFQA evaluation due to their compelling performance on various NLP tasks. Common approaches include pointwise scoring of each candidate answer and pairwise comparisons between answers. Inspired by the evolution from pointwise to pairwise to listwise in learning-to-rank methods, we propose a novel listwise NFQA evaluation approach, that utilizes LLMs to rank candidate answers in a list of reference answers sorted by descending quality. Moreover, for NF questions that do not have multi-grade or any golden answers, we leverage LLMs to generate the reference answer list of various quality to facilitate the listwise evaluation. Extensive experimental results on three NFQA datasets, i.e., ANTIQUE, the TREC-DL-NF, and WebGLM show that our method has significantly higher correlations with human annotations compared to automatic scores and common pointwise and pairwise approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14744v2,2024-09
ToxiCraft: A Novel Framework for Synthetic Generation of Harmful Information,"Zheng Hui, Zhaoxiao Guo, Hang Zhao, Juanyong Duan, Congrui Huang","In different NLP tasks, detecting harmful content is crucial for online environments, especially with the growing influence of social media. However, previous research has two main issues: 1) a lack of data in low-resource settings, and 2) inconsistent definitions and criteria for judging harmful content, requiring classification models to be robust to spurious features and diverse. We propose Toxicraft, a novel framework for synthesizing datasets of harmful information to address these weaknesses. With only a small amount of seed data, our framework can generate a wide variety of synthetic, yet remarkably realistic, examples of toxic information. Experimentation across various datasets showcases a notable enhancement in detection model robustness and adaptability, surpassing or close to the gold labels. We release the generated data at Github upon acceptance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14740v1,2024-09
Parse Trees Guided LLM Prompt Compression,"Wenhao Mao, Chengbin Hou, Tianyu Zhang, Xinyu Lin, Ke Tang, Hairong Lv","Offering rich contexts to Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown to boost the performance in various tasks, but the resulting longer prompt would increase the computational cost and might exceed the input limit of LLMs. Recently, some prompt compression methods have been suggested to shorten the length of prompts by using language models to generate shorter prompts or by developing computational models to select important parts of original prompt. The generative compression methods would suffer from issues like hallucination, while the selective compression methods have not involved linguistic rules and overlook the global structure of prompt. To this end, we propose a novel selective compression method called PartPrompt. It first obtains a parse tree for each sentence based on linguistic rules, and calculates local information entropy for each node in a parse tree. These local parse trees are then organized into a global tree according to the hierarchical structure such as the dependency of sentences, paragraphs, and sections. After that, the root-ward propagation and leaf-ward propagation are proposed to adjust node values over the global tree. Finally, a recursive algorithm is developed to prune the global tree based on the adjusted node values. The experiments show that PartPrompt receives the state-of-the-art performance across various datasets, metrics, compression ratios, and target LLMs for inference. The in-depth ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of designs in PartPrompt, and other additional experiments also demonstrate its superiority in terms of the coherence of compressed prompts and in the extreme long prompt scenario.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15395v1,2024-09
ERABAL: Enhancing Role-Playing Agents through Boundary-Aware Learning,"Yihong Tang, Jiao Ou, Che Liu, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai","Role-playing is an emerging application in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), primarily implemented through the alignment training of a large language model (LLM) with assigned characters. Despite significant progress, role-playing agents (RPLAs) still struggle with maintaining role-consistency across conversations, particularly when confronted with boundary queries subtly related to character attributes. In this paper, we present ERABAL, a framework aimed at enhancing RPLAs' role-playing capabilities through boundary-aware learning. ERABAL encompasses a generation pipeline for role-specific dialogues and a concomitant methodology for alignment training. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that ERABAL is both efficient and effective. By training with significantly fewer dialogues than those used in leading approaches, ERABAL achieves notable improvements across WikiRoleEval, CharacterEval, and the role-playing subset of MT-Bench compared to the generalist baseline models. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available to support further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14710v2,2024-09
Target-Aware Language Modeling via Granular Data Sampling,"Ernie Chang, Pin-Jie Lin, Yang Li, Changsheng Zhao, Daeil Kim, Rastislav Rabatin, Zechun Liu, Yangyang Shi, Vikas Chandra","Language model pretraining generally targets a broad range of use cases and incorporates data from diverse sources. However, there are instances where we desire a model that excels in specific areas without markedly compromising performance in other areas. A cost-effective and straightforward approach is sampling with low-dimensional data features, which allows to select large-scale pretraining data for domain-specific use cases. In this work, we revisit importance sampling with n-gram features consisting of multi-granular tokens, which strikes a good balance between sentence compression and representation capabilities. We observed the sampled data to have a high correlation with the target downstream task performance while preserving its effectiveness on other tasks. This leads to the proposed data sampling paradigm where language models can be pretrained more efficiently on selected documents. On eight benchmarks we demonstrate with $\sim$1% of the data, pretrained models perform on par with the full RefinedWeb data and outperform randomly selected samples for model sizes ranging from 125M to 1.5B.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14705v1,2024-09
VLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation for Generalizability of Text-to-Image Models,"Jingtao Cao, Zheng Zhang, Hongru Wang, Kam-Fai Wong","Progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has significantly improved the generation of images from textual descriptions. However, existing evaluation metrics do not adequately assess the models' ability to handle a diverse range of textual prompts, which is crucial for their generalizability. To address this, we introduce a new metric called Visual Language Evaluation Understudy (VLEU). VLEU uses large language models to sample from the visual text domain, the set of all possible input texts for T2I models, to generate a wide variety of prompts. The images generated from these prompts are evaluated based on their alignment with the input text using the CLIP model.VLEU quantifies a model's generalizability by computing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the marginal distribution of the visual text and the conditional distribution of the images generated by the model. This metric provides a quantitative way to compare different T2I models and track improvements during model finetuning. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VLEU in evaluating the generalization capability of various T2I models, positioning it as an essential metric for future research in text-to-image synthesis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14704v2,2024-09
MemeCLIP: Leveraging CLIP Representations for Multimodal Meme Classification,"Siddhant Bikram Shah, Shuvam Shiwakoti, Maheep Chaudhary, Haohan Wang","The complexity of text-embedded images presents a formidable challenge in machine learning given the need for multimodal understanding of multiple aspects of expression conveyed by them. While previous research in multimodal analysis has primarily focused on singular aspects such as hate speech and its subclasses, this study expands this focus to encompass multiple aspects of linguistics: hate, targets of hate, stance, and humor. We introduce a novel dataset PrideMM comprising 5,063 text-embedded images associated with the LGBTQ+ Pride movement, thereby addressing a serious gap in existing resources. We conduct extensive experimentation on PrideMM by using unimodal and multimodal baseline methods to establish benchmarks for each task. Additionally, we propose a novel framework MemeCLIP for efficient downstream learning while preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained CLIP model. The results of our experiments show that MemeCLIP achieves superior performance compared to previously proposed frameworks on two real-world datasets. We further compare the performance of MemeCLIP and zero-shot GPT-4 on the hate classification task. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of our model by qualitatively analyzing misclassified samples.

Reducing the Footprint of Multi-Vector Retrieval with Minimal Performance Impact via Token Pooling,"Benjamin Clavié, Antoine Chaffin, Griffin Adams","Over the last few years, multi-vector retrieval methods, spearheaded by ColBERT, have become an increasingly popular approach to Neural IR. By storing representations at the token level rather than at the document level, these methods have demonstrated very strong retrieval performance, especially in out-of-domain settings. However, the storage and memory requirements necessary to store the large number of associated vectors remain an important drawback, hindering practical adoption. In this paper, we introduce a simple clustering-based token pooling approach to aggressively reduce the number of vectors that need to be stored. This method can reduce the space & memory footprint of ColBERT indexes by 50% with virtually no retrieval performance degradation. This method also allows for further reductions, reducing the vector count by 66%-to-75% , with degradation remaining below 5% on a vast majority of datasets. Importantly, this approach requires no architectural change nor query-time processing, and can be used as a simple drop-in during indexation with any ColBERT-like model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14683v1,2024-09

RACER: Rich Language-Guided Failure Recovery Policies for Imitation Learning,"Yinpei Dai, Jayjun Lee, Nima Fazeli, Joyce Chai","Developing robust and correctable visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation is challenging due to the lack of self-recovery mechanisms from failures and the limitations of simple language instructions in guiding robot actions. To address these issues, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline that automatically augments expert demonstrations with failure recovery trajectories and fine-grained language annotations for training. We then introduce Rich languAge-guided failure reCovERy (RACER), a supervisor-actor framework, which combines failure recovery data with rich language descriptions to enhance robot control. RACER features a vision-language model (VLM) that acts as an online supervisor, providing detailed language guidance for error correction and task execution, and a language-conditioned visuomotor policy as an actor to predict the next actions. Our experimental results show that RACER outperforms the state-of-the-art Robotic View Transformer (RVT) on RLbench across various evaluation settings, including standard long-horizon tasks, dynamic goal-change tasks and zero-shot unseen tasks, achieving superior performance in both simulated and real world environments.

Instruction Tuning Vs. In-Context Learning: Revisiting Large Language Models in Few-Shot Computational Social Science,"Taihang Wang, Xiaoman Xu, Yimin Wang, Ye Jiang","Real-world applications of large language models (LLMs) in computational social science (CSS) tasks primarily depend on the effectiveness of instruction tuning (IT) or in-context learning (ICL). While IT has shown highly effective at fine-tuning LLMs for various tasks, ICL offers a rapid alternative for task adaptation by learning from examples without explicit gradient updates. In this paper, we evaluate the classification performance of LLMs using IT versus ICL in few-shot CSS tasks. The experimental results indicate that ICL consistently outperforms IT in most CSS tasks. Additionally, we investigate the relationship between the increasing number of training samples and LLM performance. Our findings show that simply increasing the number of samples without considering their quality does not consistently enhance the performance of LLMs with either ICL or IT and can sometimes even result in a performance decline. Finally, we compare three prompting strategies, demonstrating that ICL is more effective than zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Our research highlights the significant advantages of ICL in handling CSS tasks in few-shot settings and emphasizes the importance of optimizing sample quality and prompting strategies to improve LLM classification performance.

Direct Judgement Preference Optimization,"Peifeng Wang, Austin Xu, Yilun Zhou, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty","Auto-evaluation is crucial for assessing response quality and offering feedback for model development. Recent studies have explored training large language models (LLMs) as generative judges to evaluate and critique other models' outputs. In this work, we investigate the idea of learning from both positive and negative data with preference optimization to enhance the evaluation capabilities of LLM judges across an array of different use cases. We achieve this by employing three approaches to collect the preference pairs for different use cases, each aimed at improving our generative judge from a different perspective. Our comprehensive study over a wide range of benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. In particular, our generative judge achieves the best performance on 10 out of 13 benchmarks, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-4o and specialized judge models. Further analysis show that our judge model robustly counters inherent biases such as position and length bias, flexibly adapts to any evaluation protocol specified by practitioners, and provides helpful language feedback for improving downstream generator models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14664v2,2024-09
Building Tamil Treebanks,Kengatharaiyer Sarveswaran,"Treebanks are important linguistic resources, which are structured and annotated corpora with rich linguistic annotations. These resources are used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, supporting linguistic analyses, and are essential for training and evaluating various computational models. This paper discusses the creation of Tamil treebanks using three distinct approaches: manual annotation, computational grammars, and machine learning techniques. Manual annotation, though time-consuming and requiring linguistic expertise, ensures high-quality and rich syntactic and semantic information. Computational deep grammars, such as Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG), offer deep linguistic analyses but necessitate significant knowledge of the formalism. Machine learning approaches, utilising off-the-shelf frameworks and tools like Stanza, UDpipe, and UUParser, facilitate the automated annotation of large datasets but depend on the availability of quality annotated data, cross-linguistic training resources, and computational power. The paper discusses the challenges encountered in building Tamil treebanks, including issues with Internet data, the need for comprehensive linguistic analysis, and the difficulty of finding skilled annotators. Despite these challenges, the development of Tamil treebanks is essential for advancing linguistic research and improving NLP tools for Tamil.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14657v1,2024-09
Harmonising the Clinical Melody: Tuning Large Language Models for Hospital Course Summarisation in Clinical Coding,"Bokang Bi, Leibo Liu, Sanja Lujic, Louisa Jorm, Oscar Perez-Concha","The increasing volume and complexity of clinical documentation in Electronic Medical Records systems pose significant challenges for clinical coders, who must mentally process and summarise vast amounts of clinical text to extract essential information needed for coding tasks. While large language models have been successfully applied to shorter summarisation tasks in recent years, the challenge of summarising a hospital course remains an open area for further research and development. In this study, we adapted three pre trained LLMs, Llama 3, BioMistral, Mistral Instruct v0.1 for the hospital course summarisation task, using Quantized Low Rank Adaptation fine tuning. We created a free text clinical dataset from MIMIC III data by concatenating various clinical notes as the input clinical text, paired with ground truth Brief Hospital Course sections extracted from the discharge summaries for model training. The fine tuned models were evaluated using BERTScore and ROUGE metrics to assess the effectiveness of clinical domain fine tuning. Additionally, we validated their practical utility using a novel hospital course summary assessment metric specifically tailored for clinical coding. Our findings indicate that fine tuning pre trained LLMs for the clinical domain can significantly enhance their performance in hospital course summarisation and suggest their potential as assistive tools for clinical coding. Future work should focus on refining data curation methods to create higher quality clinical datasets tailored for hospital course summary tasks and adapting more advanced open source LLMs comparable to proprietary models to further advance this research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14638v2,2024-09

However, it is a long, exhaustive, and time-consuming process. This paper presents a novel model that guides a linguist during the fieldwork and accounts for the dynamics of linguist-speaker interactions. We introduce a novel framework that evaluates the efficiency of various sampling strategies for obtaining morphological data and assesses the effectiveness of state-of-the-art neural models in generalising morphological structures.

Can pre-trained language models generate titles for research papers?,"Tohida Rehman, Debarshi Kumar Sanyal, Samiran Chattopadhyay","The title of a research paper communicates in a succinct style the main theme and, sometimes, the findings of the paper. Coming up with the right title is often an arduous task, and therefore, it would be beneficial to authors if title generation can be automated. In this paper, we fine-tune pre-trained language models to generate titles of papers from their abstracts. Additionally, we use GPT-3.5-turbo in a zero-shot setting to generate paper titles. The performance of the models is measured with ROUGE, METEOR, MoverScore, BERTScore and SciBERTScore metrics. We find that fine-tuned PEGASUS-large outperforms the other models, including fine-tuned LLaMA-3-8B and GPT-3.5-turbo, across most metrics. We also demonstrate that ChatGPT can generate creative titles for papers.

"EchoAtt: Attend, Copy, then Adjust for More Efficient Large Language Models","Hossein Rajabzadeh, Aref Jafari, Aman Sharma, Benyamin Jami, Hyock Ju Kwon, Ali Ghodsi, Boxing Chen, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh","Large Language Models (LLMs), with their increasing depth and number of parameters, have demonstrated outstanding performance across a variety of natural language processing tasks. However, this growth in scale leads to increased computational demands, particularly during inference and fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we introduce EchoAtt, a novel framework aimed at optimizing transformer-based models by analyzing and leveraging the similarity of attention patterns across layers. Our analysis reveals that many inner layers in LLMs, especially larger ones, exhibit highly similar attention matrices. By exploiting this similarity, EchoAtt enables the sharing of attention matrices in less critical layers, significantly reducing computational requirements without compromising performance. We incorporate this approach within a knowledge distillation setup, where a pre-trained teacher model guides the training of a smaller student model. The student model selectively shares attention matrices in layers with high similarity while inheriting key parameters from the teacher. Our best results with TinyLLaMA-1.1B demonstrate that EchoAtt improves inference speed by 15\%, training speed by 25\%, and reduces the number of parameters by approximately 4\%, all while improving zero-shot performance. These findings highlight the potential of attention matrix sharing to enhance the efficiency of LLMs, making them more practical for real-time and resource-limited applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14595v1,2024-09
Backtracking Improves Generation Safety,"Yiming Zhang, Jianfeng Chi, Hailey Nguyen, Kartikeya Upasani, Daniel M. Bikel, Jason Weston, Eric Michael Smith","Text generation has a fundamental limitation almost by definition: there is no taking back tokens that have been generated, even when they are clearly problematic. In the context of language model safety, when a partial unsafe generation is produced, language models by their nature tend to happily keep on generating similarly unsafe additional text. This is in fact how safety alignment of frontier models gets circumvented in the wild, despite great efforts in improving their safety. Deviating from the paradigm of approaching safety alignment as prevention (decreasing the probability of harmful responses), we propose backtracking, a technique that allows language models to ""undo"" and recover from their own unsafe generation through the introduction of a special [RESET] token. Our method can be incorporated into either SFT or DPO training to optimize helpfulness and harmlessness. We show that models trained to backtrack are consistently safer than baseline models: backtracking Llama-3-8B is four times more safe than the baseline model (6.1\% $\to$ 1.5\%) in our evaluations without regression in helpfulness. Our method additionally provides protection against four adversarial attacks including an adaptive attack, despite not being trained to do so.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14586v1,2024-09
The X Types -- Mapping the Semantics of the Twitter Sphere,"Ogen Schlachet Drukerman, Einat Minkov","Social networks form a valuable source of world knowledge, where influential entities correspond to popular accounts. Unlike factual knowledge bases (KBs), which maintain a semantic ontology, structured semantic information is not available on social media. In this work, we consider a social KB of roughly 200K popular Twitter accounts, which denotes entities of interest. We elicit semantic information about those entities. In particular, we associate them with a fine-grained set of 136 semantic types, e.g., determine whether a given entity account belongs to a politician, or a musical artist. In the lack of explicit type information in Twitter, we obtain semantic labels for a subset of the accounts via alignment with the KBs of DBpedia and Wikidata. Given the labeled dataset, we finetune a transformer-based text encoder to generate semantic embeddings of the entities based on the contents of their accounts. We then exploit this evidence alongside network-based embeddings to predict the entities semantic types. In our experiments, we show high type prediction performance on the labeled dataset. Consequently, we apply our type classification model to all of the entity accounts in the social KB. Our analysis of the results offers insights about the global semantics of the Twitter sphere. We discuss downstream applications that should benefit from semantic type information and the semantic embeddings of social entities generated in this work. In particular, we demonstrate enhanced performance on the key task of entity similarity assessment using this information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14584v1,2024-09
Evaluating the Performance and Robustness of LLMs in Materials Science Q&A and Property Predictions,"Hongchen Wang, Kangming Li, Scott Ramsay, Yao Fehlis, Edward Kim, Jason Hattrick-Simpers","Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize scientific research, yet their robustness and reliability in domain-specific applications remain insufficiently explored. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation and robustness analysis of LLMs within the field of materials science, focusing on domain-specific question answering and materials property prediction. Three distinct datasets are used in this study: 1) a set of multiple-choice questions from undergraduate-level materials science courses, 2) a dataset including various steel compositions and yield strengths, and 3) a band gap dataset, containing textual descriptions of material crystal structures and band gap values. The performance of LLMs is assessed using various prompting strategies, including zero-shot chain-of-thought, expert prompting, and few-shot in-context learning. The robustness of these models is tested against various forms of 'noise', ranging from realistic disturbances to intentionally adversarial manipulations, to evaluate their resilience and reliability under real-world conditions. Additionally, the study uncovers unique phenomena of LLMs during predictive tasks, such as mode collapse behavior when the proximity of prompt examples is altered and performance enhancement from train/test mismatch. The findings aim to provide informed skepticism for the broad use of LLMs in materials science and to inspire advancements that enhance their robustness and reliability for practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14572v1,2024-09
Unleashing the Power of Emojis in Texts via Self-supervised Graph Pre-Training,"Zhou Zhang, Dongzeng Tan, Jiaan Wang, Yilong Chen, Jiarong Xu","Emojis have gained immense popularity on social platforms, serving as a common means to supplement or replace text. However, existing data mining approaches generally either completely ignore or simply treat emojis as ordinary Unicode characters, which may limit the model's ability to grasp the rich semantic information in emojis and the interaction between emojis and texts. Thus, it is necessary to release the emoji's power in social media data mining. To this end, we first construct a heterogeneous graph consisting of three types of nodes, i.e. post, word and emoji nodes to improve the representation of different elements in posts. The edges are also well-defined to model how these three elements interact with each other. To facilitate the sharing of information among post, word and emoji nodes, we propose a graph pre-train framework for text and emoji co-modeling, which contains two graph pre-training tasks: node-level graph contrastive learning and edge-level link reconstruction learning. Extensive experiments on the Xiaohongshu and Twitter datasets with two types of downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach proves significant improvement over previous strong baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14552v2,2024-09
What Are They Doing?

Recent Auditory Large Language Models (ALLMs) have made it possible to process audio and speech simultaneously within a single model, leading to further considerations of joint audio-speech tasks.   In this paper, we investigate how well ALLMs can perform joint audio-speech processing. Specifically, we introduce Joint Audio-Speech Co-Reasoning (JASCO), a novel task that unifies audio and speech processing, strictly requiring co-reasoning across both modalities. We release a scene-reasoning dataset called ""What Are They Doing"" and establish a joint audio-speech benchmark to evaluate the joint reasoning capability of popular ALLMs. Additionally, we provide deeper insights into the models' behaviors by analyzing their dependence on each modality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14526v1,2024-09
Beyond Words: Evaluating Large Language Models in Transportation Planning,"Shaowei Ying, Zhenlong Li, Manzhu Yu","The resurgence and rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in 2023 has catalyzed transformative shifts across numerous industry sectors, including urban transportation and logistics. This study investigates the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and Phi-3-mini, to enhance transportation planning. The study assesses the performance and spatial comprehension of these models through a transportation-informed evaluation framework that includes general geospatial skills, general transportation domain skills, and real-world transportation problem-solving. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the research encompasses an evaluation of the LLMs' general Geographic Information System (GIS) skills, general transportation domain knowledge as well as abilities to support human decision-making in the real-world transportation planning scenarios of congestion pricing. Results indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates superior accuracy and reliability across various GIS and transportation-specific tasks compared to Phi-3-mini, highlighting its potential as a robust tool for transportation planners. Nonetheless, Phi-3-mini exhibits competence in specific analytical scenarios, suggesting its utility in resource-constrained environments. The findings underscore the transformative potential of GenAI technologies in urban transportation planning. Future work could explore the application of newer LLMs and the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, on a broader set of real-world transportation planning and operations challenges, to deepen the integration of advanced AI models in transportation management practices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14516v1,2024-09
Can AI writing be salvaged? Mitigating Idiosyncrasies and Improving Human-AI Alignment in the Writing Process through Edits,"Tuhin Chakrabarty, Philippe Laban, Chien-Sheng Wu","LLM-based applications are helping people write, and LLM-generated text is making its way into social media, journalism, and our classrooms. However, the differences between LLM-generated and human-written text remain unclear. To explore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in several creative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirable idiosyncrasies in LLM-generated text, formalizing it into a seven-category taxonomy (e.g. cliches, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMP corpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers according to our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in our study (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in terms of writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third, we explored automatic editing methods to improve LLM-generated text. A large-scale preference annotation confirms that although experts largely prefer text edited by other experts, automatic editing methods show promise in improving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14509v3,2024-09
A is for Absorption: Studying Feature Splitting and Absorption in Sparse Autoencoders,"David Chanin, James Wilken-Smith, Tomáš Dulka, Hardik Bhatnagar, Joseph Bloom","Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach to decompose the activations of Large Language Models (LLMs) into human-interpretable latents. In this paper, we pose two questions. First, to what extent do SAEs extract monosemantic and interpretable latents? Second, to what extent does varying the sparsity or the size of the SAE affect monosemanticity / interpretability? By investigating these questions in the context of a simple first-letter identification task where we have complete access to ground truth labels for all tokens in the vocabulary, we are able to provide more detail than prior investigations. Critically, we identify a problematic form of feature-splitting we call feature absorption where seemingly monosemantic latents fail to fire in cases where they clearly should. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE size or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue, and that there are deeper conceptual issues in need of resolution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14507v4,2024-09
Thought-Path Contrastive Learning via Premise-Oriented Data Augmentation for Logical Reading Comprehension,"Chenxu Wang, Ping Jian, Zhen Yang","Logical reading comprehension is a challenging task that entails grasping the underlying semantics of text and applying reasoning to deduce the correct answer. Prior researches have primarily focused on enhancing logical reasoning capabilities through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or data augmentation. However, previous work constructing chain-of-thought rationales concentrates solely on analyzing correct options, neglecting the incorrect alternatives. Addtionally, earlier efforts on data augmentation by altering contexts rely on rule-based methods, which result in generated contexts that lack diversity and coherence. To address these issues, we propose a Premise-Oriented Data Augmentation (PODA) framework. This framework can generate CoT rationales including analyses for both correct and incorrect options, while constructing diverse and high-quality counterfactual contexts from incorrect candidate options. We integrate summarizing premises and identifying premises for each option into rationales. Subsequently, we employ multi-step prompts with identified premises to construct counterfactual context. To facilitate the model's capabilities to better differentiate the reasoning process associated with each option, we introduce a novel thought-path contrastive learning method that compares reasoning paths between the original and counterfactual samples. Experimental results on three representative LLMs demonstrate that our method can improve the baselines substantially across two challenging logical reasoning benchmarks (ReClor and LogiQA 2.0). The data and code are released at https://github.com/lalalamdbf/TPReasoner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14495v2,2024-09
Unsupervised Word Discovery: Boundary Detection with Clustering vs. Dynamic Programming,"Simon Malan, Benjamin van Niekerk, Herman Kamper","We look at the long-standing problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like segments and clustering these into a lexicon. Several previous methods use a scoring model coupled with dynamic programming to find an optimal segmentation. Here we propose a much simpler strategy: we predict word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent self-supervised features, then we cluster the predicted segments to construct a lexicon. For a fair comparison, we update the older ES-KMeans dynamic programming method with better features and boundary constraints. On the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, our simple approach gives similar state-of-the-art results compared to the new ES-KMeans+ method, while being almost five times faster.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14486v1,2024-09
A Large Language Model and Denoising Diffusion Framework for Targeted Design of Microstructures with Commands in Natural Language,"Nikita Kartashov, Nikolaos N. Vlassis","Microstructure plays a critical role in determining the macroscopic properties of materials, with applications spanning alloy design, MEMS devices, and tissue engineering, among many others. Computational frameworks have been developed to capture the complex relationship between microstructure and material behavior. However, despite these advancements, the steep learning curve associated with domain-specific knowledge and complex algorithms restricts the broader application of these tools. To lower this barrier, we propose a framework that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to enable microstructure design using intuitive natural language commands. Our framework employs contextual data augmentation, driven by a pretrained LLM, to generate and expand a diverse dataset of microstructure descriptors. A retrained NER model extracts relevant microstructure descriptors from user-provided natural language inputs, which are then used by the DDPM to generate microstructures with targeted mechanical properties and topological features. The NLP and DDPM components of the framework are modular, allowing for separate training and validation, which ensures flexibility in adapting the framework to different datasets and use cases. A surrogate model system is employed to rank and filter generated samples based on their alignment with target properties. Demonstrated on a database of nonlinear hyperelastic microstructures, this framework serves as a prototype for accessible inverse design of microstructures, starting from intuitive natural language commands.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14473v1,2024-09
Rethinking Semantic Parsing for Large Language Models: Enhancing LLM Performance with Semantic Hints,"Kaikai An, Shuzheng Si, Helan Hu, Haozhe Zhao, Yuchi Wang, Qingyan Guo, Baobao Chang","Semantic Parsing aims to capture the meaning of a sentence and convert it into a logical, structured form. Previous studies show that semantic parsing enhances the performance of smaller models (e.g., BERT) on downstream tasks. However, it remains unclear whether the improvements extend similarly to LLMs. In this paper, our empirical findings reveal that, unlike smaller models, directly adding semantic parsing results into LLMs reduces their performance. To overcome this, we propose SENSE, a novel prompting approach that embeds semantic hints within the prompt. Experiments show that SENSE consistently improves LLMs' performance across various tasks, highlighting the potential of integrating semantic information to improve LLM capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14469v1,2024-09
AggregHate: An Efficient Aggregative Approach for the Detection of Hatemongers on Social Platforms,"Tom Marzea, Abraham Israeli, Oren Tsur","Automatic detection of online hate speech serves as a crucial step in the detoxification of the online discourse. Moreover, accurate classification can promote a better understanding of the proliferation of hate as a social phenomenon. While most prior work focus on the detection of hateful utterances, we argue that focusing on the user level is as important, albeit challenging. In this paper we consider a multimodal aggregative approach for the detection of hate-mongers, taking into account the potentially hateful texts, user activity, and the user network. We evaluate our methods on three unique datasets X (Twitter), Gab, and Parler showing that a processing a user's texts in her social context significantly improves the detection of hate mongers, compared to previously used text and graph-based methods. Our method can be then used to improve the classification of coded messages, dog-whistling, and racial gas-lighting, as well as inform intervention measures. Moreover, our approach is highly efficient even for very large datasets and networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14464v1,2024-09
Exploring Multilingual Probing in Large Language Models: A Cross-Language Analysis,"Daoyang Li, Mingyu Jin, Qingcheng Zeng, Haiyan Zhao, Mengnan Du","Probing techniques for large language models (LLMs) have primarily focused on English, overlooking the vast majority of the world's languages. In this paper, we extend these probing methods to a multilingual context, investigating the behaviors of LLMs across diverse languages. We conduct experiments on several open-source LLM models, analyzing probing accuracy, trends across layers, and similarities between probing vectors for multiple languages. Our key findings reveal: (1) a consistent performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages, with high-resource languages achieving significantly higher probing accuracy; (2) divergent layer-wise accuracy trends, where high-resource languages show substantial improvement in deeper layers similar to English; and (3) higher representational similarities among high-resource languages, with low-resource languages demonstrating lower similarities both among themselves and with high-resource languages. These results highlight significant disparities in LLMs' multilingual capabilities and emphasize the need for improved modeling of low-resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14459v1,2024-09
SAC-KG: Exploiting Large Language Models as Skilled Automatic Constructors for Domain Knowledge Graphs,"Hanzhu Chen, Xu Shen, Qitan Lv, Jie Wang, Xiaoqi Ni, Jieping Ye","Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a pivotal role in knowledge-intensive tasks across specialized domains, where the acquisition of precise and dependable knowledge is crucial. However, existing KG construction methods heavily rely on human intervention to attain qualified KGs, which severely hinders the practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a general KG construction framework, named SAC-KG, to exploit large language models (LLMs) as Skilled Automatic Constructors for domain Knowledge Graph. SAC-KG effectively involves LLMs as domain experts to generate specialized and precise multi-level KGs. Specifically, SAC-KG consists of three components: Generator, Verifier, and Pruner. For a given entity, Generator produces its relations and tails from raw domain corpora, to construct a specialized single-level KG. Verifier and Pruner then work together to ensure precision by correcting generation errors and determining whether newly produced tails require further iteration for the next-level KG.Experiments demonstrate that SAC-KG automatically constructs a domain KG at the scale of over one million nodes and achieves a precision of 89.32%, leading to a superior performance with over 20% increase in precision rate compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for the KG construction task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02811v1,2024-09
Automotive innovation landscaping using LLM,"Raju Gorain, Omkar Salunke","The process of landscaping automotive innovation through patent analysis is crucial for Research and Development teams. It aids in comprehending innovation trends, technological advancements, and the latest technologies from competitors. Traditionally, this process required intensive manual efforts. However, with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), it can now be automated, leading to faster and more efficient patent categorization & state-of-the-art of inventive concept extraction. This automation can assist various R\&D teams in extracting relevant information from extensive patent databases. This paper introduces a method based on prompt engineering to extract essential information for landscaping. The information includes the problem addressed by the patent, the technology utilized, and the area of innovation within the vehicle ecosystem (such as safety, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and more).The result demonstrates the implementation of this method to create a landscape of fuel cell technology using open-source patent data.

Beyond Persuasion: Towards Conversational Recommender System with Credible Explanations,"Peixin Qin, Chen Huang, Yang Deng, Wenqiang Lei, Tat-Seng Chua","With the aid of large language models, current conversational recommender system (CRS) has gaining strong abilities to persuade users to accept recommended items. While these CRSs are highly persuasive, they can mislead users by incorporating incredible information in their explanations, ultimately damaging the long-term trust between users and the CRS. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, called PC-CRS, to enhance the credibility of CRS's explanations during persuasion. It guides the explanation generation through our proposed credibility-aware persuasive strategies and then gradually refines explanations via post-hoc self-reflection. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of PC-CRS in promoting persuasive and credible explanations. Further analysis reveals the reason behind current methods producing incredible explanations and the potential of credible explanations to improve recommendation accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14399v2,2024-09
Predicting User Stances from Target-Agnostic Information using Large Language Models,"Siyuan Brandon Loh, Liang Ze Wong, Prasanta Bhattacharya, Joseph Simons, Wei Gao, Hong Zhang","We investigate Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to predict a user's stance on a target given a collection of his/her target-agnostic social media posts (i.e., user-level stance prediction). While we show early evidence that LLMs are capable of this task, we highlight considerable variability in the performance of the model across (i) the type of stance target, (ii) the prediction strategy and (iii) the number of target-agnostic posts supplied. Post-hoc analyses further hint at the usefulness of target-agnostic posts in providing relevant information to LLMs through the presence of both surface-level (e.g., target-relevant keywords) and user-level features (e.g., encoding users' moral values). Overall, our findings suggest that LLMs might offer a viable method for determining public stances towards new topics based on historical and target-agnostic data. At the same time, we also call for further research to better understand LLMs' strong performance on the stance prediction task and how their effectiveness varies across task contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14395v1,2024-09
Investigating Layer Importance in Large Language Models,"Yang Zhang, Yanfei Dong, Kenji Kawaguchi","Large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention due to their prominent ability to understand and process texts. Nevertheless, LLMs largely remain opaque. The lack of understanding of LLMs has obstructed the deployment in safety-critical scenarios and hindered the development of better models. In this study, we advance the understanding of LLM by investigating the significance of individual layers in LLMs. We propose an efficient sampling method to faithfully evaluate the importance of layers using Shapley values, a widely used explanation framework in feature attribution and data valuation. In addition, we conduct layer ablation experiments to assess the performance degradation resulting from the exclusion of specific layers. Our findings reveal the existence of cornerstone layers, wherein certain early layers can exhibit a dominant contribution over others. Removing one cornerstone layer leads to a drastic collapse of the model performance, often reducing it to random guessing. Conversely, removing non-cornerstone layers results in only marginal performance changes. This study identifies cornerstone layers in LLMs and underscores their critical role for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14381v1,2024-09
J2N -- Nominal Adjective Identification and its Application,"Lemeng Qi, Yang Han, Zhuotong Xie","This paper explores the challenges posed by nominal adjectives (NAs) in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly in part-of-speech (POS) tagging.

Our study shows that reclassifying NAs can improve the accuracy of syntactic analysis and structural understanding in NLP. We present experimental results using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models, and Spacy, demonstrating the feasibility and potential benefits of this approach. Additionally we finetuned a bert model to identify the NA in untagged text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14374v3,2024-09
The Ability of Large Language Models to Evaluate Constraint-satisfaction in Agent Responses to Open-ended Requests,"Lior Madmoni, Amir Zait, Ilia Labzovsky, Danny Karmon","Generative AI agents are often expected to respond to complex user requests that have No One Right Answer (NORA), e.g., ""design a vegetarian meal plan below 1800 calories"". Such requests may entail a set of constraints that the agent should adhere to. To successfully develop agents for NORA scenarios, an accurate automatic evaluation framework is essential, and specifically - one capable of validating the satisfaction of constraints in the agent's response. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted as versatile evaluators for many NORA tasks, but their ability to evaluate constraint-satisfaction in generated text remains unclear. To study this, we develop and release a novel Arithmetic Constraint-Satisfaction (ACS) benchmarking dataset. The dataset consists of complex user requests with corresponding constraints, agent responses and human labels indicating each constraint's satisfaction level in the response. A unique property of this dataset is that validating many of its constraints requires reviewing the response as a whole (in contrast to many other benchmarks that require the validation of a single independent item). Moreover, it assesses LLMs in performing reasoning, in-context data extraction, arithmetic calculations, and counting. We then benchmark both open and proprietary LLMs on evaluating constraint-satisfaction, and show that most models still have a significant headroom for improvement, and that errors primarily stem from reasoning issues. In addition, most models exhibit a skewed constraint-satisfaction prediction pattern, with higher accuracy where the ground-truth label is ""satisfied"". Lastly, few-shot prompting for our task proved to be rather challenging, since many of the studied models showed a degradation in performance when it was introduced.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14371v1,2024-09

Using Natural Language Processing to find Indication for Burnout with Text Classification: From Online Data to Real-World Data,"Mascha Kurpicz-Briki, Ghofrane Merhbene, Alexandre Puttick, Souhir Ben Souissi, Jannic Bieri, Thomas Jörg Müller, Christoph Golz","Burnout, classified as a syndrome in the ICD-11, arises from chronic workplace stress that has not been effectively managed. It is characterized by exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy, and estimates of its prevalence vary significantly due to inconsistent measurement methods. Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning offer promising tools for detecting burnout through textual data analysis, with studies demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This paper contributes to burnout detection in German texts by: (a) collecting an anonymous real-world dataset including free-text answers and Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) responses; (b) demonstrating the limitations of a GermanBERT-based classifier trained on online data; (c) presenting two versions of a curated BurnoutExpressions dataset, which yielded models that perform well in real-world applications; and (d) providing qualitative insights from an interdisciplinary focus group on the interpretability of AI models used for burnout detection. Our findings emphasize the need for greater collaboration between AI researchers and clinical experts to refine burnout detection models. Additionally, more real-world data is essential to validate and enhance the effectiveness of current AI methods developed in NLP research, which are often based on data automatically scraped from online sources and not evaluated in a real-world context. This is essential for ensuring AI tools are well suited for practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14357v1,2024-09
MQM-APE: Toward High-Quality Error Annotation Predictors with Automatic Post-Editing in LLM Translation Evaluators,"Qingyu Lu, Liang Ding, Kanjian Zhang, Jinxia Zhang, Dacheng Tao","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential as judges for Machine Translation (MT) quality assessment, providing both scores and fine-grained feedback. Although approaches such as GEMBA-MQM have shown state-of-the-art performance on reference-free evaluation, the predicted errors do not align well with those annotated by human, limiting their interpretability as feedback signals. To enhance the quality of error annotations predicted by LLM evaluators, we introduce a universal and training-free framework, $\textbf{MQM-APE}$, based on the idea of filtering out non-impactful errors by Automatically Post-Editing (APE) the original translation based on each error, leaving only those errors that contribute to quality improvement. Specifically, we prompt the LLM to act as 1) $\textit{evaluator}$ to provide error annotations, 2) $\textit{post-editor}$ to determine whether errors impact quality improvement and 3) $\textit{pairwise quality verifier}$ as the error filter. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves both the reliability and quality of error spans against GEMBA-MQM, across eight LLMs in both high- and low-resource languages. Orthogonal to trained approaches, MQM-APE complements translation-specific evaluators such as Tower, highlighting its broad applicability. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of each module and offers valuable insights into evaluator design and LLMs selection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14335v2,2024-09
Unveiling Narrative Reasoning Limits of Large Language Models with Trope in Movie Synopses,"Hung-Ting Su, Ya-Ching Hsu, Xudong Lin, Xiang-Qian Shi, Yulei Niu, Han-Yuan Hsu, Hung-yi Lee, Winston H. Hsu","Large language models (LLMs) equipped with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) prompting have shown significant multi-step reasoning capabilities in factual content like mathematics, commonsense, and logic. However, their performance in narrative reasoning, which demands greater abstraction capabilities, remains unexplored. This study utilizes tropes in movie synopses to assess the abstract reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs and uncovers their low performance. We introduce a trope-wise querying approach to address these challenges and boost the F1 score by 11.8 points. Moreover, while prior studies suggest that CoT enhances multi-step reasoning, this study shows CoT can cause hallucinations in narrative content, reducing GPT-4's performance. We also introduce an Adversarial Injection method to embed trope-related text tokens into movie synopses without explicit tropes, revealing CoT's heightened sensitivity to such injections. Our comprehensive analysis provides insights for future research directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14324v1,2024-09
Reliable and diverse evaluation of LLM medical knowledge mastery,"Yuxuan Zhou, Xien Liu, Chen Ning, Xiao Zhang, Ji Wu","Mastering medical knowledge is crucial for medical-specific LLMs. However, despite the existence of medical benchmarks like MedQA, a unified framework that fully leverages existing knowledge bases to evaluate LLMs' mastery of medical knowledge is still lacking. In the study, we propose a novel framework PretexEval that dynamically generates reliable and diverse test samples to evaluate LLMs for any given medical knowledge base. We notice that test samples produced directly from knowledge bases by templates or LLMs may introduce factual errors and also lack diversity. To address these issues, we introduce a novel schema into our proposed evaluation framework that employs predicate equivalence transformations to produce a series of variants for any given medical knowledge point. Finally, these produced predicate variants are converted into textual language, resulting in a series of reliable and diverse test samples to evaluate whether LLMs fully master the given medical factual knowledge point. Here, we use our proposed framework to systematically investigate the mastery of medical factual knowledge of 12 well-known LLMs, based on two knowledge bases that are crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The evaluation results illustrate that current LLMs still exhibit significant deficiencies in fully mastering medical knowledge, despite achieving considerable success on some famous public benchmarks. These new findings provide valuable insights for developing medical-specific LLMs, highlighting that current LLMs urgently need to strengthen their comprehensive and in-depth mastery of medical knowledge before being applied to real-world medical scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14302v2,2024-09
Towards Within-Class Variation in Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Spontaneous Speech,"Jiawen Kang, Dongrui Han, Lingwei Meng, Jingyan Zhou, Jinchao Li, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection has emerged as a promising research area that employs machine learning classification models to distinguish between individuals with AD and those without. Unlike conventional classification tasks, we identify within-class variation as a critical challenge in AD detection: individuals with AD exhibit a spectrum of cognitive impairments. Given that many AD detection tasks lack fine-grained labels, simplistic binary classification may overlook two crucial aspects: within-class differences and instance-level imbalance. The former compels the model to map AD samples with varying degrees of impairment to a single diagnostic label, disregarding certain changes in cognitive function. While the latter biases the model towards overrepresented severity levels. This work presents early efforts to address these challenges. We propose two novel methods: Soft Target Distillation (SoTD) and Instance-level Re-balancing (InRe), targeting two problems respectively. Experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve detection accuracy. Further analysis reveals that SoTD effectively harnesses the strengths of multiple component models, while InRe substantially alleviates model over-fitting. These findings provide insights for developing more robust and reliable AD detection models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16322v1,2024-09

TextBlob provides subjectivity analysis as well as polarity classification. VADER offers cumulative sentiment scores. SentiWordNet considers sentiments with reference to context and performs classification accordingly. Techniques in NLP are harnessed to gather meaning from the textual data in social media.

ESPERANTO: Evaluating Synthesized Phrases to Enhance Robustness in AI Detection for Text Origination,"Navid Ayoobi, Lily Knab, Wen Cheng, David Pantoja, Hamidreza Alikhani, Sylvain Flamant, Jin Kim, Arjun Mukherjee","While large language models (LLMs) exhibit significant utility across various domains, they simultaneously are susceptible to exploitation for unethical purposes, including academic misconduct and dissemination of misinformation. Consequently, AI-generated text detection systems have emerged as a countermeasure. However, these detection mechanisms demonstrate vulnerability to evasion techniques and lack robustness against textual manipulations. This paper introduces back-translation as a novel technique for evading detection, underscoring the need to enhance the robustness of current detection systems. The proposed method involves translating AI-generated text through multiple languages before back-translating to English. We present a model that combines these back-translated texts to produce a manipulated version of the original AI-generated text. Our findings demonstrate that the manipulated text retains the original semantics while significantly reducing the true positive rate (TPR) of existing detection methods. We evaluate this technique on nine AI detectors, including six open-source and three proprietary systems, revealing their susceptibility to back-translation manipulation. In response to the identified shortcomings of existing AI text detectors, we present a countermeasure to improve the robustness against this form of manipulation. Our results indicate that the TPR of the proposed method declines by only 1.85% after back-translation manipulation. Furthermore, we build a large dataset of 720k texts using eight different LLMs. Our dataset contains both human-authored and LLM-generated texts in various domains and writing styles to assess the performance of our method and existing detectors. This dataset is publicly shared for the benefit of the research community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14285v1,2024-09
Can-Do! A Dataset and Neuro-Symbolic Grounded Framework for Embodied Planning with Large Multimodal Models,"Yew Ken Chia, Qi Sun, Lidong Bing, Soujanya Poria","Large multimodal models have demonstrated impressive problem-solving abilities in vision and language tasks, and have the potential to encode extensive world knowledge. However, it remains an open challenge for these models to perceive, reason, plan, and act in realistic environments. In this work, we introduce Can-Do, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate embodied planning abilities through more diverse and complex scenarios than previous datasets. Our dataset includes 400 multimodal samples, each consisting of natural language user instructions, visual images depicting the environment, state changes, and corresponding action plans. The data encompasses diverse aspects of commonsense knowledge, physical understanding, and safety awareness. Our fine-grained analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4V, face bottlenecks in visual perception, comprehension, and reasoning abilities. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroGround, a neurosymbolic framework that first grounds the plan generation in the perceived environment states and then leverages symbolic planning engines to augment the model-generated plans. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared to strong baselines. Our code and dataset are available at https://embodied-planning.github.io.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14277v1,2024-09
Instruction Following without Instruction Tuning,"John Hewitt, Nelson F. Liu, Percy Liang, Christopher D. Manning","Instruction tuning commonly means finetuning a language model on instruction-response pairs. We discover two forms of adaptation (tuning) that are deficient compared to instruction tuning, yet still yield instruction following; we call this implicit instruction tuning. We first find that instruction-response pairs are not necessary: training solely on responses, without any corresponding instructions, yields instruction following. This suggests pretrained models have an instruction-response mapping which is revealed by teaching the model the desired distribution of responses. However, we then find it's not necessary to teach the desired distribution of responses: instruction-response training on narrow-domain data like poetry still leads to broad instruction-following behavior like recipe generation. In particular, when instructions are very different from those in the narrow finetuning domain, models' responses do not adhere to the style of the finetuning domain. To begin to explain implicit instruction tuning, we hypothesize that very simple changes to a language model's distribution yield instruction following. We support this by hand-writing a rule-based language model which yields instruction following in a product-of-experts with a pretrained model. The rules are to slowly increase the probability of ending the sequence, penalize repetition, and uniformly change 15 words' probabilities. In summary, adaptations made without being designed to yield instruction following can do so implicitly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14254v1,2024-09
Repairs in a Block World: A New Benchmark for Handling User Corrections with Multi-Modal Language Models,"Javier Chiyah-Garcia, Alessandro Suglia, Arash Eshghi","In dialogue, the addressee may initially misunderstand the speaker and respond erroneously, often prompting the speaker to correct the misunderstanding in the next turn with a Third Position Repair (TPR). The ability to process and respond appropriately to such repair sequences is thus crucial in conversational AI systems. In this paper, we first collect, analyse, and publicly release BlockWorld-Repairs: a dataset of multi-modal TPR sequences in an instruction-following manipulation task that is, by design, rife with referential ambiguity. We employ this dataset to evaluate several state-of-the-art Vision and Language Models (VLM) across multiple settings, focusing on their capability to process and accurately respond to TPRs and thus recover from miscommunication. We find that, compared to humans, all models significantly underperform in this task. We then show that VLMs can benefit from specialised losses targeting relevant tokens during fine-tuning, achieving better performance and generalising better to new scenarios. Our results suggest that these models are not yet ready to be deployed in multi-modal collaborative settings where repairs are common, and highlight the need to design training regimes and objectives that facilitate learning from interaction.

Data-centric NLP Backdoor Defense from the Lens of Memorization,"Zhenting Wang, Zhizhi Wang, Mingyu Jin, Mengnan Du, Juan Zhai, Shiqing Ma","Backdoor attack is a severe threat to the trustworthiness of DNN-based language models. In this paper, we first extend the definition of memorization of language models from sample-wise to more fine-grained sentence element-wise (e.g., word, phrase, structure, and style), and then point out that language model backdoors are a type of element-wise memorization. Through further analysis, we find that the strength of such memorization is positively correlated to the frequency of duplicated elements in the training dataset. In conclusion, duplicated sentence elements are necessary for successful backdoor attacks. Based on this, we propose a data-centric defense. We first detect trigger candidates in training data by finding memorizable elements, i.e., duplicated elements, and then confirm real triggers by testing if the candidates can activate backdoor behaviors (i.e., malicious elements). Results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in defending against different types of NLP backdoors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14200v1,2024-09
"The Imperative of Conversation Analysis in the Era of LLMs: A Survey of Tasks, Techniques, and Trends","Xinghua Zhang, Haiyang Yu, Yongbin Li, Minzheng Wang, Longze Chen, Fei Huang","In the era of large language models (LLMs), a vast amount of conversation logs will be accumulated thanks to the rapid development trend of language UI. Conversation Analysis (CA) strives to uncover and analyze critical information from conversation data, streamlining manual processes and supporting business insights and decision-making. The need for CA to extract actionable insights and drive empowerment is becoming increasingly prominent and attracting widespread attention. However, the lack of a clear scope for CA leads to a dispersion of various techniques, making it difficult to form a systematic technical synergy to empower business applications. In this paper, we perform a thorough review and systematize CA task to summarize the existing related work. Specifically, we formally define CA task to confront the fragmented and chaotic landscape in this field, and derive four key steps of CA from conversation scene reconstruction, to in-depth attribution analysis, and then to performing targeted training, finally generating conversations based on the targeted training for achieving the specific goals. In addition, we showcase the relevant benchmarks, discuss potential challenges and point out future directions in both industry and academia. In view of current advancements, it is evident that the majority of efforts are still concentrated on the analysis of shallow conversation elements, which presents a considerable gap between the research and business, and with the assist of LLMs, recent work has shown a trend towards research on causality and strategic tasks which are sophisticated and high-level. The analyzed experiences and insights will inevitably have broader application value in business operations that target conversation logs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14195v1,2024-09
Knowledge in Triples for LLMs: Enhancing Table QA Accuracy with Semantic Extraction,"Hossein Sholehrasa, Sanaz Saki Norouzi, Pascal Hitzler, Majid Jaberi-Douraki","Integrating structured knowledge from tabular formats poses significant challenges within natural language processing (NLP), mainly when dealing with complex, semi-structured tables like those found in the FeTaQA dataset. These tables require advanced methods to interpret and generate meaningful responses accurately. Traditional approaches, such as SQL and SPARQL, often fail to fully capture the semantics of such data, especially in the presence of irregular table structures like web tables. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel approach that extracts triples straightforward from tabular data and integrates it with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model to enhance the accuracy, coherence, and contextual richness of responses generated by a fine-tuned GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 model. Our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines on the FeTaQA dataset, particularly excelling in Sacre-BLEU and ROUGE metrics. It effectively generates contextually accurate and detailed long-form answers from tables, showcasing its strength in complex data interpretation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14192v2,2024-09
Rephrase and Contrast: Fine-Tuning Language Models for Enhanced Understanding of Communication and Computer Networks,"Liujianfu Wang, Yuyang Du, Jingqi Lin, Kexin Chen, Soung Chang Liew","Large language models (LLMs) are being widely researched across various disciplines, with significant recent efforts focusing on adapting LLMs for understanding of how communication networks operate. However, over-reliance on prompting techniques hinders the full exploitation of the generalization ability of these models, and the lack of efficient fine-tuning methods prevents the full realization of lightweight LLMs' potential. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing our Rephrase and Contrast (RaC) framework, an efficient fine-tuning framework. RaC enhances LLMs' comprehension and critical thinking abilities by incorporating question reformulation and contrastive analysis of correct and incorrect answers during the fine-tuning process. Experimental results demonstrate a 63.73% accuracy improvement over the foundational model when tested on a comprehensive networking problem set. Moreover, to efficiently construct the dataset for RaC fine-tuning, we develop a GPT-assisted data mining method for generating high-quality question-answer (QA) pairs; furthermore, we introduce ChoiceBoost, a data augmentation technique that expands dataset size while reducing answer-order bias. Apart from these technical innovations, we contribute to the networking community by open-sourcing valuable research resources, including: 1) the fine-tuned networking model referred to as RaC-Net, 2) the training dataset used for fine-tuning the model, 3) three testing problem sets of different difficulties to serve as benchmarks for future research, and 4) code associated with the above resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19007v2,2024-09
On Lexical Invariance on Multisets and Graphs,Muhan Zhang,"In this draft, we study a novel problem, called lexical invariance, using the medium of multisets and graphs. Traditionally in the NLP domain, lexical invariance indicates that the semantic meaning of a sentence should remain unchanged regardless of the specific lexical or word-based representation of the input. For example, ``The movie was extremely entertaining'' would have the same meaning as ``The film was very enjoyable''. In this paper, we study a more challenging setting, where the output of a function is invariant to any injective transformation applied to the input lexical space. For example, multiset {1,2,3,2} is equivalent to multiset {a,b,c,b} if we specify an injective transformation that maps 1 to a, 2 to b and 3 to c. We study the sufficient and necessary conditions for a most expressive lexical invariant (and permutation invariant) function on multisets and graphs, and proves that for multisets, the function must have a form that only takes the multiset of counts of the unique elements in the original multiset as input. For example, a most expressive lexical invariant function on {a,b,c,b} must have a form that only operates on {1,1,2} (meaning that there are 1, 1, 2 unique elements corresponding to a,c,b). For graphs, we prove that a most expressive lexical invariant and permutation invariant function must have a form that only takes the adjacency matrix and a difference matrix as input, where the (i,j)th element of the difference matrix is 1 if node i and node j have the same feature and 0 otherwise. We perform synthetic experiments on TU datasets to verify our theorems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14179v1,2024-09
QMOS: Enhancing LLMs for Telecommunication with Question Masked loss and Option Shuffling,"Blessed Guda, Gabrial Zencha A., Lawrence Francis, Carlee Joe-Wong","Large Language models (LLMs) have brought about substantial advancements in the field of Question Answering (QA) systems. These models do remarkably well in addressing intricate inquiries in a variety of disciplines. However, because of domain-specific vocabulary, complex technological concepts, and the requirement for exact responses applying LLMs to specialized sectors like telecommunications presents additional obstacles. GPT-3.5 has been used in recent work, to obtain noteworthy accuracy for telecom-related questions in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Notwithstanding these developments, the practical use of models such as GPT-3.5 is restricted by their proprietary nature and high computing demands. This paper introduces QMOS, an innovative approach which uses a Question-Masked loss and Option Shuffling trick to enhance the performance of LLMs in answering Multiple-Choice Questions in the telecommunications domain. Our focus was on using opensource, smaller language models (Phi-2 and Falcon-7B) within an enhanced RAG framework. Our multi-faceted approach involves several enhancements to the whole LLM-RAG pipeline of finetuning, retrieval, prompt engineering and inference. Our approaches significantly outperform existing results, achieving accuracy improvements from baselines of 24.70% to 49.30% with Falcon-7B and from 42.07% to 84.65% with Phi-2.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14175v1,2024-09
Towards Building Efficient Sentence BERT Models using Layer Pruning,"Anushka Shelke, Riya Savant, Raviraj Joshi","This study examines the effectiveness of layer pruning in creating efficient Sentence BERT (SBERT) models. Our goal is to create smaller sentence embedding models that reduce complexity while maintaining strong embedding similarity. We assess BERT models like Muril and MahaBERT-v2 before and after pruning, comparing them with smaller, scratch-trained models like MahaBERT-Small and MahaBERT-Smaller. Through a two-phase SBERT fine-tuning process involving Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), we evaluate the impact of layer reduction on embedding quality. Our findings show that pruned models, despite fewer layers, perform competitively with fully layered versions. Moreover, pruned models consistently outperform similarly sized, scratch-trained models, establishing layer pruning as an effective strategy for creating smaller, efficient embedding models. These results highlight layer pruning as a practical approach for reducing computational demand while preserving high-quality embeddings, making SBERT models more accessible for languages with limited technological resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14168v1,2024-09
A Survey on Large Language Model-empowered Autonomous Driving,"Yuxuan Zhu, Shiyi Wang, Wenqing Zhong, Nianchen Shen, Yunqi Li, Siqi Wang, Zhiheng Li, Cathy Wu, Zhengbing He, Li Li","Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD) research, propelling its development towards intelligence and efficiency. Currently, the development of AD technology follows two main technical paths: modularization and end-to-end. Modularization decompose the driving task into modules such as perception, prediction, planning, and control, and train them separately. Due to the inconsistency of training objectives between modules, the integrated effect suffers from bias. End-to-end attempts to address this issue by utilizing a single model that directly maps from sensor data to control signals. This path has limited learning capabilities in a comprehensive set of features and struggles to handle unpredictable long-tail events and complex urban traffic scenarios. In the face of challenges encountered in both paths, many researchers believe that large language models (LLMs) with powerful reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge understanding may be the solution, expecting LLMs to provide AD systems with deeper levels of understanding and decision-making capabilities. In light of the challenges faced by both paths, many researchers believe that LLMs, with their powerful reasoning abilities and extensive knowledge, could offer a solution. To understand if LLMs could enhance AD, this paper conducts a thorough analysis of the potential applications of LLMs in AD systems, including exploring their optimization strategies in both modular and end-to-end approaches, with a particular focus on how LLMs can tackle the problems and challenges present in current solutions. Furthermore, we discuss an important question: Can LLM-based artificial general intelligence (AGI) be a key to achieve high-level AD? We further analyze the potential limitations and challenges that LLMs may encounter in promoting the development of AD technology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14165v3,2024-09
PromptTA: Prompt-driven Text Adapter for Source-free Domain Generalization,"Haoran Zhang, Shuanghao Bai, Wanqi Zhou, Jingwen Fu, Badong Chen","Source-free domain generalization (SFDG) tackles the challenge of adapting models to unseen target domains without access to source domain data. To deal with this challenging task, recent advances in SFDG have primarily focused on leveraging the text modality of vision-language models such as CLIP. These methods involve developing a transferable linear classifier based on diverse style features extracted from the text and learned prompts or deriving domain-unified text representations from domain banks. However, both style features and domain banks have limitations in capturing comprehensive domain knowledge. In this work, we propose Prompt-Driven Text Adapter (PromptTA) method, which is designed to better capture the distribution of style features and employ resampling to ensure thorough coverage of domain knowledge. To further leverage this rich domain information, we introduce a text adapter that learns from these style features for efficient domain information storage. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that PromptTA achieves state-of-the-art performance.

On Importance of Pruning and Distillation for Efficient Low Resource NLP,"Aishwarya Mirashi, Purva Lingayat, Srushti Sonavane, Tejas Padhiyar, Raviraj Joshi, Geetanjali Kale","The rise of large transformer models has revolutionized Natural Language Processing, leading to significant advances in tasks like text classification. However, this progress demands substantial computational resources, escalating training duration, and expenses with larger model sizes. Efforts have been made to downsize and accelerate English models (e.g., Distilbert, MobileBert). Yet, research in this area is scarce for low-resource languages.   In this study, we explore the case of the low-resource Indic language Marathi. Leveraging the marathi-topic-all-doc-v2 model as our baseline, we implement optimization techniques to reduce computation time and memory usage. Our focus is on enhancing the efficiency of Marathi transformer models while maintaining top-tier accuracy and reducing computational demands. Using the MahaNews document classification dataset and the marathi-topic-all-doc-v2 model from L3Cube, we apply Block Movement Pruning, Knowledge Distillation, and Mixed Precision methods individually and in combination to boost efficiency. We demonstrate the importance of strategic pruning levels in achieving desired efficiency gains. Furthermore, we analyze the balance between efficiency improvements and environmental impact, highlighting how optimized model architectures can contribute to a more sustainable computational ecosystem. Implementing these techniques on a single GPU system, we determine that the optimal configuration is 25\% pruning + knowledge distillation. This approach yielded a 2.56x speedup in computation time while maintaining baseline accuracy levels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14162v1,2024-09
Interpreting Arithmetic Mechanism in Large Language Models through Comparative Neuron Analysis,"Zeping Yu, Sophia Ananiadou","We find arithmetic ability resides within a limited number of attention heads, with each head specializing in distinct operations. To delve into the reason, we introduce the Comparative Neuron Analysis (CNA) method, which identifies an internal logic chain consisting of four distinct stages from input to prediction: feature enhancing with shallow FFN neurons, feature transferring by shallow attention layers, feature predicting by arithmetic heads, and prediction enhancing among deep FFN neurons. Moreover, we identify the human-interpretable FFN neurons within both feature-enhancing and feature-predicting stages. These findings lead us to investigate the mechanism of LoRA, revealing that it enhances prediction probabilities by amplifying the coefficient scores of FFN neurons related to predictions. Finally, we apply our method in model pruning for arithmetic tasks and model editing for reducing gender bias.

Towards Automated Patent Workflows: AI-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Framework for Intellectual Property Management and Analysis,"Sakhinana Sagar Srinivas, Vijay Sri Vaikunth, Venkataramana Runkana","Patents are the currency of innovation, and like any currency, they need to be managed and protected (Gavin Potenza). Patents, as legal documents that secure intellectual property rights, play a critical role in technological innovation. The growing complexity of patent documents and the surge in patent applications have created a need for automated solutions in patent analysis. In this work, we present PatExpert, an autonomous multi-agent conversational framework designed to streamline and optimize patent-related tasks. The framework consists of a metaagent that coordinates task-specific expert agents for various patent-related tasks and a critique agent for error handling and feedback provision. The meta-agent orchestrates specialized expert agents, each fine-tuned for specific tasks such as patent classification, acceptance, claim generation, abstractive summarization, multi-patent analysis, and scientific hypothesis generation. For multi-patent analysis, the framework incorporates advanced methods like Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG) to enhance response accuracy and relevance by combining semantic similarity with knowledge graphs. Error handling is managed by critique agents (Gold-LLM-as-a-Judge and Reward-LLM-as-a-Judge), which evaluate output responses for accuracy and provide iterative feedback. The framework also prioritizes explainability, ensuring transparent justifications for decisions made during patent analysis. Its comprehensive capabilities make it a valuable tool for automating complex patent workflows, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and compliance in patent-related tasks. Empirical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in patent processing tasks, concluding that the framework offers a robust solution for automating and optimizing patent analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19006v2,2024-09
Obliviate: Neutralizing Task-agnostic Backdoors within the Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning Paradigm,"Jaehan Kim, Minkyoo Song, Seung Ho Na, Seungwon Shin","Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a key training strategy for large language models. However, its reliance on fewer trainable parameters poses security risks, such as task-agnostic backdoors. Despite their severe impact on a wide range of tasks, there is no practical defense solution available that effectively counters task-agnostic backdoors within the context of PEFT. In this study, we introduce Obliviate, a PEFT-integrable backdoor defense. We develop two techniques aimed at amplifying benign neurons within PEFT layers and penalizing the influence of trigger tokens. Our evaluations across three major PEFT architectures show that our method can significantly reduce the attack success rate of the state-of-the-art task-agnostic backdoors (83.6%$\downarrow$). Furthermore, our method exhibits robust defense capabilities against both task-specific backdoors and adaptive attacks.

Routing in Sparsely-gated Language Models responds to Context,"Stefan Arnold, Marian Fietta, Dilara Yesilbas","Language Models (LMs) recently incorporate mixture-of-experts layers consisting of a router and a collection of experts to scale up their parameter count given a fixed computational budget. Building on previous efforts indicating that token-expert assignments are predominantly influenced by token identities and positions, we trace routing decisions of similarity-annotated text pairs to evaluate the context sensitivity of learned token-expert assignments. We observe that routing in encoder layers mainly depends on (semantic) associations, but contextual cues provide an additional layer of refinement. Conversely, routing in decoder layers is more variable and markedly less sensitive to context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14107v1,2024-09
Probing Context Localization of Polysemous Words in Pre-trained Language Model Sub-Layers,"Soniya Vijayakumar, Josef van Genabith, Simon Ostermann","In the era of high performing Large Language Models, researchers have widely acknowledged that contextual word representations are one of the key drivers in achieving top performances in downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the degree of contextualization encoded in the fine-grained sub-layer representations of a Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) by empirical experiments using linear probes. Unlike previous work, we are particularly interested in identifying the strength of contextualization across PLM sub-layer representations (i.e. Self-Attention, Feed-Forward Activation and Output sub-layers). To identify the main contributions of sub-layers to contextualisation, we first extract the sub-layer representations of polysemous words in minimally different sentence pairs, and compare how these representations change through the forward pass of the PLM network. Second, by probing on a sense identification classification task, we try to empirically localize the strength of contextualization information encoded in these sub-layer representations. With these probing experiments, we also try to gain a better understanding of the influence of context length and context richness on the degree of contextualization. Our main conclusion is cautionary: BERT demonstrates a high degree of contextualization in the top sub-layers if the word in question is in a specific position in the sentence with a shorter context window, but this does not systematically generalize across different word positions and context sizes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14097v1,2024-09
PTD-SQL: Partitioning and Targeted Drilling with LLMs in Text-to-SQL,"Ruilin Luo, Liyuan Wang, Binghuai Lin, Zicheng Lin, Yujiu Yang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for Text-to-SQL tasks, exhibiting remarkable reasoning capabilities. Different from tasks such as math word problems and commonsense reasoning, SQL solutions have a relatively fixed pattern. This facilitates the investigation of whether LLMs can benefit from categorical thinking, mirroring how humans acquire knowledge through inductive reasoning based on comparable examples. In this study, we propose that employing query group partitioning allows LLMs to focus on learning the thought processes specific to a single problem type, consequently enhancing their reasoning abilities across diverse difficulty levels and problem categories. Our experiments reveal that multiple advanced LLMs, when equipped with PTD-SQL, can either surpass or match previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the Spider and BIRD datasets. Intriguingly, models with varying initial performances have exhibited significant improvements, mainly at the boundary of their capabilities after targeted drilling, suggesting a parallel with human progress.

Adversarial Attacks on Parts of Speech: An Empirical Study in Text-to-Image Generation,"G M Shahariar, Jia Chen, Jiachen Li, Yue Dong","Recent studies show that text-to-image (T2I) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially with noun perturbations in text prompts. In this study, we investigate the impact of adversarial attacks on different POS tags within text prompts on the images generated by T2I models. We create a high-quality dataset for realistic POS tag token swapping and perform gradient-based attacks to find adversarial suffixes that mislead T2I models into generating images with altered tokens. Our empirical results show that the attack success rate (ASR) varies significantly among different POS tag categories, with nouns, proper nouns, and adjectives being the easiest to attack. We explore the mechanism behind the steering effect of adversarial suffixes, finding that the number of critical tokens and content fusion vary among POS tags, while features like suffix transferability are consistent across categories.

"What is a Digital Twin Anyway? Deriving the Definition for the Built Environment from over 15,000 Scientific Publications","Mahmoud Abdelrahman, Edgardo Macatulad, Binyu Lei, Matias Quintana, Clayton Miller, Filip Biljecki","The concept of digital twins has attracted significant attention across various domains, particularly within the built environment. However, there is a sheer volume of definitions and the terminological consensus remains out of reach. The lack of a universally accepted definition leads to ambiguities in their conceptualization and implementation, and may cause miscommunication for both researchers and practitioners. We employed Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to systematically extract and analyze definitions of digital twins from a corpus of 15,000 full-text articles spanning diverse disciplines in the built environment. The study compares these findings with insights from an expert survey that included 52 experts. The study identifies concurrence on the components that comprise a 'Digital Twin' from a practical perspective across various domains, contrasting them with those that do not, to identify deviations. We investigate the evolution of digital twin definitions over time and across different scales, including manufacturing, building, and urban/geospatial perspectives. We extracted the main components of Digital Twins using Text Frequency Analysis and N-gram analysis. Subsequently, we identified components that appeared in the literature and conducted a Chi-square test to assess the significance of each component in different domains. Our findings indicate that definitions differ based on the field of research in which they are conceived, but with many similarities across domains. One significant generalizable differentiation is related to whether a digital twin was used for High-Performance Real-Time (HPRT) or Long-Term Decision Support (LTDS) applications. We synthesized and contrasted the most representative definitions in each domain, culminating in a novel, data-driven definition specifically tailored for each context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19005v1,2024-09

Temporally Consistent Factuality Probing for Large Language Models,"Ashutosh Bajpai, Aaryan Goyal, Atif Anwer, Tanmoy Chakraborty","The prolific use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an alternate knowledge base requires them to be factually consistent, necessitating both correctness and consistency traits for paraphrased queries. Recently, significant attempts have been made to benchmark datasets and metrics to evaluate LLMs for these traits. However, structural simplicity (subject-relation-object) and contemporary association in their query formulation limit the broader definition of factuality and consistency. In this study, we introduce TeCFaP, a novel Temporally Consistent Factuality Probe task to expand the consistent factuality probe in the temporal dimension. To this end, we propose TEMP-COFAC, a high-quality dataset of prefix-style English query paraphrases. Subsequently, we extend the definitions of existing metrics to represent consistent factuality across temporal dimension. We experiment with a diverse set of LLMs and find most of them performing poorly on TeCFaP. Next, we propose a novel solution CoTSeLF (Consistent-Time-Sensitive Learning Framework) combining multi-task instruction tuning (MT-IT) with consistent-time-sensitive reinforcement learning (CTSRL) to improve temporally consistent factuality in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CoTSeLF over several baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14065v2,2024-09
Co-occurrence is not Factual Association in Language Models,"Xiao Zhang, Miao Li, Ji Wu","Pretrained language models can encode a large amount of knowledge and utilize it for various reasoning tasks, yet they can still struggle to learn novel factual knowledge effectively from finetuning on limited textual demonstrations. In this work, we show that the reason for this deficiency is that language models are biased to learn word co-occurrence statistics instead of true factual associations. We identify the differences between two forms of knowledge representation in language models: knowledge in the form of co-occurrence statistics is encoded in the middle layers of the transformer model and does not generalize well to reasoning scenarios beyond simple question answering, while true factual associations are encoded in the lower layers and can be freely utilized in various reasoning tasks. Based on these observations, we propose two strategies to improve the learning of factual associations in language models. We show that training on text with implicit rather than explicit factual associations can force the model to learn factual associations instead of co-occurrence statistics, significantly improving the generalization of newly learned knowledge. We also propose a simple training method to actively forget the learned co-occurrence statistics, which unblocks and enhances the learning of factual associations when training on plain narrative text. On both synthetic and real-world corpora, the two proposed strategies improve the generalization of the knowledge learned during finetuning to reasoning scenarios such as indirect and multi-hop question answering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14057v1,2024-09
GroupDebate: Enhancing the Efficiency of Multi-Agent Debate Using Group Discussion,"Tongxuan Liu, Xingyu Wang, Weizhe Huang, Wenjiang Xu, Yuting Zeng, Lei Jiang, Hailong Yang, Jing Li","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse NLP tasks. Extensive research has explored how to enhance the logical reasoning abilities such as Chain-of-Thought, Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency, Tree-Of-Thoughts, and multi-agent debates. In the context of multi-agent debates, significant performance improvements can be achieved with an increasing number of agents and debate rounds. However, the escalation in the number of agents and debate rounds can drastically raise the tokens cost of debates, thereby limiting the scalability of the multi-agent debate technique. To better harness the advantages of multi-agent debates in logical reasoning tasks, this paper proposes a method to significantly reduce token cost in multi-agent debates. This approach involves dividing all agents into multiple debate groups, with agents engaging in debates within their respective groups and sharing interim debate results between groups. Comparative experiments across multiple datasets have demonstrated that this method can reduce the total tokens by up to 51.7% during debates and while potentially enhancing accuracy by as much as 25%. Our method significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of interactions in the multi-agent debate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14051v1,2024-09

In this work, we focus on evaluating the reliability of current LLMs as science communicators. Unlike existing benchmarks, our approach emphasizes assessing these models on scientific questionanswering tasks that require a nuanced understanding and awareness of answerability. We introduce a novel dataset, SCiPS-QA, comprising 742 Yes/No queries embedded in complex scientific concepts, along with a benchmarking suite that evaluates LLMs for correctness and consistency across various criteria. We benchmark three proprietary LLMs from the OpenAI GPT family and 13 open-access LLMs from the Meta Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families. While most open-access models significantly underperform compared to GPT-4 Turbo, our experiments identify Llama-3-70B as a strong competitor, often surpassing GPT-4 Turbo in various evaluation aspects. We also find that even the GPT models exhibit a general incompetence in reliably verifying LLM responses.

Uncovering Latent Chain of Thought Vectors in Language Models,"Jason Zhang, Scott Viteri","As language models grow more influential and trusted in our society, our ability to reliably steer them toward favorable behaviors becomes increasingly paramount. For this, we investigate the technique of steering vectors: biasing the forward pass of language models using a ""steering vector"" derived from a specific task. We apply them to steer language models toward performing Chain of Thought (CoT) Reasoning without the need to prompt through natural language. We demonstrate this approach on Llama3 8b and Mistral 7b v0.2, and obtain competitive results compared to CoT-prompted performances on a series of reasoning benchmarks (GSM8k, MMLU, AGI Eval, ARC AI2) and qualitative examples. We find this approach yields consistent steering towards CoT responses and takes less compute than traditional methods of fine-tuning models towards CoT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14026v2,2024-09
StateAct: State Tracking and Reasoning for Acting and Planning with Large Language Models,"Nikolai Rozanov, Marek Rei","Planning and acting to solve `real' tasks using large language models (LLMs) in interactive environments has become a new frontier for AI methods. While recent advances allowed LLMs to interact with online tools, solve robotics tasks and many more, long range reasoning tasks remain a problem for LLMs. Existing methods to address this issue are very resource intensive and require additional data or human crafted rules, instead, we propose a simple method based on few-shot in-context learning alone to enhance `chain-of-thought' with state-tracking for planning and acting with LLMs. We show that our method establishes the new state-of-the-art on Alfworld for in-context learning methods (\textbf{+14\%} over the previous best few-shot in-context learning method) and performs on par with methods that use additional training data and additional tools such as code-execution. We also demonstrate that our enhanced `chain-of-states' allows the agent to both solve longer horizon problems and to be more efficient in number of steps required to solve a task. We show that our method works across a variety of LLMs for both API-based and open source ones.

Graph Neural Network Framework for Sentiment Analysis Using Syntactic Feature,"Linxiao Wu, Yuanshuai Luo, Binrong Zhu, Guiran Liu, Rui Wang, Qian Yu","Amidst the swift evolution of social media platforms and e-commerce ecosystems, the domain of opinion mining has surged as a pivotal area of exploration within natural language processing. A specialized segment within this field focuses on extracting nuanced evaluations tied to particular elements within textual contexts. This research advances a composite framework that amalgamates the positional cues of topical descriptors. The proposed system converts syntactic structures into a matrix format, leveraging convolutions and attention mechanisms within a graph to distill salient characteristics. Incorporating the positional relevance of descriptors relative to lexical items enhances the sequential integrity of the input. Trials have substantiated that this integrated graph-centric scheme markedly elevates the efficacy of evaluative categorization, showcasing preeminence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14000v1,2024-09
Contrastive Learning for Knowledge-Based Question Generation in Large Language Models,"Zhenhong Zhang, Jiajing Chen, Weiyan Shi, Lingjie Yi, Chihang Wang, Qian Yu","With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, especially the increasingly widespread application of question-and-answer systems, high-quality question generation has become a key component in supporting the development of these systems. This article focuses on knowledge-based question generation technology, which aims to enable computers to simulate the human questioning process based on understanding specific texts or knowledge bases. In light of the issues of hallucination and knowledge gaps present in large-scale language models when applied to knowledge-intensive tasks, this paper proposes an enhanced question generation method that incorporates contrastive learning. This method utilizes multiple models to jointly mine domain knowledge and uses contrastive learning to guide the model in reducing noise and hallucinations in generation. Experimental results show that by designing prompts containing contrasting examples, the model's performance in question generation improves considerably, particularly when contrasting instructions and examples are used simultaneously, leading to the highest quality of generated questions and improved accuracy. These results demonstrate that the method proposed in this study, which combines contrasting context and chain-of-thought prompts, can effectively improve both the quality and the practicality of question generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13994v2,2024-09
SMART-RAG: Selection using Determinantal Matrices for Augmented Retrieval,"Jiatao Li, Xinyu Hu, Xiaojun Wan","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has greatly improved large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to generate accurate, contextually grounded responses through the integration of external information. However, conventional RAG approaches, which prioritize top-ranked documents based solely on query-context relevance, often introduce redundancy and conflicting information. This issue is particularly evident in unsupervised retrieval settings, where there are no mechanisms to effectively mitigate these problems, leading to suboptimal context selection. To address this, we propose Selection using Matrices for Augmented Retrieval (SMART) in question answering tasks, a fully unsupervised and training-free framework designed to optimize context selection in RAG. SMART leverages Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to simultaneously model relevance, diversity and conflict, ensuring the selection of potentially high-quality contexts. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that SMART significantly enhances QA performance and surpasses previous unsupervised context selection methods, showing a promising strategy for RAG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13992v1,2024-09
ChemEval: A Comprehensive Multi-Level Chemical Evaluation for Large Language Models,"Yuqing Huang, Rongyang Zhang, Xuesong He, Xuyang Zhi, Hao Wang, Xin Li, Feiyang Xu, Deguang Liu, Huadong Liang, Yi Li, Jian Cui, Zimu Liu, Shijin Wang, Guoping Hu, Guiquan Liu, Qi Liu, Defu Lian, Enhong Chen","There is a growing interest in the role that LLMs play in chemistry which lead to an increased focus on the development of LLMs benchmarks tailored to chemical domains to assess the performance of LLMs across a spectrum of chemical tasks varying in type and complexity. However, existing benchmarks in this domain fail to adequately meet the specific requirements of chemical research professionals. To this end, we propose \textbf{\textit{ChemEval}}, which provides a comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of LLMs across a wide range of chemical domain tasks. Specifically, ChemEval identified 4 crucial progressive levels in chemistry, assessing 12 dimensions of LLMs across 42 distinct chemical tasks which are informed by open-source data and the data meticulously crafted by chemical experts, ensuring that the tasks have practical value and can effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs. In the experiment, we evaluate 12 mainstream LLMs on ChemEval under zero-shot and few-shot learning contexts, which included carefully selected demonstration examples and carefully designed prompts. The results show that while general LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 excel in literature understanding and instruction following, they fall short in tasks demanding advanced chemical knowledge. Conversely, specialized LLMs exhibit enhanced chemical competencies, albeit with reduced literary comprehension. This suggests that LLMs have significant potential for enhancement when tackling sophisticated tasks in the field of chemistry. We believe our work will facilitate the exploration of their potential to drive progress in chemistry. Our benchmark and analysis will be available at {\color{blue} \url{https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/ChemEval}}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13989v1,2024-09
Bias and Toxicity in Role-Play Reasoning,"Jinman Zhao, Zifan Qian, Linbo Cao, Yining Wang, Yitian Ding","Role-play in the Large Language Model (LLM) is a crucial technique that enables models to adopt specific perspectives, enhancing their ability to generate contextually relevant and accurate responses. By simulating different roles, theis approach improves reasoning capabilities across various NLP benchmarks, making the model's output more aligned with diverse scenarios. However, in this work, we demonstrate that role-play also carries potential risks. We systematically evaluate the impact of role-play by asking the language model to adopt different roles and testing it on multiple benchmarks that contain stereotypical and harmful questions. Despite the significant fluctuations in the benchmark results in different experiments, we find that applying role-play often increases the overall likelihood of generating stereotypical and harmful outputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13979v1,2024-09

Exploring Automated Keyword Mnemonics Generation with Large Language Models via Overgenerate-and-Rank,"Jaewook Lee, Hunter McNichols, Andrew Lan","In this paper, we study an under-explored area of language and vocabulary learning: keyword mnemonics, a technique for memorizing vocabulary through memorable associations with a target word via a verbal cue. Typically, creating verbal cues requires extensive human effort and is quite time-consuming, necessitating an automated method that is more scalable. We propose a novel overgenerate-and-rank method via prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate verbal cues and then ranking them according to psycholinguistic measures and takeaways from a pilot user study. To assess cue quality, we conduct both an automated evaluation of imageability and coherence, as well as a human evaluation involving English teachers and learners. Results show that LLM-generated mnemonics are comparable to human-generated ones in terms of imageability, coherence, and perceived usefulness, but there remains plenty of room for improvement due to the diversity in background and preference among language learners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13952v1,2024-09
Mufu: Multilingual Fused Learning for Low-Resource Translation with LLM,"Zheng Wei Lim, Nitish Gupta, Honglin Yu, Trevor Cohn","Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are great translators, but this is largely limited to high-resource languages. For many LLMs, translating in and out of low-resource languages remains a challenging task. To maximize data efficiency in this low-resource setting, we introduce Mufu, which includes a selection of automatically generated multilingual candidates and an instruction to correct inaccurate translations in the prompt. Mufu prompts turn a translation task into a postediting one, and seek to harness the LLM's reasoning capability with auxiliary translation candidates, from which the model is required to assess the input quality, align the semantics cross-lingually, copy from relevant inputs and override instances that are incorrect. Our experiments on En-XX translations over the Flores-200 dataset show LLMs finetuned against Mufu-style prompts are robust to poor quality auxiliary translation candidates, achieving performance superior to NLLB 1.3B distilled model in 64% of low- and very-low-resource language pairs. We then distill these models to reduce inference cost, while maintaining on average 3.1 chrF improvement over finetune-only baseline in low-resource translations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13949v1,2024-09
Aligning Language Models Using Follow-up Likelihood as Reward Signal,"Chen Zhang, Dading Chong, Feng Jiang, Chengguang Tang, Anningzhe Gao, Guohua Tang, Haizhou Li","In natural human-to-human conversations, participants often receive feedback signals from one another based on their follow-up reactions. These reactions can include verbal responses, facial expressions, changes in emotional state, and other non-verbal cues. Similarly, in human-machine interactions, the machine can leverage the user's follow-up utterances as feedback signals to assess whether it has appropriately addressed the user's request. Therefore, we propose using the likelihood of follow-up utterances as rewards to differentiate preferred responses from less favored ones, without relying on human or commercial LLM-based preference annotations. Our proposed reward mechanism, ``Follow-up Likelihood as Reward"" (FLR), matches the performance of strong reward models trained on large-scale human or GPT-4 annotated data on 8 pairwise-preference and 4 rating-based benchmarks. Building upon the FLR mechanism, we propose to automatically mine preference data from the online generations of a base policy model. The preference data are subsequently used to boost the helpfulness of the base model through direct alignment from preference (DAP) methods, such as direct preference optimization (DPO). Lastly, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the language model that provides follow-up likelihood with natural language feedback significantly enhances FLR's performance on reward modeling benchmarks and effectiveness in aligning the base policy model's helpfulness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13948v2,2024-09
MirrorStories: Reflecting Diversity through Personalized Narrative Generation with Large Language Models,"Sarfaroz Yunusov, Hamza Sidat, Ali Emami","This study explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in creating personalized ""mirror stories"" that reflect and resonate with individual readers' identities, addressing the significant lack of diversity in literature. We present MirrorStories, a corpus of 1,500 personalized short stories generated by integrating elements such as name, gender, age, ethnicity, reader interest, and story moral. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively incorporate diverse identity elements into narratives, with human evaluators identifying personalized elements in the stories with high accuracy. Through a comprehensive evaluation involving 26 diverse human judges, we compare the effectiveness of MirrorStories against generic narratives. We find that personalized LLM-generated stories not only outscore generic human-written and LLM-generated ones across all metrics of engagement (with average ratings of 4.22 versus 3.37 on a 5-point scale), but also achieve higher textual diversity while preserving the intended moral. We also provide analyses that include bias assessments and a study on the potential for integrating images into personalized stories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13935v2,2024-09
On-Device Collaborative Language Modeling via a Mixture of Generalists and Specialists,"Dongyang Fan, Bettina Messmer, Martin Jaggi","On-device LLMs have gained increasing attention for their ability to enhance privacy and provide a personalized user experience. To facilitate learning with private and scarce local data, federated learning has become a standard approach, though it introduces challenges related to system and data heterogeneity among end users. As a solution, we propose a novel $\textbf{Co}$llaborative learning approach with a $\textbf{Mi}$xture of $\textbf{G}$eneralists and $\textbf{S}$pecialists (CoMiGS), being the first to effectively address both. Our approach distinguishes generalists and specialists by aggregating certain experts across end users while keeping others localized to specialize in user-specific datasets. A key innovation of our method is the bi-level optimization formulation of the Mixture-of-Experts learning objective, where the router is updated using a separate validation set that represents the target distribution. CoMiGS effectively balances collaboration and personalization, as demonstrated by its superior performance in scenarios with high data heterogeneity across multiple datasets. By design, our approach accommodates users' varying computational resources through different numbers of specialists. By decoupling resource abundance from data quantity, CoMiGS remains robust against overfitting-due to the generalists' regularizing effect-while adapting to local data through specialist expertise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13931v2,2024-09

"One Model is All You Need: ByT5-Sanskrit, a Unified Model for Sanskrit NLP Tasks","Sebastian Nehrdich, Oliver Hellwig, Kurt Keutzer","Morphologically rich languages are notoriously challenging to process for downstream NLP applications. This paper presents a new pretrained language model, ByT5-Sanskrit, designed for NLP applications involving the morphologically rich language Sanskrit. We evaluate ByT5-Sanskrit on established Sanskrit word segmentation tasks, where it outperforms previous data-driven approaches by a considerable margin and matches the performance of the current best lexicon-based model. It is easier to deploy and more robust to data not covered by external linguistic resources. It also achieves new state-of-the-art results in Vedic Sanskrit dependency parsing and OCR post-correction tasks. Additionally, based on the Digital Corpus of Sanskrit, we introduce a novel multitask dataset for the joint training of Sanskrit word segmentation, lemmatization, and morphosyntactic tagging tasks. We fine-tune ByT5-Sanskrit on this dataset, creating a versatile multitask model for various downstream Sanskrit applications. We have used this model in Sanskrit linguistic annotation projects, in information retrieval setups, and as a preprocessing step in a Sanskrit machine translation pipeline. We also show that our approach yields new best scores for lemmatization and dependency parsing of other morphologically rich languages. We thus demonstrate that byte-level pretrained language models can achieve excellent performance for morphologically rich languages, outperforming tokenizer-based models and presenting an important vector of exploration when constructing NLP pipelines for such languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13920v1,2024-09
Target word activity detector: An approach to obtain ASR word boundaries without lexicon,"Sunit Sivasankaran, Eric Sun, Jinyu Li, Yan Huang, Jing Pan","Obtaining word timestamp information from end-to-end (E2E) ASR models remains challenging due to the lack of explicit time alignment during training. This issue is further complicated in multilingual models. Existing methods, either rely on lexicons or introduce additional tokens, leading to scalability issues and increased computational costs. In this work, we propose a new approach to estimate word boundaries without relying on lexicons. Our method leverages word embeddings from sub-word token units and a pretrained ASR model, requiring only word alignment information during training. Our proposed method can scale-up to any number of languages without incurring any additional cost. We validate our approach using a multilingual ASR model trained on five languages and demonstrate its effectiveness against a strong baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13913v1,2024-09

L. Keenan, Xia Hu, Emily Y. Chew, Zhiyong Lu, Hua Xu, Ron A. Adelman, Yih-Chung Tham, Qingyu Chen","Despite the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in medicine, they may generate responses lacking supporting evidence or based on hallucinated evidence. While Retrieval Augment Generation (RAG) is popular to address this issue, few studies implemented and evaluated RAG in downstream domain-specific applications. We developed a RAG pipeline with 70,000 ophthalmology-specific documents that retrieve relevant documents to augment LLMs during inference time. In a case study on long-form consumer health questions, we systematically evaluated the responses including over 500 references of LLMs with and without RAG on 100 questions with 10 healthcare professionals. The evaluation focuses on factuality of evidence, selection and ranking of evidence, attribution of evidence, and answer accuracy and completeness. LLMs without RAG provided 252 references in total. Of which, 45.3% hallucinated, 34.1% consisted of minor errors, and 20.6% were correct. In contrast, LLMs with RAG significantly improved accuracy (54.5% being correct) and reduced error rates (18.8% with minor hallucinations and 26.7% with errors). 62.5% of the top 10 documents retrieved by RAG were selected as the top references in the LLM response, with an average ranking of 4.9. The use of RAG also improved evidence attribution (increasing from 1.85 to 2.49 on a 5-point scale, P<0.001), albeit with slight decreases in accuracy (from 3.52 to 3.23, P=0.03) and completeness (from 3.47 to 3.27, P=0.17). The results demonstrate that LLMs frequently exhibited hallucinated and erroneous evidence in the responses, raising concerns for downstream applications in the medical domain. RAG substantially reduced the proportion of such evidence but encountered challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13902v1,2024-09
LLM for Everyone: Representing the Underrepresented in Large Language Models,Samuel Cahyawijaya,"Natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed a profound impact of large language models (LLMs) that excel in a multitude of tasks. However, the limitation of LLMs in multilingual settings, particularly in underrepresented languages, remains a significant hurdle. This thesis aims to bridge the gap in NLP research and development by focusing on underrepresented languages. A comprehensive evaluation of LLMs is conducted to assess their capabilities in these languages, revealing the challenges of multilingual and multicultural generalization. Addressing the multilingual generalization gap, this thesis proposes data-and-compute-efficient methods to mitigate the disparity in LLM ability in underrepresented languages, allowing better generalization on underrepresented languages without the loss of task generalization ability. The proposed solutions cover cross-lingual continual instruction tuning, retrieval-based cross-lingual in-context learning, and in-context query alignment. Furthermore, a novel method to measure cultural values alignment between LLMs operating in different languages is proposed, ensuring cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. These contributions aim to enhance the multilingual and multicultural alignment of LLMs in underrepresented languages, ultimately advancing the NLP field toward greater equality and inclusiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13897v1,2024-09
Transfer Learning with Clinical Concept Embeddings from Large Language Models,"Yuhe Gao, Runxue Bao, Yuelyu Ji, Yiming Sun, Chenxi Song, Jeffrey P. Ferraro, Ye Ye","Knowledge sharing is crucial in healthcare, especially when leveraging data from multiple clinical sites to address data scarcity, reduce costs, and enable timely interventions. Transfer learning can facilitate cross-site knowledge transfer, but a major challenge is heterogeneity in clinical concepts across different sites. Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential of capturing the semantic meaning of clinical concepts and reducing heterogeneity. This study analyzed electronic health records from two large healthcare systems to assess the impact of semantic embeddings from LLMs on local, shared, and transfer learning models. Results indicate that domain-specific LLMs, such as Med-BERT, consistently outperform in local and direct transfer scenarios, while generic models like OpenAI embeddings require fine-tuning for optimal performance. However, excessive tuning of models with biomedical embeddings may reduce effectiveness, emphasizing the need for balance. This study highlights the importance of domain-specific embeddings and careful model tuning for effective knowledge transfer in healthcare.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13893v1,2024-09
A Multi-LLM Debiasing Framework,"Deonna M. Owens, Ryan A.

Despite significant advancements in bias mitigation techniques using data augmentation, zero-shot prompting, and model fine-tuning, biases continuously persist, including subtle biases that may elude human detection. Recent research has shown a growing interest in multi-LLM approaches, which have been demonstrated to be effective in improving the quality of reasoning and factuality in LLMs. Building on this approach, we propose a novel multi-LLM debiasing framework aimed at reducing bias in LLMs. Our work is the first to introduce and evaluate two distinct approaches within this framework for debiasing LLMs: a centralized method, where the conversation is facilitated by a single central LLM, and a decentralized method, where all models communicate directly.

Inspired by the well-grounded theory on equivocation, we aim to resolve the closely related problem of response clarity in questions extracted from political interviews, leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and human expertise. To this end, we introduce a novel taxonomy that frames the task of detecting and classifying response clarity and a corresponding clarity classification dataset which consists of question-answer (QA) pairs drawn from political interviews and annotated accordingly. Our proposed two-level taxonomy addresses the clarity of a response in terms of the information provided for a given question (high-level) and also provides a fine-grained taxonomy of evasion techniques that relate to unclear, ambiguous responses (lower-level). We combine ChatGPT and human annotators to collect, validate and annotate discrete QA pairs from political interviews, to be used for our newly introduced response clarity task.

Instruct-Tuning Pretrained Causal Language Models for Ancient Greek Papyrology and Epigraphy,Eric Cullhed,"This article presents an experiment in fine-tuning a pretrained causal language model (Meta's Llama 3.1 8B Instruct) to assist with restoring missing or illegible characters in ancient Greek inscriptions and documentary papyri. Utilizing a straightforward instruction-based approach and a 95%/5% train/test split, the papyrus restoration model achieved a character error rate (CER) of 14.9%, a top-1 accuracy of 73.5%, and a top-20 accuracy of 86.0% for sequences up to 10 characters. A model was also fine-tuned for geographic attribution, reaching a top-1 accuracy of 66.4% and a top-3 accuracy of 79.9%. In chronological attribution, it demonstrated an average deviation of 21.7 years from the actual terminus post/ante quem, with a median deviation of 0 years. For inscriptions, the restoration model achieved a CER of 20.5%, a top-1 accuracy of 63.7%, and a top-20 accuracy of 83.0% for sequences up to 10 characters. In geographic attribution, it attained a top-1 accuracy of 75.0% and a top-3 accuracy of 83.7%, while in dating, it had an average deviation of 37.1 years and a median deviation of 3 years from the actual date range. Benchmarked against the state-of-the-art model (Ithaca) on a shared test set and on recently edited inscriptions, the instruction-tuned models excelled in text restoration, while also offering the practical advantage of ignoring spaces during reconstruction, which aligns with the scriptio continua of ancient textual artifacts. However, their performance in geographic and chronological attribution was lower than Ithaca's. To evaluate the approach in a more even setup, the instruction model was retrained with an 80%/10%/10% train-validation-test split, and still outperformed Ithaca in text restoration. The results suggest that fine-tuning larger pretrained causal language models using instruction templates for emendations and conjectures to ancient texts holds promise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13870v3,2024-09

Unlocking Memorization in Large Language Models with Dynamic Soft Prompting,"Zhepeng Wang, Runxue Bao, Yawen Wu, Jackson Taylor, Cao Xiao, Feng Zheng, Weiwen Jiang, Shangqian Gao, Yanfu Zhang","Pretrained large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as summarization, question answering, and translation. However, LLMs pose significant security risks due to their tendency to memorize training data, leading to potential privacy breaches and copyright infringement. Accurate measurement of this memorization is essential to evaluate and mitigate these potential risks. However, previous attempts to characterize memorization are constrained by either using prefixes only or by prepending a constant soft prompt to the prefixes, which cannot react to changes in input. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method for estimating LLM memorization using dynamic, prefix-dependent soft prompts. Our approach involves training a transformer-based generator to produce soft prompts that adapt to changes in input, thereby enabling more accurate extraction of memorized data. Our method not only addresses the limitations of previous methods but also demonstrates superior performance in diverse experimental settings compared to state-of-the-art techniques. In particular, our method can achieve the maximum relative improvement of 112.75% and 32.26% over the vanilla baseline in terms of discoverable memorization rate for the text generation task and code generation task respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13853v1,2024-09
Do language models practice what they preach? Examining language ideologies about gendered language reform encoded in LLMs,"Julia Watson, Sophia Lee, Barend Beekhuizen, Suzanne Stevenson","We study language ideologies in text produced by LLMs through a case study on English gendered language reform (related to role nouns like congressperson/-woman/-man, and singular they). First, we find political bias: when asked to use language that is ""correct"" or ""natural"", LLMs use language most similarly to when asked to align with conservative (vs. progressive) values. This shows how LLMs' metalinguistic preferences can implicitly communicate the language ideologies of a particular political group, even in seemingly non-political contexts. Second, we find LLMs exhibit internal inconsistency: LLMs use gender-neutral variants more often when more explicit metalinguistic context is provided. This shows how the language ideologies expressed in text produced by LLMs can vary, which may be unexpected to users. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for value alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13852v1,2024-09
STOP! Benchmarking Large Language Models with Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions,"Robert Morabito, Sangmitra Madhusudan, Tyler McDonald, Ali Emami","Mitigating explicit and implicit biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical focus in the field of natural language processing. However, many current methodologies evaluate scenarios in isolation, without considering the broader context or the spectrum of potential biases within each situation. To address this, we introduce the Sensitivity Testing on Offensive Progressions (STOP) dataset, which includes 450 offensive progressions containing 2,700 unique sentences of varying severity that progressively escalate from less to more explicitly offensive. Covering a broad spectrum of 9 demographics and 46 sub-demographics, STOP ensures inclusivity and comprehensive coverage. We evaluate several leading closed- and open-source models, including GPT-4, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our findings reveal that even the best-performing models detect bias inconsistently, with success rates ranging from 19.3% to 69.8%. We also demonstrate how aligning models with human judgments on STOP can improve model answer rates on sensitive tasks such as BBQ, StereoSet, and CrowS-Pairs by up to 191%, while maintaining or even improving performance. STOP presents a novel framework for assessing the complex nature of biases in LLMs, which will enable more effective bias mitigation strategies and facilitates the creation of fairer language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13843v1,2024-09

Measuring Copyright Risks of Large Language Model via Partial Information Probing,"Weijie Zhao, Huajie Shao, Zhaozhuo Xu, Suzhen Duan, Denghui Zhang","Exploring the data sources used to train Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial direction in investigating potential copyright infringement by these models. While this approach can identify the possible use of copyrighted materials in training data, it does not directly measure infringing risks. Recent research has shifted towards testing whether LLMs can directly output copyrighted content. Addressing this direction, we investigate and assess LLMs' capacity to generate infringing content by providing them with partial information from copyrighted materials, and try to use iterative prompting to get LLMs to generate more infringing content. Specifically, we input a portion of a copyrighted text into LLMs, prompt them to complete it, and then analyze the overlap between the generated content and the original copyrighted material.

The Impact of Large Language Models in Academia: from Writing to Speaking,"Mingmeng Geng, Caixi Chen, Yanru Wu, Dongping Chen, Yao Wan, Pan Zhou","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly impacting human society, particularly in textual information. Based on more than 30,000 papers and 1,000 presentations from machine learning conferences, we examined and compared the words used in writing and speaking, representing the first large-scale study of how LLMs influence the two main modes of verbal communication and expression within the same group of people. Our empirical results show that LLM-style words such as ""significant"" have been used more frequently in abstracts and oral presentations. The impact on speaking is beginning to emerge and is likely to grow in the future, calling attention to the implicit influence and ripple effect of LLMs on human society.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13686v2,2024-09
ReMEmbR: Building and Reasoning Over Long-Horizon Spatio-Temporal Memory for Robot Navigation,"Abrar Anwar, John Welsh, Joydeep Biswas, Soha Pouya, Yan Chang","Navigating and understanding complex environments over extended periods of time is a significant challenge for robots. People interacting with the robot may want to ask questions like where something happened, when it occurred, or how long ago it took place, which would require the robot to reason over a long history of their deployment. To address this problem, we introduce a Retrieval-augmented Memory for Embodied Robots, or ReMEmbR, a system designed for long-horizon video question answering for robot navigation. To evaluate ReMEmbR, we introduce the NaVQA dataset where we annotate spatial, temporal, and descriptive questions to long-horizon robot navigation videos. ReMEmbR employs a structured approach involving a memory building and a querying phase, leveraging temporal information, spatial information, and images to efficiently handle continuously growing robot histories. Our experiments demonstrate that ReMEmbR outperforms LLM and VLM baselines, allowing ReMEmbR to achieve effective long-horizon reasoning with low latency. Additionally, we deploy ReMEmbR on a robot and show that our approach can handle diverse queries. The dataset, code, videos, and other material can be found at the following link: https://nvidia-ai-iot.github.io/remembr",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13682v1,2024-09
Beyond Accuracy Optimization: Computer Vision Losses for Large Language Model Fine-Tuning,"Daniele Rege Cambrin, Giuseppe Gallipoli, Irene Benedetto, Luca Cagliero, Paolo Garza","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks. However, current training approaches combine standard cross-entropy loss with extensive data, human feedback, or ad hoc methods to enhance performance. These solutions are often not scalable or feasible due to their associated costs, complexity, or resource requirements. This study investigates the use of established semantic segmentation loss functions in natural language generation to create a versatile, practical, and scalable solution for fine-tuning different architectures. We evaluate their effectiveness in solving Math Word Problems and question answering across different models of varying sizes. For the analyzed tasks, we found that the traditional Cross-Entropy loss represents a sub-optimal choice, while models trained to minimize alternative (task-dependent) losses, such as Focal or Lov\'asz, achieve a mean improvement of +42% on exact match without requiring additional data or human feedback. These findings suggest a promising pathway for more efficient and accessible training processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13641v1,2024-09
Advancing Event Causality Identification via Heuristic Semantic Dependency Inquiry Network,"Haoran Li, Qiang Gao, Hongmei Wu, Li Huang","Event Causality Identification (ECI) focuses on extracting causal relations between events in texts. Existing methods for ECI primarily rely on causal features and external knowledge. However, these approaches fall short in two dimensions: (1) causal features between events in a text often lack explicit clues, and (2) external knowledge may introduce bias, while specific problems require tailored analyses. To address these issues, we propose SemDI - a simple and effective Semantic Dependency Inquiry Network for ECI. SemDI captures semantic dependencies within the context using a unified encoder. Then, it utilizes a Cloze Analyzer to generate a fill-in token based on comprehensive context understanding. Finally, this fill-in token is used to inquire about the causal relation between two events. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SemDI, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks.

MaPPER: Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning for Referring Expression Comprehension,"Ting Liu, Zunnan Xu, Yue Hu, Liangtao Shi, Zhiqiang Wang, Quanjun Yin","Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), which aims to ground a local visual region via natural language, is a task that heavily relies on multimodal alignment. Most existing methods utilize powerful pre-trained models to transfer visual/linguistic knowledge by full fine-tuning. However, full fine-tuning the entire backbone not only breaks the rich prior knowledge embedded in the pre-training, but also incurs significant computational costs. Motivated by the recent emergence of Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) methods, we aim to solve the REC task in an effective and efficient manner. Directly applying these PETL methods to the REC task is inappropriate, as they lack the specific-domain abilities for precise local visual perception and visual-language alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel framework of Multimodal Prior-guided Parameter Efficient Tuning, namely MaPPER. Specifically, MaPPER comprises Dynamic Prior Adapters guided by an aligned prior, and Local Convolution Adapters to extract precise local semantics for better visual perception. Moreover, the Prior-Guided Text module is proposed to further utilize the prior for facilitating the cross-modal alignment. Experimental results on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that MaPPER achieves the best accuracy compared to the full fine-tuning and other PETL methods with only 1.41% tunable backbone parameters.

"Cross-Target Stance Detection: A Survey of Techniques, Datasets, and Challenges","Parisa Jamadi Khiabani, Arkaitz Zubiaga","Stance detection is the task of determining the viewpoint expressed in a text towards a given target. A specific direction within the task focuses on cross-target stance detection, where a model trained on samples pertaining to certain targets is then applied to a new, unseen target. With the increasing need to analyze and mining viewpoints and opinions online, the task has recently seen a significant surge in interest. This review paper examines the advancements in cross-target stance detection over the last decade, highlighting the evolution from basic statistical methods to contemporary neural and LLM-based models. These advancements have led to notable improvements in accuracy and adaptability. Innovative approaches include the use of topic-grouped attention and adversarial learning for zero-shot detection, as well as fine-tuning techniques that enhance model robustness. Additionally, prompt-tuning methods and the integration of external knowledge have further refined model performance.

In this paper, we propose the challenging tasks of Satirical Image Detection (detecting whether an image is satirical), Understanding (generating the reason behind the image being satirical), and Completion (given one half of the image, selecting the other half from 2 given options, such that the complete image is satirical) and release a high-quality dataset YesBut, consisting of 2547 images, 1084 satirical and 1463 non-satirical, containing different artistic styles, to evaluate those tasks. Each satirical image in the dataset depicts a normal scenario, along with a conflicting scenario which is funny or ironic. Despite the success of current Vision-Language Models on multimodal tasks such as Visual QA and Image Captioning, our benchmarking experiments show that such models perform poorly on the proposed tasks on the YesBut Dataset in Zero-Shot Settings w.r.t both automated as well as human evaluation.

We introduce Kalahi, a cultural LLM evaluation suite collaboratively created by native Filipino speakers. It is composed of 150 high-quality, handcrafted and nuanced prompts that test LLMs for generations that are relevant to shared Filipino cultural knowledge and values. Strong LLM performance in Kalahi indicates a model's ability to generate responses similar to what an average Filipino would say or do in a given situation. We conducted experiments on LLMs with multilingual and Filipino language support. Results show that Kalahi, while trivial for Filipinos, is challenging for LLMs, with the best model answering only 46.0% of the questions correctly compared to native Filipino performance of 89.10%. Thus, Kalahi can be used to accurately and reliably evaluate Filipino cultural representation in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15380v3,2024-09
Demystifying and Extracting Fault-indicating Information from Logs for Failure Diagnosis,"Junjie Huang, Zhihan Jiang, Jinyang Liu, Yintong Huo, Jiazhen Gu, Zhuangbin Chen, Cong Feng, Hui Dong, Zengyin Yang, Michael R. Lyu","Logs are imperative in the maintenance of online service systems, which often encompass important information for effective failure mitigation. While existing anomaly detection methodologies facilitate the identification of anomalous logs within extensive runtime data, manual investigation of log messages by engineers remains essential to comprehend faults, which is labor-intensive and error-prone. Upon examining the log-based troubleshooting practices at CloudA, we find that engineers typically prioritize two categories of log information for diagnosis. These include fault-indicating descriptions, which record abnormal system events, and fault-indicating parameters, which specify the associated entities. Motivated by this finding, we propose an approach to automatically extract such faultindicating information from logs for fault diagnosis, named LoFI. LoFI comprises two key stages. In the first stage, LoFI performs coarse-grained filtering to collect logs related to the faults based on semantic similarity. In the second stage, LoFI leverages a pre-trained language model with a novel prompt-based tuning method to extract fine-grained information of interest from the collected logs. We evaluate LoFI on logs collected from Apache Spark and an industrial dataset from CloudA. The experimental results demonstrate that LoFI outperforms all baseline methods by a significant margin, achieving an absolute improvement of 25.8~37.9 in F1 over the best baseline method, ChatGPT. This highlights the effectiveness of LoFI in recognizing fault-indicating information. Furthermore, the successful deployment of LoFI at CloudA and user studies validate the utility of our method.

Generating Visual Stories with Grounded and Coreferent Characters,"Danyang Liu, Mirella Lapata, Frank Keller","Characters are important in narratives. They move the plot forward, create emotional connections, and embody the story's themes. Visual storytelling methods focus more on the plot and events relating to it, without building the narrative around specific characters. As a result, the generated stories feel generic, with character mentions being absent, vague, or incorrect. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the new task of character-centric story generation and present the first model capable of predicting visual stories with consistently grounded and coreferent character mentions. Our model is finetuned on a new dataset which we build on top of the widely used VIST benchmark. Specifically, we develop an automated pipeline to enrich VIST with visual and textual character coreference chains. We also propose new evaluation metrics to measure the richness of characters and coreference in stories. Experimental results show that our model generates stories with recurring characters which are consistent and coreferent to larger extent compared to baselines and state-of-the-art systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13555v1,2024-09
Contextualized Data-Wrangling Code Generation in Computational Notebooks,"Junjie Huang, Daya Guo, Chenglong Wang, Jiazhen Gu, Shuai Lu, Jeevana Priya Inala, Cong Yan, Jianfeng Gao, Nan Duan, Michael R. Lyu","Data wrangling, the process of preparing raw data for further analysis in computational notebooks, is a crucial yet time-consuming step in data science. Code generation has the potential to automate the data wrangling process to reduce analysts' overhead by translating user intents into executable code. Precisely generating data wrangling code necessitates a comprehensive consideration of the rich context present in notebooks, including textual context, code context and data context. However, notebooks often interleave multiple non-linear analysis tasks into linear sequence of code blocks, where the contextual dependencies are not clearly reflected. Directly training models with source code blocks fails to fully exploit the contexts for accurate wrangling code generation.   To bridge the gap, we aim to construct a high quality datasets with clear and rich contexts to help training models for data wrangling code generation tasks. In this work, we first propose an automated approach, CoCoMine to mine data-wrangling code generation examples with clear multi-modal contextual dependency. It first adopts data flow analysis to identify the code blocks containing data wrangling codes. Then, CoCoMine extracts the contextualized datawrangling code examples through tracing and replaying notebooks. With CoCoMine, we construct CoCoNote, a dataset containing 58,221 examples for Contextualized Data-wrangling Code generation in Notebooks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset, we finetune a range of pretrained code models and prompt various large language models on our task. Furthermore, we also propose DataCoder, which encodes data context and code&textual contexts separately to enhance code generation. Experiment results demonstrate the significance of incorporating data context in data-wrangling code generation and the effectiveness of our model.

ShizishanGPT: An Agricultural Large Language Model Integrating Tools and Resources,"Shuting Yang, Zehui Liu, Wolfgang Mayer","Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in intelligent dialogue systems'ability to handle complex inquiries. However, current LLMs still exhibit limitations in specialized domain knowledge, particularly in technical fields such as agriculture. To address this problem, we propose ShizishanGPT, an intelligent question answering system for agriculture based on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and agent architecture. ShizishanGPT consists of five key modules: including a generic GPT-4 based module for answering general questions; a search engine module that compensates for the problem that the large language model's own knowledge cannot be updated in a timely manner; an agricultural knowledge graph module for providing domain facts; a retrieval module which uses RAG to supplement domain knowledge; and an agricultural agent module, which invokes specialized models for crop phenotype prediction, gene expression analysis, and so on. We evaluated the ShizishanGPT using a dataset containing 100 agricultural questions specially designed for this study. The experimental results show that the tool significantly outperforms general LLMs as it provides more accurate and detailed answers due to its modular design and integration of different domain knowledge sources.

EMMeTT: Efficient Multimodal Machine Translation Training,"Piotr Żelasko, Zhehuai Chen, Mengru Wang, Daniel Galvez, Oleksii Hrinchuk, Shuoyang Ding, Ke Hu, Jagadeesh Balam, Vitaly Lavrukhin, Boris Ginsburg","A rising interest in the modality extension of foundation language models warrants discussion on the most effective, and efficient, multimodal training approach. This work focuses on neural machine translation (NMT) and proposes a joint multimodal training regime of Speech-LLM to include automatic speech translation (AST). We investigate two different foundation model architectures, decoder-only GPT and encoder-decoder T5, extended with Canary-1B's speech encoder. To handle joint multimodal training, we propose a novel training framework called EMMeTT. EMMeTT improves training efficiency with the following: balanced sampling across languages, datasets, and modalities; efficient sequential data iteration; and a novel 2D bucketing scheme for multimodal data, complemented by a batch size optimizer (OOMptimizer). We show that a multimodal training consistently helps with both architectures. Moreover, SALM-T5 trained with EMMeTT retains the original NMT capability while outperforming AST baselines on four-language subsets of FLORES and FLEURS.

LM-assisted keyword biasing with Aho-Corasick algorithm for Transducer-based ASR,"Iuliia Thorbecke, Juan Zuluaga-Gomez, Esaú Villatoro-Tello, Andres Carofilis, Shashi Kumar, Petr Motlicek, Karthik Pandia, Aravind Ganapathiraju","Despite the recent success of end-to-end models for automatic speech recognition, recognizing special rare and out-of-vocabulary words, as well as fast domain adaptation with text, are still challenging. It often happens that biasing to the special entities leads to a degradation in the overall performance. We propose a light on-the-fly method to improve automatic speech recognition performance by combining a bias list of named entities with a word-level n-gram language model with the shallow fusion approach based on the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm. The Aho-Corasick algorithm has proved to be more efficient than other methods and allows fast context adaptation. An n-gram language model is introduced as a graph with fail and output arcs, where the arc weights are adapted from the n-gram probabilities. The language model is used as an additional support to keyword biasing when the language model is combined with bias entities in a single context graph to take care of the overall performance. We demonstrate our findings on 4 languages, 2 public and 1 private datasets including performance on named entities and out-of-vocabulary entities. We achieve up to 21.6% relative improvement in the general word error rate with no practical difference in the inverse real-time factor.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13514v1,2024-09

Starting with a simulated model of the human vocal tract, we first try generating vocal imitations by tuning the model's control parameters to make the synthesized vocalization match the target sound in terms of perceptually-salient auditory features. Then, to better match human intuitions, we apply a cognitive theory of communication to take into account how human speakers reason strategically about their listeners. Finally, we show through several experiments and user studies that when we add this type of communicative reasoning to our method, it aligns with human intuitions better than matching auditory features alone does.

End-Cloud Collaboration Framework for Advanced AI Customer Service in E-commerce,"Liangyu Teng, Yang Liu, Jing Liu, Liang Song","In recent years, the e-commerce industry has seen a rapid increase in the demand for advanced AI-driven customer service solutions. Traditional cloud-based models face limitations in terms of latency, personalized services, and privacy concerns. Furthermore, end devices often lack the computational resources to deploy large AI models effectively. In this paper, we propose an innovative End-Cloud Collaboration (ECC) framework for advanced AI customer service in e-commerce. This framework integrates the advantages of large cloud models and mid/small-sized end models by deeply exploring the generalization potential of cloud models and effectively utilizing the computing power resources of terminal chips, alleviating the strain on computing resources to some extent. Specifically, the large cloud model acts as a teacher, guiding and promoting the learning of the end model, which significantly reduces the end model's reliance on large-scale, high-quality data and thereby addresses the data bottleneck in traditional end model training, offering a new paradigm for the rapid deployment of industry applications. Additionally, we introduce an online evolutive learning strategy that enables the end model to continuously iterate and upgrade based on guidance from the cloud model and real-time user feedback. This strategy ensures that the model can flexibly adapt to the rapid changes in application scenarios while avoiding the uploading of sensitive information by performing local fine-tuning, achieving the dual goals of privacy protection and personalized service. %We make systematic contributions to the customized model fine-tuning methods in the e-commerce domain. To conclude, we implement in-depth corpus collection (e.g., data organization, cleaning, and preprocessing) and train an ECC-based industry-specific model for e-commerce customer service.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07122v1,2024-09
HUT: A More Computation Efficient Fine-Tuning Method With Hadamard Updated Transformation,"Geyuan Zhang, Xiaofei Zhou, Chuheng Chen","Fine-tuning pre-trained language models for downstream tasks has achieved impressive results in NLP. However, fine-tuning all parameters becomes impractical due to the rapidly increasing size of model parameters. To address this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods update only a subset of parameters. Most PEFT methods, such as LoRA, use incremental updates, which involve adding learned weight matrix increments to the original parameters. Although effective, these methods face limitations in capturing complex parameter dynamics and do not maintain a strong correlation between the original and updated parameters. To overcome these challenges, we propose the direct Updated Transformation (UT) paradigm, which constructs a transformation directly from the original to the updated parameters. This approach ensures that the correlation between the original and updated parameters is preserved, leveraging the semantic features learned during pre-training. Building on this paradigm, we present the Hadamard Updated Transformation (HUT) method. HUT efficiently updates the original weight matrix using the Hadamard transformation with two low-rank matrices, offering a more expressive and flexible update mechanism. This allows HUT to capture richer parameter features through functional transformations, reducing computational complexity while maintaining or improving model quality. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on RoBERTa and GPT-2 validate the effectiveness of HUT. Results show that HUT performs on par with or better than other PEFT methods in terms of model quality, while significantly reducing computational complexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13501v1,2024-09

In this work, we demonstrate that streaming Transformer-Transducer (TT) models can be trained from scratch in consumer and accessible GPUs in their entirety with pseudo-labeled (PL) speech from foundational speech models (FSM). This allows training a robust ASR model just in one stage and does not require large data and computational budget compared to the two-step scenario with pre-training and fine-tuning. We perform a comprehensive ablation on different aspects of PL-based streaming TT models such as the impact of (1) shallow fusion of n-gram LMs, (2) contextual biasing with named entities, (3) chunk-wise decoding for low-latency streaming applications, and (4) TT overall performance as the function of the FSM size. Our results demonstrate that TT can be trained from scratch without supervised data, even with very noisy PLs.

Constrained Reasoning Chains for Enhancing Theory-of-Mind in Large Language Models,"Zizheng Lin, Chunkit Chan, Yangqiu Song, Xin Liu","Theory-of-Mind (ToM) ability possessed by Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to be limited. Most existing methods for improving ToM in LLMs adopt zero-shot prompting, and they face challenges including poor performance in complex ToM reasoning tasks and an inability to handle non-narrative contexts. We propose a zero-shot prompting method named Constrained Chain-of-ToM (CCoToM) that leverages domain knowledge and the causal relations between ToM dimensions to address these limitations. Specifically, CCoToM guides LLMs to construct explicit reasoning chains by first prompting LLMs to infer related ToM dimensions (e.g., belief). Afterward, CCoToM prompts LLMs to infer the queried ToM dimension based on the generated related ToM dimensions and corresponding causal relations. Additionally, CCoToM adaptively imposes constraints on prompts to introduce inductive biases and improve consistency between ToM dimensions. Besides narratives, CCoToM can also handle non-narrative contexts like conversations. Extensive experiments show that CCoToM consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins across all LLMs and datasets used. We also conduct in-depth analyses to gain deeper insights into CCoToM. We have made our code publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13490v1,2024-09
'Since Lawyers are Males..': Examining Implicit Gender Bias in Hindi Language Generation by LLMs,"Ishika Joshi, Ishita Gupta, Adrita Dey, Tapan Parikh","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate text across various languages, for tasks such as translation, customer support, and education.

We developed Hindi datasets inspired by WinoBias to examine stereotypical patterns in responses from models like GPT-4o and Claude-3 sonnet. Our results reveal a significant gender bias of 87.8% in Hindi, compared to 33.4% in English GPT-4o generation, with Hindi responses frequently relying on gender stereotypes related to occupations, power hierarchies, and social class.

A Multimodal Dense Retrieval Approach for Speech-Based Open-Domain Question Answering,"Georgios Sidiropoulos, Evangelos Kanoulas","Speech-based open-domain question answering (QA over a large corpus of text passages with spoken questions) has emerged as an important task due to the increasing number of users interacting with QA systems via speech interfaces. Passage retrieval is a key task in speech-based open-domain QA. So far, previous works adopted pipelines consisting of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that transcribes the spoken question before feeding it to a dense text retriever. Such pipelines have several limitations. The need for an ASR model limits the applicability to low-resource languages and specialized domains with no annotated speech data. Furthermore, the ASR model propagates its errors to the retriever. In this work, we try to alleviate these limitations by proposing an ASR-free, end-to-end trained multimodal dense retriever that can work directly on spoken questions. Our experimental results showed that, on shorter questions, our retriever is a promising alternative to the \textit{ASR and Retriever} pipeline, achieving better retrieval performance in cases where ASR would have mistranscribed important words in the question or have produced a transcription with a high word error rate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13483v1,2024-09

Alternate Preference Optimization for Unlearning Factual Knowledge in Large Language Models,"Anmol Mekala, Vineeth Dorna, Shreya Dubey, Abhishek Lalwani, David Koleczek, Mukund Rungta, Sadid Hasan, Elita Lobo","Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the influence of specific training data, known as the forget set, from the model. However, existing unlearning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) face a critical challenge: they rely solely on negative feedback to suppress responses related to the forget set, which often results in nonsensical or inconsistent outputs, diminishing model utility and posing potential privacy risks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Alternate Preference Optimization (AltPO), which combines negative feedback with in-domain positive feedback on the forget set. Additionally, we introduce new evaluation metrics to assess the quality of responses related to the forget set. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only enables effective unlearning but also avoids undesirable model behaviors while maintaining overall model performance.

Nevertheless, formulating high-quality prompts to assist them in their work poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately, these endeavors lack a structural design, incurring high learning costs and it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts, especially for non-AI experts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages, we propose LangGPT, a structural prompt design framework. Furthermore, we introduce Minstrel, a multi-generative agent system with reflection to automate the generation of structural prompts. Experiments and the case study illustrate that structural prompts generated by Minstrel or written manually significantly enhance the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, we analyze the ease of use of structural prompts through a user survey in our online community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13449v1,2024-09

This observation motivates the development of a dynamic method that adaptively selects the most suitable QA strategy for each question, enabling more efficient and effective systems capable of addressing a broader range of question types. To this aim, we build on recent advances in the orchestration of multiple large language models (LLMs) and formulate adaptive QA as a dynamic orchestration challenge. We define this as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem, where the context is defined by the characteristics of the incoming question and the action space consists of potential communication graph configurations among the LLM agents. We then train a linear upper confidence bound model to learn an optimal mapping between different question types and their corresponding optimal multi-LLM communication graph representation. Our experiments show that the proposed solution is viable for adaptive orchestration of a QA system with multiple modules, as it combines the superior performance of more complex strategies while avoiding their costs when simpler strategies suffice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13447v2,2024-09
Selective Exploration and Information Gathering in Search and Rescue Using Hierarchical Learning Guided by Natural Language Input,"Dimitrios Panagopoulos, Adolfo Perrusquia, Weisi Guo","In recent years, robots and autonomous systems have become increasingly integral to our daily lives, offering solutions to complex problems across various domains. Their application in search and rescue (SAR) operations, however, presents unique challenges. Comprehensively exploring the disaster-stricken area is often infeasible due to the vastness of the terrain, transformed environment, and the time constraints involved. Traditional robotic systems typically operate on predefined search patterns and lack the ability to incorporate and exploit ground truths provided by human stakeholders, which can be the key to speeding up the learning process and enhancing triage. Addressing this gap, we introduce a system that integrates social interaction via large language models (LLMs) with a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework. The proposed system is designed to translate verbal inputs from human stakeholders into actionable RL insights and adjust its search strategy. By leveraging human-provided information through LLMs and structuring task execution through HRL, our approach not only bridges the gap between autonomous capabilities and human intelligence but also significantly improves the agent's learning efficiency and decision-making process in environments characterised by long horizons and sparse rewards.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13445v1,2024-09
AVG-LLaVA: A Large Multimodal Model with Adaptive Visual Granularity,"Zhibin Lan, Liqiang Niu, Fandong Meng, Wenbo Li, Jie Zhou, Jinsong Su","Recently, when dealing with high-resolution images, dominant LMMs usually divide them into multiple local images and one global image, which will lead to a large number of visual tokens. In this work, we introduce AVG-LLaVA, an LMM that can adaptively select the appropriate visual granularity based on the input image and instruction. This approach not only reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference, but also improves the overall model performance. Specifically, we introduce the following modules based on LLaVA-NeXT: (a) a visual granularity scaler that includes multiple pooling layers to obtain visual tokens with different granularities; (b) a visual granularity router, which includes a Transformer layer, an MLP layer, and a voter layer, used to select the appropriate visual granularity based on the image and instruction. Furthermore, we propose RGLF, a novel training paradigm that aims at aligning the granularity predicted by the router with the preferences of the LMM, without the need for additional manually annotated data. Extensive experiments and analysis show that AVG-LLaVA achieves superior performance across 11 benchmarks, as well as significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference (e.g., an 85.3% reduction in visual tokens and a 2.53$\times$ increase in inference speed on the AI2D benchmark).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02745v2,2024-09
Contextual Compression in Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey,Sourav Verma,"Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase remarkable abilities, yet they struggle with limitations such as hallucinations, outdated knowledge, opacity, and inexplicable reasoning. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be a viable solution, leveraging external databases to improve the consistency and coherence of generated content, especially valuable for complex, knowledge-rich tasks, and facilitates continuous improvement by leveraging domain-specific insights. By combining the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases, RAG achieves a synergistic effect. However, RAG is not without its limitations, including a limited context window, irrelevant information, and the high processing overhead for extensive contextual data. In this comprehensive work, we explore the evolution of Contextual Compression paradigms, providing an in-depth examination of the field. Finally, we outline the current challenges and suggest potential research and development directions, paving the way for future advancements in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13385v2,2024-09
LLMs Still Can't Plan; Can LRMs? A Preliminary Evaluation of OpenAI's o1 on PlanBench,"Karthik Valmeekam, Kaya Stechly, Subbarao Kambhampati","The ability to plan a course of action that achieves a desired state of affairs has long been considered a core competence of intelligent agents and has been an integral part of AI research since its inception. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there has been considerable interest in the question of whether or not they possess such planning abilities. PlanBench, an extensible benchmark we developed in 2022, soon after the release of GPT3, has remained an important tool for evaluating the planning abilities of LLMs. Despite the slew of new private and open source LLMs since GPT3, progress on this benchmark has been surprisingly slow. OpenAI claims that their recent o1 (Strawberry) model has been specifically constructed and trained to escape the normal limitations of autoregressive LLMs--making it a new kind of model: a Large Reasoning Model (LRM). Using this development as a catalyst, this paper takes a comprehensive look at how well current LLMs and new LRMs do on PlanBench. As we shall see, while o1's performance is a quantum improvement on the benchmark, outpacing the competition, it is still far from saturating it. This improvement also brings to the fore questions about accuracy, efficiency, and guarantees which must be considered before deploying such systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13373v1,2024-09
EmotionQueen: A Benchmark for Evaluating Empathy of Large Language Models,"Yuyan Chen, Hao Wang, Songzhou Yan, Sijia Liu, Yueze Li, Yi Zhao, Yanghua Xiao","Emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs) is of great importance in Natural Language Processing. However, the previous research mainly focus on basic sentiment analysis tasks, such as emotion recognition, which is not enough to evaluate LLMs' overall emotional intelligence. Therefore, this paper presents a novel framework named EmotionQueen for evaluating the emotional intelligence of LLMs. The framework includes four distinctive tasks: Key Event Recognition, Mixed Event Recognition, Implicit Emotional Recognition, and Intention Recognition. LLMs are requested to recognize important event or implicit emotions and generate empathetic response. We also design two metrics to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in recognition and response for emotion-related statements. Experiments yield significant conclusions about LLMs' capabilities and limitations in emotion intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13359v1,2024-09

In this paper, we present a detailed survey of recent progress in LLMs for emotion cognition. We explore key research studies, methodologies, outcomes, and resources, aligning them with Ulric Neisser's cognitive stages. Additionally, we outline potential future directions for research in this evolving field, including unsupervised learning approaches and the development of more complex and interpretable emotion cognition LLMs. We also discuss advanced methods such as contrastive learning used to improve LLMs' emotion cognition capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13354v1,2024-09
Time Awareness in Large Language Models: Benchmarking Fact Recall Across Time,"David Herel, Vojtech Bartek, Tomas Mikolov","Who is the US President? The answer changes depending on when the question is asked. While large language models (LLMs) are evaluated on various reasoning tasks, they often miss a crucial dimension: time. In real-world scenarios, the correctness of answers is frequently tied to temporal context. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset designed to rigorously test LLMs' ability to handle time-sensitive facts. Our benchmark offers a systematic way to measure how well LLMs align their knowledge with the correct time context, filling a key gap in current evaluation methods and offering a valuable tool for improving real-world applicability in future models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13338v1,2024-09
Beyond the binary: Limitations and possibilities of gender-related speech technology research,"Ariadna Sanchez, Alice Ross, Nina Markl","This paper presents a review of 107 research papers relating to speech and sex or gender in ISCA Interspeech publications between 2013 and 2023. We note the scarcity of work on this topic and find that terminology, particularly the word gender, is used in ways that are underspecified and often out of step with the prevailing view in social sciences that gender is socially constructed and is a spectrum as opposed to a binary category. We draw attention to the potential problems that this can cause for already marginalised groups, and suggest some questions for researchers to ask themselves when undertaking work on speech and gender.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13335v2,2024-09
Applying Pre-trained Multilingual BERT in Embeddings for Improved Malicious Prompt Injection Attacks Detection,"Md Abdur Rahman, Hossain Shahriar, Fan Wu, Alfredo Cuzzocrea","Large language models (LLMs) are renowned for their exceptional capabilities, and applying to a wide range of applications. However, this widespread use brings significant vulnerabilities. Also, it is well observed that there are huge gap which lies in the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies against malicious prompt injection attacks in large language models, as current approaches may not adequately address the complexity and evolving nature of these vulnerabilities in real-world applications. Therefore, this work focuses the impact of malicious prompt injection attacks which is one of most dangerous vulnerability on real LLMs applications. It examines to apply various BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) like multilingual BERT, DistilBert for classifying malicious prompts from legitimate prompts. Also, we observed how tokenizing the prompt texts and generating embeddings using multilingual BERT contributes to improve the performance of various machine learning methods: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. The performance of each model is rigorously analyzed with various parameters to improve the binary classification to discover malicious prompts. Multilingual BERT approach to embed the prompts significantly improved and outperformed the existing works and achieves an outstanding accuracy of 96.55% by Logistic regression. Additionally, we investigated the incorrect predictions of the model to gain insights into its limitations. The findings can guide researchers in tuning various BERT for finding the most suitable model for diverse LLMs vulnerabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13331v1,2024-09
SLaVA-CXR: Small Language and Vision Assistant for Chest X-ray Report Automation,"Jinge Wu, Yunsoo Kim, Daqian Shi, David Cliffton, Fenglin Liu, Honghan Wu","Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is growing research interest in developing LLMs in the medical domain to assist clinicians. However, for hospitals, using closed-source commercial LLMs involves privacy issues, and developing open-source public LLMs requires large-scale computational resources, which are usually limited, especially in resource-efficient regions and low-income countries. We propose an open-source Small Language and Vision Assistant (SLaVA-CXR) that can be used for Chest X-Ray report automation. To efficiently train a small assistant, we first propose the Re$^3$Training method, which simulates the cognitive development of radiologists and optimizes the model in the Recognition, Reasoning, and Reporting training manner. Then, we introduce a data synthesis method, RADEX, which can generate a high-quality and diverse training corpus with privacy regulation compliance. The extensive experiments show that our SLaVA-CXR built on a 2.7B backbone not only outperforms but also achieves 6 times faster inference efficiency than previous state-of-the-art larger models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13321v1,2024-09
CSCE: Boosting LLM Reasoning by Simultaneous Enhancing of Casual Significance and Consistency,"Kangsheng Wang, Xiao Zhang, Zizheng Guo, Tianyu Hu, Huimin Ma","Chain-based reasoning methods like chain of thought (CoT) play a rising role in solving reasoning tasks for large language models (LLMs). However, the causal illusions between \textit{a step of reasoning} and \textit{corresponding state transitions} are becoming a significant obstacle to advancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities, especially in long-range reasoning tasks. This paper proposes a non-chain-based reasoning framework for simultaneous consideration of causal significance and consistency, i.e., the Causal Significance and Consistency Enhancer (CSCE). We customize LLM's loss function utilizing treatment effect assessments to enhance its reasoning ability from two aspects: causal significance and consistency. This ensures that the model captures essential causal relationships and maintains robust and consistent performance across various scenarios. Additionally, we transform the reasoning process from the cascading multiple one-step reasoning commonly used in Chain-Based methods, like CoT, to a causal-enhanced method that outputs the entire reasoning process in one go, further improving the model's reasoning efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method improves both the reasoning success rate and speed. These improvements further demonstrate that non-chain-based methods can also aid LLMs in completing reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17174v1,2024-09
JMedBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Japanese Biomedical Large Language Models,"Junfeng Jiang, Jiahao Huang, Akiko Aizawa","Recent developments in Japanese large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on general domains, with fewer advancements in Japanese biomedical LLMs. One obstacle is the absence of a comprehensive, large-scale benchmark for comparison. Furthermore, the resources for evaluating Japanese biomedical LLMs are insufficient. To advance this field, we propose a new benchmark including eight LLMs across four categories and 20 Japanese biomedical datasets across five tasks. Experimental results indicate that: (1) LLMs with a better understanding of Japanese and richer biomedical knowledge achieve better performance in Japanese biomedical tasks, (2) LLMs that are not mainly designed for Japanese biomedical domains can still perform unexpectedly well, and (3) there is still much room for improving the existing LLMs in certain Japanese biomedical tasks. Moreover, we offer insights that could further enhance development in this field. Our evaluation tools tailored to our benchmark as well as the datasets are publicly available in https://huggingface.co/datasets/Coldog2333/JMedBench to facilitate future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13317v1,2024-09
GAProtoNet: A Multi-head Graph Attention-based Prototypical Network for Interpretable Text Classification,"Ximing Wen, Wenjuan Tan, Rosina O. Weber","Pretrained transformer-based Language Models (LMs) are well-known for their ability to achieve significant improvement on text classification tasks with their powerful word embeddings, but their black-box nature, which leads to a lack of interpretability, has been a major concern. In this work, we introduce GAProtoNet, a novel white-box Multi-head Graph Attention-based Prototypical Network designed to explain the decisions of text classification models built with LM encoders. In our approach, the input vector and prototypes are regarded as nodes within a graph, and we utilize multi-head graph attention to selectively construct edges between the input node and prototype nodes to learn an interpretable prototypical representation. During inference, the model makes decisions based on a linear combination of activated prototypes weighted by the attention score assigned for each prototype, allowing its choices to be transparently explained by the attention weights and the prototypes projected into the closest matching training examples. Experiments on multiple public datasets show our approach achieves superior results without sacrificing the accuracy of the original black-box LMs. We also compare with four alternative prototypical network variations and our approach achieves the best accuracy and F1 among all. Our case study and visualization of prototype clusters also demonstrate the efficiency in explaining the decisions of black-box models built with LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13312v2,2024-09
Learning to Generalize Unseen Domains via Multi-Source Meta Learning for Text Classification,"Yuxuan Hu, Chenwei Zhang, Min Yang, Xiaodan Liang, Chengming Li, Xiping Hu","With the rapid development of deep learning methods, there have been many breakthroughs in the field of text classification. Models developed for this task have been shown to achieve high accuracy. However, most of these models are trained using labeled data from seen domains. It is difficult for these models to maintain high accuracy in a new challenging unseen domain, which is directly related to the generalization of the model. In this paper, we study the multi-source Domain Generalization of text classification and propose a framework to use multiple seen domains to train a model that can achieve high accuracy in an unseen domain. Specifically, we propose a multi-source meta-learning Domain Generalization framework to simulate the process of model generalization to an unseen domain, so as to extract sufficient domain-related features. We introduced a memory mechanism to store domain-specific features, which coordinate with the meta-learning framework. Besides, we adopt the novel ""jury"" mechanism that enables the model to learn sufficient domain-invariant features. Experiments demonstrate that our meta-learning framework can effectively enhance the ability of the model to generalize to an unseen domain and can outperform the state-of-the-art methods on multi-source text classification datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13787v1,2024-09
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Keyphrase Generation using Citation Contexts,"Florian Boudin, Akiko Aizawa","Adapting keyphrase generation models to new domains typically involves few-shot fine-tuning with in-domain labeled data. However, annotating documents with keyphrases is often prohibitively expensive and impractical, requiring expert annotators. This paper presents silk, an unsupervised method designed to address this issue by extracting silver-standard keyphrases from citation contexts to create synthetic labeled data for domain adaptation. Extensive experiments across three distinct domains demonstrate that our method yields high-quality synthetic samples, resulting in significant and consistent improvements in in-domain performance over strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13266v2,2024-09
Towards LifeSpan Cognitive Systems,"Yu Wang, Chi Han, Tongtong Wu, Xiaoxin He, Wangchunshu Zhou, Nafis Sadeq, Xiusi Chen, Zexue He, Wei Wang, Gholamreza Haffari, Heng Ji, Julian McAuley","Building a human-like system that continuously interacts with complex environments -- whether simulated digital worlds or human society -- presents several key challenges. Central to this is enabling continuous, high-frequency interactions, where the interactions are termed experiences. We refer to this envisioned system as the LifeSpan Cognitive System (LSCS). A critical feature of LSCS is its ability to engage in incremental and rapid updates while retaining and accurately recalling past experiences. We identify two major challenges in achieving this: (1) Abstraction and Experience Merging, and (2) Long-term Retention with Accurate Recall. These properties are essential for storing new experiences, organizing past experiences, and responding to the environment in ways that leverage relevant historical data. Unlike language models with continual learning, which typically rely on large corpora for fine-tuning and focus on improving performance within specific domains or tasks, LSCS must rapidly and incrementally update with new information from its environment at a high frequency. Existing technologies with the potential of solving the above two major challenges can be classified into four classes based on a conceptual metric called Storage Complexity, which measures the relative space required to store past experiences. Each of these four classes of technologies has its own strengths and limitations. Given that none of the existing technologies can achieve LSCS alone, we propose a novel paradigm for LSCS that integrates all four classes of technologies. The new paradigm operates through two core processes: Absorbing Experiences and Generating Responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13265v1,2024-09
Large Language Model Should Understand Pinyin for Chinese ASR Error Correction,"Yuang Li, Xiaosong Qiao, Xiaofeng Zhao, Huan Zhao, Wei Tang, Min Zhang, Hao Yang","Large language models can enhance automatic speech recognition systems through generative error correction. In this paper, we propose Pinyin-enhanced GEC, which leverages Pinyi, the phonetic representation of Mandarin Chinese, as supplementary information to improve Chinese ASR error correction. Our approach only utilizes synthetic errors for training and employs the one-best hypothesis during inference. Additionally, we introduce a multitask training approach involving conversion tasks between Pinyin and text to align their feature spaces. Experiments on the Aishell-1 and the Common Voice datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms GEC with text-only input. More importantly, we provide intuitive explanations for the effectiveness of PY-GEC and multitask training from two aspects: 1) increased attention weight on Pinyin features; and 2) aligned feature space between Pinyin and text hidden states.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13262v1,2024-09
Prompting Large Language Models for Supporting the Differential Diagnosis of Anemia,"Elisa Castagnari, Lillian Muyama, Adrien Coulet","In practice, clinicians achieve a diagnosis by following a sequence of steps, such as laboratory exams, observations, or imaging. The pathways to reach diagnosis decisions are documented by guidelines authored by expert organizations, which guide clinicians to reach a correct diagnosis through these sequences of steps. While these guidelines are beneficial for following medical reasoning and consolidating medical knowledge, they have some drawbacks. They often fail to address patients with uncommon conditions due to their focus on the majority population, and are slow and costly to update, making them unsuitable for rapidly emerging diseases or new practices. Inspired by clinical guidelines, our study aimed to develop pathways similar to those that can be obtained in clinical guidelines. We tested three Large Language Models (LLMs) -Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 (GPT-4), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and Mistral -on a synthetic yet realistic dataset to differentially diagnose anemia and its subtypes. By using advanced prompting techniques to enhance the decision-making process, we generated diagnostic pathways using these models.

RLHFuse: Efficient RLHF Training for Large Language Models with Inter- and Intra-Stage Fusion,"Yinmin Zhong, Zili Zhang, Bingyang Wu, Shengyu Liu, Yukun Chen, Changyi Wan, Hanpeng Hu, Lei Xia, Ranchen Ming, Yibo Zhu, Xin Jin","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) enhances the alignment between LLMs and human preference. The workflow of RLHF typically involves several models and tasks in a series of distinct stages. Existing RLHF training systems view each task as the smallest execution unit thus overlooking the opportunities for subtask-level optimizations. Due to the intrinsic nature of RLHF training, i.e., the data skewness in the generation stage, and the pipeline bubbles in the training stage, existing RLHF systems suffer from low GPU utilization in production deployments.   RLHFuse breaks the traditional view of RLHF workflow as a composition of individual tasks, splitting each task into finer-grained subtasks, and performing stage fusion to improve GPU utilization. RLHFuse contains two key ideas. First, for generation and inference tasks, RLHFuse splits them into sample-level subtasks, enabling efficient inter-stage fusion to mitigate the original generation bottleneck dominated by long-tailed samples. Second, for training tasks, RLHFuse breaks them into subtasks of micro-batches. By leveraging the intuition that pipeline execution can be essentially complemented by another pipeline, RLHFuse performs intra-stage fusion to concurrently execute these subtasks in the training stage with a fused pipeline schedule, resulting in fewer pipeline bubbles. In addition, RLHFuse incorporates a series of system optimizations tailored for each stage of RLHF, making it efficient and scalable for our internal product usage. We evaluate RLHFuse on various popular LLMs and the results show that RLHFuse increases the training throughput by up to 3.7x, compared to existing state-of-the-art systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13221v2,2024-09
A Multiple-Fill-in-the-Blank Exam Approach for Enhancing Zero-Resource Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models,"Satoshi Munakata, Taku Fukui, Takao Mohri","Large language models (LLMs) often fabricate a hallucinatory text. Several methods have been developed to detect such text by semantically comparing it with the multiple versions probabilistically regenerated. However, a significant issue is that if the storyline of each regenerated text changes, the generated texts become incomparable, which worsen detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hallucination detection method that incorporates a multiple-fill-in-the-blank exam approach to address this storyline-changing issue. First, our method creates a multiple-fill-in-the-blank exam by masking multiple objects from the original text. Second, prompts an LLM to repeatedly answer this exam. This approach ensures that the storylines of the exam answers align with the original ones. Finally, quantifies the degree of hallucination for each original sentence by scoring the exam answers, considering the potential for \emph{hallucination snowballing} within the original text itself. Experimental results show that our method alone not only outperforms existing methods, but also achieves clearer state-of-the-art performance in the ensembles with existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17173v1,2024-09
Neural-Symbolic Collaborative Distillation: Advancing Small Language Models for Complex Reasoning Tasks,"Huanxuan Liao, Shizhu He, Yao Xu, Yuanzhe Zhang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","In this paper, we propose $\textbf{Ne}$ural-$\textbf{Sy}$mbolic $\textbf{C}$ollaborative $\textbf{D}$istillation ($\textbf{NesyCD}$), a novel knowledge distillation method for learning the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., \textgreater 13B). We argue that complex reasoning tasks are difficult for Small Language Models (SLMs, e.g., $\leq$ 7B), as these tasks demand not only general cognitive abilities but also specialized knowledge, which is often sparse and difficult for these neural-based SLMs to effectively capture. Therefore, NesyCD distills the general capabilities and specialized knowledge in LLMs using different manners. On the one hand, we distill only general abilities from teacher LLMs into the student SLMs of parameterized neural networks. On the other hand, for the specialized abilities and uncommon knowledge of a complex reasoning task, we employ a symbolic knowledge distillation approach to obtain and store the specialized knowledge within a symbolic knowledge base (KB). By decoupling general and specialized capabilities, the proposed NesyCD can achieve superior performance cost-effectively, utilizing smaller models and blending parameterized neural networks with symbolic KB. Moreover, the specialized KB generalizes well and is comprehended and manipulated by humans. Our experiments show that NesyCD significantly boosts SLMs' complex reasoning performance on in-domain (BBH, GSM8K) and out-of-domain (AGIEval, ARC) datasets. Notably, our approach enabled the LLaMA3-8B and Qwen2-7B to surpass GPT-3.5-turbo in performance and come close to matching LLaMA3-70B, despite the latter having nine times more parameters.

CITI: Enhancing Tool Utilizing Ability in Large Language Models without Sacrificing General Performance,"Yupu Hao, Pengfei Cao, Zhuoran Jin, Huanxuan Liao, Yubo Chen, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","Tool learning enables the Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with the external environment by invoking tools, enriching the accuracy and capability scope of LLMs. However, previous works predominantly focus on improving model's tool-utilizing accuracy and the ability to generalize to new, unseen tools, excessively forcing LLMs to adjust specific tool-invoking pattern without considering the harm to model's general performance. This deviates from the actual applications and original intention of integrating tools to enhance model. To tackle this problem, we dissect the capability trade-offs by examining the hidden representation changes and the gradient-based importance score of model's components. Based on the analysis result, we propose a Component Importance-based Tool-utilizing ability Injection method (CITI). According to the gradient-based importance score of different components, it alleviates the capability conflicts caused by fine-tuning process by applying distinct training strategies to different components. CITI applies Mixture-Of-LoRA (MOLoRA) for important components. Meanwhile, it fine-tunes the parameters of few components deemed less important in the backbone of the LLM, while keeping other parameters frozen. CITI can effectively enhance the model's tool-utilizing capability without excessively compromising its general performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves outstanding performance across a range of evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13202v2,2024-09
CFSP: An Efficient Structured Pruning Framework for LLMs with Coarse-to-Fine Activation Information,"Yuxin Wang, Minghua Ma, Zekun Wang, Jingchang Chen, Huiming Fan, Liping Shan, Qing Yang, Dongliang Xu, Ming Liu, Bing Qin","The colossal parameters and computational overhead of Large Language Models (LLMs) challenge their real-world applications. Network pruning, which targets unstructured or structured sparsity by removing redundant parameters, has recently been explored for LLM acceleration. Existing LLM pruning works focus on unstructured pruning, which typically requires special hardware support for a practical speed-up. In contrast, structured pruning can reduce latency on general devices. However, it remains a challenge to perform structured pruning efficiently and maintain performance, especially at high sparsity ratios. To this end, we introduce an efficient structured pruning framework named CFSP, which leverages both Coarse (interblock) and Fine-grained (intrablock) activation information as an importance criterion to guide pruning. The pruning is highly efficient, as it only requires one forward pass to compute feature activations. Specifically, we first allocate the sparsity budget across blocks based on their importance and then retain important weights within each block. In addition, we introduce a recovery fine-tuning strategy that adaptively allocates training overhead based on coarse-grained importance to further improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that CFSP outperforms existing methods on diverse models across various sparsity budgets. Our code will be available at https://github.com/wyxscir/CFSP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13199v2,2024-09

ControlMath: Controllable Data Generation Promotes Math Generalist Models,"Nuo Chen, Ning Wu, Jianhui Chang, Jia Li","Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has yielded encouraging results in mathematical reasoning. However, these approaches face constraints in problem diversity, potentially restricting them to in-domain/distribution data generation. To this end, we propose ControlMath, an iterative method involving an equation-generator module and two LLM-based agents. The module creates diverse equations, which the Problem-Crafter agent then transforms into math word problems. The Reverse-Agent filters and selects high-quality data, adhering to the ""less is more"" principle, achieving better results with fewer data points. This approach enables the generation of diverse math problems, not limited to specific domains or distributions. As a result, we collect ControlMathQA, which involves 190k math word problems. Extensive results prove that combining our dataset with in-domain datasets like GSM8K can help improve the model's mathematical ability to generalize, leading to improved performances both within and beyond specific domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15376v1,2024-09

However, neither existing unimodal task-specific specialist models nor emerging general large multimodal models (LMM) can cover the wide range of chemical data modality and task categories. To address the real demands of chemists, a cross-modal Chemical General Intelligence (CGI) system, which serves as a truly practical and useful research assistant utilizing the great potential of LMMs, is in great need. In this work, we introduce the first Cross-modal Dialogue Foundation Model for Chemistry (ChemDFM-X). Diverse multimodal data are generated from an initial modality by approximate calculations and task-specific model predictions. This strategy creates sufficient chemical training corpora, while significantly reducing excessive expense, resulting in an instruction-tuning dataset containing 7.6M data. After instruction finetuning, ChemDFM-X is evaluated on extensive experiments of different chemical tasks with various data modalities.

An adapted large language model facilitates multiple medical tasks in diabetes care,"Lai Wei, Zhen Ying, Muyang He, Yutong Chen, Qian Yang, Yanzhe Hong, Jiaping Lu, Xiaoying Li, Weiran Huang, Ying Chen","Diabetes is a chronic disease that poses a significant global health burden, and optimizing diabetes management requires multi-stakeholder collaboration. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various healthcare scenarios, but their effectiveness across a diverse range of diabetes tasks remains unproven. In this study, we introduced a framework to train and validate diabetes-specific LLMs. We first developed a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes data collection, filtering, augmentation and refinement. This approach contributes to creating a high-quality, diabetes-specific dataset, and several evaluation benchmarks entirely from scratch. Utilizing the collected training dataset, we fine-tuned a diabetes-specific LLM family that demonstrated state-of-the-art proficiency in understanding and processing various diabetes tasks compared to other LLMs. Furthermore, clinical studies showed the potential applications of our models in diabetes care, including providing personalized healthcare, assisting medical education, and streamlining clinical tasks. In conclusion, our study introduced a framework to develop and evaluate a diabetes-specific LLM family, and highlighted its potential to enhance clinical practice and provide personalized, data-driven support for diabetes support when facing different end users.

$\textit{SKIntern}$: Internalizing Symbolic Knowledge for Distilling Better CoT Capabilities into Small Language Models,"Huanxuan Liao, Shizhu He, Yupu Hao, Xiang Li, Yuanzhe Zhang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu","Small Language Models (SLMs) are attracting attention due to the high computational demands and privacy concerns of Large Language Models (LLMs). Some studies fine-tune SLMs using Chains of Thought (CoT) data distilled from LLMs, aiming to enhance their reasoning ability. Furthermore, Some CoT distillation methods introduce external symbolic knowledge into the generation process to improve the limited knowledge memory, reasoning ability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization of SLMs. However, the introduction of symbolic knowledge increases computational overhead and introduces potential noise. In this paper, we introduce $\textit{SKIntern}$, an innovative approach that empowers SLMs to internalize symbolic knowledge and few-shot examples gradually through a progressive fine-tuning process, guided by a predefined linear decay schedule under curriculum learning. By efficiently internalizing knowledge, $\textit{SKIntern}$ reduces computational overhead and speeds up the reasoning process by focusing solely on the question during inference. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 5\%, while reducing inference costs (measured in FLOPs) by up to $4\times$ across a wide range of SLMs in both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks.

RRM: Robust Reward Model Training Mitigates Reward Hacking,"Tianqi Liu, Wei Xiong, Jie Ren, Lichang Chen, Junru Wu, Rishabh Joshi, Yang Gao, Jiaming Shen, Zhen Qin, Tianhe Yu, Daniel Sohn, Anastasiia Makarova, Jeremiah Liu, Yuan Liu, Bilal Piot, Abe Ittycheriah, Aviral Kumar, Mohammad Saleh","Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, traditional RM training, which relies on response pairs tied to specific prompts, struggles to disentangle prompt-driven preferences from prompt-independent artifacts, such as response length and format. In this work, we expose a fundamental limitation of current RM training methods, where RMs fail to effectively distinguish between contextual signals and irrelevant artifacts when determining preferences. To address this, we introduce a causal framework that learns preferences independent of these artifacts and propose a novel data augmentation technique designed to eliminate them. Extensive experiments show that our approach successfully filters out undesirable artifacts, yielding a more robust reward model (RRM). Our RRM improves the performance of a pairwise reward model trained on Gemma-2-9b-it, on RewardBench, increasing accuracy from 80.61% to 84.15%. Additionally, we train two DPO policies using both the RM and RRM, demonstrating that the RRM significantly enhances DPO-aligned policies, improving MT-Bench scores from 7.27 to 8.31 and length-controlled win-rates in AlpacaEval-2 from 33.46% to 52.49%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13156v1,2024-09
Utility of Multimodal Large Language Models in Analyzing Chest X-ray with Incomplete Contextual Information,"Choonghan Kim, Seonhee Cho, Joo Heung Yoon","Background: Large language models (LLMs) are gaining use in clinical settings, but their performance can suffer with incomplete radiology reports. We tested whether multimodal LLMs (using text and images) could improve accuracy and understanding in chest radiography reports, making them more effective for clinical decision support.   Purpose: To assess the robustness of LLMs in generating accurate impressions from chest radiography reports using both incomplete data and multimodal data. Material and Methods: We used 300 radiology image-report pairs from the MIMIC-CXR database. Three LLMs (OpenFlamingo, MedFlamingo, IDEFICS) were tested in both text-only and multimodal formats. Impressions were first generated from the full text, then tested by removing 20%, 50%, and 80% of the text. The impact of adding images was evaluated using chest x-rays, and model performance was compared using three metrics with statistical analysis.   Results: The text-only models (OpenFlamingo, MedFlamingo, IDEFICS) had similar performance (ROUGE-L: 0.39 vs. 0.21 vs. 0.21; F1RadGraph: 0.34 vs. 0.17 vs. 0.17; F1CheXbert: 0.53 vs. 0.40 vs. 0.40), with OpenFlamingo performing best on complete text (p<0.001). Performance declined with incomplete data across all models. However, adding images significantly boosted the performance of MedFlamingo and IDEFICS (p<0.001), equaling or surpassing OpenFlamingo, even with incomplete text. Conclusion: LLMs may produce low-quality outputs with incomplete radiology data, but multimodal LLMs can improve reliability and support clinical decision-making.

Are Large Language Models Good Essay Graders?,"Anindita Kundu, Denilson Barbosa","We evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing essay quality, focusing on their alignment with human grading. More precisely, we evaluate ChatGPT and Llama in the Automated Essay Scoring (AES) task, a crucial natural language processing (NLP) application in Education. We consider both zero-shot and few-shot learning and different prompting approaches. We compare the numeric grade provided by the LLMs to human rater-provided scores utilizing the ASAP dataset, a well-known benchmark for the AES task. Our research reveals that both LLMs generally assign lower scores compared to those provided by the human raters; moreover, those scores do not correlate well with those provided by the humans. In particular, ChatGPT tends to be harsher and further misaligned with human evaluations than Llama. We also experiment with a number of essay features commonly used by previous AES methods, related to length, usage of connectives and transition words, and readability metrics, including the number of spelling and grammar mistakes. We find that, generally, none of these features correlates strongly with human or LLM scores. Finally, we report results on Llama 3, which are generally better across the board, as expected. Overall, while LLMs do not seem an adequate replacement for human grading, our results are somewhat encouraging for their use as a tool to assist humans in the grading of written essays in the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13120v1,2024-09
What Would You Ask When You First Saw $a^2+b^2=c^2$? Evaluating LLM on Curiosity-Driven Questioning,"Shashidhar Reddy Javaji, Zining Zhu","Large language models (LLMs) can store a massive amount of knowledge, yet their potential to acquire new knowledge remains unknown. We propose a novel evaluation framework that evaluates this capability. This framework prompts LLMs to generate questions about a statement introducing scientific knowledge, simulating a curious person when facing the statement for the first time. We score the qualities of the generated questions, thereby evaluating the knowledge acquisition potential of the LLM. We apply controlled ablation studies to validate our scoring procedures. Additionally, we created a synthetic dataset consisting of 1101 statements in physics, chemistry, and maths with distinct levels of difficulties, 300 general knowledge statements, and 567 incorrect statements. Human evaluations were conducted to validate our model assessments, achieving an approximate weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.7 on all three metrics considered. We find that while large models like GPT-4 and Mistral 8x7b are adept at generating coherent and relevant questions, the smaller Phi-2 model is equally or more effective. This indicates that size does not solely determine a model's knowledge acquisition potential. The proposed framework quantifies a critical model capability that was commonly overlooked and opens up research opportunities for developing more knowledgeable AI systems",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17172v1,2024-09
Cross-Domain Content Generation with Domain-Specific Small Language Models,"Ankit Maloo, Abhinav Garg","Generating domain-specific content using small language models poses challenges, especially when dealing with multiple distinct datasets with minimal overlap. In this study, we explore methods to enable a small language model to produce coherent and relevant outputs for two different domains: stories (Dataset A) and recipes (Dataset B). Our initial experiments show that training individual models on each dataset yields satisfactory results, with each model generating appropriate content within its domain. We find that utilizing custom tokenizers tailored to each dataset significantly enhances generation quality compared to using a generic tokenizer. Attempts to adapt a single model to both domains using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or standard fine-tuning do not yield substantial results, often failing to produce meaningful outputs. Moreover, full fine-tuning without freezing the model's existing weights leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses previously learned information and only retains knowledge from the new data. To overcome these challenges, we employ a knowledge expansion strategy: training only with additional parameters. This approach enables the model to generate both stories and recipes upon request, effectively handling multiple domains without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge expansion with frozen layers is an effective method for small language models to generate domain-specific content across distinct datasets. This work contributes to the development of efficient multi-domain language models and provides insights into managing catastrophic forgetting in small-scale architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17171v2,2024-09
Personalized Speech Recognition for Children with Test-Time Adaptation,"Zhonghao Shi, Harshvardhan Srivastava, Xuan Shi, Shrikanth Narayanan, Maja J. Matarić","Accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) for children is crucial for effective real-time child-AI interaction, especially in educational applications. However, off-the-shelf ASR models primarily pre-trained on adult data tend to generalize poorly to children's speech due to the data domain shift from adults to children. Recent studies have found that supervised fine-tuning on children's speech data can help bridge this domain shift, but human annotations may be impractical to obtain for real-world applications and adaptation at training time can overlook additional domain shifts occurring at test time. We devised a novel ASR pipeline to apply unsupervised test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for child speech recognition, so that ASR models pre-trained on adult speech can be continuously adapted to each child speaker at test time without further human annotations. Our results show that ASR models adapted with TTA methods significantly outperform the unadapted off-the-shelf ASR baselines both on average and statistically across individual child speakers. Our analysis also discovered significant data domain shifts both between child speakers and within each child speaker, which further motivates the need for test-time adaptation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13095v1,2024-09
Guided Profile Generation Improves Personalization with LLMs,Jiarui Zhang,"In modern commercial systems, including Recommendation, Ranking, and E-Commerce platforms, there is a trend towards improving customer experiences by incorporating Personalization context as input into Large Language Models (LLMs). However, LLMs often struggle to effectively parse and utilize sparse and complex personal context without additional processing or contextual enrichment, underscoring the need for more sophisticated context understanding mechanisms. In this work, we propose Guided Profile Generation (GPG), a general method designed to generate personal profiles in natural language. As is observed, intermediate guided profile generation enables LLMs to summarize, and extract the important, distinctive features from the personal context into concise, descriptive sentences, precisely tailoring their generation more closely to an individual's unique habits and preferences. Our experimental results show that GPG improves LLM's personalization ability across different tasks, for example, it increases 37% accuracy in predicting personal preference compared to directly feeding the LLMs with raw personal context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13093v1,2024-09

Strategic Collusion of LLM Agents: Market Division in Multi-Commodity Competitions,"Ryan Y. Lin, Siddhartha Ojha, Kevin Cai, Maxwell F.

In this work, we explore the strategic behaviors of large language models (LLMs) when deployed as autonomous agents in multi-commodity markets, specifically within Cournot competition frameworks. We examine whether LLMs can independently engage in anti-competitive practices such as collusion or, more specifically, market division. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively monopolize specific commodities by dynamically adjusting their pricing and resource allocation strategies, thereby maximizing profitability without direct human input or explicit collusion commands. These results pose unique challenges and opportunities for businesses looking to integrate AI into strategic roles and for regulatory bodies tasked with maintaining fair and competitive markets.

System 2 thinking in OpenAI's o1-preview model: Near-perfect performance on a mathematics exam,"Joost de Winter, Dimitra Dodou, Yke Bauke Eisma","The processes underlying human cognition are often divided into System 1, which involves fast, intuitive thinking, and System 2, which involves slow, deliberate reasoning. Previously, large language models were criticized for lacking the deeper, more analytical capabilities of System 2. In September 2024, OpenAI introduced the o1 model series, designed to handle System 2-like reasoning. While OpenAI's benchmarks are promising, independent validation is still needed. In this study, we tested the o1-preview model twice on the Dutch 'Mathematics B' final exam. It scored a near-perfect 76 and 74 out of 76 points. For context, only 24 out of 16,414 students in the Netherlands achieved a perfect score. By comparison, the GPT-4o model scored 66 and 62 out of 76, well above the Dutch students' average of 40.63 points. Neither model had access to the exam figures. Since there was a risk of model contami-nation (i.e., the knowledge cutoff for o1-preview and GPT-4o was after the exam was published online), we repeated the procedure with a new Mathematics B exam that was published after the cutoff date. The results again indicated that o1-preview performed strongly (97.8th percentile), which suggests that contamination was not a factor. We also show that there is some variability in the output of o1-preview, which means that sometimes there is 'luck' (the answer is correct) or 'bad luck' (the output has diverged into something that is incorrect). We demonstrate that the self-consistency approach, where repeated prompts are given and the most common answer is selected, is a useful strategy for identifying the correct answer. It is concluded that while OpenAI's new model series holds great potential, certain risks must be considered.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07114v5,2024-09

LLM Surgery: Efficient Knowledge Unlearning and Editing in Large Language Models,"Akshaj Kumar Veldanda, Shi-Xiong Zhang, Anirban Das, Supriyo Chakraborty, Stephen Rawls, Sambit Sahu, Milind Naphade","Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, yet their utility comes with significant challenges related to outdated or problematic knowledge embedded during pretraining. This paper addresses the challenge of modifying LLMs to unlearn problematic and outdated information while efficiently integrating new knowledge without retraining from scratch. Here, we propose LLM Surgery, a framework to efficiently modify LLM behaviour by optimizing a three component objective function that: (1) Performs reverse gradient on unlearning dataset (problematic and outdated information), (2) Performs gradient descent on the update dataset (new and updated information), and (3) Minimizes the KL divergence on the retain dataset (small subset of unchanged text), ensuring alignment between pretrained and modified model outputs. Due to the lack of publicly available datasets specifically tailored for our novel task, we compiled a new dataset and an evaluation benchmark.

TACO-RL: Task Aware Prompt Compression Optimization with Reinforcement Learning,"Shivam Shandilya, Menglin Xia, Supriyo Ghosh, Huiqiang Jiang, Jue Zhang, Qianhui Wu, Victor Rühle","The increasing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 in various applications has led to a surge in the size of prompts required for optimal performance, leading to challenges in computational efficiency. Prompt compression aims to reduce the inference cost by minimizing input tokens without compromising on the task performance. However, existing prompt compression techniques either rely on sub-optimal metrics such as information entropy or model it as a task-agnostic token classification problem that fails to capture task-specific information. To address these issues, we propose a novel and efficient reinforcement learning (RL) based task-aware prompt compression method. To ensure low latency requirements, we leverage existing Transformer encoder-based token classification model while guiding the learning process with task-specific reward signals using lightweight REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our method on three diverse and challenging tasks including text summarization, question answering and code summarization. We demonstrate that our RL-guided compression method improves the task performance by 8% - 189% across these three scenarios over state-of-the-art compression techniques while satisfying the same compression rate and latency requirements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13035v3,2024-09
CLAIR-A: Leveraging Large Language Models to Judge Audio Captions,"Tsung-Han Wu, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Trevor Darrell, David M. Chan","The Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) task asks models to generate natural language descriptions of an audio input. Evaluating these machine-generated audio captions is a complex task that requires considering diverse factors, among them, auditory scene understanding, sound-object inference, temporal coherence, and the environmental context of the scene. While current methods focus on specific aspects, they often fail to provide an overall score that aligns well with human judgment. In this work, we propose CLAIR-A, a simple and flexible method that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate candidate audio captions by directly asking LLMs for a semantic distance score. In our evaluations, CLAIR-A better predicts human judgements of quality compared to traditional metrics, with a 5.8% relative accuracy improvement compared to the domain-specific FENSE metric and up to 11% over the best general-purpose measure on the Clotho-Eval dataset. Moreover, CLAIR-A offers more transparency by allowing the language model to explain the reasoning behind its scores, with these explanations rated up to 30% better by human evaluators than those provided by baseline methods.

However, most current AI search engines are limited to text-only settings, neglecting the multimodal user queries and the text-image interleaved nature of website information. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made impressive strides. Yet, whether they can function as AI search engines remains under-explored, leaving the potential of LMMs in multimodal search an open question. To this end, we first design a delicate pipeline, MMSearch-Engine, to empower any LMMs with multimodal search capabilities. On top of this, we introduce MMSearch, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess the multimodal search performance of LMMs. The curated dataset contains 300 manually collected instances spanning 14 subfields, which involves no overlap with the current LMMs' training data, ensuring the correct answer can only be obtained within searching. By using MMSearch-Engine, the LMMs are evaluated by performing three individual tasks (requery, rerank, and summarization), and one challenging end-to-end task with a complete searching process. We conduct extensive experiments on closed-source and open-source LMMs. Among all tested models, GPT-4o with MMSearch-Engine achieves the best results, which surpasses the commercial product, Perplexity Pro, in the end-to-end task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline. We further present error analysis to unveil current LMMs still struggle to fully grasp the multimodal search tasks, and conduct ablation study to indicate the potential of scaling test-time computation for AI search engine.

"Re-Introducing LayerNorm: Geometric Meaning, Irreversibility and a Comparative Study with RMSNorm","Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli","Layer normalization is a pivotal step in the transformer architecture. This paper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process, examining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors in the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is innately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1, 1, \cdots, 1]^T \in \mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step in LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component of a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and (iii) scale the resultant vector by $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the representation space. We also introduce the property of ""irreversibility"" for LayerNorm, where we show that the information lost during the normalization process cannot be recovered. In other words, unlike batch normalization, LayerNorm cannot learn an identity transform. While we present possible arguments for removing the component along the uniform vector, the choice of removing this component seems arbitrary and not well motivated by the original authors. To evaluate the usefulness of this step, we compare the hidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using RMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally align representations orthogonal to the uniform vector, presenting the first mechanistic evidence that removing the component along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. Our findings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more computationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also learns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal to the uniform vector.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12951v1,2024-09
"Fact, Fetch, and Reason: A Unified Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation","Satyapriya Krishna, Kalpesh Krishna, Anhad Mohananey, Steven Schwarcz, Adam Stambler, Shyam Upadhyay, Manaal Faruqui","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant performance improvements across various cognitive tasks. An emerging application is using LLMs to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. These systems require LLMs to understand user queries, retrieve relevant information, and synthesize coherent and accurate responses. Given the increasing real-world deployment of such systems, comprehensive evaluation becomes crucial. To this end, we propose FRAMES (Factuality, Retrieval, And reasoning MEasurement Set), a high-quality evaluation dataset designed to test LLMs' ability to provide factual responses, assess retrieval capabilities, and evaluate the reasoning required to generate final answers. While previous work has provided datasets and benchmarks to evaluate these abilities in isolation, FRAMES offers a unified framework that provides a clearer picture of LLM performance in end-to-end RAG scenarios. Our dataset comprises challenging multi-hop questions that require the integration of information from multiple sources. We present baseline results demonstrating that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with this task, achieving 0.40 accuracy with no retrieval. The accuracy is significantly improved with our proposed multi-step retrieval pipeline, achieving an accuracy of 0.66 (>50% improvement).

First, we constructed diverse test samples input based on algorithmic questions and code solutions. Then, we designed different complex reasoning questions based on algorithmic problems and test samples. Finally, combining the intermediate variable outputs of the code solutions and the complex reasoning questions, we derived the reasoning process and the final answer. With this approach, we can construct a dataset that is sufficiently difficult (all models are ineffective), diverse (synthesized from 2,360 different algorithmic questions), and scalable (building different test samples and collecting more algorithmic questions).

Mitigating Unsafe Feedback with Learning Constraints,"Domenic Rosati, Giles Edkins, Harsh Raj, David Atanasov, Subhabrata Majumdar, Janarthanan Rajendran, Frank Rudzicz, Hassan Sajjad","While there has been progress towards aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ensuring safe behaviour at inference time, safety-guards can easily be removed when fine-tuned on unsafe and harmful datasets.While this setting has been treated extensively, another popular training paradigm, learning from unsafe feedback with reinforcement learning, has previously been unexplored. This is concerning due to the widespread deployment of feedback collection systems. We address this gap by providing an analysis of learning settings where feedback is adversarial and noisy, i.e. that unsafe samples are preferred over safe ones despite model developers goal to maintain safety. We find that safety-aligned LLMs easily explore unsafe action spaces through generating harmful text and optimize for adversarial reward indicating that current safety guards are not enough to prevent learning from unsafe feedback. In order to protect against this vulnerability, we adapt a number of both ""implict"" and ""explicit"" harmful fine-tuning defences to evaluate whether they are effective as learning constraints in an RL setting finding that no method is generally effective pointing to the need for more research in defences given the widespread adoption of methods designed to learn from feedback. We end the paper with the observation that some defences work by performing ""harmless reward hacking"" for which we provide a theoretical explanation drawn from the theory of Constrained Markov Decision Processes and provide some direction for future defence development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12914v2,2024-09
Scaling Smart: Accelerating Large Language Model Pre-training with Small Model Initialization,"Mohammad Samragh, Iman Mirzadeh, Keivan Alizadeh Vahid, Fartash Faghri, Minsik Cho, Moin Nabi, Devang Naik, Mehrdad Farajtabar","The pre-training phase of language models often begins with randomly initialized parameters. With the current trends in scaling models, training their large number of parameters can be extremely slow and costly. In contrast, small language models are less expensive to train, but they often cannot achieve the accuracy of large models. In this paper, we explore an intriguing idea to connect these two different regimes: Can we develop a method to initialize large language models using smaller pre-trained models? Will such initialization bring any benefits in terms of training time and final accuracy? In this paper, we introduce HyperCloning, a method that can expand the parameters of a pre-trained language model to those of a larger model with increased hidden dimensions. Our method ensures that the larger model retains the functionality of the smaller model. As a result, the larger model already inherits the predictive power and accuracy of the smaller model before the training starts. We demonstrate that training such an initialized model results in significant savings in terms of GPU hours required for pre-training large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12903v2,2024-09
Enhancing Unsupervised Sentence Embeddings via Knowledge-Driven Data Augmentation and Gaussian-Decayed Contrastive Learning,"Peichao Lai, Zhengfeng Zhang, Wentao Zhang, Fangcheng Fu, Bin Cui","Recently, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has led to considerable improvements in unsupervised sentence embedding models. However, existing methods encounter two primary challenges: limited data diversity and high data noise. Current approaches often neglect fine-grained knowledge, such as entities and quantities, leading to insufficient diversity. Additionally, unsupervised data frequently lacks discriminative information, and the generated synthetic samples may introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline-based data augmentation method via LLMs and introduce the Gaussian-decayed gradient-assisted Contrastive Sentence Embedding (GCSE) model to enhance unsupervised sentence embeddings. To tackle the issue of low data diversity, our pipeline utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to extract entities and quantities, enabling LLMs to generate more diverse, knowledge-enriched samples. To address high data noise, the GCSE model uses a Gaussian-decayed function to limit the impact of false hard negative samples, enhancing the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, using fewer data samples and smaller LLMs, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness across various models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12887v2,2024-09
Enhancing E-commerce Product Title Translation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Large Language Models,"Bryan Zhang, Taichi Nakatani, Stephan Walter","E-commerce stores enable multilingual product discovery which require accurate product title translation. Multilingual large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capacity to perform machine translation tasks, and it can also enhance and translate product titles cross-lingually in one step. However, product title translation often requires more than just language conversion because titles are short, lack context, and contain specialized terminology. This study proposes a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that leverages existing bilingual product information in e-commerce by retrieving similar bilingual examples and incorporating them as few-shot prompts to enhance LLM-based product title translation. Experiment results show that our proposed RAG approach improve product title translation quality with chrF score gains of up to 15.3% for language pairs where the LLM has limited proficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12880v1,2024-09
A New Perspective on ADHD Research: Knowledge Graph Construction with LLMs and Network Based Insights,"Hakan T. Otal, Stephen V. Faraone, M. Abdullah Canbaz","Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a challenging disorder to study due to its complex symptomatology and diverse contributing factors. To explore how we can gain deeper insights on this topic, we performed a network analysis on a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG) of ADHD, constructed by integrating scientific literature and clinical data with the help of cutting-edge large language models. The analysis, including k-core techniques, identified critical nodes and relationships that are central to understanding the disorder. Building on these findings, we curated a knowledge graph that is usable in a context-aware chatbot (Graph-RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling accurate and informed interactions. Our knowledge graph not only advances the understanding of ADHD but also provides a powerful tool for research and clinical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12853v2,2024-09
Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis on Text Polarities with Evaluation of Classification Models,"Muhammad Raees, Samina Fazilat","Sentiment analysis possesses the potential of diverse applicability on digital platforms. Sentiment analysis extracts the polarity to understand the intensity and subjectivity in the text. This work uses a lexicon-based method to perform sentiment analysis and shows an evaluation of classification models trained over textual data. The lexicon-based methods identify the intensity of emotion and subjectivity at word levels. The categorization identifies the informative words inside a text and specifies the quantitative ranking of the polarity of words. This work is based on a multi-class problem of text being labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. Twitter sentiment dataset containing 1.6 million unprocessed tweets is used with lexicon-based methods like Text Blob and Vader Sentiment to introduce the neutrality measure on text. The analysis of lexicons shows how the word count and the intensity classify the text. A comparative analysis of machine learning models, Naiive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient (XG) Boost performed across multiple performance metrics. The best estimations are achieved through Random Forest with an accuracy score of 81%. Additionally, sentiment analysis is applied for a personality judgment case against a Twitter profile based on online activity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12840v1,2024-09
Pay Attention to What Matters,"Pedro Luiz Silva, Antonio de Domenico, Ali Maatouk, Fadhel Ayed","Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they still exhibit a limited capability to align their outputs to the user instructions. In this work, we introduce a simple and effective method, which we name GUIDE, that mechanistically increases attention scores in instruction tokens. To support this operation, we present Influence, a novel metric that highlights how the user's instructions propagate through the transformer layers and impact the LLM output. Our results show that GUIDE improves the accuracy of following instructions 29.4 % to 60.4%, outperforming natural prompting alternatives and Supervised Fine-Tuning up to 1M tokens.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19001v1,2024-09
FoodPuzzle: Developing Large Language Model Agents as Flavor Scientists,"Tenghao Huang, Donghee Lee, John Sweeney, Jiatong Shi, Emily Steliotes, Matthew Lange, Jonathan May, Muhao Chen","Flavor development in the food industry is increasingly challenged by the need for rapid innovation and precise flavor profile creation. Traditional flavor research methods typically rely on iterative, subjective testing, which lacks the efficiency and scalability required for modern demands. This paper presents three contributions to address the challenges. Firstly, we define a new problem domain for scientific agents in flavor science, conceptualized as the generation of hypotheses for flavor profile sourcing and understanding. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce the FoodPuzzle, a challenging benchmark consisting of 978 food items and 1,766 flavor molecules profiles. We propose a novel Scientific Agent approach, integrating in-context learning and retrieval augmented techniques to generate grounded hypotheses in the domain of food science. Experimental results indicate that our model significantly surpasses traditional methods in flavor profile prediction tasks, demonstrating its potential to transform flavor development practices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12832v3,2024-09
Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF,"Jiaxin Wen, Ruiqi Zhong, Akbir Khan, Ethan Perez, Jacob Steinhardt, Minlie Huang, Samuel R. Bowman, He He, Shi Feng","Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex. RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it ""U-SOPHISTRY"" since it is Unintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS. Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting Intended Sophistry (e.g. backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-SOPHISTRY. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12822v3,2024-09
Bilingual Evaluation of Language Models on General Knowledge in University Entrance Exams with Minimal Contamination,"Eva Sánchez Salido, Roser Morante, Julio Gonzalo, Guillermo Marco, Jorge Carrillo-de-Albornoz, Laura Plaza, Enrique Amigó, Andrés Fernández, Alejandro Benito-Santos, Adrián Ghajari Espinosa, Victor Fresno","In this article we present UNED-ACCESS 2024, a bilingual dataset that consists of 1003 multiple-choice questions of university entrance level exams in Spanish and English. Questions are originally formulated in Spanish and translated manually into English, and have not ever been publicly released. A selection of current open-source and proprietary models are evaluated in a uniform zero-shot experimental setting both on the UNED-ACCESS 2024 dataset and on an equivalent subset of MMLU questions. Results show that (i) reasoning questions are challenging for models, (ii) smaller models perform worse than larger models and degrade faster in Spanish than in English and (iii) the performance gap between languages is negligible for the best models and grows up to 37% for smaller models. Model ranking on UNED-ACCESS 2024 is almost identical in English and Spanish, and has also a high correlation (0.98 Pearson) with ranking on MMLU, suggesting that a small dataset is sufficiently diverse and representative to measure performance by discipline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12746v1,2024-09
Fine Tuning Large Language Models for Medicine: The Role and Importance of Direct Preference Optimization,"Thomas Savage, Stephen Ma, Abdessalem Boukil, Vishwesh Patel, Ekanath Rangan, Ivan Lopez, Jonathan H Chen","Large Language Model (LLM) fine tuning is underutilized in the field of medicine. Two of the most common methods of fine tuning are Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), but there is little guidance informing users when to use either technique. In this investigation, we compare the performance of SFT and DPO for five common natural language tasks in medicine: Classification with text data, Classification with numeric data, Clinical Reasoning, Summarization, and Clinical Triage. We find that SFT alone is sufficient for Classification with text data, whereas DPO improves performance for the more complex tasks of Clinical Reasoning, Summarization and Clinical Triage. Our results establish the role and importance of DPO fine tuning within medicine, and consequently call attention to current software gaps that prevent widespread deployment of this technique.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12741v3,2024-09
Edu-Values: Towards Evaluating the Chinese Education Values of Large Language Models,"Peiyi Zhang, Yazhou Zhang, Bo Wang, Lu Rong, Jing Qin","With the recent evolution of large language models (LLMs), concerns about aligning such models with human values have grown. Previous research has primarily focused on assessing LLMs' performance in terms of the Helpful, Honest, Harmless (3H) basic principles, while often overlooking their alignment with educational values in the Chinese context. To fill this gap, we present Edu-Values, the first Chinese education values evaluation benchmark designed to measure LLMs' alignment ability across seven dimensions: professional ideology, cultural literacy, educational knowledge and skills, education laws and regulations, teachers' professional ethics, basic competencies, and subject knowledge. We meticulously design and compile 1,418 questions, including multiple-choice, multi-modal question answering, subjective analysis, adversarial prompts, and questions on traditional Chinese culture. We conduct both human evaluation and automatic evaluation over 11 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LLMs, and highlight three main findings: (1) due to differences in educational culture, Chinese LLMs significantly outperform English LLMs, with Qwen 2 ranking the first with a score of 81.37; (2) LLMs perform well in subject knowledge and teaching skills but struggle with teachers' professional ethics and basic competencies; (3) LLMs excel at multiple-choice questions but perform poorly on subjective analysis and multi-modal tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of the proposed benchmark.   Our dataset is available at https://github.com/zhangpeii/Edu-Values.git.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12739v2,2024-09
MEXMA: Token-level objectives improve sentence representations,"João Maria Janeiro, Benjamin Piwowarski, Patrick Gallinari, Loïc Barrault","Current pre-trained cross-lingual sentence encoders approaches use sentence-level objectives only. This can lead to loss of information, especially for tokens, which then degrades the sentence representation. We propose MEXMA, a novel approach that integrates both sentence-level and token-level objectives. The sentence representation in one language is used to predict masked tokens in another language, with both the sentence representation and all tokens directly updating the encoder. We show that adding token-level objectives greatly improves the sentence representation quality across several tasks. Our approach outperforms current pre-trained cross-lingual sentence encoders on bi-text mining as well as several downstream tasks. We also analyse the information encoded in our tokens, and how the sentence representation is built from them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12737v1,2024-09
"LLM-Measure: Generating Valid, Consistent, and Reproducible Text-Based Measures for Social Science Research","Yi Yang, Hanyu Duan, Jiaxin Liu, Kar Yan Tam","The increasing use of text as data in social science research necessitates the development of valid, consistent, reproducible, and efficient methods for generating text-based concept measures. This paper presents a novel method that leverages the internal hidden states of large language models (LLMs) to generate these concept measures. Specifically, the proposed method learns a concept vector that captures how the LLM internally represents the target concept, then estimates the concept value for text data by projecting the text's LLM hidden states onto the concept vector. Three replication studies demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing highly valid, consistent, and reproducible text-based measures across various social science research contexts, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for the research community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12722v1,2024-09

This paper first presents an analysis of fine-tuned LLMs on Verilog coding, with synthetic data from prior methods. We identify two main issues: difficulties in handling non-textual representations (Karnaugh maps, state-transition diagrams and waveforms) and significant variability during training with models randomly making ""minor"" mistakes. To address these limitations, we enhance data curation by creating correct-by-construction data targeting non-textual representations. Additionally, we introduce an automated framework that generates error reports from various model checkpoints and injects these errors into open-source code to create targeted code repair data. Our fine-tuned Starcoder2-15B outperforms prior state-of-the-art results by 3.8%, 10.9%, 6.6% for pass@1 on VerilogEval-Machine, VerilogEval-Human, and RTLLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12993v1,2024-09
Exploring Large Language Models for Product Attribute Value Identification,"Kassem Sabeh, Mouna Kacimi, Johann Gamper, Robert Litschko, Barbara Plank","Product attribute value identification (PAVI) involves automatically identifying attributes and their values from product information, enabling features like product search, recommendation, and comparison. Existing methods primarily rely on fine-tuning pre-trained language models, such as BART and T5, which require extensive task-specific training data and struggle to generalize to new attributes. This paper explores large language models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and Mistral, as data-efficient and robust alternatives for PAVI. We propose various strategies: comparing one-step and two-step prompt-based approaches in zero-shot settings and utilizing parametric and non-parametric knowledge through in-context learning examples. We also introduce a dense demonstration retriever based on a pre-trained T5 model and perform instruction fine-tuning to explicitly train LLMs on task-specific instructions. Extensive experiments on two product benchmarks show that our two-step approach significantly improves performance in zero-shot settings, and instruction fine-tuning further boosts performance when using training data, demonstrating the practical benefits of using LLMs for PAVI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12695v1,2024-09
"Connecting Ideas in 'Lower-Resource' Scenarios: NLP for National Varieties, Creoles and Other Low-resource Scenarios","Aditya Joshi, Diptesh Kanojia, Heather Lent, Hour Kaing, Haiyue Song","Despite excellent results on benchmarks over a small subset of languages, large language models struggle to process text from languages situated in `lower-resource' scenarios such as dialects/sociolects (national or social varieties of a language), Creoles (languages arising from linguistic contact between multiple languages) and other low-resource languages. This introductory tutorial will identify common challenges, approaches, and themes in natural language processing (NLP) research for confronting and overcoming the obstacles inherent to data-poor contexts. By connecting past ideas to the present field, this tutorial aims to ignite collaboration and cross-pollination between researchers working in these scenarios.

"Exploring the topics, sentiments and hate speech in the Spanish information environment","ALEJANDRO BUITRAGO LOPEZ, Javier Pastor-Galindo, José Antonio Ruipérez-Valiente","In the digital era, the internet and social media have transformed communication but have also facilitated the spread of hate speech and disinformation, leading to radicalization, polarization, and toxicity. This is especially concerning for media outlets due to their significant role in shaping public discourse. This study examines the topics, sentiments, and hate prevalence in 337,807 response messages (website comments and tweets) to news from five Spanish media outlets (La Vanguardia, ABC, El Pa\'is, El Mundo, and 20 Minutos) in January 2021. These public reactions were originally labeled as distinct types of hate by experts following an original procedure, and they are now classified into three sentiment values (negative, neutral, or positive) and main topics. The BERTopic unsupervised framework was used to extract 81 topics, manually named with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs) and grouped into nine primary categories.   Results show social issues (22.22%), expressions and slang (20.35%), and political issues (11.80%) as the most discussed. Content is mainly negative (62.7%) and neutral (28.57%), with low positivity (8.73%). Toxic narratives relate to conversation expressions, gender, feminism, and COVID-19. Despite low levels of hate speech (3.98%), the study confirms high toxicity in online responses to social and political topics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12658v1,2024-09
Efficient Performance Tracking: Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Construction of Scientific Leaderboards,"Furkan Şahinuç, Thy Thy Tran, Yulia Grishina, Yufang Hou, Bei Chen, Iryna Gurevych","Scientific leaderboards are standardized ranking systems that facilitate evaluating and comparing competitive methods. Typically, a leaderboard is defined by a task, dataset, and evaluation metric (TDM) triple, allowing objective performance assessment and fostering innovation through benchmarking. However, the exponential increase in publications has made it infeasible to construct and maintain these leaderboards manually. Automatic leaderboard construction has emerged as a solution to reduce manual labor. Existing datasets for this task are based on the community-contributed leaderboards without additional curation. Our analysis shows that a large portion of these leaderboards are incomplete, and some of them contain incorrect information. In this work, we present SciLead, a manually-curated Scientific Leaderboard dataset that overcomes the aforementioned problems. Building on this dataset, we propose three experimental settings that simulate real-world scenarios where TDM triples are fully defined, partially defined, or undefined during leaderboard construction. While previous research has only explored the first setting, the latter two are more representative of real-world applications. To address these diverse settings, we develop a comprehensive LLM-based framework for constructing leaderboards. Our experiments and analysis reveal that various LLMs often correctly identify TDM triples while struggling to extract result values from publications. We make our code and data publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12656v1,2024-09

This evaluation is derived via a novel, unifying framework for evaluations over arbitrarily long contexts which measure the model's ability to do more than retrieve a single piece of information from its context. The central idea of the Latent Structure Queries framework (LSQ) is to construct tasks which require a model to ``chisel away'' the irrelevant information in the context, revealing a latent structure in the context. To verify a model's understanding of this latent structure, we query the model for details of the structure. Using LSQ, we produce three diagnostic long-context evaluations across code and natural-language domains intended to provide a stronger signal of long-context language model capabilities. We perform evaluations on several state-of-the-art models and demonstrate both that a) the proposed evaluations are high-signal and b) that there is significant room for improvement in synthesizing long-context information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12640v2,2024-09
DiSHA: Dimension-Sharding Adaptation with Fast Convergence and Fast Computation,Jiale Kang,"Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) leverages the low intrinsic rank of weight updates in Large Language Models (LLMs), establishing a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) paradigm. However, LoRA suffers from slow convergence. We introduce Dimension-Sharding Adaptation (DiSHA), which expands the PEFT design space to unlock lower intrinsic ranks and faster convergence by default. Within DiSHA's design space, we propose Block Affine Adaptation (Bone), a computationally efficient structure that delivers both high performance and efficiency. While certain DiSHA configurations may result in colinear updates to weight shards, we address this with Block Affine Transformation Adaptation (BAT), a nonlinear variant of DiSHA. BAT introduces nonlinearity by combining trainable matrices with original weight shards in a nonlinear manner, inducing nonlinearity in matrix updates without introducing additional parameters. Empirical results show that Bone, under the DiSHA framework, consistently outperforms LoRA variants in both NLG and NLU tasks, with significantly improved computational efficiency. Further analysis demonstrates that BAT enhances model capabilities by leveraging its nonlinear design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15371v6,2024-09
Enhancing TinyBERT for Financial Sentiment Analysis Using GPT-Augmented FinBERT Distillation,Graison Jos Thomas,"In the rapidly evolving field of financial sentiment analysis, the efficiency and accuracy of predictive models are critical due to their significant impact on financial markets. Transformer based models like BERT and large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, have advanced NLP tasks considerably. Despite their advantages, BERT-based models face challenges with computational intensity in edge computing environments, and the substantial size and compute requirements of LLMs limit their practical deployment. This study proposes leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, such as GPT-4 Omni, to create synthetic, domain-specific training data. This approach addresses the challenge of data scarcity and enhances the performance of smaller models by making them competitive with their larger counterparts. The research specifically aims to enhance FinBERT, a BERT model fine-tuned for financial sentiment analysis, and develop TinyFinBERT, a compact transformer model, through a structured, two-tiered knowledge distillation strategy. Using data augmented by GPT-4 Omni, which involves generating new training examples and transforming existing data, we significantly improved the accuracy of FinBERT, preparing it to serve as a teacher model. This enhanced FinBERT then distilled knowledge to TinyFinBERT, employing both GPT-4 Omni and GPT-3.5 Turbo augmented data. The distillation strategy incorporated both logit and intermediate layer distillation. The training and evaluation of TinyFinBERT utilized the PhraseBank dataset and the FiQA 2018 Task1 dataset, achieving performance comparable to FinBERT while being substantially smaller and more efficient. This research demonstrates how LLMs can effectively contribute to the advancement of financial sentiment analysis by enhancing the capabilities of smaller, more efficient models through innovative data augmentation and distillation techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18999v1,2024-09

Iteration of Thought: Leveraging Inner Dialogue for Autonomous Large Language Model Reasoning,"Santosh Kumar Radha, Yasamin Nouri Jelyani, Ara Ghukasyan, Oktay Goktas","Iterative human engagement is a common and effective means of leveraging the advanced language processing power of large language models (LLMs). Using well-structured prompts in a conversational manner, human users can effectively influence an LLM to develop more thoughtful and accurate responses. Motivated by this insight, we propose the Iteration of Thought (IoT) framework for enhancing LLM responses by generating ""thought""-provoking prompts vis a vis an input query and the current iteration of an LLM's response. Unlike static or semi-static approaches, e.g. Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), IoT adapts its reasoning path dynamically, based on evolving context, and without generating alternate explorative thoughts which are ultimately discarded. The three components of the IoT framework are (1) an Inner Dialogue Agent (IDA) responsible for generating instructive, context-specific prompts; (2) an LLM Agent (LLMA) that processes these prompts to refine its responses; and (3) an iterative prompting loop that implements a conversation between the former two components. We introduce two variants of our framework: Autonomous Iteration of Thought (AIoT), where an LLM decides when to stop iterating, and Guided Iteration of Thought (GIoT), which always forces a fixed number iterations. We investigate the performance of IoT across various datasets, spanning complex reasoning tasks from the GPQA dataset, explorative problem-solving in Game of 24, puzzle solving in Mini Crosswords, and multi-hop question answering from the HotpotQA dataset. Our results show that IoT represents a viable paradigm for autonomous response refinement in LLMs, showcasing significant improvements over CoT and thereby enabling more adaptive and efficient reasoning systems that minimize human intervention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12618v2,2024-09

Our methods involve two forms of rationale generation--information extraction and informed reasoning--to enrich the ANLI dataset. We then fine-tune T5-Small on these augmented datasets, evaluating its performance against an established benchmark. Our findings reveal that the incorporation of synthetic rationales significantly improves the model's ability to comprehend natural language, leading to 1.3\% and 2.3\% higher classification accuracy, respectively, on the ANLI dataset, demonstrating the potential of leveraging LLMs for dataset augmentation. This approach not only enhances the performance of smaller models on complex tasks but also introduces a cost-effective method for fine-tuning smaller language models.

Efficient Knowledge Distillation: Empowering Small Language Models with Teacher Model Insights,"Mohamad Ballout, Ulf Krumnack, Gunther Heidemann, Kai-Uwe Kühnberger","Enhancing small language models for real-life application deployment is a significant challenge facing the research community. Due to the difficulties and costs of using large language models, researchers are seeking ways to effectively deploy task-specific small models. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective knowledge distillation method to improve the performance of small language models. Our approach utilizes a teacher model with approximately 3 billion parameters to identify the most influential tokens in its decision-making process. These tokens are extracted from the input based on their attribution scores relative to the output, using methods like saliency maps. These important tokens are then provided as rationales to a student model, aiming to distill the knowledge of the teacher model. This method has proven to be effective, as demonstrated by testing it on four diverse datasets, where it shows improvement over both standard fine-tuning methods and state-of-the-art knowledge distillation models. Furthermore, we explore explanations of the success of the model by analyzing the important tokens extracted from the teacher model. Our findings reveal that in 68\% of cases, specifically in datasets where labels are part of the answer, such as multiple-choice questions, the extracted tokens are part of the ground truth.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12586v1,2024-09
RAD-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models Capabilities in Retrieval Augmented Dialogues,"Tzu-Lin Kuo, Feng-Ting Liao, Mu-Wei Hsieh, Fu-Chieh Chang, Po-Chun Hsu, Da-Shan Shiu","In real-world applications with Large Language Models (LLMs), external retrieval mechanisms - such as Search-Augmented Generation (SAG), tool utilization, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - are often employed to enhance the quality of augmented generations in dialogues. These approaches often come with multi-turn dialogue, where each interaction is enriched by relevant information retrieved from external sources. Existing benchmarks either assess LLMs' chat abilities in multi-turn dialogues or their use of retrieval for augmented responses in single-turn settings. However, there is a gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to leverage retrieval for more precise responses across multiple turns. To address this limitation, we introduce RAD-Bench (Retrieval Augmented Dialogue), a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in multi-turn dialogues following retrievals, essential for their deployment in context-rich applications. RAD-Bench evaluates two key abilities of LLMs: Retrieval Synthesis and Retrieval Reasoning. These are measured using discriminative questions and retrieved contexts, and corresponding reference answers, assessing how effectively LLMs integrate and reason with context to maintain and enhance conversation quality over multiple turns. Our evaluation results on commonly used LLMs reveal that model performance deteriorates as additional layers of conditions or constraints are applied across conversation turns, even when accurate retrieved contexts are provided.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12558v1,2024-09
Enhancing Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models through Efficient Multi-Modal Distribution Alignment,"Tianyu Peng, Jiajun Zhang","Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression method that can transfer the internal capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to smaller ones. However, the multi-modal probability distribution predicted by teacher LLMs causes difficulties for student models to learn. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of multi-modal distribution alignment with experiments and then highlight the inefficiency of existing KD approaches in learning multi-modal distributions. To address this problem, we propose Ranking Loss based Knowledge Distillation (RLKD), which encourages the consistency of the ranking of peak predictions between the teacher and student models. By incorporating word-level ranking loss, we ensure excellent compatibility with existing distillation objectives while fully leveraging the fine-grained information between different categories in peaks of two predicted distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables the student model to better learn the multi-modal distributions of the teacher model, leading to a significant performance improvement in various downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12545v2,2024-09
Profiling Patient Transcript Using Large Language Model Reasoning Augmentation for Alzheimer's Disease Detection,"Chin-Po Chen, Jeng-Lin Li","Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the predominant cause of dementia, characterized by a gradual decline in speech and language capabilities. Recent deep-learning advancements have facilitated automated AD detection through spontaneous speech. However, common transcript-based detection methods directly model text patterns in each utterance without a global view of the patient's linguistic characteristics, resulting in limited discriminability and interpretability. Despite the enhanced reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there remains a gap in fully harnessing the reasoning ability to facilitate AD detection and model interpretation. Therefore, we propose a patient-level transcript profiling framework leveraging LLM-based reasoning augmentation to systematically elicit linguistic deficit attributes. The summarized embeddings of the attributes are integrated into an Albert model for AD detection. The framework achieves 8.51\% ACC and 8.34\% F1 improvements on the ADReSS dataset compared to the baseline without reasoning augmentation. Our further analysis shows the effectiveness of our identified linguistic deficit attributes and the potential to use LLM for AD detection interpretation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12541v1,2024-09
Should RAG Chatbots Forget Unimportant Conversations? Exploring Importance and Forgetting with Psychological Insights,"Ryuichi Sumida, Koji Inoue, Tatsuya Kawahara","While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing long-term conversations, the increasing memory load as conversations progress degrades retrieval accuracy. Drawing on psychological insights, we propose LUFY, a simple yet effective method that focuses on emotionally arousing memories and retains less than 10% of the conversation. In the user experiment, participants interacted with three types of RAG chatbots, each for 2 hours over 4 sessions, marking the most extensive assessment of a chatbot's long-term capabilities to date -- more than four times longer than any existing benchmark. The results demonstrate that prioritizing arousing memories while forgetting the majority of the conversation significantly enhances user experience. This study pushes the frontier of long-term conversations and highlights the importance of forgetting unimportant parts of conversations.

Exploring and Enhancing the Transfer of Distribution in Knowledge Distillation for Autoregressive Language Models,"Jun Rao, Xuebo Liu, Zepeng Lin, Liang Ding, Jing Li, Dacheng Tao, Min Zhang","Knowledge distillation (KD) is a technique that compresses large teacher models by training smaller student models to mimic them. The success of KD in auto-regressive language models mainly relies on Reverse KL for mode-seeking and student-generated output (SGO) to combat exposure bias. Our theoretical analyses and experimental validation reveal that while Reverse KL effectively mimics certain features of the teacher distribution, it fails to capture most of its behaviors. Conversely, SGO incurs higher computational costs and presents challenges in optimization, particularly when the student model is significantly smaller than the teacher model. These constraints are primarily due to the immutable distribution of the teacher model, which fails to adjust adaptively to models of varying sizes. We introduce Online Knowledge Distillation (OKD), where the teacher network integrates small online modules to concurrently train with the student model. This strategy abolishes the necessity for on-policy sampling and merely requires minimal updates to the parameters of the teacher's online module during training, thereby allowing dynamic adaptation to the student's distribution to make distillation better. Extensive results across multiple generation datasets show that OKD achieves or exceeds the performance of leading methods in various model architectures and sizes, reducing training time by up to fourfold.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12512v2,2024-09
A Case Study of Web App Coding with OpenAI Reasoning Models,Yi Cui,"This paper presents a case study of coding tasks by the latest reasoning models of OpenAI, i.e. o1-preview and o1-mini, in comparison with other frontier models. The o1 models deliver SOTA results for WebApp1K, a single-task benchmark. To this end, we introduce WebApp1K-Duo, a harder benchmark doubling number of tasks and test cases. The new benchmark causes the o1 model performances to decline significantly, falling behind Claude 3.5. Moreover, they consistently fail when confronted with atypical yet correct test cases, a trap non-reasoning models occasionally avoid. We hypothesize that the performance variability is due to instruction comprehension. Specifically, the reasoning mechanism boosts performance when all expectations are captured, meanwhile exacerbates errors when key expectations are missed, potentially impacted by input lengths. As such, we argue that the coding success of reasoning models hinges on the top-notch base model and SFT to ensure meticulous adherence to instructions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13773v1,2024-09
"PropaInsight: Toward Deeper Understanding of Propaganda in Terms of Techniques, Appeals, and Intent","Jiateng Liu, Lin Ai, Zizhou Liu, Payam Karisani, Zheng Hui, May Fung, Preslav Nakov, Julia Hirschberg, Heng Ji","Propaganda plays a critical role in shaping public opinion and fueling disinformation. While existing research primarily focuses on identifying propaganda techniques, it lacks the ability to capture the broader motives and the impacts of such content. To address these challenges, we introduce propainsight, a conceptual framework grounded in foundational social science research, which systematically dissects propaganda into techniques, arousal appeals, and underlying intent. propainsight offers a more granular understanding of how propaganda operates across different contexts. Additionally, we present propagaze, a novel dataset that combines human-annotated data with high-quality synthetic data generated through a meticulously designed pipeline. Our experiments show that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle with propaganda analysis, but training with propagaze significantly improves performance. Fine-tuned Llama-7B-Chat achieves 203.4% higher text span IoU in technique identification and 66.2% higher BertScore in appeal analysis compared to 1-shot GPT-4-Turbo. Moreover, propagaze complements limited human-annotated data in data-sparse and cross-domain scenarios, showing its potential for comprehensive and generalizable propaganda analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18997v1,2024-09

CritiPrefill: A Segment-wise Criticality-based Approach for Prefilling Acceleration in LLMs,"Junlin Lv, Yuan Feng, Xike Xie, Xin Jia, Qirong Peng, Guiming Xie","Large language models have achieved notable success across various domains, yet efficient inference is still limited by the quadratic computation complexity of the attention mechanism. The inference consists of prefilling and decoding phases. Although several attempts have been made to accelerate decoding, the inefficiency of the prefilling phase, especially for long-context tasks, remains a challenge. In this paper, we observe a locality in query criticality during the prefilling phase of long-context processing: adjacent query tokens tend to focus on similar subsets of the past Key-Value (KV) cache. Based on this observation, we propose CritiPrefill, a criticality-based segment-wise prefilling method. This method partitions the input sequence's queries and KV cache into segments and blocks, utilizing a segment-wise algorithm to estimate the query criticality. By pruning non-critical computations between query segments and cache blocks in the self-attention mechanism, the prefilling process can be significantly accelerated. Extensive evaluations on multiple long-context datasets show up to 2.7x speedup on Llama3-8B and 3.0x speedup on Yi-9B for 128K context length on a single A100 GPU, with minimal quality degradation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12490v2,2024-09
AutoMode-ASR: Learning to Select ASR Systems for Better Quality and Cost,"Ahmet Gündüz, Yunsu Kim, Kamer Ali Yuksel, Mohamed Al-Badrashiny, Thiago Castro Ferreira, Hassan Sawaf","We present AutoMode-ASR, a novel framework that effectively integrates multiple ASR systems to enhance the overall transcription quality while optimizing cost. The idea is to train a decision model to select the optimal ASR system for each segment based solely on the audio input before running the systems. We achieve this by ensembling binary classifiers determining the preference between two systems. These classifiers are equipped with various features, such as audio embeddings, quality estimation, and signal properties. Additionally, we demonstrate how using a quality estimator can further improve performance with minimal cost increase. Experimental results show a relative reduction in WER of 16.2%, a cost saving of 65%, and a speed improvement of 75%, compared to using a single-best model for all segments. Our framework is compatible with commercial and open-source black-box ASR systems as it does not require changes in model codes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12476v1,2024-09
Familiarity-Aware Evidence Compression for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Dongwon Jung, Qin Liu, Tenghao Huang, Ben Zhou, Muhao Chen","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge through evidence retrieved from external sources. However, it often struggles to cope with inconsistent and irrelevant information that can distract the LM from its tasks, especially when multiple evidence pieces are required. While compressing the retrieved evidence with a compression model aims to address this issue, the compressed evidence may still be unfamiliar to the target model used for downstream tasks, potentially failing to utilize the evidence effectively. We propose FaviComp (Familarity-Aware Evidence Compression), a novel training-free evidence compression technique that makes retrieved evidence more familiar to the target model, while seamlessly integrating parametric knowledge from the model. Experimental results show that FaviComp consistently outperforms most recent evidence compression baselines across multiple open-domain QA datasets, improving accuracy by up to 28.1% while achieving high compression rates. Additionally, we demonstrate the effective integration of both parametric and non-parametric knowledge during evidence compression.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12468v2,2024-09
Unlocking Reasoning Potential in Large Langauge Models by Scaling Code-form Planning,"Jiaxin Wen, Jian Guan, Hongning Wang, Wei Wu, Minlie Huang","Despite the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) on traditional natural language processing tasks, their planning ability remains a critical bottleneck in tackling complex multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing approaches mainly rely on prompting or task-specific fine-tuning, often suffering from poor robustness and cross-task generalization. To address the limitation, we introduce CodePlan, a scalable framework that empowers LLMs to generate and follow \textit{code-form plans} -- pseudocode that outlines high-level, structured reasoning processes. By leveraging the structured and versatile nature of code, CodePlan effectively captures the rich semantics and control flows inherent to sophisticated reasoning tasks. Importantly, CodePlan allows automatic extraction of code-form plans from massive, wide-ranging text corpora without the need for curated, task-specific datasets. This enables it to scale up efficiently and improve LLM's reasoning capabilities across diverse scenarios. To train CodePlan, we construct a large-scale dataset of 2M examples that integrate code-form plans with standard prompt-response pairs from existing corpora. With minimal computation overhead during both training and inference, CodePlan achieves a 25.1\% relative improvement compared with directly generating responses, averaged across 13 challenging multi-step reasoning benchmarks, spanning mathematical reasoning, symbolic reasoning, instruction-following, multi-hop QA, and decision-making tasks. Further analysis reveals CodePlan's increasing performance gains on more complex reasoning tasks, as well as significant data efficiency thanks to its generalization ability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12452v2,2024-09
Incremental and Data-Efficient Concept Formation to Support Masked Word Prediction,"Xin Lian, Nishant Baglodi, Christopher J. MacLellan","This paper introduces Cobweb4L, a novel approach for efficient language model learning that supports masked word prediction. The approach builds on Cobweb, an incremental system that learns a hierarchy of probabilistic concepts. Each concept stores the frequencies of words that appear in instances tagged with that concept label. The system utilizes an attribute value representation to encode words and their surrounding context into instances. Cobweb4L uses the information theoretic variant of category utility and a new performance mechanism that leverages multiple concepts to generate predictions. We demonstrate that with these extensions it significantly outperforms prior Cobweb performance mechanisms that use only a single node to generate predictions. Further, we demonstrate that Cobweb4L learns rapidly and achieves performance comparable to and even superior to Word2Vec. Next, we show that Cobweb4L and Word2Vec outperform BERT in the same task with less training data. Finally, we discuss future work to make our conclusions more robust and inclusive.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12440v1,2024-09

Our extensive experiments, conducted on two established natural language reasoning tasks -- inductive reasoning and spatial reasoning -- demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic graph-based reasoning data effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning performance without compromising their effectiveness on other standard evaluation benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12437v2,2024-09
Linguistic Minimal Pairs Elicit Linguistic Similarity in Large Language Models,"Xinyu Zhou, Delong Chen, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Xufeng Duan, Zhenguang G. Cai","We introduce a novel analysis that leverages linguistic minimal pairs to probe the internal linguistic representations of Large Language Models (LLMs). By measuring the similarity between LLM activation differences across minimal pairs, we quantify the and gain insight into the linguistic knowledge captured by LLMs. Our large-scale experiments, spanning 100+ LLMs and 150k minimal pairs in three languages, reveal properties of linguistic similarity from four key aspects: consistency across LLMs, relation to theoretical categorizations, dependency to semantic context, and cross-lingual alignment of relevant phenomena. Our findings suggest that 1) linguistic similarity is significantly influenced by training data exposure, leading to higher cross-LLM agreement in higher-resource languages. 2) Linguistic similarity strongly aligns with fine-grained theoretical linguistic categories but weakly with broader ones. 3) Linguistic similarity shows a weak correlation with semantic similarity, showing its context-dependent nature. 4) LLMs exhibit limited cross-lingual alignment in their understanding of relevant linguistic phenomena. This work demonstrates the potential of minimal pairs as a window into the neural representations of language in LLMs, shedding light on the relationship between LLMs and linguistic theory.

Zero-to-Strong Generalization: Eliciting Strong Capabilities of Large Language Models Iteratively without Gold Labels,"Chaoqun Liu, Qin Chao, Wenxuan Zhang, Xiaobao Wu, Boyang Li, Anh Tuan Luu, Lidong Bing","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance through supervised fine-tuning or in-context learning using gold labels. However, this paradigm is limited by the availability of gold labels, while in certain scenarios, LLMs may need to perform tasks that are too complex for humans to provide such labels. To tackle this challenge, this study explores whether solely utilizing unlabeled data can elicit strong model capabilities. We propose a new paradigm termed zero-to-strong generalization. We iteratively prompt LLMs to annotate unlabeled data and retain high-quality labels by filtering. Surprisingly, we obverse that this iterative process gradually unlocks LLMs' potential on downstream tasks. Our experiments on extensive classification and reasoning tasks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our analysis indicates that this paradigm is effective for both in-context learning and fine-tuning, and for various model sizes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12425v1,2024-09

Mutual Information-based Representations Disentanglement for Unaligned Multimodal Language Sequences,"Fan Qian, Jiqing Han, Jianchen Li, Yongjun He, Tieran Zheng, Guibin Zheng","The key challenge in unaligned multimodal language sequences lies in effectively integrating information from various modalities to obtain a refined multimodal joint representation. Recently, the disentangle and fuse methods have achieved the promising performance by explicitly learning modality-agnostic and modality-specific representations and then fusing them into a multimodal joint representation. However, these methods often independently learn modality-agnostic representations for each modality and utilize orthogonal constraints to reduce linear correlations between modality-agnostic and modality-specific representations, neglecting to eliminate their nonlinear correlations. As a result, the obtained multimodal joint representation usually suffers from information redundancy, leading to overfitting and poor generalization of the models. In this paper, we propose a Mutual Information-based Representations Disentanglement (MIRD) method for unaligned multimodal language sequences, in which a novel disentanglement framework is designed to jointly learn a single modality-agnostic representation. In addition, the mutual information minimization constraint is employed to ensure superior disentanglement of representations, thereby eliminating information redundancy within the multimodal joint representation. Furthermore, the challenge of estimating mutual information caused by the limited labeled data is mitigated by introducing unlabeled data. Meanwhile, the unlabeled data also help to characterize the underlying structure of multimodal data, consequently further preventing overfitting and enhancing the performance of the models. Experimental results on several widely used benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12408v1,2024-09

Further optimization can be achieved through preference alignment algorithms, which adjust LMs to align with the preferences of reward models, enhancing the desirability of the generated content. This study presents a thorough empirical evaluation of how preference alignment algorithms, particularly Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enhance LM-based TTS. With a 1.15B parameter LM-based TTS model, we demonstrate that preference alignment consistently improves intelligibility, speaker similarity, and proxy subjective evaluation scores, with the latter two metrics surpassing even human speech in certain evaluations.

Small Language Models are Equation Reasoners,"Bumjun Kim, Kunha Lee, Juyeon Kim, Sangam Lee","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled Large Language Model (LLM) to achieve remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including arithmetic problem-solving. However, this success does not generalize to small language model (sLM) like T5, due to their limited capacity and absence of emergent abilities associated with larger models. Recent works to enhance sLM through knowledge distillation have yielded some improvements but still face significant limitations, particularly high ambiguity from the variability in natural language expressions and substantial computational costs. In this paper, we investigate why sLM perform poorly on arithmetic reasoning tasks and hypothesize that natural language format variability introduces high ambiguity for these smaller models. Based on this hypothesis, we conduct experiments with equation-only format, which is a reasoning format that unifies arithmetic reasoning previously expressed in natural language formats into mathematical equations. Experiment results demonstrate that equation-only format effectively boosts the arithmetic reasoning abilities of sLM, especially in very small models like T5-Tiny.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12393v1,2024-09
Channel-Aware Domain-Adaptive Generative Adversarial Network for Robust Speech Recognition,"Chien-Chun Wang, Li-Wei Chen, Cheng-Kang Chou, Hung-Shin Lee, Berlin Chen, Hsin-Min Wang","While pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems demonstrate impressive performance on matched domains, their performance often degrades when confronted with channel mismatch stemming from unseen recording environments and conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel channel-aware data simulation method for robust ASR training. Our method harnesses the synergistic power of channel-extractive techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first train a channel encoder capable of extracting embeddings from arbitrary audio. On top of this, channel embeddings are extracted using a minimal amount of target-domain data and used to guide a GAN-based speech synthesizer. This synthesizer generates speech that faithfully preserves the phonetic content of the input while mimicking the channel characteristics of the target domain. We evaluate our method on the challenging Hakka Across Taiwan (HAT) and Taiwanese Across Taiwan (TAT) corpora, achieving relative character error rate (CER) reductions of 20.02% and 9.64%, respectively, compared to the baselines. These results highlight the efficacy of our channel-aware data simulation method for bridging the gap between source- and target-domain acoustics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12386v2,2024-09

In this paper, we introduce EVA, leveraging the mixture-of-Experts for audioVisual ASR to perform robust speech recognition for ``in-the-wild'' videos. Specifically, we first encode visual information into visual tokens sequence and map them into speech space by a lightweight projection. Then, we build EVA upon a robust pretrained speech recognition model, ensuring its generalization ability. Moreover, to incorporate visual information effectively, we inject visual information into the ASR model through a mixture-of-experts module.

"RAG-Modulo: Solving Sequential Tasks using Experience, Critics, and Language Models","Abhinav Jain, Chris Jermaine, Vaibhav Unhelkar","Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for solving challenging robotic tasks, even in the presence of action and observation uncertainties. Recent LLM-based decision-making methods (also referred to as LLM-based agents), when paired with appropriate critics, have demonstrated potential in solving complex, long-horizon tasks with relatively few interactions. However, most existing LLM-based agents lack the ability to retain and learn from past interactions - an essential trait of learning-based robotic systems. We propose RAG-Modulo, a framework that enhances LLM-based agents with a memory of past interactions and incorporates critics to evaluate the agents' decisions. The memory component allows the agent to automatically retrieve and incorporate relevant past experiences as in-context examples, providing context-aware feedback for more informed decision-making. Further by updating its memory, the agent improves its performance over time, thereby exhibiting learning. Through experiments in the challenging BabyAI and AlfWorld domains, we demonstrate significant improvements in task success rates and efficiency, showing that the proposed RAG-Modulo framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12294v1,2024-09

Making Large Language Models into World Models with Precondition and Effect Knowledge,"Kaige Xie, Ian Yang, John Gunerli, Mark Riedl","World models, which encapsulate the dynamics of how actions affect environments, are foundational to the functioning of intelligent agents. In this work, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to operate as world models. Although LLMs are not inherently designed to model real-world dynamics, we show that they can be induced to perform two critical world model functions: determining the applicability of an action based on a given world state, and predicting the resulting world state upon action execution. This is achieved by fine-tuning two separate LLMs-one for precondition prediction and another for effect prediction-while leveraging synthetic data generation techniques. Through human-participant studies, we validate that the precondition and effect knowledge generated by our models aligns with human understanding of world dynamics. We also analyze the extent to which the world model trained on our synthetic data results in an inferred state space that supports the creation of action chains, a necessary property for planning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12278v2,2024-09
Systematic Characterization of the Effectiveness of Alignment in Large Language Models for Categorical Decisions,Isaac Kohane,"As large language models (LLMs) are deployed in high-stakes domains like healthcare, understanding how well their decision-making aligns with human preferences and values becomes crucial, especially when we recognize that there is no single gold standard for these preferences. This paper applies a systematic methodology for evaluating preference alignment in LLMs on categorical decision-making with medical triage as a domain-specific use case. It also measures how effectively an alignment procedure will change the alignment of a specific model. Key to this methodology is a novel simple measure, the Alignment Compliance Index (ACI), that quantifies how effectively a LLM can be aligned to a given preference function or gold standard. Since the ACI measures the effect rather than the process of alignment, it is applicable to alignment methods beyond the in-context learning used in this study.   Using a dataset of simulated patient pairs, three frontier LLMs (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini Advanced) were assessed on their ability to make triage decisions consistent with an expert clinician's preferences. The models' performance before and after alignment attempts was evaluated using various prompting strategies. The results reveal significant variability in alignment effectiveness across models and alignment approaches. Notably, models that performed well, as measured by ACI, pre-alignment sometimes degraded post-alignment, and small changes in the target preference function led to large shifts in model rankings. The implicit ethical principles, as understood by humans, underlying the LLMs' decisions were also explored through targeted questioning.   This study motivates the use of a practical set of methods and the ACI, in the near term, to understand the correspondence between the variety of human and LLM decision-making values in categorical decision-making such as triage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18995v1,2024-09
MQA-KEAL: Multi-hop Question Answering under Knowledge Editing for Arabic Language,"Muhammad Asif Ali, Nawal Daftardar, Mutayyaba Waheed, Jianbin Qin, Di Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities across numerous application domains. A key challenge is to keep these models updated with latest available information, which limits the true potential of these models for the end-applications. Although, there have been numerous attempts for LLMs Knowledge Editing (KE), i.e., to edit the LLMs prior knowledge and in turn test it via Multi-hop Question Answering (MQA), yet so far these studies are primarily focused on English language. To bridge this gap, in this paper we propose: Multi-hop Questioning Answering under Knowledge Editing for Arabic Language (MQA-KEAL). MQA-KEAL stores knowledge edits as structured knowledge units in the external memory. In order to solve multi-hop question, it first uses task-decomposition to decompose the question into smaller sub-problems. Later for each sub-problem, it iteratively queries the external memory and/or target LLM in order to generate the final response. In addition, we also contribute MQUAKE-AR (Arabic translation of English benchmark MQUAKE), as well as a new benchmark MQA-AEVAL for rigorous performance evaluation of MQA under KE for Arabic language.

Fine-Tuning a Time Series Foundation Model with Wasserstein Loss,Andrei Chernov,"Inspired by recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) for Natural Language Processing (NLP), there has been a surge in research focused on developing foundational models for time series forecasting. One approach involves training LLM architectures on tokenized time series data using cross-entropy loss. Although this method has demonstrated promising results, cross-entropy loss is primarily designed for classification tasks and does not account for the distance between classes. To address this limitation, we propose using the Wasserstein loss for such architectures. To validate our approach, we fine-tuned a foundational time series model on $22$ zero-shot datasets, comparing the performance of cross-entropy loss with that of Wasserstein loss.

First, via a substantial corpus of 51,278 interview questions sourced from 888 YouTube videos of mock interviews of Indian civil service candidates, we demonstrate stark gender bias in the broad nature of questions asked to male and female candidates. Second, our experiments with large language models show a strong presence of gender bias in explanations provided by the LLMs on the gender inference task. Finally, we present a novel dataset of 51,278 interview questions that can inform future social science studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12194v3,2024-09
Qwen2-VL: Enhancing Vision-Language Model's Perception of the World at Any Resolution,"Peng Wang, Shuai Bai, Sinan Tan, Shijie Wang, Zhihao Fan, Jinze Bai, Keqin Chen, Xuejing Liu, Jialin Wang, Wenbin Ge, Yang Fan, Kai Dang, Mengfei Du, Xuancheng Ren, Rui Men, Dayiheng Liu, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin","We present the Qwen2-VL Series, an advanced upgrade of the previous Qwen-VL models that redefines the conventional predetermined-resolution approach in visual processing. Qwen2-VL introduces the Naive Dynamic Resolution mechanism, which enables the model to dynamically process images of varying resolutions into different numbers of visual tokens. This approach allows the model to generate more efficient and accurate visual representations, closely aligning with human perceptual processes. The model also integrates Multimodal Rotary Position Embedding (M-RoPE), facilitating the effective fusion of positional information across text, images, and videos. We employ a unified paradigm for processing both images and videos, enhancing the model's visual perception capabilities. To explore the potential of large multimodal models, Qwen2-VL investigates the scaling laws for large vision-language models (LVLMs). By scaling both the model size-with versions at 2B, 8B, and 72B parameters-and the amount of training data, the Qwen2-VL Series achieves highly competitive performance. Notably, the Qwen2-VL-72B model achieves results comparable to leading models such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5-Sonnet across various multimodal benchmarks, outperforming other generalist models.

ARTICLE: Annotator Reliability Through In-Context Learning,"Sujan Dutta, Deepak Pandita, Tharindu Cyril Weerasooriya, Marcos Zampieri, Christopher M. Homan, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh","Ensuring annotator quality in training and evaluation data is a key piece of machine learning in NLP. Tasks such as sentiment analysis and offensive speech detection are intrinsically subjective, creating a challenging scenario for traditional quality assessment approaches because it is hard to distinguish disagreement due to poor work from that due to differences of opinions between sincere annotators. With the goal of increasing diverse perspectives in annotation while ensuring consistency, we propose \texttt{ARTICLE}, an in-context learning (ICL) framework to estimate annotation quality through self-consistency. We evaluate this framework on two offensive speech datasets using multiple LLMs and compare its performance with traditional methods. Our findings indicate that \texttt{ARTICLE} can be used as a robust method for identifying reliable annotators, hence improving data quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12218v2,2024-09

This series includes six models: Qwen2.5-Coder-(0.5B/1.5B/3B/7B/14B/32B). As a code-specific model, Qwen2.5-Coder is built upon the Qwen2.5 architecture and continues pretrained on a vast corpus of over 5.5 trillion tokens. Through meticulous data cleaning, scalable synthetic data generation, and balanced data mixing, Qwen2.5-Coder demonstrates impressive code generation capabilities while retaining general and math skills. These models have been evaluated on a wide range of code-related tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across more than 10 benchmarks, including code generation, completion, reasoning, and repair, consistently outperforming larger models of the same model size.

To CoT or not to CoT? Chain-of-thought helps mainly on math and symbolic reasoning,"Zayne Sprague, Fangcong Yin, Juan Diego Rodriguez, Dongwei Jiang, Manya Wadhwa, Prasann Singhal, Xinyu Zhao, Xi Ye, Kyle Mahowald, Greg Durrett","Chain-of-thought (CoT) via prompting is the de facto method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). But for what kinds of tasks is this extra ``thinking'' really helpful? To analyze this, we conducted a quantitative meta-analysis covering over 100 papers using CoT and ran our own evaluations of 20 datasets across 14 models. Our results show that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. Following this finding, we analyze the behavior of CoT on these problems by separating planning and execution and comparing against tool-augmented LLMs. Much of CoT's gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but it underperforms relative to using a symbolic solver. Our results indicate that CoT can be applied selectively, maintaining performance while saving inference costs. Furthermore, they suggest a need to move beyond prompt-based CoT to new paradigms that better leverage intermediate computation across the whole range of LLM applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12183v2,2024-09
A Controlled Study on Long Context Extension and Generalization in LLMs,"Yi Lu, Jing Nathan Yan, Songlin Yang, Justin T. Chiu, Siyu Ren, Fei Yuan, Wenting Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Alexander M. Rush","Broad textual understanding and in-context learning require language models that utilize full document contexts. Due to the implementation challenges associated with directly training long-context models, many methods have been proposed for extending models to handle long contexts. However, owing to differences in data and model classes, it has been challenging to compare these approaches, leading to uncertainty as to how to evaluate long-context performance and whether it differs from standard evaluation. We implement a controlled protocol for extension methods with a standardized evaluation, utilizing consistent base models and extension data. Our study yields several insights into long-context behavior. First, we reaffirm the critical role of perplexity as a general-purpose performance indicator even in longer-context tasks. Second, we find that current approximate attention methods systematically underperform across long-context tasks. Finally, we confirm that exact fine-tuning based methods are generally effective within the range of their extension, whereas extrapolation remains challenging. All codebases, models, and checkpoints will be made available open-source, promoting transparency and facilitating further research in this critical area of AI development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12181v2,2024-09
Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty,"Arslan Chaudhry, Sridhar Thiagarajan, Dilan Gorur","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate information that conflicts with real-world facts, and their persuasive style can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result, end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore supervised finetuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and then fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and supervised finetuning based on the model's own confidence leads to well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim answers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12180v1,2024-09
You Only Read Once (YORO): Learning to Internalize Database Knowledge for Text-to-SQL,"Hideo Kobayashi, Wuwei Lan, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Jiang Guo, Henghui Zhu, Zhiguo Wang, Patrick Ng","While significant progress has been made on the text-to-SQL task, recent solutions repeatedly encode the same database schema for every question, resulting in unnecessary high inference cost and often overlooking crucial database knowledge. To address these issues, we propose You Only Read Once (YORO), a novel paradigm that directly internalizes database knowledge into the parametric knowledge of a text-to-SQL model during training and eliminates the need for schema encoding during inference. YORO significantly reduces the input token length by 66%-98%. Despite its shorter inputs, our empirical results demonstrate YORO's competitive performances with traditional systems on three benchmarks as well as its significant outperformance on large databases. Furthermore, YORO excels in handling questions with challenging value retrievals such as abbreviation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12172v1,2024-09
"MAgICoRe: Multi-Agent, Iterative, Coarse-to-Fine Refinement for Reasoning","Justin Chih-Yao Chen, Archiki Prasad, Swarnadeep Saha, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal","Large Language Models' (LLM) reasoning can be improved using test-time aggregation strategies, i.e., generating multiple samples and voting among generated samples. While these improve performance, they often reach a saturation point. Refinement offers an alternative by using LLM-generated feedback to improve solution quality. However, refinement introduces 3 key challenges: (1) Excessive refinement: Uniformly refining all instances can over-correct and reduce the overall performance. (2) Inability to localize and address errors: LLMs have a limited ability to self-correct and struggle to identify and correct their own mistakes. (3) Insufficient refinement: Deciding how many iterations of refinement are needed is non-trivial, and stopping too soon could leave errors unaddressed. To tackle these issues, we propose MAgICoRe, which avoids excessive refinement by categorizing problem difficulty as easy or hard, solving easy problems with coarse-grained aggregation and hard ones with fine-grained and iterative multi-agent refinement. To improve error localization, we incorporate external step-wise reward model (RM) scores. Moreover, to ensure effective refinement, we employ a multi-agent loop with three agents: Solver, Reviewer (which generates targeted feedback based on step-wise RM scores), and the Refiner (which incorporates feedback). To ensure sufficient refinement, we re-evaluate updated solutions, iteratively initiating further rounds of refinement. We evaluate MAgICoRe on Llama-3-8B and GPT-3.5 and show its effectiveness across 5 math datasets. Even one iteration of MAgICoRe beats Self-Consistency by 3.4%, Best-of-k by 3.2%, and Self-Refine by 4.0% while using less than half the samples. Unlike iterative refinement with baselines, MAgICoRe continues to improve with more iterations. Finally, our ablations highlight the importance of MAgICoRe's RMs and multi-agent communication.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12147v1,2024-09

However, sparse computation challenges traditional training practices, as discrete expert routing hinders standard backpropagation and thus gradient-based optimization, which are the cornerstone of deep learning. To better pursue the scaling power of MoE, we introduce GRIN (GRadient-INformed MoE training), which incorporates sparse gradient estimation for expert routing and configures model parallelism to avoid token dropping. Applying GRIN to autoregressive language modeling, we develop a top-2 16$\times$3.8B MoE model. Our model, with only 6.6B activated parameters, outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model trained on the same data. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks demonstrate the potential of GRIN to significantly enhance MoE efficacy, achieving 79.4 on MMLU, 83.7 on HellaSwag, 74.4 on HumanEval, and 58.9 on MATH.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12136v1,2024-09
BERT-VBD: Vietnamese Multi-Document Summarization Framework,"Tuan-Cuong Vuong, Trang Mai Xuan, Thien Van Luong","In tackling the challenge of Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), numerous methods have been proposed, spanning both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. However, each approach has its own limitations, making it less effective to rely solely on either one. An emerging and promising strategy involves a synergistic fusion of extractive and abstractive summarization methods. Despite the plethora of studies in this domain, research on the combined methodology remains scarce, particularly in the context of Vietnamese language processing. This paper presents a novel Vietnamese MDS framework leveraging a two-component pipeline architecture that integrates extractive and abstractive techniques. The first component employs an extractive approach to identify key sentences within each document. This is achieved by a modification of the pre-trained BERT network, which derives semantically meaningful phrase embeddings using siamese and triplet network structures. The second component utilizes the VBD-LLaMA2-7B-50b model for abstractive summarization, ultimately generating the final summary document. Our proposed framework demonstrates a positive performance, attaining ROUGE-2 scores of 39.6% on the VN-MDS dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12134v1,2024-09

To attain high accuracy on this benchmark, models don't need previous knowledge of the tested language, as all the information needed to solve the linguistic puzzle is presented in the context. We find that, while all analyzed models rank below 25% accuracy, there is a significant gap between open and closed models, with the best-performing proprietary model at 24.05% and the best-performing open model at 8.84%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12126v1,2024-09

The core innovation of the Qwen2.5 series lies in integrating the philosophy of self-improvement throughout the entire pipeline, from pre-training and post-training to inference: (1) During the pre-training phase, Qwen2-Math-Instruct is utilized to generate large-scale, high-quality mathematical data. (2) In the post-training phase, we develop a reward model (RM) by conducting massive sampling from Qwen2-Math-Instruct. This RM is then applied to the iterative evolution of data in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). With a stronger SFT model, it's possible to iteratively train and update the RM, which in turn guides the next round of SFT data iteration. On the final SFT model, we employ the ultimate RM for reinforcement learning, resulting in the Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct. (3) Furthermore, during the inference stage, the RM is used to guide sampling, optimizing the model's performance.   Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct supports both Chinese and English, and possess advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). We evaluate our models on 10 mathematics datasets in both English and Chinese, such as GSM8K, MATH, GaoKao, AMC23, and AIME24, covering a range of difficulties from grade school level to math competition problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12122v1,2024-09
Low Frame-rate Speech Codec: a Codec Designed for Fast High-quality Speech LLM Training and Inference,"Edresson Casanova, Ryan Langman, Paarth Neekhara, Shehzeen Hussain, Jason Li, Subhankar Ghosh, Ante Jukić, Sang-gil Lee","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced audio processing through audio codecs that convert audio into discrete tokens, enabling the application of language modeling techniques to audio data. However, audio codecs often operate at high frame rates, resulting in slow training and inference, especially for autoregressive models. To address this challenge, we present the Low Frame-rate Speech Codec (LFSC): a neural audio codec that leverages finite scalar quantization and adversarial training with large speech language models to achieve high-quality audio compression with a 1.89 kbps bitrate and 21.5 frames per second.

Measuring Human and AI Values Based on Generative Psychometrics with Large Language Models,"Haoran Ye, Yuhang Xie, Yuanyi Ren, Hanjun Fang, Xin Zhang, Guojie Song","Human values and their measurement are long-standing interdisciplinary inquiry. Recent advances in AI have sparked renewed interest in this area, with large language models (LLMs) emerging as both tools and subjects of value measurement. This work introduces Generative Psychometrics for Values (GPV), an LLM-based, data-driven value measurement paradigm, theoretically grounded in text-revealed selective perceptions. The core idea is to dynamically parse unstructured texts into perceptions akin to static stimuli in traditional psychometrics, measure the value orientations they reveal, and aggregate the results. Applying GPV to human-authored blogs, we demonstrate its stability, validity, and superiority over prior psychological tools. Then, extending GPV to LLM value measurement, we advance the current art with 1) a psychometric methodology that measures LLM values based on their scalable and free-form outputs, enabling context-specific measurement; 2) a comparative analysis of measurement paradigms, indicating response biases of prior methods; and 3) an attempt to bridge LLM values and their safety, revealing the predictive power of different value systems and the impacts of various values on LLM safety. Through interdisciplinary efforts, we aim to leverage AI for next-generation psychometrics and psychometrics for value-aligned AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12106v2,2024-09
Skill matching at scale: freelancer-project alignment for efficient multilingual candidate retrieval,"Warren Jouanneau, Marc Palyart, Emma Jouffroy","Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a contrastive loss on historical data.

VERA: Validation and Enhancement for Retrieval Augmented systems,"Nitin Aravind Birur, Tanay Baswa, Divyanshu Kumar, Jatan Loya, Sahil Agarwal, Prashanth Harshangi","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but often produce inaccurate responses, as they rely solely on their embedded knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating an external information retrieval system, supplying additional context along with the query to mitigate inaccuracies for a particular context. However, accuracy issues still remain, as the model may rely on irrelevant documents or extrapolate incorrectly from its training knowledge. To assess and improve the performance of both the retrieval system and the LLM in a RAG framework, we propose \textbf{VERA} (\textbf{V}alidation and \textbf{E}nhancement for \textbf{R}etrieval \textbf{A}ugmented systems), a system designed to: 1) Evaluate and enhance the retrieved context before response generation, and 2) Evaluate and refine the LLM-generated response to ensure precision and minimize errors. VERA employs an evaluator-cum-enhancer LLM that first checks if external retrieval is necessary, evaluates the relevance and redundancy of the retrieved context, and refines it to eliminate non-essential information. Post-response generation, VERA splits the response into atomic statements, assesses their relevance to the query, and ensures adherence to the context. Our experiments demonstrate VERA's remarkable efficacy not only in improving the performance of smaller open-source models, but also larger state-of-the art models. These enhancements underscore VERA's potential to produce accurate and relevant responses, advancing the state-of-the-art in retrieval-augmented language modeling. VERA's robust methodology, combining multiple evaluation and refinement steps, effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves retrieval and response processes, making it a valuable tool for applications demanding high accuracy and reliability in information generation. .",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15364v1,2024-09
PARAPHRASUS : A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Paraphrase Detection Models,"Andrianos Michail, Simon Clematide, Juri Opitz","The task of determining whether two texts are paraphrases has long been a challenge in NLP. However, the prevailing notion of paraphrase is often quite simplistic, offering only a limited view of the vast spectrum of paraphrase phenomena. Indeed, we find that evaluating models in a paraphrase dataset can leave uncertainty about their true semantic understanding. To alleviate this, we create PARAPHRASUS, a benchmark designed for multi-dimensional assessment, benchmarking and selection of paraphrase detection models. We find that paraphrase detection models under our fine-grained evaluation lens exhibit trade-offs that cannot be captured through a single classification dataset. Furthermore, PARAPHRASUS allows prompt calibration for different use cases, tailoring LLM models to specific strictness levels. PARAPHRASUS includes 3 challenges spanning over 10 datasets, including 8 repurposed and 2 newly annotated; we release it along with a benchmarking library at https://github.com/impresso/paraphrasus",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12060v2,2024-09

Interestingly, these can be integrated into material embeddings, potentially useful for data-driven predictions of materials properties. We investigate the extent to which LLM-derived vectors capture the desired information and their potential to provide insights into material properties without additional training. Our findings indicate that, although LLMs can be used to generate representations reflecting certain property information, extracting the embeddings requires identifying the optimal contextual clues and appropriate comparators.

Efficacy of Synthetic Data as a Benchmark,"Gaurav Maheshwari, Dmitry Ivanov, Kevin El Haddad","Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a range of applications in zero-shot and few-shot learning settings, including the generation of synthetic datasets for training and testing. However, to reliably use these synthetic datasets, it is essential to understand how representative they are of real-world data. We investigate this by assessing the effectiveness of generating synthetic data through LLM and using it as a benchmark for various NLP tasks. Our experiments across six datasets, and three different tasks, show that while synthetic data can effectively capture performance of various methods for simpler tasks, such as intent classification, it falls short for more complex tasks like named entity recognition. Additionally, we propose a new metric called the bias factor, which evaluates the biases introduced when the same LLM is used to both generate benchmarking data and to perform the tasks. We find that smaller LLMs exhibit biases towards their own generated data, whereas larger models do not. Overall, our findings suggest that the effectiveness of synthetic data as a benchmark varies depending on the task, and that practitioners should rely on data generated from multiple larger models whenever possible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11968v1,2024-09

LLMs + Persona-Plug = Personalized LLMs,"Jiongnan Liu, Yutao Zhu, Shuting Wang, Xiaochi Wei, Erxue Min, Yu Lu, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Zhicheng Dou","Personalization plays a critical role in numerous language tasks and applications, since users with the same requirements may prefer diverse outputs based on their individual interests. This has led to the development of various personalized approaches aimed at adapting large language models (LLMs) to generate customized outputs aligned with user preferences. Some of them involve fine-tuning a unique personalized LLM for each user, which is too expensive for widespread application. Alternative approaches introduce personalization information in a plug-and-play manner by retrieving the user's relevant historical texts as demonstrations. However, this retrieval-based strategy may break the continuity of the user history and fail to capture the user's overall styles and patterns, hence leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personalized LLM model, \ours{}. It constructs a user-specific embedding for each individual by modeling all her historical contexts through a lightweight plug-in user embedder module. By attaching this embedding to the task input, LLMs can better understand and capture user habits and preferences, thereby producing more personalized outputs without tuning their own parameters. Extensive experiments on various tasks in the language model personalization (LaMP) benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing personalized LLM approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11901v1,2024-09

"Retrieve, Annotate, Evaluate, Repeat: Leveraging Multimodal LLMs for Large-Scale Product Retrieval Evaluation","Kasra Hosseini, Thomas Kober, Josip Krapac, Roland Vollgraf, Weiwei Cheng, Ana Peleteiro Ramallo","Evaluating production-level retrieval systems at scale is a crucial yet challenging task due to the limited availability of a large pool of well-trained human annotators. Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to address this scaling issue and offer a viable alternative to humans for the bulk of annotation tasks. In this paper, we propose a framework for assessing the product search engines in a large-scale e-commerce setting, leveraging Multimodal LLMs for (i) generating tailored annotation guidelines for individual queries, and (ii) conducting the subsequent annotation task. Our method, validated through deployment on a large e-commerce platform, demonstrates comparable quality to human annotations, significantly reduces time and cost, facilitates rapid problem discovery, and provides an effective solution for production-level quality control at scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11860v1,2024-09
Local Explanations and Self-Explanations for Assessing Faithfulness in black-box LLMs,"Christos Fragkathoulas, Odysseas S. Chlapanis","This paper introduces a novel task to assess the faithfulness of large language models (LLMs) using local perturbations and self-explanations. Many LLMs often require additional context to answer certain questions correctly. For this purpose, we propose a new efficient alternative explainability technique, inspired by the commonly used leave-one-out approach. Using this approach, we identify the sufficient and necessary parts for the LLM to generate correct answers, serving as explanations. We propose a metric for assessing faithfulness that compares these crucial parts with the self-explanations of the model. Using the Natural Questions dataset, we validate our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in explaining model decisions and assessing faithfulness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13764v1,2024-09
TaCIE: Enhancing Instruction Comprehension in Large Language Models through Task-Centred Instruction Evolution,"Jiuding Yang, Shengyao Lu, Weidong Guo, Xiangyang Li, Kaitong Yang, Yu Xu, Di Niu","Large Language Models (LLMs) require precise alignment with complex instructions to optimize their performance in real-world applications. As the demand for refined instruction tuning data increases, traditional methods that evolve simple seed instructions often struggle to effectively enhance complexity or manage difficulty scaling across various domains. Our innovative approach, Task-Centered Instruction Evolution (TaCIE), addresses these shortcomings by redefining instruction evolution from merely evolving seed instructions to a more dynamic and comprehensive combination of elements. TaCIE starts by deconstructing complex instructions into their fundamental components. It then generates and integrates new elements with the original ones, reassembling them into more sophisticated instructions that progressively increase in difficulty, diversity, and complexity. Applied across multiple domains, LLMs fine-tuned with these evolved instructions have substantially outperformed those tuned with conventional methods, marking a significant advancement in instruction-based model fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02795v1,2024-09
MEOW: MEMOry Supervised LLM Unlearning Via Inverted Facts,"Tianle Gu, Kexin Huang, Ruilin Luo, Yuanqi Yao, Yujiu Yang, Yan Teng, Yingchun Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize sensitive information, raising concerns about potential misuse. LLM Unlearning, a post-hoc approach to remove this information from trained LLMs, offers a promising solution to mitigate these risks. However, previous practices face three key challenges: 1. Utility: successful unlearning often causes catastrophic collapse on unrelated tasks. 2. Efficiency: many methods either involve adding similarly sized models, which slows down unlearning or inference, or require retain data that are difficult to obtain. 3. Robustness: even effective methods may still leak data via extraction techniques. To address these challenges, we propose MEOW, a simple yet effective gradient descent-based unlearning method. Specifically, we use an offline LLM to generate a set of inverted facts. Then, we design a new metric, MEMO, to quantify memorization in LLMs. Finally, based on the signals provided by MEMO, we select the most appropriate set of inverted facts and finetune the model based on them. We evaluate MEOW on the commonly used unlearn benchmark, ToFU, with Llama2-7B-Chat and Phi-1.5B, and test it on both NLU and NLG tasks. Results demonstrate significant improvement of MEOW in forget quality without substantial loss in model utility. Meanwhile, MEOW does not exhibit significant degradation in NLU or NLG capabilities, and there is even a slight improvement in NLU performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11844v1,2024-09
Extract-and-Abstract: Unifying Extractive and Abstractive Summarization within Single Encoder-Decoder Framework,"Yuping Wu, Hao Li, Hongbo Zhu, Goran Nenadic, Xiao-Jun Zeng","Extract-then-Abstract is a naturally coherent paradigm to conduct abstractive summarization with the help of salient information identified by the extractive model. Previous works that adopt this paradigm train the extractor and abstractor separately and introduce extra parameters to highlight the extracted salients to the abstractor, which results in error accumulation and additional training costs. In this paper, we first introduce a parameter-free highlight method into the encoder-decoder framework: replacing the encoder attention mask with a saliency mask in the cross-attention module to force the decoder to focus only on salient parts of the input. A preliminary analysis compares different highlight methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our saliency mask. We further propose the novel extract-and-abstract paradigm, ExtAbs, which jointly and seamlessly performs Extractive and Abstractive summarization tasks within single encoder-decoder model to reduce error accumulation. In ExtAbs, the vanilla encoder is augmented to extract salients, and the vanilla decoder is modified with the proposed saliency mask to generate summaries. Built upon BART and PEGASUS, experiments on three datasets show that ExtAbs can achieve superior performance than baselines on the extractive task and performs comparable, or even better than the vanilla models on the abstractive task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11827v1,2024-09
The Factuality of Large Language Models in the Legal Domain,"Rajaa El Hamdani, Thomas Bonald, Fragkiskos Malliaros, Nils Holzenberger, Fabian Suchanek","This paper investigates the factuality of large language models (LLMs) as knowledge bases in the legal domain, in a realistic usage scenario: we allow for acceptable variations in the answer, and let the model abstain from answering when uncertain. First, we design a dataset of diverse factual questions about case law and legislation. We then use the dataset to evaluate several LLMs under different evaluation methods, including exact, alias, and fuzzy matching. Our results show that the performance improves significantly under the alias and fuzzy matching methods. Further, we explore the impact of abstaining and in-context examples, finding that both strategies enhance precision. Finally, we demonstrate that additional pre-training on legal documents, as seen with SaulLM, further improves factual precision from 63% to 81%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11798v1,2024-09
Development and bilingual evaluation of Japanese medical large language model within reasonably low computational resources,Issey Sukeda,"The recent success of large language models (LLMs) and the scaling law has led to a widespread adoption of larger models. Particularly in the healthcare industry, there is an increasing demand for locally operated LLMs due to security concerns. However, the majority of high quality open-source LLMs have a size of 70B parameters, imposing significant financial burdens on users for GPU preparation and operation. To overcome these issues, we present a medical adaptation based on the recent 7B models, which enables the operation in low computational resources. We compare the performance on medical question-answering benchmarks in two languages (Japanese and English), demonstrating that its scores reach parity with or surpass those of currently existing medical LLMs that are ten times larger. We find that fine-tuning an English-centric base model on Japanese medical dataset improves the score in both language, supporting the effect of cross-lingual knowledge transfer. We hope that this study will alleviate financial challenges, serving as a stepping stone for clinical institutions to practically utilize LLMs locally.

Multitask Mayhem: Unveiling and Mitigating Safety Gaps in LLMs Fine-tuning,"Essa Jan, Nouar AlDahoul, Moiz Ali, Faizan Ahmad, Fareed Zaffar, Yasir Zaki","Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their adoption across a wide range of tasks, ranging from code generation to machine translation and sentiment analysis, etc. Red teaming/Safety alignment efforts show that fine-tuning models on benign (non-harmful) data could compromise safety. However, it remains unclear to what extent this phenomenon is influenced by different variables, including fine-tuning task, model calibrations, etc. This paper explores the task-wise safety degradation due to fine-tuning on downstream tasks such as summarization, code generation, translation, and classification across various calibration. Our results reveal that: 1) Fine-tuning LLMs for code generation and translation leads to the highest degradation in safety guardrails. 2) LLMs generally have weaker guardrails for translation and classification, with 73-92% of harmful prompts answered, across baseline and other calibrations, falling into one of two concern categories. 3) Current solutions, including guards and safety tuning datasets, lack cross-task robustness. To address these issues, we developed a new multitask safety dataset effectively reducing attack success rates across a range of tasks without compromising the model's overall helpfulness. Our work underscores the need for generalized alignment measures to ensure safer and more robust models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15361v1,2024-09
Human-like Affective Cognition in Foundation Models,"Kanishk Gandhi, Zoe Lynch, Jan-Philipp Fränken, Kayla Patterson, Sharon Wambu, Tobias Gerstenberg, Desmond C. Ong, Noah D. Goodman","Understanding emotions is fundamental to human interaction and experience. Humans easily infer emotions from situations or facial expressions, situations from emotions, and do a variety of other affective cognition. How adept is modern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing affective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory, we generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals, emotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation models (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully selected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with human intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some conditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human judgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought reasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like understanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11733v2,2024-09
Enabling Real-Time Conversations with Minimal Training Costs,"Wang Xu, Shuo Wang, Weilin Zhao, Xu Han, Yukun Yan, Yudi Zhang, Zhe Tao, Zhiyuan Liu, Wanxiang Che","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to improve human efficiency through conversational interactions. Conventional LLM-powered dialogue systems, operating on a turn-based paradigm, preclude real-time interaction during response generation. To address this limitation, researchers have proposed duplex models. These models can dynamically adapt to user input, facilitating real-time interactive feedback. However, these methods typically require substantial computational resources to acquire the ability. To reduce overhead, this paper presents a new duplex decoding approach that enhances LLMs with duplex ability, requiring minimal additional training. Specifically, our method employs parallel decoding of queries and responses in conversations, effectively implementing a channel-division-multiplexing decoding strategy. Experimental results indicate that our proposed method significantly enhances the naturalness and human-likeness of user-AI interactions with minimal training costs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11727v1,2024-09
Revealing the Challenge of Detecting Character Knowledge Errors in LLM Role-Playing,"Wenyuan Zhang, Jiawei Sheng, Shuaiyi Nie, Zefeng Zhang, Xinghua Zhang, Yongquan He, Tingwen Liu","Large language model (LLM) role-playing has gained widespread attention, where the authentic character knowledge is crucial for constructing realistic LLM role-playing agents. However, existing works usually overlook the exploration of LLMs' ability to detect characters' known knowledge errors (KKE) and unknown knowledge errors (UKE) while playing roles, which would lead to low-quality automatic construction of character trainable corpus. In this paper, we propose a probing dataset to evaluate LLMs' ability to detect errors in KKE and UKE. The results indicate that even the latest LLMs struggle to effectively detect these two types of errors, especially when it comes to familiar knowledge. We experimented with various reasoning strategies and propose an agent-based reasoning method, Self-Recollection and Self-Doubt (S2RD), to further explore the potential for improving error detection capabilities. Experiments show that our method effectively improves the LLMs' ability to detect error character knowledge, but it remains an issue that requires ongoing attention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11726v1,2024-09
TART: An Open-Source Tool-Augmented Framework for Explainable Table-based Reasoning,"Xinyuan Lu, Liangming Pan, Yubo Ma, Preslav Nakov, Min-Yen Kan","Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit limited ability to understand table structures and to apply precise numerical reasoning, which is crucial for tasks such as table question answering (TQA) and table-based fact verification (TFV). To address these challenges, we introduce our Tool-Augmented Reasoning framework for Tables (TART), which integrates LLMs with specialized tools. TART contains three key components: a table formatter to ensure accurate data representation, a tool maker to develop specific computational tools, and an explanation generator to maintain explainability. We also present the TOOLTAB dataset, a new benchmark designed specifically for training LLMs in table-tool integration. Our experiments indicate that TART achieves substantial improvements over existing methods (e.g., Chain-of-Thought) by improving both the precision of data processing and the clarity of the reasoning process. Notably, TART paired with CodeLlama achieves 90.0% of the accuracy of the closed-sourced LLM GPT-3.5-turbo, highlighting its robustness in diverse real-world scenarios.

From Lists to Emojis: How Format Bias Affects Model Alignment,"Xuanchang Zhang, Wei Xiong, Lichang Chen, Tianyi Zhou, Heng Huang, Tong Zhang","In this paper, we study format biases in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). We observe that many widely-used preference models, including human evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark, exhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links, bold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit these biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval and LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example of this is verbosity bias, where current preference models favor longer responses that appear more comprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter, competing responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely underexplored in the literature. In this work, we extend the study of biases in preference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a comprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show that with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject significant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also be easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as best-of-n sampling and online iterative DPO, as it is usually easier to manipulate the format than to improve the quality of responses. Our findings emphasize the need to disentangle format and content both for designing alignment algorithms and evaluating models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11704v1,2024-09
Harnessing LLMs for API Interactions: A Framework for Classification and Synthetic Data Generation,"Chunliang Tao, Xiaojing Fan, Yahe Yang","As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance in natural language processing, there is growing interest in leveraging their capabilities to simplify software interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel system that integrates LLMs for both classifying natural language inputs into corresponding API calls and automating the creation of sample datasets tailored to specific API functions. By classifying natural language commands, our system allows users to invoke complex software functionalities through simple inputs, improving interaction efficiency and lowering the barrier to software utilization. Our dataset generation approach also enables the efficient and systematic evaluation of different LLMs in classifying API calls, offering a practical tool for developers or business owners to assess the suitability of LLMs for customized API management. We conduct experiments on several prominent LLMs using generated sample datasets for various API functions. The results show that GPT-4 achieves a high classification accuracy of 0.996, while LLaMA-3-8B performs much worse at 0.759. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to transform API management and validate the effectiveness of our system in guiding model testing and selection across diverse applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11703v1,2024-09

This architecture allows Flare to effectively combine collaborative and content information for enhanced recommendations.   We conduct a two-stage evaluation, first assessing Flare's performance against established baselines on smaller datasets, where it demonstrates competitive accuracy. Subsequently, we evaluate Flare on a larger, more realistic dataset with a significantly larger item vocabulary, introducing new baselines for this setting.

We further leverage critiquing as an evaluation method to assess the model's language understanding and its transferability to the recommendation task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11699v1,2024-09
Enhancing Complex Formula Recognition with Hierarchical Detail-Focused Network,"Jiale Wang, Junhui Yu, Huanyong Liu, Chenanran Kong","Hierarchical and complex Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) is challenging due to multiple possible interpretations of a formula, complicating both parsing and evaluation. In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical Detail-Focused Recognition dataset (HDR), the first dataset specifically designed to address these issues. It consists of a large-scale training set, HDR-100M, offering an unprecedented scale and diversity with one hundred million training instances. And the test set, HDR-Test, includes multiple interpretations of complex hierarchical formulas for comprehensive model performance evaluation. Additionally, the parsing of complex formulas often suffers from errors in fine-grained details.

RUIE: Retrieval-based Unified Information Extraction using Large Language Model,"Xincheng Liao, Junwen Duan, Yixi Huang, Jianxin Wang","Unified information extraction (UIE) aims to complete all information extraction tasks using a single model or framework. While previous work has primarily focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) with constructed datasets, these methods require significant computational resources and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks. To address these limitations, we propose RUIE (Retrieval-based Unified Information Extraction), a framework that leverages in-context learning to enable rapid generalization while reducing computational costs. The key challenge in RUIE is selecting the most beneficial demonstrations for LLMs to effectively handle diverse IE tasks. To achieve this, we integrate LLM preferences for ranking candidate demonstrations and design a keyword-enhanced reward model to capture fine-grained relationships between queries and demonstrations. We then train a bi-encoder retriever for UIE through contrastive learning and knowledge distillation. To the best of our knowledge, RUIE is the first trainable retrieval framework for UIE. Experimental results on 8 held-out datasets demonstrate RUIE's effectiveness in generalizing to unseen tasks, with average F1-score improvements of 19.22 and 3.13 compared to instruction-tuning methods and other retrievers, respectively. Further analysis confirms RUIE's adaptability to LLMs of varying sizes and the importance of its key components.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11673v1,2024-09
Reward-Robust RLHF in LLMs,"Yuzi Yan, Xingzhou Lou, Jialian Li, Yiping Zhang, Jian Xie, Chao Yu, Yu Wang, Dong Yan, Yuan Shen","As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to progress toward more advanced forms of intelligence, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly seen as a key pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the reliance on reward-model-based (RM-based) alignment methods introduces significant challenges due to the inherent instability and imperfections of Reward Models (RMs), which can lead to critical issues such as reward hacking and misalignment with human intentions. In this paper, we introduce a reward-robust RLHF framework aimed at addressing these fundamental challenges, paving the way for more reliable and resilient learning in LLMs. Our approach introduces a novel optimization objective that carefully balances performance and robustness by incorporating Bayesian Reward Model Ensembles (BRME) to model the uncertainty set of reward functions. This allows the framework to integrate both nominal performance and minimum reward signals, ensuring more stable learning even with imperfect RMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms baselines across diverse benchmarks, showing improved accuracy and long-term stability. We also provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that reward-robust RLHF approaches the stability of constant reward settings, which proves to be acceptable even in a stochastic-case analysis. Together, these contributions highlight the framework potential to enhance both the performance and stability of LLM alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15360v3,2024-09
Navigation with VLM framework: Go to Any Language,"Zecheng Yin, Chonghao Cheng, Lizhen","Navigating towards fully open language goals and exploring open scenes in a manner akin to human exploration have always posed significant challenges. Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning with both language and visual data. While many works have focused on leveraging VLMs for navigation in open scenes and with open vocabularies, these efforts often fall short of fully utilizing the potential of VLMs or require substantial computational resources. We introduce Navigation with VLM (NavVLM), a framework that harnesses equipment-level VLMs to enable agents to navigate towards any language goal specific or non-specific in open scenes, emulating human exploration behaviors without any prior training. The agent leverages the VLM as its cognitive core to perceive environmental information based on any language goal and constantly provides exploration guidance during navigation until it reaches the target location or area. Our framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) in traditional specific goal settings but also extends the navigation capabilities to any open-set language goal. We evaluate NavVLM in richly detailed environments from the Matterport 3D (MP3D), Habitat Matterport 3D (HM3D), and Gibson datasets within the Habitat simulator. With the power of VLMs, navigation has entered a new era.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02787v1,2024-09

In an effort to extend the focus of bias research beyond English-centric datasets, we have localized the content from the StereoSet, IndiBias, and Kamruzzaman et. al.'s datasets, producing a resource tailored to capture biases prevalent within the Bangla-speaking community. Our BanStereoSet dataset consists of 1,194 sentences spanning 9 categories of bias: race, profession, gender, ageism, beauty, beauty in profession, region, caste, and religion. This dataset not only serves as a crucial tool for measuring bias in multilingual LLMs but also facilitates the exploration of stereotypical bias across different social categories, potentially guiding the development of more equitable language technologies in Bangladeshi contexts.

"""A Woman is More Culturally Knowledgeable than A Man?"": The Effect of Personas on Cultural Norm Interpretation in LLMs","Mahammed Kamruzzaman, Hieu Nguyen, Nazmul Hassan, Gene Louis Kim","As the deployment of large language models (LLMs) expands, there is an increasing demand for personalized LLMs. One method to personalize and guide the outputs of these models is by assigning a persona -- a role that describes the expected behavior of the LLM (e.g., a man, a woman, an engineer). This study investigates whether an LLM's understanding of social norms varies across assigned personas. Ideally, the perception of a social norm should remain consistent regardless of the persona, since acceptability of a social norm should be determined by the region the norm originates from, rather than by individual characteristics such as gender, body size, or race. A norm is universal within its cultural context. In our research, we tested 36 distinct personas from 12 sociodemographic categories (e.g., age, gender, beauty) across four different LLMs. We find that LLMs' cultural norm interpretation varies based on the persona used and the norm interpretation also varies within a sociodemographic category (e.g., a fat person and a thin person as in physical appearance group) where an LLM with the more socially desirable persona (e.g., a thin person) interprets social norms more accurately than with the less socially desirable persona (e.g., a fat person). We also discuss how different types of social biases may contribute to the results that we observe.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11636v1,2024-09
Watch Your Steps: Observable and Modular Chains of Thought,"Cassandra A. Cohen, William W. Cohen","We propose a variant of chain of thought (CoT) prompting called Program Trace Prompting that makes explanations more observable while preserving the power, generality and flexibility of CoT. In our approach, few-shot CoT demonstrations are wrapped in a formal syntax based on Python, and each prompt: identifies and names steps; defines the input/output behavior of steps; and replaces CoT explanations of in-context examples with chains of these formalized steps on the same examples. Program Trace Prompting is applicable to many tasks, achieving strong results on the 23 diverse tasks in the BIG-Bench Hard benchmark. More importantly, by instrumenting explanations in this way, we enable new types of analysis. In particular, we identify ""non-local errors"" (which correspond to incorrectly learning the reasoning method illustrated in the demonstrations) as an unaddressed issue in CoT learning, and we present methods for verifying the modularity of steps in a CoT explanation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15359v2,2024-09
Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"To Eun Kim, Fernando Diaz","Many language models now enhance their responses with retrieval capabilities, leading to the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, despite retrieval being a core component of RAG, much of the research in this area overlooks the extensive body of work on fair ranking, neglecting the importance of considering all stakeholders involved. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair rankings. We focus specifically on measuring the fair exposure of each relevant item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness), aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems, despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and maintaining system-effectiveness. We believe our insights lay the groundwork for responsible and equitable RAG systems and open new avenues for future research.

REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs,"Honggen Zhang, Xufeng Zhao, Igor Molybog, June Zhang","Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human feedback. The response pair annotation process is the most labor-intensive and costly part of the alignment pipeline, and improving its efficiency and annotation quality would have a meaningful impact on AI development. We propose REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs, a strategy for constructing a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the most informative response pairs for labeling out of a set of response candidates. Our selection process is based on embedding responses independently of prompts. Experimental results on real-world dataset SHP2 and synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. The model aligned on dissimilar response pairs obtained a better margin and win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on distinct pairs can reduce the label error to improve the efficiency of LLM alignment, saving up to 65% of annotators' work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17169v3,2024-09

A Review of Mechanistic Models of Event Comprehension,Tan T. Nguyen,"This review examines theoretical assumptions and computational models of event comprehension, tracing the evolution from discourse comprehension theories to contemporary event cognition frameworks. The review covers key discourse comprehension accounts, including Construction-Integration, Event Indexing, Causal Network, and Resonance models, highlighting their contributions to understanding cognitive processes in comprehension. I then discuss contemporary theoretical frameworks of event comprehension, including Event Segmentation Theory (Zacks et al., 2007), the Event Horizon Model (Radvansky & Zacks, 2014), and Hierarchical Generative Framework (Kuperberg, 2021), which emphasize prediction, causality, and multilevel representations in event understanding. Building on these theories, I evaluate five computational models of event comprehension: REPRISE (Butz et al., 2019), Structured Event Memory (SEM; Franklin et al., 2020), the Lu model (Lu et al., 2022), the Gumbsch model (Gumbsch et al., 2022), and the Elman and McRae model (2019). The analysis focuses on their approaches to hierarchical processing, prediction mechanisms, and representation learning. Key themes that emerge include the use of hierarchical structures as inductive biases, the importance of prediction in comprehension, and diverse strategies for learning event dynamics. The review identifies critical areas for future research, including the need for more sophisticated approaches to learning structured representations, integrating episodic memory mechanisms, and developing adaptive updating algorithms for working event models.

"HEARTS: A Holistic Framework for Explainable, Sustainable and Robust Text Stereotype Detection","Theo King, Zekun Wu, Adriano Koshiyama, Emre Kazim, Philip Treleaven","Stereotypes are generalised assumptions about societal groups, and even state-of-the-art LLMs using in-context learning struggle to identify them accurately. Due to the subjective nature of stereotypes, where what constitutes a stereotype can vary widely depending on cultural, social, and individual perspectives, robust explainability is crucial. Explainable models ensure that these nuanced judgments can be understood and validated by human users, promoting trust and accountability. We address these challenges by introducing HEARTS (Holistic Framework for Explainable, Sustainable, and Robust Text Stereotype Detection), a framework that enhances model performance, minimises carbon footprint, and provides transparent, interpretable explanations. We establish the Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (EMGSD), comprising 57,201 labelled texts across six groups, including under-represented demographics like LGBTQ+ and regional stereotypes. Ablation studies confirm that BERT models fine-tuned on EMGSD outperform those trained on individual components. We then analyse a fine-tuned, carbon-efficient ALBERT-V2 model using SHAP to generate token-level importance values, ensuring alignment with human understanding, and calculate explainability confidence scores by comparing SHAP and LIME outputs...",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11579v3,2024-09
"Preference Tuning with Human Feedback on Language, Speech, and Vision Tasks: A Survey","Genta Indra Winata, Hanyang Zhao, Anirban Das, Wenpin Tang, David D. Yao, Shi-Xiong Zhang, Sambit Sahu","Preference tuning is a crucial process for aligning deep generative models with human preferences.

Small Language Models can Outperform Humans in Short Creative Writing: A Study Comparing SLMs with Humans and LLMs,"Guillermo Marco, Luz Rello, Julio Gonzalo","In this paper, we evaluate the creative fiction writing abilities of a fine-tuned small language model (SLM), BART Large, and compare its performance to humans and two large language models (LLMs): GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. Our evaluation consists of two experiments: (i) a human evaluation where readers assess the stories generated by the SLM compared to human-written stories, and (ii) a qualitative linguistic analysis comparing the textual characteristics of the stories generated by the different models. In the first experiment, we asked 68 participants to rate short stories generated by the models and humans along dimensions such as grammaticality, relevance, creativity, and attractiveness. BART Large outperformed human writers in most aspects, except creativity, with an overall score of 2.11 compared to 1.85 for human-written texts -- a 14% improvement. In the second experiment, the qualitative analysis revealed that, while GPT-4o exhibited near-perfect internal and external coherence, it tended to produce more predictable narratives, with only 3% of its stories seen as novel. In contrast, 15% of BART's stories were considered novel, indicating a higher degree of creativity despite its smaller model size. This study provides both quantitative and qualitative insights into how model size and fine-tuning influence the balance between creativity, fluency, and coherence in creative writing tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11547v1,2024-09
Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Speech Translation,"Ke Hu, Zhehuai Chen, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Piotr Żelasko, Oleksii Hrinchuk, Vitaly Lavrukhin, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advancements in language understanding and generation. Building on the success of text-based LLMs, recent research has adapted these models to use speech embeddings for prompting, resulting in Speech-LLM models that exhibit strong performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speech translation (AST). In this work, we propose a novel approach to leverage ASR transcripts as prompts for AST in a Speech-LLM built on an encoder-decoder text LLM. The Speech-LLM model consists of a speech encoder and an encoder-decoder structure Megatron-T5. By first decoding speech to generate ASR transcripts and subsequently using these transcripts along with encoded speech for prompting, we guide the speech translation in a two-step process like chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is used for the T5 LLM for model adaptation and shows superior performance to full model fine-tuning. Experimental results show that the proposed CoT prompting significantly improves AST performance, achieving an average increase of 2.4 BLEU points across 6 En->X or X->En AST tasks compared to speech prompting alone. Additionally, compared to a related CoT prediction method that predicts a concatenated sequence of ASR and AST transcripts, our method performs better by an average of 2 BLEU points.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11538v1,2024-09
Egalitarian Language Representation in Language Models: It All Begins with Tokenizers,"Menan Velayuthan, Kengatharaiyer Sarveswaran","Tokenizers act as a bridge between human language and the latent space of language models, influencing how language is represented in these models. Due to the immense popularity of English-Centric Large Language Models (LLMs), efforts are being made to adapt them for other languages. However, we demonstrate that, from a tokenization standpoint, not all tokenizers offer fair representation for complex script languages such as Tamil, Sinhala, and Hindi, primarily due to the choice of pre-tokenization methods. We go further to show that pre-tokenization plays a more critical role than the tokenization algorithm itself in achieving an egalitarian representation of these complex script languages. To address this, we introduce an improvement to the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm by incorporating graphemes, which we term Grapheme Pair Encoding (GPE). Our experiments show that grapheme-based character extraction outperforms byte-level tokenizers for complex scripts. We validate this approach through experiments on Tamil, Sinhala, and Hindi.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11501v1,2024-09
Multi-Document Grounded Multi-Turn Synthetic Dialog Generation,"Young-Suk Lee, Chulaka Gunasekara, Danish Contractor, Ramón Fernandez Astudillo, Radu Florian","We introduce a technique for multi-document grounded multi-turn synthetic dialog generation that incorporates three main ideas. First, we control the overall dialog flow using taxonomy-driven user queries that are generated with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Second, we support the generation of multi-document grounded dialogs by mimicking real-world use of retrievers to update the grounding documents after every user-turn in the dialog. Third, we apply LLM-as-a-Judge to filter out queries with incorrect answers. Human evaluation of the synthetic dialog data suggests that the data is diverse, coherent, and includes mostly correct answers. Both human and automatic evaluations of answerable queries indicate that models fine-tuned on synthetic dialogs consistently out-perform those fine-tuned on existing human generated training data across four publicly available multi-turn document grounded benchmark test sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11500v1,2024-09
"Augment, Drop & Swap: Improving Diversity in LLM Captions for Efficient Music-Text Representation Learning","Ilaria Manco, Justin Salamon, Oriol Nieto","Audio-text contrastive models have become a powerful approach in music representation learning. Despite their empirical success, however, little is known about the influence of key design choices on the quality of music-text representations learnt through this framework. In this work, we expose these design choices within the constraints of limited data and computation budgets, and establish a more solid understanding of their impact grounded in empirical observations along three axes: the choice of base encoders, the level of curation in training data, and the use of text augmentation. We find that data curation is the single most important factor for music-text contrastive training in resource-constrained scenarios. Motivated by this insight, we introduce two novel techniques, Augmented View Dropout and TextSwap, which increase the diversity and descriptiveness of text inputs seen in training. Through our experiments we demonstrate that these are effective at boosting performance across different pre-training regimes, model architectures, and downstream data distributions, without incurring higher computational costs or requiring additional training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11498v1,2024-09
Enriching Datasets with Demographics through Large Language Models: What's in a Name?,"Khaled AlNuaimi, Gautier Marti, Mathieu Ravaut, Abdulla AlKetbi, Andreas Henschel, Raed Jaradat","Enriching datasets with demographic information, such as gender, race, and age from names, is a critical task in fields like healthcare, public policy, and social sciences. Such demographic insights allow for more precise and effective engagement with target populations. Despite previous efforts employing hidden Markov models and recurrent neural networks to predict demographics from names, significant limitations persist: the lack of large-scale, well-curated, unbiased, publicly available datasets, and the lack of an approach robust across datasets. This scarcity has hindered the development of traditional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we demonstrate that the zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform as well as, if not better than, bespoke models trained on specialized data. We apply these LLMs to a variety of datasets, including a real-life, unlabelled dataset of licensed financial professionals in Hong Kong, and critically assess the inherent demographic biases in these models. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in demographic enrichment but also opens avenues for future research in mitigating biases in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11491v1,2024-09
Learning variant product relationship and variation attributes from e-commerce website structures,"Pedro Herrero-Vidal, You-Lin Chen, Cris Liu, Prithviraj Sen, Lichao Wang","We introduce VARM, variant relationship matcher strategy, to identify pairs of variant products in e-commerce catalogs. Traditional definitions of entity resolution are concerned with whether product mentions refer to the same underlying product. However, this fails to capture product relationships that are critical for e-commerce applications, such as having similar, but not identical, products listed on the same webpage or share reviews. Here, we formulate a new type of entity resolution in variant product relationships to capture these similar e-commerce product links. In contrast with the traditional definition, the new definition requires both identifying if two products are variant matches of each other and what are the attributes that vary between them. To satisfy these two requirements, we developed a strategy that leverages the strengths of both encoding and generative AI models. First, we construct a dataset that captures webpage product links, and therefore variant product relationships, to train an encoding LLM to predict variant matches for any given pair of products. Second, we use RAG prompted generative LLMs to extract variation and common attributes amongst groups of variant products. To validate our strategy, we evaluated model performance using real data from one of the world's leading e-commerce retailers. The results showed that our strategy outperforms alternative solutions and paves the way to exploiting these new type of product relationships.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02779v1,2024-09
AraDiCE: Benchmarks for Dialectal and Cultural Capabilities in LLMs,"Basel Mousi, Nadir Durrani, Fatema Ahmad, Md. Arid Hasan, Maram Hasanain, Tameem Kabbani, Fahim Dalvi, Shammur Absar Chowdhury, Firoj Alam","Arabic, with its rich diversity of dialects, remains significantly underrepresented in Large Language Models, particularly in dialectal variations. We address this gap by introducing seven synthetic datasets in dialects alongside Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), created using Machine Translation (MT) combined with human post-editing. We present AraDiCE, a benchmark for Arabic Dialect and Cultural Evaluation. We evaluate LLMs on dialect comprehension and generation, focusing specifically on low-resource Arabic dialects. Additionally, we introduce the first-ever fine-grained benchmark designed to evaluate cultural awareness across the Gulf, Egypt, and Levant regions, providing a novel dimension to LLM evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that while Arabic-specific models like Jais and AceGPT outperform multilingual models on dialectal tasks, significant challenges persist in dialect identification, generation, and translation. This work contributes $\approx$45K post-edited samples, a cultural benchmark, and highlights the importance of tailored training to improve LLM performance in capturing the nuances of diverse Arabic dialects and cultural contexts.

NVLM: Open Frontier-Class Multimodal LLMs,"Wenliang Dai, Nayeon Lee, Boxin Wang, Zhuolin Yang, Zihan Liu, Jon Barker, Tuomas Rintamaki, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping","We introduce NVLM 1.0, a family of frontier-class multimodal large language models (LLMs) that achieve state-of-the-art results on vision-language tasks, rivaling the leading proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-access models (e.g., Llama 3-V 405B and InternVL 2). Remarkably, NVLM 1.0 shows improved text-only performance over its LLM backbone after multimodal training. In terms of model design, we perform a comprehensive comparison between decoder-only multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) and cross-attention-based models (e.g., Flamingo). Based on the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, we propose a novel architecture that enhances both training efficiency and multimodal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a 1-D tile-tagging design for tile-based dynamic high-resolution images, which significantly boosts performance on multimodal reasoning and OCR-related tasks. Regarding training data, we meticulously curate and provide detailed information on our multimodal pretraining and supervised fine-tuning datasets. Our findings indicate that dataset quality and task diversity are more important than scale, even during the pretraining phase, across all architectures. Notably, we develop production-grade multimodality for the NVLM-1.0 models, enabling them to excel in vision-language tasks while maintaining and even improving text-only performance compared to their LLM backbones. To achieve this, we craft and integrate a high-quality text-only dataset into multimodal training, alongside a substantial amount of multimodal math and reasoning data, leading to enhanced math and coding capabilities across modalities. To advance research in the field, we release the model weights at https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVLM-D-72B and will open-source the training code for the community soon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11402v2,2024-09
Moshi: a speech-text foundation model for real-time dialogue,"Alexandre Défossez, Laurent Mazaré, Manu Orsini, Amélie Royer, Patrick Pérez, Hervé Jégou, Edouard Grave, Neil Zeghidour","We introduce Moshi, a speech-text foundation model and full-duplex spoken dialogue framework. Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of independent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition, textual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the experience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of several seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate modality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning -- such as emotion or non-speech sounds -- is lost in the interaction. Finally, they rely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account overlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these independent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this ""Inner Monologue"" method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech, but we also illustrate how it can provide streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. Our resulting model is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice, and is available at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00037v2,2024-09
Says Who? Effective Zero-Shot Annotation of Focalization,"Rebecca M. M. Hicke, Yuri Bizzoni, Pascale Feldkamp, Ross Deans Kristensen-McLachlan","Focalization, the perspective through which narrative is presented, is encoded via a wide range of lexico-grammatical features and is subject to reader interpretation. Moreover, trained readers regularly disagree on interpretations, suggesting that this problem may be computationally intractable. In this paper, we provide experiments to test how well contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) perform when annotating literary texts for focalization mode. Despite the challenging nature of the task, LLMs show comparable performance to trained human annotators in our experiments. We provide a case study working with the novels of Stephen King to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for computational literary studies, illustrating how focalization can be studied at scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11390v1,2024-09
Diversify and Conquer: Diversity-Centric Data Selection with Iterative Refinement,"Simon Yu, Liangyu Chen, Sara Ahmadian, Marzieh Fadaee","Finetuning large language models on instruction data is crucial for enhancing pre-trained knowledge and improving instruction-following capabilities. As instruction datasets proliferate, selecting optimal data for effective training becomes increasingly important. This work addresses the question: How can we determine the optimal subset of data for effective training? While existing research often emphasizes local criteria like instance quality for subset selection, we argue that a global approach focused on data diversity is more critical. Our method employs k-means clustering to ensure the selected subset effectively represents the full dataset. We propose an iterative refinement method inspired by active learning techniques to resample instances from clusters, reassessing each cluster's importance and sampling weight in every training iteration. This approach reduces the effect of outliers and automatically filters out clusters containing low-quality data. Through extensive evaluation across natural language reasoning, general world knowledge, code and math reasoning tasks, and by fine-tuning models from various families, we observe consistent improvements, achieving a 7% increase over random selection and a 3.8% improvement over state-of-the-art sampling methods. Our work highlights the significance of diversity-first sampling when finetuning LLMs to enhance performance across a broad array of evaluation tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/for-ai/iterative-data-selection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11378v1,2024-09
CoCA: Regaining Safety-awareness of Multimodal Large Language Models with Constitutional Calibration,"Jiahui Gao, Renjie Pi, Tianyang Han, Han Wu, Lanqing Hong, Lingpeng Kong, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li","The deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated remarkable success in engaging in conversations involving visual inputs, thanks to the superior power of large language models (LLMs). Those MLLMs are typically built based on the LLMs, with an image encoder to process images into the token embedding space of the LLMs. However, the integration of visual modality has introduced a unique vulnerability: the MLLM becomes susceptible to malicious visual inputs and prone to generating sensitive or harmful responses, even though the LLM has been trained on textual dataset to align with human value. In this paper, we first raise the question: ``Do the MLLMs possess safety-awareness against malicious image inputs?"". We find that after adding a principle that specifies the safety requirement into the input of the MLLM, the model's safety awareness becomes boosted. This phenomenon verifies the existence of MLLM's safety-awareness against image inputs, it is only weakened by the modality gap. We then introduce a simple yet effective technique termed CoCA, which amplifies the safety-awareness of the MLLM by calibrating its output distribution. Our proposed strategy helps the model reclaim its original safety awareness without losing its original capabilities. We verify the effectiveness of our approach on both multimodal safety and understanding benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11365v2,2024-09
CORE-Bench: Fostering the Credibility of Published Research Through a Computational Reproducibility Agent Benchmark,"Zachary S. Siegel, Sayash Kapoor, Nitya Nagdir, Benedikt Stroebl, Arvind Narayanan","AI agents have the potential to aid users on a variety of consequential tasks, including conducting scientific research. To spur the development of useful agents, we need benchmarks that are challenging, but more crucially, directly correspond to real-world tasks of interest. This paper introduces such a benchmark, designed to measure the accuracy of AI agents in tackling a crucial yet surprisingly challenging aspect of scientific research: computational reproducibility. This task, fundamental to the scientific process, involves reproducing the results of a study using the provided code and data. We introduce CORE-Bench (Computational Reproducibility Agent Benchmark), a benchmark consisting of 270 tasks based on 90 scientific papers across three disciplines (computer science, social science, and medicine). Tasks in CORE-Bench consist of three difficulty levels and include both language-only and vision-language tasks. We provide an evaluation system to measure the accuracy of agents in a fast and parallelizable way, saving days of evaluation time for each run compared to a sequential implementation. We evaluated two baseline agents: the general-purpose AutoGPT and a task-specific agent called CORE-Agent. We tested both variants using two underlying language models: GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. The best agent achieved an accuracy of 21% on the hardest task, showing the vast scope for improvement in automating routine scientific tasks. Having agents that can reproduce existing work is a necessary step towards building agents that can conduct novel research and could verify and improve the performance of other research agents.

THaMES: An End-to-End Tool for Hallucination Mitigation and Evaluation in Large Language Models,"Mengfei Liang, Archish Arun, Zekun Wu, Cristian Munoz, Jonathan Lutch, Emre Kazim, Adriano Koshiyama, Philip Treleaven","Hallucination, the generation of factually incorrect content, is a growing challenge in Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing detection and mitigation methods are often isolated and insufficient for domain-specific needs, lacking a standardized pipeline. This paper introduces THaMES (Tool for Hallucination Mitigations and EvaluationS), an integrated framework and library addressing this gap. THaMES offers an end-to-end solution for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, featuring automated test set generation, multifaceted benchmarking, and adaptable mitigation strategies. It automates test set creation from any corpus, ensuring high data quality, diversity, and cost-efficiency through techniques like batch processing, weighted sampling, and counterfactual validation. THaMES assesses a model's ability to detect and reduce hallucinations across various tasks, including text generation and binary classification, applying optimal mitigation strategies like In-Context Learning (ICL), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs using a knowledge base of academic papers, political news, and Wikipedia reveal that commercial models like GPT-4o benefit more from RAG than ICL, while open-weight models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo gain more from ICL. Additionally, PEFT significantly enhances the performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct in both evaluation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11353v3,2024-09
SpMis: An Investigation of Synthetic Spoken Misinformation Detection,"Peizhuo Liu, Li Wang, Renqiang He, Haorui He, Lei Wang, Huadi Zheng, Jie Shi, Tong Xiao, Zhizheng Wu","In recent years, speech generation technology has advanced rapidly, fueled by generative models and large-scale training techniques. While these developments have enabled the production of high-quality synthetic speech, they have also raised concerns about the misuse of this technology, particularly for generating synthetic misinformation. Current research primarily focuses on distinguishing machine-generated speech from human-produced speech, but the more urgent challenge is detecting misinformation within spoken content. This task requires a thorough analysis of factors such as speaker identity, topic, and synthesis. To address this need, we conduct an initial investigation into synthetic spoken misinformation detection by introducing an open-source dataset, SpMis. SpMis includes speech synthesized from over 1,000 speakers across five common topics, utilizing state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems. Although our results show promising detection capabilities, they also reveal substantial challenges for practical implementation, underscoring the importance of ongoing research in this critical area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11308v1,2024-09
EIA: Environmental Injection Attack on Generalist Web Agents for Privacy Leakage,"Zeyi Liao, Lingbo Mo, Chejian Xu, Mintong Kang, Jiawei Zhang, Chaowei Xiao, Yuan Tian, Bo Li, Huan Sun","Generalist web agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in autonomously completing a wide range of tasks on real websites, significantly boosting human productivity. However, web tasks, such as booking flights, usually involve users' PII, which may be exposed to potential privacy risks if web agents accidentally interact with compromised websites, a scenario that remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this work, we narrow this gap by conducting the first study on the privacy risks of generalist web agents in adversarial environments. First, we present a realistic threat model for attacks on the website, where we consider two adversarial targets: stealing users' specific PII or the entire user request. Then, we propose a novel attack method, termed Environmental Injection Attack (EIA). EIA injects malicious content designed to adapt well to environments where the agents operate and our work instantiates EIA specifically for privacy scenarios in web environments. We collect 177 action steps that involve diverse PII categories on realistic websites from the Mind2Web, and conduct experiments using one of the most capable generalist web agent frameworks to date. The results demonstrate that EIA achieves up to 70% ASR in stealing specific PII and 16% ASR for full user request. Additionally, by accessing the stealthiness and experimenting with a defensive system prompt, we indicate that EIA is hard to detect and mitigate. Notably, attacks that are not well adapted for a webpage can be detected via human inspection, leading to our discussion about the trade-off between security and autonomy. However, extra attackers' efforts can make EIA seamlessly adapted, rendering such supervision ineffective. Thus, we further discuss the defenses at the pre- and post-deployment stages of the websites without relying on human supervision and call for more advanced defense strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11295v3,2024-09
Zero-resource Hallucination Detection for Text Generation via Graph-based Contextual Knowledge Triples Modeling,"Xinyue Fang, Zhen Huang, Zhiliang Tian, Minghui Fang, Ziyi Pan, Quntian Fang, Zhihua Wen, Hengyue Pan, Dongsheng Li","LLMs obtain remarkable performance but suffer from hallucinations. Most research on detecting hallucination focuses on the questions with short and concrete correct answers that are easy to check the faithfulness. Hallucination detections for text generation with open-ended answers are more challenging. Some researchers use external knowledge to detect hallucinations in generated texts, but external resources for specific scenarios are hard to access. Recent studies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources conduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs. To handle long texts, researchers split long texts into multiple facts and individually compare the consistency of each pairs of facts. However, these methods (1) hardly achieve alignment among multiple facts; (2) overlook dependencies between multiple contextual facts. In this paper, we propose a graph-based context-aware (GCA) hallucination detection for text generations, which aligns knowledge facts and considers the dependencies between contextual knowledge triples in consistency comparison. Particularly, to align multiple facts, we conduct a triple-oriented response segmentation to extract multiple knowledge triples. To model dependencies among contextual knowledge triple (facts), we construct contextual triple into a graph and enhance triples' interactions via message passing and aggregating via RGCN. To avoid the omission of knowledge triples in long text, we conduct a LLM-based reverse verification via reconstructing the knowledge triples. Experiments show that our model enhances hallucination detection and excels all baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11283v3,2024-09
Leveraging Distillation Techniques for Document Understanding: A Case Study with FLAN-T5,"Marcel Lamott, Muhammad Armaghan Shakir","The surge of digital documents in various formats, including less standardized documents such as business reports and environmental assessments, underscores the growing importance of Document Understanding.

Previous research has demonstrated the utility of LLMs in this domain, yet their significant computational demands make them challenging to deploy effectively. Additionally, proprietary Blackbox LLMs often outperform their open-source counterparts, posing a barrier to widespread accessibility. In this paper, we delve into the realm of document understanding, leveraging distillation methods to harness the power of large LLMs while accommodating computational limitations. Specifically, we present a novel approach wherein we distill document understanding knowledge from the proprietary LLM ChatGPT into FLAN-T5. Our methodology integrates labeling and curriculum-learning mechanisms to facilitate efficient knowledge transfer. This work contributes to the advancement of document understanding methodologies by offering a scalable solution that bridges the gap between resource-intensive LLMs and practical applications.

P-RAG: Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation For Planning on Embodied Everyday Task,"Weiye Xu, Min Wang, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li","Embodied Everyday Task is a popular task in the embodied AI community, requiring agents to make a sequence of actions based on natural language instructions and visual observations. Traditional learning-based approaches face two challenges. Firstly, natural language instructions often lack explicit task planning. Secondly, extensive training is required to equip models with knowledge of the task environment. Previous works based on Large Language Model (LLM) either suffer from poor performance due to the lack of task-specific knowledge or rely on ground truth as few-shot samples. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel approach called Progressive Retrieval Augmented Generation (P-RAG), which not only effectively leverages the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs but also progressively accumulates task-specific knowledge without ground-truth. Compared to the conventional RAG methods, which retrieve relevant information from the database in a one-shot manner to assist generation, P-RAG introduces an iterative approach to progressively update the database. In each iteration, P-RAG retrieves the latest database and obtains historical information from the previous interaction as experiential references for the current interaction. Moreover, we also introduce a more granular retrieval scheme that not only retrieves similar tasks but also incorporates retrieval of similar situations to provide more valuable reference experiences. Extensive experiments reveal that P-RAG achieves competitive results without utilizing ground truth and can even further improve performance through self-iterations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11279v1,2024-09
Task Arithmetic for Language Expansion in Speech Translation,"Yao-Fei Cheng, Hayato Futami, Yosuke Kashiwagi, Emiru Tsunoo, Wen Shen Teo, Siddhant Arora, Shinji Watanabe","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have gained interest in speech-text multimodal foundation models, achieving strong performance on instruction-based speech translation (ST). However, expanding language pairs from an existing instruction-tuned ST system is costly due to the necessity of re-training on a combination of new and previous datasets. We propose to expand new language pairs by merging the model trained on new language pairs and the existing model, using task arithmetic. We find that the direct application of task arithmetic for ST causes the merged model to fail to follow instructions; thus, generating translation in incorrect languages. To eliminate language confusion, we propose an augmented task arithmetic method that merges an additional language control model. It is trained to generate the correct target language token following the instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed language control model can achieve language expansion by eliminating language confusion. In our MuST-C and CoVoST-2 experiments, it shows up to 4.66 and 4.92 BLEU scores improvement, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate the use of our task arithmetic framework can expand to a language pair where neither paired ST training data nor a pre-trained ST model is available. We first synthesize the ST system from machine translation (MT) systems via task analogy, then merge the synthesized ST system to the existing ST model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11274v1,2024-09

Bio-Inspired Mamba: Temporal Locality and Bioplausible Learning in Selective State Space Models,Jiahao Qin,"This paper introduces Bio-Inspired Mamba (BIM), a novel online learning framework for selective state space models that integrates biological learning principles with the Mamba architecture. BIM combines Real-Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)-like local learning rules, addressing the challenges of temporal locality and biological plausibility in training spiking neural networks. Our approach leverages the inherent connection between backpropagation through time and STDP, offering a computationally efficient alternative that maintains the ability to capture long-range dependencies. We evaluate BIM on language modeling, speech recognition, and biomedical signal analysis tasks, demonstrating competitive performance against traditional methods while adhering to biological learning principles. Results show improved energy efficiency and potential for neuromorphic hardware implementation. BIM not only advances the field of biologically plausible machine learning but also provides insights into the mechanisms of temporal information processing in biological neural networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11263v1,2024-09
The Art of Storytelling: Multi-Agent Generative AI for Dynamic Multimodal Narratives,"Samee Arif, Taimoor Arif, Muhammad Saad Haroon, Aamina Jamal Khan, Agha Ali Raza, Awais Athar","This paper introduces the concept of an education tool that utilizes Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to enhance storytelling for children. The system combines GenAI-driven narrative co-creation, text-to-speech conversion, and text-to-video generation to produce an engaging experience for learners. We describe the co-creation process, the adaptation of narratives into spoken words using text-to-speech models, and the transformation of these narratives into contextually relevant visuals through text-to-video technology. Our evaluation covers the linguistics of the generated stories, the text-to-speech conversion quality, and the accuracy of the generated visuals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11261v3,2024-09
Norm of Mean Contextualized Embeddings Determines their Variance,"Hiroaki Yamagiwa, Hidetoshi Shimodaira","Contextualized embeddings vary by context, even for the same token, and form a distribution in the embedding space. To analyze this distribution, we focus on the norm of the mean embedding and the variance of the embeddings. In this study, we first demonstrate that these values follow the well-known formula for variance in statistics and provide an efficient sequential computation method. Then, by observing embeddings from intermediate layers of several Transformer models, we found a strong trade-off relationship between the norm and the variance: as the mean embedding becomes closer to the origin, the variance increases. This trade-off is likely influenced by the layer normalization mechanism used in Transformer models. Furthermore, when the sets of token embeddings are treated as clusters, we show that the variance of the entire embedding set can theoretically be decomposed into the within-cluster variance and the between-cluster variance. We found experimentally that as the layers of Transformer models deepen, the embeddings move farther from the origin, the between-cluster variance relatively decreases, and the within-cluster variance relatively increases. These results are consistent with existing studies on the anisotropy of the embedding spaces across layers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11253v2,2024-09
WER We Stand: Benchmarking Urdu ASR Models,"Samee Arif, Sualeha Farid, Aamina Jamal Khan, Mustafa Abbas, Agha Ali Raza, Awais Athar","This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of Urdu Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. We analyze the performance of three ASR model families: Whisper, MMS, and Seamless-M4T using Word Error Rate (WER), along with a detailed examination of the most frequent wrong words and error types including insertions, deletions, and substitutions. Our analysis is conducted using two types of datasets, read speech and conversational speech. Notably, we present the first conversational speech dataset designed for benchmarking Urdu ASR models. We find that seamless-large outperforms other ASR models on the read speech dataset, while whisper-large performs best on the conversational speech dataset. Furthermore, this evaluation highlights the complexities of assessing ASR models for low-resource languages like Urdu using quantitative metrics alone and emphasizes the need for a robust Urdu text normalization system. Our findings contribute valuable insights for developing robust ASR systems for low-resource languages like Urdu.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11252v2,2024-09
Linear Recency Bias During Training Improves Transformers' Fit to Reading Times,"Christian Clark, Byung-Doh Oh, William Schuler","Recent psycholinguistic research has compared human reading times to surprisal estimates from language models to study the factors shaping human sentence processing difficulty. Previous studies have shown a strong fit between surprisal values from Transformers and reading times. However, standard Transformers work with a lossless representation of the entire previous linguistic context, unlike models of human language processing that include memory decay. To bridge this gap, this paper evaluates a modification of the Transformer model that uses ALiBi (Press et al., 2022), a recency bias added to attention scores. Surprisal estimates with ALiBi show an improved fit to human reading times compared to a standard Transformer baseline. A subsequent analysis of attention heads suggests that ALiBi's mixture of slopes -- which determine the rate of memory decay in each attention head -- may play a role in the improvement by helping models with ALiBi to track different kinds of linguistic dependencies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11250v1,2024-09
Measuring and Enhancing Trustworthiness of LLMs in RAG through Grounded Attributions and Learning to Refuse,"Maojia Song, Shang Hong Sim, Rishabh Bhardwaj, Hai Leong Chieu, Navonil Majumder, Soujanya Poria","LLMs are an integral component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. The LLaMA-3 family, aligned using our method, significantly outperforms open-source LLMs of similar sizes on ASQA (up 14.0), QAMPARI (up 28.9), and ELI5 (up 13.7). We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b). We release our code at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trust-align}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11242v2,2024-09
Spontaneous Informal Speech Dataset for Punctuation Restoration,"Xing Yi Liu, Homayoon Beigi","Presently, punctuation restoration models are evaluated almost solely on well-structured, scripted corpora. On the other hand, real-world ASR systems and post-processing pipelines typically apply towards spontaneous speech with significant irregularities, stutters, and deviations from perfect grammar. To address this discrepancy, we introduce SponSpeech, a punctuation restoration dataset derived from informal speech sources, which includes punctuation and casing information. In addition to publicly releasing the dataset, we contribute a filtering pipeline that can be used to generate more data. Our filtering pipeline examines the quality of both speech audio and transcription text. We also carefully construct a ``challenging"" test set, aimed at evaluating models' ability to leverage audio information to predict otherwise grammatically ambiguous punctuation. SponSpeech is available at https://github.com/GitHubAccountAnonymous/PR, along with all code for dataset building and model runs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11241v1,2024-09
LLM-as-a-Judge & Reward Model: What They Can and Cannot Do,"Guijin Son, Hyunwoo Ko, Hoyoung Lee, Yewon Kim, Seunghyeok Hong","LLM-as-a-Judge and reward models are widely used alternatives of multiple-choice questions or human annotators for large language model (LLM) evaluation. Their efficacy shines in evaluating long-form responses, serving a critical role as evaluators of leaderboards and as proxies to align LLMs via reinforcement learning. However, despite their popularity, their effectiveness in diverse contexts, such as non-English prompts, factual verification, or challenging questions, remains unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of automated evaluators, reporting several key findings on their behavior. First, we discover that English evaluation capabilities significantly influence language-specific evaluation capabilities, often more than the language proficiency itself, enabling evaluators trained in English to easily transfer their skills to other languages. Second, we identify critical shortcomings, where LLMs fail to detect and penalize errors, such as factual inaccuracies, cultural misrepresentations, and the presence of unwanted language. Finally, we find that state-of-the-art evaluators struggle with challenging prompts, in either English or Korean, underscoring their limitations in assessing or generating complex reasoning questions. We release the dataset and codes used.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11239v2,2024-09
Surveying the MLLM Landscape: A Meta-Review of Current Surveys,"Ming Li, Keyu Chen, Ziqian Bi, Ming Liu, Benji Peng, Qian Niu, Junyu Liu, Jinlang Wang, Sen Zhang, Xuanhe Pan, Jiawei Xu, Pohsun Feng","The rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has become a transformative force in the field of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to process and generate content across multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and video. These models represent a significant advancement over traditional unimodal systems, opening new frontiers in diverse applications ranging from autonomous agents to medical diagnostics. By integrating multiple modalities, MLLMs achieve a more holistic understanding of information, closely mimicking human perception. As the capabilities of MLLMs expand, the need for comprehensive and accurate performance evaluation has become increasingly critical. This survey aims to provide a systematic review of benchmark tests and evaluation methods for MLLMs, covering key topics such as foundational concepts, applications, evaluation methodologies, ethical concerns, security, efficiency, and domain-specific applications. Through the classification and analysis of existing literature, we summarize the main contributions and methodologies of various surveys, conduct a detailed comparative analysis, and examine their impact within the academic community. Additionally, we identify emerging trends and underexplored areas in MLLM research, proposing potential directions for future studies.

Evaluating the Impact of Compression Techniques on Task-Specific Performance of Large Language Models,"Bishwash Khanal, Jeffery M. Capone","Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities but incur substantial computational costs, driving the need for efficient compression techniques. This study evaluates the impact of popular compression methods - Magnitude Pruning, SparseGPT, and Wanda - on the LLaMA-2-7B model, focusing on the trade-offs between model size reduction, downstream task performance, and the role of calibration data. Our findings reveal that while SparseGPT and Wanda preserve perplexity even at 50% sparsity, they suffer significant degradation on downstream tasks, highlighting the inadequacy of perplexity as the sole evaluation metric. To address this, we introduce Jensen-Shannon (JS) Divergence as a more comprehensive metric that captures nuanced changes in model behavior post-compression. We further demonstrate that task-specific calibration data significantly enhances the downstream performance of compressed models compared to general calibration data. This research underscores the necessity for diverse evaluation metrics and careful calibration data selection to fully understand the complexities of LLM compression and its implications for practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11233v1,2024-09
Fast Analysis of the OpenAI O1-Preview Model in Solving Random K-SAT Problem: Does the LLM Solve the Problem Itself or Call an External SAT Solver?,Raffaele Marino,"In this manuscript, I present an analysis on the performance of OpenAI O1-preview model in solving random K-SAT instances for K$\in {2,3,4}$ as a function of $\alpha=M/N$ where $M$ is the number of clauses and $N$ is the number of variables of the satisfiable problem. I show that the model can call an external SAT solver to solve the instances, rather than solving them directly. Despite using external solvers, the model reports incorrect assignments as output. Moreover, I propose and present an analysis to quantify whether the OpenAI O1-preview model demonstrates a spark of intelligence or merely makes random guesses when outputting an assignment for a Boolean satisfiability problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11232v2,2024-09
Exploring ChatGPT-based Augmentation Strategies for Contrastive Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Lingling Xu, Haoran Xie, S. Joe Qin, Fu Lee Wang, Xiaohui Tao","Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) involves identifying sentiment towards specific aspect terms in a sentence and allows us to uncover nuanced perspectives and attitudes on particular aspects of a product, service, or topic. However, the scarcity of labeled data poses a significant challenge to training high-quality models. To address this issue, we explore the potential of data augmentation using ChatGPT, a well-performing large language model (LLM), to enhance the sentiment classification performance towards aspect terms. Specifically, we explore three data augmentation strategies based on ChatGPT: context-focused, aspect-focused, and context-aspect data augmentation techniques. Context-focused data augmentation focuses on changing the word expression of context words in the sentence while keeping aspect terms unchanged. In contrast, aspect-focused data augmentation aims to change aspect terms but keep context words unchanged. Context-Aspect data augmentation integrates the above two data augmentations to generate augmented samples. Furthermore, we incorporate contrastive learning into the ABSA tasks to improve performance. Extensive experiments show that all three data augmentation techniques lead to performance improvements, with the context-aspect data augmentation strategy performing best and surpassing the performance of the baseline models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11218v1,2024-09
Self-Evolutionary Large Language Models through Uncertainty-Enhanced Preference Optimization,"Jianing Wang, Yang Zhou, Xiaocheng Zhang, Mengjiao Bao, Peng Yan","Iterative preference optimization has recently become one of the de-facto training paradigms for large language models (LLMs), but the performance is still underwhelming due to too much noisy preference data yielded in the loop. To combat this issue, we present an \textbf{U}ncertainty-enhanced \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (UPO) framework to make the LLM self-evolve with reliable feedback. The key idea is mitigating the noisy preference data derived from the current policy and reward models by performing pair-wise uncertainty estimation and judiciously reliable feedback sampling. To reach this goal, we thus introduce an estimator model, which incorporates Monte Carlo (MC) dropout in Bayesian neural network (BNN) to perform uncertainty estimation for the preference data derived from the LLM policy. Compared to the existing methods that directly filter generated responses based on the reward score, the estimator focuses on the model uncertainty in a pair-wise manner and effectively bypasses the confirmation bias problem of the reward model. Additionally, we also propose an uncertainty-enhanced self-evolution algorithm to improve the robustness of preference optimization and encourage the LLM to generate responses with both high reward and certainty. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our framework substantially alleviates the noisy problem and improves the performance of iterative preference optimization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11212v1,2024-09
Mind the Uncertainty in Human Disagreement: Evaluating Discrepancies between Model Predictions and Human Responses in VQA,"Jian Lan, Diego Frassinelli, Barbara Plank","Large vision-language models frequently struggle to accurately predict responses provided by multiple human annotators, particularly when those responses exhibit human uncertainty. In this study, we focus on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, and we comprehensively evaluate how well the state-of-the-art vision-language models correlate with the distribution of human responses. To do so, we categorize our samples based on their levels (low, medium, high) of human uncertainty in disagreement (HUD) and employ not only accuracy but also three new human-correlated metrics in VQA, to investigate the impact of HUD. To better align models with humans, we also verify the effect of common calibration and human calibration. Our results show that even BEiT3, currently the best model for this task, struggles to capture the multi-label distribution inherent in diverse human responses. Additionally, we observe that the commonly used accuracy-oriented calibration technique adversely affects BEiT3's ability to capture HUD, further widening the gap between model predictions and human distributions. In contrast, we show the benefits of calibrating models towards human distributions for VQA, better aligning model confidence with human uncertainty. Our findings highlight that for VQA, the consistent alignment between human responses and model predictions is understudied and should become the next crucial target of future studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02773v1,2024-09
Capturing Differences in Character Representations Between Communities: An Initial Study with Fandom,Bianca N. Y. Kang,"Sociolinguistic theories have highlighted how narratives are often retold, co-constructed and reconceptualized in collaborative settings. This working paper focuses on the re-interpretation of characters, an integral part of the narrative story-world, and attempts to study how this may be computationally compared between online communities. Using online fandom - a highly communal phenomenon that has been largely studied qualitatively - as data, computational methods were applied to explore shifts in character representations between two communities and the original text. Specifically, text from the Harry Potter novels, r/HarryPotter subreddit, and fanfiction on Archive of Our Own were analyzed for changes in character mentions, centrality measures from co-occurrence networks, and semantic associations. While fandom elevates secondary characters as found in past work, the two fan communities prioritize different subsets of characters. Word embedding tests reveal starkly different associations of the same characters between communities on the gendered concepts of femininity/masculinity, cruelty, and beauty. Furthermore, fanfiction descriptions of a male character analyzed between romance pairings scored higher for feminine-coded characteristics in male-male romance, matching past qualitative theorizing. The results high-light the potential for computational methods to assist in capturing the re-conceptualization of narrative elements across communities and in supporting qualitative research on fandom.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11170v1,2024-09
SAGED: A Holistic Bias-Benchmarking Pipeline for Language Models with Customisable Fairness Calibration,"Xin Guan, Nathaniel Demchak, Saloni Gupta, Ze Wang, Ediz Ertekin Jr., Adriano Koshiyama, Emre Kazim, Zekun Wu","The development of unbiased large language models is widely recognized as crucial, yet existing benchmarks fall short in detecting biases due to limited scope, contamination, and lack of a fairness baseline. SAGED(bias) is the first holistic benchmarking pipeline to address these problems. The pipeline encompasses five core stages: scraping materials, assembling benchmarks, generating responses, extracting numeric features, and diagnosing with disparity metrics. SAGED includes metrics for max disparity, such as impact ratio, and bias concentration, such as Max Z-scores. Noticing that metric tool bias and contextual bias in prompts can distort evaluation, SAGED implements counterfactual branching and baseline calibration for mitigation. For demonstration, we use SAGED on G20 Countries with popular 8b-level models including Gemma2, Llama3.1, Mistral, and Qwen2. With sentiment analysis, we find that while Mistral and Qwen2 show lower max disparity and higher bias concentration than Gemma2 and Llama3.1, all models are notably biased against countries like Russia and (except for Qwen2) China. With further experiments to have models role-playing U.S. presidents, we see bias amplifies and shifts in heterogeneous directions. Moreover, we see Qwen2 and Mistral not engage in role-playing, while Llama3.1 and Gemma2 role-play Trump notably more intensively than Biden and Harris, indicating role-playing performance bias in these models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11149v6,2024-09
Improving the Efficiency of Visually Augmented Language Models,"Paula Ontalvilla, Aitor Ormazabal, Gorka Azkune","Despite the impressive performance of autoregressive Language Models (LM) it has been shown that due to reporting bias, LMs lack visual knowledge, i.e. they do not know much about the visual world and its properties. To augment LMs with visual knowledge, existing solutions often rely on explicit images, requiring time-consuming retrieval or image generation systems. This paper shows that explicit images are not necessary to visually augment an LM. Instead, we use visually-grounded text representations obtained from the well-known CLIP multimodal system. For a fair comparison, we modify VALM, a visually-augmented LM which uses image retrieval and representation, to work directly with visually-grounded text representations. We name this new model BLIND-VALM. We show that BLIND-VALM performs on par with VALM for Visual Language Understanding (VLU), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Language Modeling tasks, despite being significantly more efficient and simpler. We also show that scaling up our model within the compute budget of VALM, either increasing the model or pre-training corpus size, we outperform VALM for all the evaluation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11148v3,2024-09
Reasoning Graph Enhanced Exemplars Retrieval for In-Context Learning,"Yukang Lin, Bingchen Zhong, Shuoran Jiang, Joanna Siebert, Qingcai Chen","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable few-shot learning capabilities and unified the paradigm of NLP tasks through the in-context learning (ICL) technique. Despite the success of ICL, the quality of the exemplar demonstrations can significantly influence the LLM's performance. Existing exemplar selection methods mainly focus on the semantic similarity between queries and candidate exemplars. On the other hand, the logical connections between reasoning steps can be beneficial to depict the problem-solving process as well. In this paper, we proposes a novel method named Reasoning Graph-enhanced Exemplar Retrieval (RGER). RGER first quires LLM to generate an initial response, then expresses intermediate problem-solving steps to a graph structure. After that, it employs graph kernel to select exemplars with semantic and structural similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the structural relationship is helpful to the alignment of queries and candidate exemplars. The efficacy of RGER on math and logit reasoning tasks showcases its superiority over state-of-the-art retrieval-based approaches.

Semformer: Transformer Language Models with Semantic Planning,"Yongjing Yin, Junran Ding, Kai Song, Yue Zhang","Next-token prediction serves as the dominant component in current neural language models. During the training phase, the model employs teacher forcing, which predicts tokens based on all preceding ground truth tokens. However, this approach has been found to create shortcuts, utilizing the revealed prefix to spuriously fit future tokens, potentially compromising the accuracy of the next-token predictor. In this paper, we introduce Semformer, a novel method of training a Transformer language model that explicitly models the semantic planning of response. Specifically, we incorporate a sequence of planning tokens into the prefix, guiding the planning token representations to predict the latent semantic representations of the response, which are induced by an autoencoder. In a minimal planning task (i.e., graph path-finding), our model exhibits near-perfect performance and effectively mitigates shortcut learning, a feat that standard training methods and baseline models have been unable to accomplish. Furthermore, we pretrain Semformer from scratch with 125M parameters, demonstrating its efficacy through measures of perplexity, in-context learning, and fine-tuning on summarization tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11143v1,2024-09
SC-Phi2: A Fine-tuned Small Language Model for StarCraft II Macromanagement Tasks,"Muhammad Junaid Khan, Gita Sukthankar","This paper introduces SC-Phi2, a fine-tuned StarCraft II small language model for macromanagement tasks. Small language models, like Phi2, Gemma, and DistilBERT, are streamlined versions of large language models (LLMs) with fewer parameters that require less power and memory to run. To teach Microsoft's Phi2 model about StarCraft, we create a new SC2 text dataset with information about StarCraft races, roles, and actions and use it to fine-tune Phi-2 with self-supervised learning. We pair this language model with a Vision Transformer (ViT) from the pre-trained BLIP-2 (Bootstrapping Language Image Pre-training) model, fine-tuning it on the MSC replay dataset. This enables us to construct dynamic prompts that include visual game state information. Unlike the large models used in StarCraft LLMs such as GPT-3.5, Phi2 is trained primarily on textbook data and contains little inherent knowledge of StarCraft II beyond what is provided by our training process. By using LoRA (Low-rank Adaptation) and quantization, our model can be trained on a single GPU. We demonstrate that our model performs well at micromanagement tasks such as build order and global state prediction with a small number of parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18989v1,2024-09
Promptriever: Instruction-Trained Retrievers Can Be Prompted Like Language Models,"Orion Weller, Benjamin Van Durme, Dawn Lawrie, Ashwin Paranjape, Yuhao Zhang, Jack Hessel","Instruction-tuned language models (LM) are able to respond to imperative commands, providing a more natural user interface compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we present Promptriever, the first retrieval model able to be prompted like an LM. To train Promptriever, we curate and release a new instance-level instruction training set from MS MARCO, spanning nearly 500k instances. Promptriever not only achieves strong performance on standard retrieval tasks, but also follows instructions. We observe: (1) large gains (reaching SoTA) on following detailed relevance instructions (+14.3 p-MRR / +3.1 nDCG on FollowIR), (2) significantly increased robustness to lexical choices/phrasing in the query+instruction (+12.9 Robustness@10 on InstructIR), and (3) the ability to perform hyperparameter search via prompting to reliably improve retrieval performance (+1.4 average increase on BEIR). Promptriever demonstrates that retrieval models can be controlled with prompts on a per-query basis, setting the stage for future work aligning LM prompting techniques with information retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11136v1,2024-09
Diversity-grounded Channel Prototypical Learning for Out-of-Distribution Intent Detection,"Bo Liu, Liming Zhan, Yujie Feng, Zexin Lu, Chengqiang Xie, Lei Xue, Albert Y. S. Lam, Xiao-Ming Wu","In the realm of task-oriented dialogue systems, a robust intent detection mechanism must effectively handle malformed utterances encountered in real-world scenarios. This study presents a novel fine-tuning framework for large language models (LLMs) aimed at enhancing in-distribution (ID) intent classification and out-of-distribution (OOD) intent detection, which utilizes semantic matching with prototypes derived from ID class names. By harnessing the highly distinguishable representations of LLMs, we construct semantic prototypes for each ID class using a diversity-grounded prompt tuning approach. We rigorously test our framework in a challenging OOD context, where ID and OOD classes are semantically close yet distinct, referred to as \emph{near} OOD detection. For a thorough assessment, we benchmark our method against the prevalent fine-tuning approaches. The experimental findings reveal that our method demonstrates superior performance in both few-shot ID intent classification and near-OOD intent detection tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11114v2,2024-09
Strategic Insights in Human and Large Language Model Tactics at Word Guessing Games,"Matīss Rikters, Sanita Reinsone","At the beginning of 2022, a simplistic word-guessing game took the world by storm and was further adapted to many languages beyond the original English version. In this paper, we examine the strategies of daily word-guessing game players that have evolved during a period of over two years. A survey gathered from 25% of frequent players reveals their strategies and motivations for continuing the daily journey. We also explore the capability of several popular open-access large language model systems and open-source models at comprehending and playing the game in two different languages. Results highlight the struggles of certain models to maintain correct guess length and generate repetitions, as well as hallucinations of non-existent words and inflections.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11112v2,2024-09
RoMath: A Mathematical Reasoning Benchmark in Romanian,"Adrian Cosma, Ana-Maria Bucur, Emilian Radoi","Mathematics has long been conveyed through natural language, primarily for human understanding. With the rise of mechanized mathematics and proof assistants, there is a growing need to understand informal mathematical text, yet most existing benchmarks focus solely on English, overlooking other languages. This paper introduces RoMath, a Romanian mathematical reasoning benchmark suite comprising three datasets: RoMath-Baccalaureate, RoMath-Competitions and RoMath-Synthetic, which cover a range of mathematical domains and difficulty levels, aiming to improve non-English language models and promote multilingual AI development. By focusing on Romanian, a low-resource language with unique linguistic features, RoMath addresses the limitations of Anglo-centric models and emphasizes the need for dedicated resources beyond simple automatic translation.

KVPruner: Structural Pruning for Faster and Memory-Efficient Large Language Models,"Bo Lv, Quan Zhou, Xuanang Ding, Yan Wang, Zeming Ma","The bottleneck associated with the key-value(KV) cache presents a significant challenge during the inference processes of large language models. While depth pruning accelerates inference, it requires extensive recovery training, which can take up to two weeks. On the other hand, width pruning retains much of the performance but offers slight speed gains. To tackle these challenges, we propose KVPruner to improve model efficiency while maintaining performance. Our method uses global perplexity-based analysis to determine the importance ratio for each block and provides multiple strategies to prune non-essential KV channels within blocks. Compared to the original model, KVPruner reduces runtime memory usage by 50% and boosts throughput by over 35%. Additionally, our method requires only two hours of LoRA fine-tuning on small datasets to recover most of the performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11057v1,2024-09
Large Language Models are Good Multi-lingual Learners : When LLMs Meet Cross-lingual Prompts,"Teng Wang, Zhenqi He, Wing-Yin Yu, Xiaojin Fu, Xiongwei Han","With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), generating rule-based data for real-world applications has become more accessible. Due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language and the complexity of rule sets, especially in long contexts, LLMs often struggle to follow all specified rules, frequently omitting at least one. To enhance the reasoning and understanding of LLMs on long and complex contexts, we propose a novel prompting strategy Multi-Lingual Prompt, namely MLPrompt, which automatically translates the error-prone rule that an LLM struggles to follow into another language, thus drawing greater attention to it. Experimental results on public datasets across various tasks have shown MLPrompt can outperform state-of-the-art prompting methods such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, and Self-Consistency. Additionally, we introduce a framework integrating MLPrompt with an auto-checking mechanism for structured data generation, with a specific case study in text-to-MIP instances. Further, we extend the proposed framework for text-to-SQL to demonstrate its generation ability towards structured data synthesis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11056v1,2024-09
A Comprehensive Evaluation of Quantized Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models: An Experimental Analysis up to 405B,"Jemin Lee, Sihyeong Park, Jinse Kwon, Jihun Oh, Yongin Kwon","Prior research works have evaluated quantized LLMs using limited metrics such as perplexity or a few basic knowledge tasks and old datasets. Additionally, recent large-scale models such as Llama 3.1 with up to 405B have not been thoroughly examined. This paper evaluates the performance of instruction-tuned LLMs across various quantization methods (GPTQ, AWQ, SmoothQuant, and FP8) on models ranging from 7B to 405B. Using 13 benchmarks, we assess performance across six task types: commonsense Q\&A, knowledge and language understanding, instruction following, hallucination detection, mathematics, and dialogue. Our key findings reveal that (1) quantizing a larger LLM to a similar size as a smaller FP16 LLM generally performs better across most benchmarks, except for hallucination detection and instruction following; (2) performance varies significantly with different quantization methods, model size, and bit-width, with weight-only methods often yielding better results in larger models; (3) task difficulty does not significantly impact accuracy degradation due to quantization; and (4) the MT-Bench evaluation method has limited discriminatory power among recent high-performing LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11055v1,2024-09
Towards No-Code Programming of Cobots: Experiments with Code Synthesis by Large Code Models for Conversational Programming,"Chalamalasetti Kranti, Sherzod Hakimov, David Schlangen","While there has been a lot of research recently on robots in household environments, at the present time, most robots in existence can be found on shop floors, and most interactions between humans and robots happen there. ``Collaborative robots'' (cobots) designed to work alongside humans on assembly lines traditionally require expert programming, limiting ability to make changes, or manual guidance, limiting expressivity of the resulting programs. To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the ``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer' instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions (human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate `first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing `higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11041v2,2024-09
Hierarchical Narrative Analysis: Unraveling Perceptions of Generative AI,"Riona Matsuoka, Hiroki Matsumoto, Takahiro Yoshida, Tomohiro Watanabe, Ryoma Kondo, Ryohei Hisano","Written texts reflect an author's perspective, making the thorough analysis of literature a key research method in fields such as the humanities and social sciences. However, conventional text mining techniques like sentiment analysis and topic modeling are limited in their ability to capture the hierarchical narrative structures that reveal deeper argumentative patterns. To address this gap, we propose a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract and organize these structures into a hierarchical framework. We validate this approach by analyzing public opinions on generative AI collected by Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs, comparing the narratives of supporters and critics. Our analysis provides clearer visualization of the factors influencing divergent opinions on generative AI, offering deeper insights into the structures of agreement and disagreement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11032v3,2024-09
GEIC: Universal and Multilingual Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models,"Hanjun Luo, Yingbin Jin, Xuecheng Liu, Tong Shang, Ruizhe Chen, Zuozhu Liu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have supplanted traditional methods in numerous natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, in Named Entity Recognition (NER), existing LLM-based methods underperform compared to baselines and require significantly more computational resources, limiting their application. In this paper, we introduce the task of generation-based extraction and in-context classification (GEIC), designed to leverage LLMs' prior knowledge and self-attention mechanisms for NER tasks. We then propose CascadeNER, a universal and multilingual GEIC framework for few-shot and zero-shot NER. CascadeNER employs model cascading to utilize two small-parameter LLMs to extract and classify independently, reducing resource consumption while enhancing accuracy. We also introduce AnythingNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs, including 8 languages, 155 entity types and a novel dynamic categorization system. Experiments show that CascadeNER achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-resource and fine-grained scenarios, including CrossNER and FewNERD. Our work is openly accessible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11022v3,2024-09
CAST: Cross-modal Alignment Similarity Test for Vision Language Models,"Gautier Dagan, Olga Loginova, Anil Batra","Vision Language Models (VLMs) are typically evaluated with Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks which assess a model's understanding of scenes. Good VQA performance is taken as evidence that the model will perform well on a broader range of tasks that require both visual and language inputs. However, scene-aware VQA does not fully capture input biases or assess hallucinations caused by a misalignment between modalities. To address this, we propose a Cross-modal Alignment Similarity Test (CAST) to probe VLMs for self-consistency across modalities. This test involves asking the models to identify similarities between two scenes through text-only, image-only, or both and then assess the truthfulness of the similarities they generate. Since there is no ground-truth to compare against, this evaluation does not focus on objective accuracy but rather on whether VLMs are internally consistent in their outputs. We argue that while not all self-consistent models are capable or accurate, all capable VLMs must be self-consistent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11007v1,2024-09
Enhancing Low-Resource Language and Instruction Following Capabilities of Audio Language Models,"Potsawee Manakul, Guangzhi Sun, Warit Sirichotedumrong, Kasima Tharnpipitchai, Kunat Pipatanakul","Audio language models can understand audio inputs and perform a range of audio-related tasks based on instructions, such as speech recognition and audio captioning, where the instructions are usually textual prompts. Audio language models are mostly initialized from pre-trained audio encoders and large language models (LLMs). Although these pre-trained components were developed to support multiple languages, audio-language models are trained predominantly on English data, which may limit their usability to only English instructions or English speech inputs. First, this paper examines the performance of existing audio language models in an underserved language using Thai as an example. This paper demonstrates that, despite being built on multilingual backbones, audio language models do not exhibit cross-lingual emergent abilities to low-resource languages. Second, this paper studies data mixture for developing audio language models that are optimized for a target language as well as English. In addition. this paper integrates audio comprehension and speech instruction-following capabilities into a single unified model. Our experiments provide insights into data mixture for enhancing instruction-following capabilities in both a low-resource language and English. Our model, Typhoon-Audio, outperforms existing open-source audio language models by a considerable margin, and it is comparable to state-of-the-art Gemini-1.5-Pro in both English and Thai languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10999v1,2024-09
Contextual Breach: Assessing the Robustness of Transformer-based QA Models,"Asir Saadat, Nahian Ibn Asad, Md Farhan Ishmam","Contextual question-answering models are susceptible to adversarial perturbations to input context, commonly observed in real-world scenarios. These adversarial noises are designed to degrade the performance of the model by distorting the textual input. We introduce a unique dataset that incorporates seven distinct types of adversarial noise into the context, each applied at five different intensity levels on the SQuAD dataset. To quantify the robustness, we utilize robustness metrics providing a standardized measure for assessing model performance across varying noise types and levels. Experiments on transformer-based question-answering models reveal robustness vulnerabilities and important insights into the model's performance in realistic textual input.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10997v3,2024-09
Less is More: A Simple yet Effective Token Reduction Method for Efficient Multi-modal LLMs,"Dingjie Song, Wenjun Wang, Shunian Chen, Xidong Wang, Michael Guan, Benyou Wang","The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has led to remarkable performances across various domains. However, this progress is accompanied by a substantial surge in the resource consumption of these models. We address this pressing issue by introducing a new approach, Token Reduction using CLIP Metric (TRIM), aimed at improving the efficiency of MLLMs without sacrificing their performance. Inspired by human attention patterns in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, TRIM presents a fresh perspective on the selection and reduction of image tokens. The TRIM method has been extensively tested across 12 datasets, and the results demonstrate a significant reduction in computational overhead while maintaining a consistent level of performance. This research marks a critical stride in efficient MLLM development, promoting greater accessibility and sustainability of high-performing models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10994v3,2024-09
GOSt-MT: A Knowledge Graph for Occupation-related Gender Biases in Machine Translation,"Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Filandrianos, Eva Tsouparopoulou, Dimitris Parsanoglou, Maria Symeonaki, Giorgos Stamou","Gender bias in machine translation (MT) systems poses significant challenges that often result in the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. Especially in the labour domain where frequently occupations are inaccurately associated with specific genders, such biases perpetuate traditional gender stereotypes with a significant impact on society. Addressing these issues is crucial for ensuring equitable and accurate MT systems. This paper introduces a novel approach to studying occupation-related gender bias through the creation of the GOSt-MT (Gender and Occupation Statistics for Machine Translation) Knowledge Graph. GOSt-MT integrates comprehensive gender statistics from real-world labour data and textual corpora used in MT training. This Knowledge Graph allows for a detailed analysis of gender bias across English, French, and Greek, facilitating the identification of persistent stereotypes and areas requiring intervention. By providing a structured framework for understanding how occupations are gendered in both labour markets and MT systems, GOSt-MT contributes to efforts aimed at making MT systems more equitable and reducing gender biases in automated translations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10989v2,2024-09
Improving Speech Emotion Recognition in Under-Resourced Languages via Speech-to-Speech Translation with Bootstrapping Data Selection,"Hsi-Che Lin, Yi-Cheng Lin, Huang-Cheng Chou, Hung-yi Lee","Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a crucial component in developing general-purpose AI agents capable of natural human-computer interaction. However, building robust multilingual SER systems remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data in languages other than English and Chinese. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance SER performance in low SER resource languages by leveraging data from high-resource languages. Specifically, we employ expressive Speech-to-Speech translation (S2ST) combined with a novel bootstrapping data selection pipeline to generate labeled data in the target language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and generalizable across different upstream models and languages. Our results suggest that this approach can facilitate the development of more scalable and robust multilingual SER systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10985v2,2024-09
Enhancing Multilingual Speech Generation and Recognition Abilities in LLMs with Constructed Code-switched Data,"Jing Xu, Daxin Tan, Jiaqi Wang, Xiao Chen","While large language models (LLMs) have been explored in the speech domain for both generation and recognition tasks, their applications are predominantly confined to the monolingual scenario, with limited exploration in multilingual and code-switched (CS) contexts. Additionally, speech generation and recognition tasks are often handled separately, such as VALL-E and Qwen-Audio. In this paper, we propose a MutltiLingual MultiTask (MLMT) model, integrating multilingual speech generation and recognition tasks within the single LLM. Furthermore, we develop an effective data construction approach that splits and concatenates words from different languages to equip LLMs with CS synthesis ability without relying on CS data. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms other baselines with a comparable data scale. Furthermore, our data construction approach not only equips LLMs with CS speech synthesis capability with comparable speaker consistency and similarity to any given speaker, but also improves the performance of LLMs in multilingual speech generation and recognition tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10969v1,2024-09
Cross-lingual transfer of multilingual models on low resource African Languages,"Harish Thangaraj, Ananya Chenat, Jaskaran Singh Walia, Vukosi Marivate","Large multilingual models have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) research. However, their high resource demands and potential biases from diverse data sources have raised concerns about their effectiveness across low-resource languages. In contrast, monolingual models, trained on a single language, may better capture the nuances of the target language, potentially providing more accurate results. This study benchmarks the cross-lingual transfer capabilities from a high-resource language to a low-resource language for both, monolingual and multilingual models, focusing on Kinyarwanda and Kirundi, two Bantu languages. We evaluate the performance of transformer based architectures like Multilingual BERT (mBERT), AfriBERT, and BantuBERTa against neural-based architectures such as BiGRU, CNN, and char-CNN. The models were trained on Kinyarwanda and tested on Kirundi, with fine-tuning applied to assess the extent of performance improvement and catastrophic forgetting. AfriBERT achieved the highest cross-lingual accuracy of 88.3% after fine-tuning, while BiGRU emerged as the best-performing neural model with 83.3% accuracy. We also analyze the degree of forgetting in the original language post-fine-tuning. While monolingual models remain competitive, this study highlights that multilingual models offer strong cross-lingual transfer capabilities in resource limited settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10965v1,2024-09
Investigating Context-Faithfulness in Large Language Models: The Roles of Memory Strength and Evidence Style,"Yuepei Li, Kang Zhou, Qiao Qiao, Bach Nguyen, Qing Wang, Qi Li","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external information into the response generation process. However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs' context-faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness to external evidence. We introduce a method to quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to evaluate the effects of evidence in different styles. Two datasets are used for evaluation: Natural Questions (NQ) with popular questions and popQA featuring long-tail questions. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory, particularly for larger LLMs such as GPT-4. On the other hand, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10955v1,2024-09
Propulsion: Steering LLM with Tiny Fine-Tuning,"Md Kowsher, Nusrat Jahan Prottasha, Prakash Bhat","The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and related fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific tasks remains computationally expensive and risks degrading pre-learned features. To address these challenges, we propose Propulsion, a novel parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method designed to optimize task-specific performance while drastically reducing computational overhead. Inspired by the concept of controlled adjustments in physical motion, Propulsion selectively re-scales specific dimensions of a pre-trained model, guiding output predictions toward task objectives without modifying the model's parameters. By introducing lightweight, trainable Propulsion parameters at the pre-trained layer, we minimize the number of parameters updated during fine-tuning, preventing overfitting or overwriting of existing knowledge. Our theoretical analysis, supported by Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, shows that Propulsion approximates the performance of full fine-tuning with far fewer trainable parameters. Empirically, Propulsion reduces the parameter count from 355.3 million to just 0.086 million, achieving over a 10x reduction compared to standard approaches like LoRA while maintaining competitive performance across benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10927v3,2024-09
GenCRF: Generative Clustering and Reformulation Framework for Enhanced Intent-Driven Information Retrieval,"Wonduk Seo, Haojie Zhang, Yueyang Zhang, Changhao Zhang, Songyao Duan, Lixin Su, Daiting Shi, Jiashu Zhao, Dawei Yin","Query reformulation is a well-known problem in Information Retrieval (IR) aimed at enhancing single search successful completion rate by automatically modifying user's input query. Recent methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve query reformulation, but often generate limited and redundant expansions, potentially constraining their effectiveness in capturing diverse intents. In this paper, we propose GenCRF: a Generative Clustering and Reformulation Framework to capture diverse intentions adaptively based on multiple differentiated, well-generated queries in the retrieval phase for the first time. GenCRF leverages LLMs to generate variable queries from the initial query using customized prompts, then clusters them into groups to distinctly represent diverse intents. Furthermore, the framework explores to combine diverse intents query with innovative weighted aggregation strategies to optimize retrieval performance and crucially integrates a novel Query Evaluation Rewarding Model (QERM) to refine the process through feedback loops. Empirical experiments on the BEIR benchmark demonstrate that GenCRF achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous query reformulation SOTAs by up to 12% on nDCG@10. These techniques can be adapted to various LLMs, significantly boosting retriever performance and advancing the field of Information Retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10909v1,2024-09
Attention-Seeker: Dynamic Self-Attention Scoring for Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction,"Erwin D. López Z., Cheng Tang, Atsushi Shimada","This paper proposes Attention-Seeker, an unsupervised keyphrase extraction method that leverages self-attention maps from a Large Language Model to estimate the importance of candidate phrases. Our approach identifies specific components - such as layers, heads, and attention vectors - where the model pays significant attention to the key topics of the text. The attention weights provided by these components are then used to score the candidate phrases. Unlike previous models that require manual tuning of parameters (e.g., selection of heads, prompts, hyperparameters), Attention-Seeker dynamically adapts to the input text without any manual adjustments, enhancing its practical applicability. We evaluate Attention-Seeker on four publicly available datasets: Inspec, SemEval2010, SemEval2017, and Krapivin. Our results demonstrate that, even without parameter tuning, Attention-Seeker outperforms most baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three out of four datasets, particularly excelling in extracting keyphrases from long documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10907v2,2024-09
A Joint Spectro-Temporal Relational Thinking Based Acoustic Modeling Framework,"Zheng Nan, Ting Dang, Vidhyasaharan Sethu, Beena Ahmed","Relational thinking refers to the inherent ability of humans to form mental impressions about relations between sensory signals and prior knowledge, and subsequently incorporate them into their model of their world. Despite the crucial role relational thinking plays in human understanding of speech, it has yet to be leveraged in any artificial speech recognition systems. Recently, there have been some attempts to correct this oversight, but these have been limited to coarse utterance-level models that operate exclusively in the time domain. In an attempt to narrow the gap between artificial systems and human abilities, this paper presents a novel spectro-temporal relational thinking based acoustic modeling framework. Specifically, it first generates numerous probabilistic graphs to model the relationships among speech segments across both time and frequency domains. The relational information rooted in every pair of nodes within these graphs is then aggregated and embedded into latent representations that can be utilized by downstream tasks. Models built upon this framework outperform state-of-the-art systems with a 7.82\% improvement in phoneme recognition tasks over the TIMIT dataset. In-depth analyses further reveal that our proposed relational thinking modeling mainly improves the model's ability to recognize vowels, which are the most likely to be confused by phoneme recognizers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15357v1,2024-09
A Unified Framework to Classify Business Activities into International Standard Industrial Classification through Large Language Models for Circular Economy,"Xiang Li, Lan Zhao, Junhao Ren, Yajuan Sun, Chuan Fu Tan, Zhiquan Yeo, Gaoxi Xiao","Effective information gathering and knowledge codification are pivotal for developing recommendation systems that promote circular economy practices. One promising approach involves the creation of a centralized knowledge repository cataloguing historical waste-to-resource transactions, which subsequently enables the generation of recommendations based on past successes. However, a significant barrier to constructing such a knowledge repository lies in the absence of a universally standardized framework for representing business activities across disparate geographical regions. To address this challenge, this paper leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to classify textual data describing economic activities into the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC), a globally recognized economic activity classification framework. This approach enables any economic activity descriptions provided by businesses worldwide to be categorized into the unified ISIC standard, facilitating the creation of a centralized knowledge repository. Our approach achieves a 95% accuracy rate on a 182-label test dataset with fine-tuned GPT-2 model. This research contributes to the global endeavour of fostering sustainable circular economy practices by providing a standardized foundation for knowledge codification and recommendation systems deployable across regions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18988v1,2024-09

In this paper, we introduce CREAM (Comparison-Based Reference-Free Elo-Ranked Automatic Evaluation for Meeting Summarization), a novel framework that addresses the unique challenges of evaluating meeting summaries. CREAM leverages a combination of chain-of-thought reasoning and key facts alignment to assess conciseness and completeness of model-generated summaries without requiring reference.

American Sign Language to Text Translation using Transformer and Seq2Seq with LSTM,"Gregorius Guntur Sunardi Putra, Adifa Widyadhani Chanda D'Layla, Dimas Wahono, Riyanarto Sarno, Agus Tri Haryono","Sign language translation is one of the important issues in communication between deaf and hearing people, as it expresses words through hand, body, and mouth movements. American Sign Language is one of the sign languages used, one of which is the alphabetic sign. The development of neural machine translation technology is moving towards sign language translation. Transformer became the state-of-the-art in natural language processing. This study compares the Transformer with the Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model in translating sign language to text. In addition, an experiment was conducted by adding Residual Long Short-Term Memory (ResidualLSTM) in the Transformer. The addition of ResidualLSTM to the Transformer reduces the performance of the Transformer model by 23.37% based on the BLEU Score value.

Adaptive Large Language Models By Layerwise Attention Shortcuts,"Prateek Verma, Mert Pilanci","Transformer architectures are the backbone of the modern AI revolution. However, they are based on simply stacking the same blocks in dozens of layers and processing information sequentially from one block to another. In this paper, we propose to challenge this and introduce adaptive computations for LLM-like setups, which allow the final layer to attend to all of the intermediate layers as it deems fit through the attention mechanism, thereby introducing computational \textbf{attention shortcuts}. These shortcuts can thus make the architecture depth and context adaptive. We showcase four different datasets, namely acoustic tokens, natural language, and symbolic music, and we achieve superior performance for GPT-like architecture. We give evidence via attention maps that the models learn complex dependencies across layers that are adaptive in context and depth depending on the input tokens.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10870v1,2024-09
Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Symbolic Mathematics,"Emet Bethany, Mazal Bethany, Juan Arturo Nolazco Flores, Sumit Kumar Jha, Peyman Najafirad","Recent advancements in AI safety have led to increased efforts in training and red-teaming large language models (LLMs) to mitigate unsafe content generation. However, these safety mechanisms may not be comprehensive, leaving potential vulnerabilities unexplored. This paper introduces MathPrompt, a novel jailbreaking technique that exploits LLMs' advanced capabilities in symbolic mathematics to bypass their safety mechanisms. By encoding harmful natural language prompts into mathematical problems, we demonstrate a critical vulnerability in current AI safety measures. Our experiments across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal an average attack success rate of 73.6\%, highlighting the inability of existing safety training mechanisms to generalize to mathematically encoded inputs. Analysis of embedding vectors shows a substantial semantic shift between original and encoded prompts, helping explain the attack's success. This work emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to AI safety, calling for expanded red-teaming efforts to develop robust safeguards across all potential input types and their associated risks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11445v2,2024-09
BAD: Bidirectional Auto-regressive Diffusion for Text-to-Motion Generation,"S. Rohollah Hosseyni, Ali Ahmad Rahmani, S. Jamal Seyedmohammadi, Sanaz Seyedin, Arash Mohammadi","Autoregressive models excel in modeling sequential dependencies by enforcing causal constraints, yet they struggle to capture complex bidirectional patterns due to their unidirectional nature. In contrast, mask-based models leverage bidirectional context, enabling richer dependency modeling. However, they often assume token independence during prediction, which undermines the modeling of sequential dependencies. Additionally, the corruption of sequences through masking or absorption can introduce unnatural distortions, complicating the learning process. To address these issues, we propose Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion (BAD), a novel approach that unifies the strengths of autoregressive and mask-based generative models. BAD utilizes a permutation-based corruption technique that preserves the natural sequence structure while enforcing causal dependencies through randomized ordering, enabling the effective capture of both sequential and bidirectional relationships. Comprehensive experiments show that BAD outperforms autoregressive and mask-based models in text-to-motion generation, suggesting a novel pre-training strategy for sequence modeling. The codebase for BAD is available on https://github.com/RohollahHS/BAD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10847v1,2024-09
Efficient and Personalized Mobile Health Event Prediction via Small Language Models,"Xin Wang, Ting Dang, Vassilis Kostakos, Hong Jia","Healthcare monitoring is crucial for early detection, timely intervention, and the ongoing management of health conditions, ultimately improving individuals' quality of life. Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in supporting healthcare tasks. However, existing LLM-based healthcare solutions typically rely on cloud-based systems, which raise privacy concerns and increase the risk of personal information leakage. As a result, there is growing interest in running these models locally on devices like mobile phones and wearables to protect users' privacy. Small Language Models (SLMs) are potential candidates to solve privacy and computational issues, as they are more efficient and better suited for local deployment. However, the performance of SLMs in healthcare domains has not yet been investigated. This paper examines the capability of SLMs to accurately analyze health data, such as steps, calories, sleep minutes, and other vital statistics, to assess an individual's health status. Our results show that, TinyLlama, which has 1.1 billion parameters, utilizes 4.31 GB memory, and has 0.48s latency, showing the best performance compared other four state-of-the-art (SOTA) SLMs on various healthcare applications.

ReXErr: Synthesizing Clinically Meaningful Errors in Diagnostic Radiology Reports,"Vishwanatha M. Rao, Serena Zhang, Julian N. Acosta, Subathra Adithan, Pranav Rajpurkar","Accurately interpreting medical images and writing radiology reports is a critical but challenging task in healthcare. Both human-written and AI-generated reports can contain errors, ranging from clinical inaccuracies to linguistic mistakes. To address this, we introduce ReXErr, a methodology that leverages Large Language Models to generate representative errors within chest X-ray reports. Working with board-certified radiologists, we developed error categories that capture common mistakes in both human and AI-generated reports. Our approach uses a novel sampling scheme to inject diverse errors while maintaining clinical plausibility. ReXErr demonstrates consistency across error categories and produces errors that closely mimic those found in real-world scenarios. This method has the potential to aid in the development and evaluation of report correction algorithms, potentially enhancing the quality and reliability of radiology reporting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10829v1,2024-09
Model Tells Itself Where to Attend: Faithfulness Meets Automatic Attention Steering,"Qingru Zhang, Xiaodong Yu, Chandan Singh, Xiaodong Liu, Liyuan Liu, Jianfeng Gao, Tuo Zhao, Dan Roth, Hao Cheng","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various real-world tasks. However, they often struggle to fully comprehend and effectively utilize their input contexts, resulting in responses that are unfaithful or hallucinated. This difficulty increases for contexts that are long or contain distracting information, which can divert LLMs from fully capturing essential evidence. To address this issue, many works use prompting to help LLMs utilize contextual information more faithfully. For instance, iterative prompting highlights key information in two steps that first ask the LLM to identify important pieces of context and then derive answers accordingly. However, prompting methods are constrained to highlighting key information implicitly in token space, which is often insufficient to fully steer the model's attention. To improve model faithfulness more reliably, we propose AutoPASTA, a method that automatically identifies key contextual information and explicitly highlights it by steering an LLM's attention scores. Like prompting, AutoPASTA is applied at inference time and does not require changing any model parameters. Our experiments on open-book QA demonstrate that AutoPASTA effectively enables models to grasp essential contextual information, leading to substantially improved model faithfulness and performance, e.g., an average improvement of 7.95% for LLAMA3-70B-Instruct. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/QingruZhang/AutoPASTA .",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10790v1,2024-09
Predicting Punctuation in Ancient Chinese Texts: A Multi-Layered LSTM and Attention-Based Approach,"Tracy Cai, Kimmy Chang, Fahad Nabi","It was only until the 20th century when the Chinese language began using punctuation. In fact, many ancient Chinese texts contain thousands of lines with no distinct punctuation marks or delimiters in sight. The lack of punctuation in such texts makes it difficult for humans to identify when there pauses or breaks between particular phrases and understand the semantic meaning of the written text (Mogahed, 2012). As a result, unless one was educated in the ancient time period, many readers of ancient Chinese would have significantly different interpretations of the texts. We propose an approach to predict the location (and type) of punctuation in ancient Chinese texts that extends the work of Oh et al (2017) by leveraging a bidirectional multi-layered LSTM with a multi-head attention mechanism as inspired by Luong et al.'s (2015) discussion of attention-based architectures. We find that the use of multi-layered LSTMs and multi-head attention significantly outperforms RNNs that don't incorporate such components when evaluating ancient Chinese texts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10783v1,2024-09
Semantics Preserving Emoji Recommendation with Large Language Models,"Zhongyi Qiu, Kangyi Qiu, Hanjia Lyu, Wei Xiong, Jiebo Luo","Emojis have become an integral part of digital communication, enriching text by conveying emotions, tone, and intent. Existing emoji recommendation methods are primarily evaluated based on their ability to match the exact emoji a user chooses in the original text. However, they ignore the essence of users' behavior on social media in that each text can correspond to multiple reasonable emojis. To better assess a model's ability to align with such real-world emoji usage, we propose a new semantics preserving evaluation framework for emoji recommendation, which measures a model's ability to recommend emojis that maintain the semantic consistency with the user's text. To evaluate how well a model preserves semantics, we assess whether the predicted affective state, demographic profile, and attitudinal stance of the user remain unchanged. If these attributes are preserved, we consider the recommended emojis to have maintained the original semantics. The advanced abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and generating nuanced, contextually relevant output make them well-suited for handling the complexities of semantics preserving emoji recommendation. To this end, we construct a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess the performance of six proprietary and open-source LLMs using different prompting techniques on our task. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o outperforms other LLMs, achieving a semantics preservation score of 79.23%. Additionally, we conduct case studies to analyze model biases in downstream classification tasks and evaluate the diversity of the recommended emojis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10760v1,2024-09
NaviQAte: Functionality-Guided Web Application Navigation,"Mobina Shahbandeh, Parsa Alian, Noor Nashid, Ali Mesbah","End-to-end web testing is challenging due to the need to explore diverse web application functionalities. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as WebCanvas, are not designed for broad functionality exploration; they rely on specific, detailed task descriptions, limiting their adaptability in dynamic web environments. We introduce NaviQAte, which frames web application exploration as a question-and-answer task, generating action sequences for functionalities without requiring detailed parameters. Our three-phase approach utilizes advanced large language models like GPT-4o for complex decision-making and cost-effective models, such as GPT-4o mini, for simpler tasks. NaviQAte focuses on functionality-guided web application navigation, integrating multi-modal inputs such as text and images to enhance contextual understanding. Evaluations on the Mind2Web-Live and Mind2Web-Live-Abstracted datasets show that NaviQAte achieves a 44.23% success rate in user task navigation and a 38.46% success rate in functionality navigation, representing a 15% and 33% improvement over WebCanvas.

Generalized Measures of Anticipation and Responsivity in Online Language Processing,"Mario Giulianelli, Andreas Opedal, Ryan Cotterell","We introduce a generalization of classic information-theoretic measures of predictive uncertainty in online language processing, based on the simulation of expected continuations of incremental linguistic contexts. Our framework provides a formal definition of anticipatory and responsive measures, and it equips experimenters with the tools to define new, more expressive measures beyond standard next-symbol entropy and surprisal. While extracting these standard quantities from language models is convenient, we demonstrate that using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate alternative responsive and anticipatory measures pays off empirically: New special cases of our generalized formula exhibit enhanced predictive power compared to surprisal for human cloze completion probability as well as ELAN, LAN, and N400 amplitudes, and greater complementarity with surprisal in predicting reading times.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10728v2,2024-09
Self-Attention Limits Working Memory Capacity of Transformer-Based Models,"Dongyu Gong, Hantao Zhang","Recent work on Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has revealed striking limits in their working memory capacity, similar to what has been found in human behavioral studies. Specifically, these models' performance drops significantly on N-back tasks as N increases. However, there is still a lack of mechanistic interpretability as to why this phenomenon would arise. Inspired by the executive attention theory from behavioral sciences, we hypothesize that the self-attention mechanism within Transformer-based models might be responsible for their working memory capacity limits. To test this hypothesis, we train vanilla decoder-only transformers to perform N-back tasks and find that attention scores gradually aggregate to the N-back positions over training, suggesting that the model masters the task by learning a strategy to pay attention to the relationship between the current position and the N-back position. Critically, we find that the total entropy of the attention score matrix increases as N increases, suggesting that the dispersion of attention scores might be the cause of the capacity limit observed in N-back tasks. Our findings thus offer insights into the shared role of attention in both human and artificial intelligence. Moreover, the limitations of the self-attention mechanism revealed in the current study could inform future efforts to design more powerful model architectures with enhanced working memory capacity and cognitive capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10715v2,2024-09
Lab-AI -- Retrieval-Augmented Language Model for Personalized Lab Test Interpretation in Clinical Medicine,"Xiaoyu Wang, Haoyong Ouyang, Balu Bhasuran, Xiao Luo, Karim Hanna, Mia Liza A. Lustria, Zhe He","Accurate interpretation of lab results is crucial in clinical medicine, yet most patient portals use universal normal ranges, ignoring factors like age and gender. This study introduces Lab-AI, an interactive system that offers personalized normal ranges using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from credible health sources. Lab-AI has two modules: factor retrieval and normal range retrieval. We tested these on 68 lab tests-30 with conditional factors and 38 without. For tests with factors, normal ranges depend on patient-specific information. Our results show that GPT-4-turbo with RAG achieved a 0.95 F1 score for factor retrieval and 0.993 accuracy for normal range retrieval. GPT-4-turbo with RAG outperformed the best non-RAG system by 29.1% in factor retrieval and showed 60.9% and 52.9% improvements in question-level and lab-level performance, respectively, for normal range retrieval. These findings highlight Lab-AI's potential to enhance patient understanding of lab results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18986v1,2024-09
Self-supervised Speech Models for Word-Level Stuttered Speech Detection,"Yi-Jen Shih, Zoi Gkalitsiou, Alexandros G. Dimakis, David Harwath","Clinical diagnosis of stuttering requires an assessment by a licensed speech-language pathologist. However, this process is time-consuming and requires clinicians with training and experience in stuttering and fluency disorders. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of speech-language pathologists report being comfortable working with individuals who stutter, which is inadequate to accommodate for the 80 million individuals who stutter worldwide. Developing machine learning models for detecting stuttered speech would enable universal and automated screening for stuttering, enabling speech pathologists to identify and follow up with patients who are most likely to be diagnosed with a stuttering speech disorder. Previous research in this area has predominantly focused on utterance-level detection, which is not sufficient for clinical settings where word-level annotation of stuttering is the norm. In this study, we curated a stuttered speech dataset with word-level annotations and introduced a word-level stuttering speech detection model leveraging self-supervised speech models. Our evaluation demonstrates that our model surpasses previous approaches in word-level stuttering speech detection. Additionally, we conducted an extensive ablation analysis of our method, providing insight into the most important aspects of adapting self-supervised speech models for stuttered speech detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10704v1,2024-09
Model-in-the-Loop (MILO): Accelerating Multimodal AI Data Annotation with LLMs,"Yifan Wang, David Stevens, Pranay Shah, Wenwen Jiang, Miao Liu, Xu Chen, Robert Kuo, Na Li, Boying Gong, Daniel Lee, Jiabo Hu, Ning Zhang, Bob Kamma","The growing demand for AI training data has transformed data annotation into a global industry, but traditional approaches relying on human annotators are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistent quality. We propose the Model-in-the-Loop (MILO) framework, which integrates AI/ML models into the annotation process. Our research introduces a collaborative paradigm that leverages the strengths of both professional human annotators and large language models (LLMs). By employing LLMs as pre-annotation and real-time assistants, and judges on annotator responses, MILO enables effective interaction patterns between human annotators and LLMs. Three empirical studies on multimodal data annotation demonstrate MILO's efficacy in reducing handling time, improving data quality, and enhancing annotator experiences. We also introduce quality rubrics for flexible evaluation and fine-grained feedback on open-ended annotations. The MILO framework has implications for accelerating AI/ML development, reducing reliance on human annotation alone, and promoting better alignment between human and machine values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10702v2,2024-09
A Bayesian Interpretation of Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation,"Haolin Chen, Philip N. Garner","Motivated by the sensitivity-based importance score of the adaptive low-rank adaptation (AdaLoRA), we utilize more theoretically supported metrics, including the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), along with the Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) optimizer, for adaptive parameter budget allocation. The resulting Bayesian counterpart not only has matched or surpassed the performance of using the sensitivity-based importance metric but is also a faster alternative to AdaLoRA with Adam. Our theoretical analysis reveals a significant connection between the two metrics, providing a Bayesian perspective on the efficacy of sensitivity as an importance score. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the magnitude, rather than the variance, is the primary indicator of the importance of parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10673v1,2024-09
Do Large Language Models Need a Content Delivery Network?,"Yihua Cheng, Kuntai Du, Jiayi Yao, Junchen Jiang","As the use of large language models (LLMs) expands rapidly, so does the range of knowledge needed to supplement various LLM queries. Thus, enabling flexible and efficient injection of new knowledge in LLM inference is critical. Three high-level options exist: (i) embedding the knowledge in LLM's weights (i.e., fine-tuning), (ii) including the knowledge as a part of LLM's text input (i.e., in-context learning), or (iii) injecting the KV caches of the new knowledge to LLM during prefill. This paper argues that, although fine-tuning and in-context learning are popular, using KV caches as the medium of knowledge could simultaneously enable more modular management of knowledge injection and more efficient LLM serving with low cost and fast response. To realize these benefits, we envision a Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN), a new system component in LLM services that dynamically optimizes the storage, transfer, and composition of KV cache across LLM engines and other compute and storage resources. We believe that, just like content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, enabled the success of the Internet ecosystem through their efficient data delivery, KDNs will be critical to the success of LLM applications through their efficient knowledge delivery. We have open-sourced a KDN prototype at https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13761v2,2024-09
Visualizing Temporal Topic Embeddings with a Compass,"Daniel Palamarchuk, Lemara Williams, Brian Mayer, Thomas Danielson, Rebecca Faust, Larry Deschaine, Chris North","Dynamic topic modeling is useful at discovering the development and change in latent topics over time. However, present methodology relies on algorithms that separate document and word representations. This prevents the creation of a meaningful embedding space where changes in word usage and documents can be directly analyzed in a temporal context. This paper proposes an expansion of the compass-aligned temporal Word2Vec methodology into dynamic topic modeling. Such a method allows for the direct comparison of word and document embeddings across time in dynamic topics. This enables the creation of visualizations that incorporate temporal word embeddings within the context of documents into topic visualizations. In experiments against the current state-of-the-art, our proposed method demonstrates overall competitive performance in topic relevancy and diversity across temporal datasets of varying size. Simultaneously, it provides insightful visualizations focused on temporal word embeddings while maintaining the insights provided by global topic evolution, advancing our understanding of how topics evolve over time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10649v2,2024-09
Improving Multi-candidate Speculative Decoding,"Xiaofan Lu, Yixiao Zeng, Feiyang Ma, Zixu Yu, Marco Levorato","Speculative Decoding (SD) is a technique to accelerate the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using a lower complexity draft model to propose candidate tokens verified by a larger target model. To further improve efficiency, Multi-Candidate Speculative Decoding (MCSD) improves upon this by sampling multiple candidate tokens from the draft model at each step and verifying them in parallel, thus increasing the chances of accepting a token and reducing generation time. Existing MCSD methods rely on the draft model to initialize the multi-candidate sequences and use static length and tree attention structure for draft generation. However, such an approach suffers from the draft and target model's output distribution differences, especially in a dynamic generation context. In this work, we introduce a new version of MCSD that includes a target model initialized multi-candidate generation, a dynamic sliced topology-aware causal mask for dynamic length adjustment, and decision models to optimize early stopping. We experimented with our method on Llama 2-7B and its variants and observed a maximum 27.5% speedup compared to our MCSD baseline across three benchmarks with Llama 2-7B as the target model and JackFram 68M as the draft model. Additionally, we evaluate the effects of using the target model initialized multi-candidate process with different draft models on output quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10644v3,2024-09
Exploring Fine-tuned Generative Models for Keyphrase Selection: A Case Study for Russian,"Anna Glazkova, Dmitry Morozov","Keyphrase selection plays a pivotal role within the domain of scholarly texts, facilitating efficient information retrieval, summarization, and indexing. In this work, we explored how to apply fine-tuned generative transformer-based models to the specific task of keyphrase selection within Russian scientific texts. We experimented with four distinct generative models, such as ruT5, ruGPT, mT5, and mBART, and evaluated their performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings. The experiments were conducted on the texts of Russian scientific abstracts from four domains: mathematics & computer science, history, medicine, and linguistics. The use of generative models, namely mBART, led to gains in in-domain performance (up to 4.9% in BERTScore, 9.0% in ROUGE-1, and 12.2% in F1-score) over three keyphrase extraction baselines for the Russian language. Although the results for cross-domain usage were significantly lower, they still demonstrated the capability to surpass baseline performances in several cases, underscoring the promising potential for further exploration and refinement in this research field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10640v2,2024-09
RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval,"Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu","Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference speed and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to build approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieve the most relevant ones through vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in the attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation demonstrates that RetrievalAttention achieves near full attention accuracy while only requiring access to 1--3% of the data. This leads to a significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs, with a much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) to serve 128K tokens for LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10516v3,2024-09
An Efficient Self-Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog Systems,"Hitesh Tulsiani, David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Garima Lalwani, Prabhat Pandey, Ankish Bansal, Sri Garimella, Ariya Rastrow, Björn Hoffmeister","Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users in complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to recognize each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the conversational context or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce a general framework for ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from single-turn utterances and learn over time how to adapt to both explicit supervision and implicit user feedback present in multi-turn conversations. We accomplish that by leveraging advances in student-teacher learning and context-aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive self-supervision approaches with Ohm, a new online hard-negative mining approach. We show that leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads to relative WER reductions of close to 10% in real-world dialog systems, and up to 26% on public synthetic data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10515v1,2024-09
DILA: Dictionary Label Attention for Mechanistic Interpretability in High-dimensional Multi-label Medical Coding Prediction,"John Wu, David Wu, Jimeng Sun","Predicting high-dimensional or extreme multilabels, such as in medical coding, requires both accuracy and interpretability. Existing works often rely on local interpretability methods, failing to provide comprehensive explanations of the overall mechanism behind each label prediction within a multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability module called DIctionary Label Attention (\method) that disentangles uninterpretable dense embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a dictionary feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through human evaluations, we show that our sparse embeddings are more human understandable than its dense counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our automated dictionary feature identification pipeline, leveraging large language models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned medical concepts by examining and summarizing the highest activating tokens for each dictionary feature. We represent the relationships between dictionary features and medical codes through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing the mechanistic and global understanding of the model's predictions while maintaining competitive performance and scalability without extensive human annotation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10504v1,2024-09
Causal Language Modeling Can Elicit Search and Reasoning Capabilities on Logic Puzzles,"Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy","Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases, multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly) when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves $92.04 \%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine implicit in the Transformer weights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10502v1,2024-09
CSKV: Training-Efficient Channel Shrinking for KV Cache in Long-Context Scenarios,"Luning Wang, Shiyao Li, Xuefei Ning, Zhihang Yuan, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to process long-context tasks. However, the large memory overhead of the key-value (KV) cache poses significant challenges in long-context scenarios. Existing training-free KV cache compression methods typically focus on quantization and token pruning, which have compression limits, and excessive sparsity can lead to severe performance degradation. Other methods design new architectures with less KV overhead but require significant training overhead. To address the above two drawbacks, we further explore the redundancy in the channel dimension and apply an architecture-level design with minor training costs. Therefore, we introduce CSKV, a training-efficient Channel Shrinking technique for KV cache compression: (1) We first analyze the singular value distribution of the KV cache, revealing significant redundancy and compression potential along the channel dimension. Based on this observation, we propose using low-rank decomposition for key and value layers and storing the low-dimension features. (2) To preserve model performance, we introduce a bi-branch KV cache, including a window-based full-precision KV cache and a low-precision compressed KV cache. (3) To reduce the training costs, we minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss for the compressed KV cache instead of retraining the entire LLMs. Extensive experiments show that CSKV can reduce the memory overhead of the KV cache by 80% while maintaining the model's long-context capability. Moreover, we show that our method can be seamlessly combined with quantization to further reduce the memory overhead, achieving a compression ratio of up to 95%.

Incorporating Classifier-Free Guidance in Diffusion Model-Based Recommendation,"Noah Buchanan, Susan Gauch, Quan Mai","This paper presents a diffusion-based recommender system that incorporates classifier-free guidance. Most current recommender systems provide recommendations using conventional methods such as collaborative or content-based filtering. Diffusion is a new approach to generative AI that improves on previous generative AI approaches such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We incorporate diffusion in a recommender system that mirrors the sequence users take when browsing and rating items. Although a few current recommender systems incorporate diffusion, they do not incorporate classifier-free guidance, a new innovation in diffusion models as a whole. In this paper, we present a diffusion recommender system that augments the underlying recommender system model for improved performance and also incorporates classifier-free guidance. Our findings show improvements over state-of-the-art recommender systems for most metrics for several recommendation tasks on a variety of datasets. In particular, our approach demonstrates the potential to provide better recommendations when data is sparse.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10494v1,2024-09
Schrodinger's Memory: Large Language Models,"Wei Wang, Qing Li","Memory is the foundation of all human activities; without memory, it would be nearly impossible for people to perform any task in daily life. With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their language capabilities are becoming increasingly comparable to those of humans. But do LLMs have memory? Based on current performance, LLMs do appear to exhibit memory. So, what is the underlying mechanism of this memory? Previous research has lacked a deep exploration of LLMs' memory capabilities and the underlying theory. In this paper, we use Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to explain the memory mechanism in LLMs. We also conduct experiments to verify the memory capabilities of various LLMs, proposing a new method to assess their abilities based on these memory ability. We argue that LLM memory operates like Schr\""odinger's memory, meaning that it only becomes observable when a specific memory is queried. We can only determine if the model retains a memory based on its output in response to the query; otherwise, it remains indeterminate. Finally, we expand on this concept by comparing the memory capabilities of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting the similarities and differences in their operational mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10482v3,2024-09

AI Conversational Interviewing: Transforming Surveys with LLMs as Adaptive Interviewers,"Alexander Wuttke, Matthias Aßenmacher, Christopher Klamm, Max M. Lang, Quirin Würschinger, Frauke Kreuter","Traditional methods for eliciting people's opinions face a trade-off between depth and scale: structured surveys enable large-scale data collection but limit respondents' ability to express unanticipated thoughts in their own words, while conversational interviews provide deeper insights but are resource-intensive. This study explores the potential of replacing human interviewers with large language models (LLMs) to conduct scalable conversational interviews. Our goal is to assess the performance of AI Conversational Interviewing and to identify opportunities for improvement in a controlled environment. We conducted a small-scale, in-depth study with university students who were randomly assigned to be interviewed by either AI or human interviewers, both employing identical questionnaires on political topics. Various quantitative and qualitative measures assessed interviewer adherence to guidelines, response quality, participant engagement, and overall interview efficacy. The findings indicate the viability of AI Conversational Interviewing in producing quality data comparable to traditional methods, with the added benefit of scalability.

A Knowledge-Enhanced Disease Diagnosis Method Based on Prompt Learning and BERT Integration,Zhang Zheng,"This paper proposes a knowledge-enhanced disease diagnosis method based on a prompt learning framework. The method retrieves structured knowledge from external knowledge graphs related to clinical cases, encodes it, and injects it into the prompt templates to enhance the language model's understanding and reasoning capabilities for the task.We conducted experiments on three public datasets: CHIP-CTC, IMCS-V2-NER, and KUAKE-QTR.

Additionally,ablation studies confirmed the critical role of the knowledge injection module,as the removal of this module resulted in a significant drop in F1 score.

Instigating Cooperation among LLM Agents Using Adaptive Information Modulation,"Qiliang Chen, Sepehr Ilami, Nunzio Lore, Babak Heydari","This paper introduces a novel framework combining LLM agents as proxies for human strategic behavior with reinforcement learning (RL) to engage these agents in evolving strategic interactions within team environments. Our approach extends traditional agent-based simulations by using strategic LLM agents (SLA) and introducing dynamic and adaptive governance through a pro-social promoting RL agent (PPA) that modulates information access across agents in a network, optimizing social welfare and promoting pro-social behavior. Through validation in iterative games, including the prisoner dilemma, we demonstrate that SLA agents exhibit nuanced strategic adaptations. The PPA agent effectively learns to adjust information transparency, resulting in enhanced cooperation rates.

2D or not 2D: How Does the Dimensionality of Gesture Representation Affect 3D Co-Speech Gesture Generation?,"Téo Guichoux, Laure Soulier, Nicolas Obin, Catherine Pelachaud","Co-speech gestures are fundamental for communication. The advent of recent deep learning techniques has facilitated the creation of lifelike, synchronous co-speech gestures for Embodied Conversational Agents. ""In-the-wild"" datasets, aggregating video content from platforms like YouTube via human pose detection technologies, provide a feasible solution by offering 2D skeletal sequences aligned with speech. Concurrent developments in lifting models enable the conversion of these 2D sequences into 3D gesture databases. However, it is important to note that the 3D poses estimated from the 2D extracted poses are, in essence, approximations of the ground-truth, which remains in the 2D domain. This distinction raises questions about the impact of gesture representation dimensionality on the quality of generated motions - a topic that, to our knowledge, remains largely unexplored. Our study examines the effect of using either 2D or 3D joint coordinates as training data on the performance of speech-to-gesture deep generative models. We employ a lifting model for converting generated 2D pose sequences into 3D and assess how gestures created directly in 3D stack up against those initially generated in 2D and then converted to 3D. We perform an objective evaluation using widely used metrics in the gesture generation field as well as a user study to qualitatively evaluate the different approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10357v2,2024-09

We formalize the problem and first establish a baseline using a random selection of questions from known benchmark datasets, achieving an accuracy of nearly 100% within 20 questions. After showing optimal bounds for this problem, we introduce two effective questioning heuristics able to discriminate 22 LLMs by using half as many questions for the same task.

MGSA: Multi-Granularity Graph Structure Attention for Knowledge Graph-to-Text Generation,"Shanshan Wang, Chun Zhang, Ning Zhang","The Knowledge Graph-to-Text Generation task aims to convert structured knowledge graphs into coherent and human-readable natural language text. Recent efforts in this field have focused on enhancing pre-trained language models (PLMs) by incorporating graph structure information to capture the intricate structure details of knowledge graphs. However, most of these approaches tend to capture only single-granularity structure information, concentrating either on the relationships between entities within the original graph or on the relationships between words within the same entity or across different entities. This narrow focus results in a significant limitation: models that concentrate solely on entity-level structure fail to capture the nuanced semantic relationships between words, while those that focus only on word-level structure overlook the broader relationships between original entire entities. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces the Multi-granularity Graph Structure Attention (MGSA), which is based on PLMs. The encoder of the model architecture features an entity-level structure encoding module, a word-level structure encoding module, and an aggregation module that synthesizes information from both structure. This multi-granularity structure encoding approach allows the model to simultaneously capture both entity-level and word-level structure information, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the knowledge graph's structure information, thereby significantly improving the quality of the generated text. We conducted extensive evaluations of the MGSA model using two widely recognized KG-to-Text Generation benchmark datasets, WebNLG and EventNarrative, where it consistently outperformed models that rely solely on single-granularity structure information, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10294v2,2024-09
ReflectDiffu:Reflect between Emotion-intent Contagion and Mimicry for Empathetic Response Generation via a RL-Diffusion Framework,"Jiahao Yuan, Zixiang Di, Zhiqing Cui, Guisong Yang, Usman Naseem","Empathetic response generation necessitates the integration of emotional and intentional dynamics to foster meaningful interactions. Existing research either neglects the intricate interplay between emotion and intent, leading to suboptimal controllability of empathy, or resorts to large language models (LLMs), which incur significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ReflectDiffu, a lightweight and comprehensive framework for empathetic response generation. This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect the mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ReflectDiffu outperforms existing models regarding relevance, controllability, and informativeness, achieving state-of-the-art results in both automatic and human evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10289v2,2024-09
From Text to Emoji: How PEFT-Driven Personality Manipulation Unleashes the Emoji Potential in LLMs,"Navya Jain, Zekun Wu, Cristian Munoz, Airlie Hilliard, Adriano Koshiyama, Emre Kazim, Philip Treleaven","As the demand for human-like interactions with LLMs continues to grow, so does the interest in manipulating their personality traits, which has emerged as a key area of research. Methods like prompt-based In-Context Knowledge Editing (IKE) and gradient-based Model Editor Networks (MEND) have been explored but show irregularity and variability. IKE depends on the prompt, leading to variability and sensitivity, while MEND yields inconsistent and gibberish outputs. To address this, we employed Opinion QA Based Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), specifically Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), to manipulate the Big Five personality traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. After PEFT, models such as Mistral-7B-Instruct and Llama-2-7B-chat began generating emojis, despite their absence in the PEFT data. For instance, Llama-2-7B-chat generated emojis in 99.5\% of extraversion-related test instances, while Mistral-7B-Instruct did so in 92.5\% of openness-related test instances.

First, introducing an Opinion QA dataset for PEFT-driven personality manipulation; second, developing metric models to benchmark LLM personality traits; third, demonstrating PEFT's superiority over IKE in personality manipulation; and finally, analysing and validating emoji usage through explainability methods such as mechanistic interpretability and in-context learning explainability methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10245v2,2024-09
Fit and Prune: Fast and Training-free Visual Token Pruning for Multi-modal Large Language Models,"Weihao Ye, Qiong Wu, Wenhao Lin, Yiyi Zhou","Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) often use large image tokens to compensate the visual shortcoming of MLLMs, which not only exhibits obvious redundancy but also greatly exacerbates the already high computation. Token pruning is an effective solution for speeding up MLLMs, but when and how to drop tokens still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and training-free approach for the effective visual token pruning of MLLMs, termed FitPrune, which can quickly produce a complete pruning recipe for MLLMs according to a pre-defined budget. Specifically, FitPrune considers token pruning as a statistical problem of MLLM and its objective is to find out an optimal pruning scheme that can minimize the divergence of the attention distributions before and after pruning. In practice, FitPrune can be quickly accomplished based on the attention statistics from a small batch of inference data, avoiding the expensive trials of MLLMs. According to the pruning recipe, an MLLM can directly remove the redundant visual tokens of different examples during inference. To validate FitPrune, we apply it to a set of recent MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and LLaVA-NEXT, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experimental results show that our FitPrune can not only reduce the computational complexity to a large extent, while retaining high performance, e.g., -54.9% FLOPs for LLaVA-NEXT with only 0.5% accuracy drop. Notably, the pruning recipe can be obtained in about 5 minutes. Our code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/FitPrune.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10197v2,2024-09
A Literature Review of Keyword Spotting Technologies for Urdu,Syed Muhammad Aqdas Rizvi,"This literature review surveys the advancements of keyword spotting (KWS) technologies, specifically focusing on Urdu, Pakistan's low-resource language (LRL), which has complex phonetics. Despite the global strides in speech technology, Urdu presents unique challenges requiring more tailored solutions. The review traces the evolution from foundational Gaussian Mixture Models to sophisticated neural architectures like deep neural networks and transformers, highlighting significant milestones such as integrating multi-task learning and self-supervised approaches that leverage unlabeled data. It examines emerging technologies' role in enhancing KWS systems' performance within multilingual and resource-constrained settings, emphasizing the need for innovations that cater to languages like Urdu. Thus, this review underscores the need for context-specific research addressing the inherent complexities of Urdu and similar URLs and the means of regions communicating through such languages for a more inclusive approach to speech technology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16317v1,2024-09
LLMs for clinical risk prediction,"Mohamed Rezk, Patricia Cabanillas Silva, Fried-Michael Dahlweid","This study compares the efficacy of GPT-4 and clinalytix Medical AI in predicting the clinical risk of delirium development. Findings indicate that GPT-4 exhibited significant deficiencies in identifying positive cases and struggled to provide reliable probability estimates for delirium risk, while clinalytix Medical AI demonstrated superior accuracy. A thorough analysis of the large language model's (LLM) outputs elucidated potential causes for these discrepancies, consistent with limitations reported in extant literature. These results underscore the challenges LLMs face in accurately diagnosing conditions and interpreting complex clinical data. While LLMs hold substantial potential in healthcare, they are currently unsuitable for independent clinical decision-making. Instead, they should be employed in assistive roles, complementing clinical expertise. Continued human oversight remains essential to ensure optimal outcomes for both patients and healthcare providers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10191v1,2024-09
Augmenting Automatic Speech Recognition Models with Disfluency Detection,"Robin Amann, Zhaolin Li, Barbara Bruno, Jan Niehues","Speech disfluency commonly occurs in conversational and spontaneous speech. However, standard Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models struggle to accurately recognize these disfluencies because they are typically trained on fluent transcripts. Current research mainly focuses on detecting disfluencies within transcripts, overlooking their exact location and duration in the speech. Additionally, previous work often requires model fine-tuning and addresses limited types of disfluencies.   In this work, we present an inference-only approach to augment any ASR model with the ability to detect open-set disfluencies. We first demonstrate that ASR models have difficulty transcribing speech disfluencies. Next, this work proposes a modified Connectionist Temporal Classification(CTC)-based forced alignment algorithm from \cite{kurzinger2020ctc} to predict word-level timestamps while effectively capturing disfluent speech. Additionally, we develop a model to classify alignment gaps between timestamps as either containing disfluent speech or silence. This model achieves an accuracy of 81.62% and an F1-score of 80.07%. We test the augmentation pipeline of alignment gap detection and classification on a disfluent dataset. Our results show that we captured 74.13% of the words that were initially missed by the transcription, demonstrating the potential of this pipeline for downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10177v2,2024-09
jina-embeddings-v3: Multilingual Embeddings With Task LoRA,"Saba Sturua, Isabelle Mohr, Mohammad Kalim Akram, Michael Günther, Bo Wang, Markus Krimmel, Feng Wang, Georgios Mastrapas, Andreas Koukounas, Nan Wang, Han Xiao","We introduce jina-embeddings-v3, a novel text embedding model with 570 million parameters, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multilingual data and long-context retrieval tasks, supporting context lengths of up to 8192 tokens.

Quantile Regression for Distributional Reward Models in RLHF,Nicolai Dorka,"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become a key method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through the use of reward models. However, traditional reward models typically generate point estimates, which oversimplify the diversity and complexity of human values and preferences. In this paper, we introduce Quantile Reward Models (QRMs), a novel approach to reward modeling that learns a distribution over rewards instead of a single scalar value. Our method uses quantile regression to estimate a full, potentially multimodal distribution over preferences, providing a more powerful and nuanced representation of preferences. This distributional approach can better capture the diversity of human values, addresses label noise, and accommodates conflicting preferences by modeling them as distinct modes in the distribution. Our experimental results show that QRM outperforms comparable traditional point-estimate models on RewardBench. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional information provided by the distributional estimates can be utilized in downstream applications, such as risk-aware reinforcement learning, resulting in LLM policies that generate fewer extremely negative responses. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/Nicolinho/QRM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10164v1,2024-09
Improving Spoken Language Modeling with Phoneme Classification: A Simple Fine-tuning Approach,"Maxime Poli, Emmanuel Chemla, Emmanuel Dupoux","Recent progress in Spoken Language Modeling has shown that learning language directly from speech is feasible. Generating speech through a pipeline that operates at the text level typically loses nuances, intonations, and non-verbal vocalizations. Modeling directly from speech opens up the path to more natural and expressive systems. On the other hand, speech-only systems require up to three orders of magnitude more data to catch up to their text-based counterparts in terms of their semantic abilities. We show that fine-tuning speech representation models on phoneme classification leads to more context-invariant representations, and language models trained on these units achieve comparable lexical comprehension to ones trained on hundred times more data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00025v2,2024-09

StruEdit: Structured Outputs Enable the Fast and Accurate Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models,"Baolong Bi, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Hongcheng Gao, Junfeng Fang, Xueqi Cheng","As the modern tool of choice for question answering, large language models (LLMs) are expected to deliver answers with up-to-date knowledge. To achieve such ideal question-answering systems, locating and then editing outdated knowledge in the natural language outputs is a general target of popular knowledge editing methods. However, this target is challenging, as both identifying which tokens to edit in the reasoning steps and ensuring the coherence of the revised reasoning chain are difficult tasks. We argue that these challenges stem from the unstructured nature of natural language outputs. To address the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{Stru}$ctural $\textbf{Edit}$ing ($\textbf{StruEdit}$), an improved baseline for knowledge editing. We first prompt LLMs to produce structured outputs consisting of reasoning triplets. Then, StruEdit removes any potentially outdated knowledge and efficiently refills the structured outputs with up-to-date information in a single step. Experimental results show that StruEdit consistently delivers the highest accuracy with lowest latency compared with other knowledge editing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10132v1,2024-09
Self-Supervised Syllable Discovery Based on Speaker-Disentangled HuBERT,"Ryota Komatsu, Takahiro Shinozaki","Self-supervised speech representation learning has become essential for extracting meaningful features from untranscribed audio. Recent advances highlight the potential of deriving discrete symbols from the features correlated with linguistic units, which enables text-less training across diverse tasks. In particular, sentence-level Self-Distillation of the pretrained HuBERT (SD-HuBERT) induces syllabic structures within latent speech frame representations extracted from an intermediate Transformer layer. In SD-HuBERT, sentence-level representation is accumulated from speech frame features through self-attention layers using a special CLS token. However, we observe that the information aggregated in the CLS token correlates more with speaker identity than with linguistic content. To address this, we propose a speech-only self-supervised fine-tuning approach that separates syllabic units from speaker information. Our method introduces speaker perturbation as data augmentation and adopts a frame-level training objective to prevent the CLS token from aggregating paralinguistic information. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art method in most syllable segmentation and syllabic unit quality metrics on Librispeech, underscoring its effectiveness in promoting syllabic organization within speech-only models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10103v1,2024-09
Trustworthiness in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems: A Survey,"Yujia Zhou, Yan Liu, Xiaoxi Li, Jiajie Jin, Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Chaozhuo Li, Zhicheng Dou, Tsung-Yi Ho, Philip S. Yu","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly grown into a pivotal paradigm in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). While much of the current research in this field focuses on performance optimization, particularly in terms of accuracy and efficiency, the trustworthiness of RAG systems remains an area still under exploration. From a positive perspective, RAG systems are promising to enhance LLMs by providing them with useful and up-to-date knowledge from vast external databases, thereby mitigating the long-standing problem of hallucination. While from a negative perspective, RAG systems are at the risk of generating undesirable contents if the retrieved information is either inappropriate or poorly utilized. To address these concerns, we propose a unified framework that assesses the trustworthiness of RAG systems across six key dimensions: factuality, robustness, fairness, transparency, accountability, and privacy. Within this framework, we thoroughly review the existing literature on each dimension. Additionally, we create the evaluation benchmark regarding the six dimensions and conduct comprehensive evaluations for a variety of proprietary and open-source models. Finally, we identify the potential challenges for future research based on our investigation results. Through this work, we aim to lay a structured foundation for future investigations and provide practical insights for enhancing the trustworthiness of RAG systems in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10102v1,2024-09
LLM-DER:A Named Entity Recognition Method Based on Large Language Models for Chinese Coal Chemical Domain,"Le Xiao, Yunfei Xu, Jing Zhao","Domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER), whose goal is to recognize domain-specific entities and their categories, provides an important support for constructing domain knowledge graphs. Currently, deep learning-based methods are widely used and effective in NER tasks, but due to the reliance on large-scale labeled data. As a result, the scarcity of labeled data in a specific domain will limit its application.Therefore, many researches started to introduce few-shot methods and achieved some results. However, the entity structures in specific domains are often complex, and the current few-shot methods are difficult to adapt to NER tasks with complex features.Taking the Chinese coal chemical industry domain as an example,there exists a complex structure of multiple entities sharing a single entity, as well as multiple relationships for the same pair of entities, which affects the NER task under the sample less condition.In this paper, we propose a Large Language Models (LLMs)-based entity recognition framework LLM-DER for the domain-specific entity recognition problem in Chinese, which enriches the entity information by generating a list of relationships containing entity types through LLMs, and designing a plausibility and consistency evaluation method to remove misrecognized entities, which can effectively solve the complex structural entity recognition problem in a specific domain.The experimental results of this paper on the Resume dataset and the self-constructed coal chemical dataset Coal show that LLM-DER performs outstandingly in domain-specific entity recognition, not only outperforming the existing GPT-3.5-turbo baseline, but also exceeding the fully-supervised baseline, verifying its effectiveness in entity recognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10077v1,2024-09
Increasing faithfulness in human-human dialog summarization with Spoken Language Understanding tasks,"Eunice Akani, Benoit Favre, Frederic Bechet, Romain Gemignani","Dialogue summarization aims to provide a concise and coherent summary of conversations between multiple speakers. While recent advancements in language models have enhanced this process, summarizing dialogues accurately and faithfully remains challenging due to the need to understand speaker interactions and capture relevant information. Indeed, abstractive models used for dialog summarization may generate summaries that contain inconsistencies. We suggest using the semantic information proposed for performing Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) in human-machine dialogue systems for goal-oriented human-human dialogues to obtain a more semantically faithful summary regarding the task. This study introduces three key contributions: First, we propose an exploration of how incorporating task-related information can enhance the summarization process, leading to more semantically accurate summaries. Then, we introduce a new evaluation criterion based on task semantics. Finally, we propose a new dataset version with increased annotated data standardized for research on task-oriented dialogue summarization. The study evaluates these methods using the DECODA corpus, a collection of French spoken dialogues from a call center. Results show that integrating models with task-related information improves summary accuracy, even with varying word error rates.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10070v1,2024-09
MindGuard: Towards Accessible and Sitgma-free Mental Health First Aid via Edge LLM,"Sijie Ji, Xinzhe Zheng, Jiawei Sun, Renqi Chen, Wei Gao, Mani Srivastava","Mental health disorders are among the most prevalent diseases worldwide, affecting nearly one in four people. Despite their widespread impact, the intervention rate remains below 25%, largely due to the significant cooperation required from patients for both diagnosis and intervention. The core issue behind this low treatment rate is stigma, which discourages over half of those affected from seeking help. This paper presents MindGuard, an accessible, stigma-free, and professional mobile mental healthcare system designed to provide mental health first aid. The heart of MindGuard is an innovative edge LLM, equipped with professional mental health knowledge, that seamlessly integrates objective mobile sensor data with subjective Ecological Momentary Assessment records to deliver personalized screening and intervention conversations. We conduct a broad evaluation of MindGuard using open datasets spanning four years and real-world deployment across various mobile devices involving 20 subjects for two weeks. Remarkably, MindGuard achieves results comparable to GPT-4 and outperforms its counterpart with more than 10 times the model size. We believe that MindGuard paves the way for mobile LLM applications, potentially revolutionizing mental healthcare practices by substituting self-reporting and intervention conversations with passive, integrated monitoring within daily life, thus ensuring accessible and stigma-free mental health support.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10064v1,2024-09
Householder Pseudo-Rotation: A Novel Approach to Activation Editing in LLMs with Direction-Magnitude Perspective,"Van-Cuong Pham, Thien Huu Nguyen","Activation Editing, which involves directly editting the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) to alter their behaviors and achieve desired properties, has emerged as a promising area of research. Existing works primarily treat LLMs' activations as points in space and modify them by adding steering vectors. However, this approach is limited in its ability to achieve greater performance improvement while maintaining the necessary consistency of activation magnitudes. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel editing method that views activations in terms of their directions and magnitudes. Our method, named Householder Pseudo-Rotation (HPR), mimics the rotation transformation, thus preserving activation norms and resulting in an improved performance on various safety benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10053v2,2024-09

Benchmarking Large Language Model Uncertainty for Prompt Optimization,"Pei-Fu Guo, Yun-Da Tsai, Shou-De Lin","Prompt optimization algorithms for Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in multi-step reasoning but still lack effective uncertainty estimation. This paper introduces a benchmark dataset to evaluate uncertainty metrics, focusing on Answer, Correctness, Aleatoric, and Epistemic Uncertainty. Through analysis of models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we show that current metrics align more with Answer Uncertainty, which reflects output confidence and diversity, rather than Correctness Uncertainty, highlighting the need for improved metrics that are optimization-objective-aware to better guide prompt optimization.

On the Diagram of Thought,"Yifan Zhang, Yang Yuan, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao","We introduce Diagram of Thought (DoT), a framework that models iterative reasoning in large language models (LLMs) as the construction of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) within a single model. Unlike traditional approaches that represent reasoning as linear chains or trees, DoT organizes propositions, critiques, refinements, and verifications into a cohesive DAG structure, allowing the model to explore complex reasoning pathways while maintaining logical consistency. Each node in the diagram corresponds to a proposition that has been proposed, critiqued, refined, or verified, enabling the LLM to iteratively improve its reasoning through natural language feedback. By leveraging auto-regressive next-token prediction with role-specific tokens, DoT facilitates seamless transitions between proposing ideas and critically evaluating them, providing richer feedback than binary signals. Furthermore, we formalize the DoT framework using Topos Theory, providing a mathematical foundation that ensures logical consistency and soundness in the reasoning process. This approach enhances both the training and inference processes within a single LLM, eliminating the need for multiple models or external control mechanisms. DoT offers a conceptual framework for designing next-generation reasoning-specialized models, emphasizing training efficiency, robust reasoning capabilities, and theoretical grounding.

HALO: Hallucination Analysis and Learning Optimization to Empower LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Context for Guided Clinical Decision Making,"Sumera Anjum, Hanzhi Zhang, Wenjun Zhou, Eun Jin Paek, Xiaopeng Zhao, Yunhe Feng","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing tasks, yet they are susceptible to generating inaccurate or unreliable responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. In critical domains such as health and medicine, these hallucinations can pose serious risks. This paper introduces HALO, a novel framework designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of medical question-answering (QA) systems by focusing on the detection and mitigation of hallucinations. Our approach generates multiple variations of a given query using LLMs and retrieves relevant information from external open knowledge bases to enrich the context. We utilize maximum marginal relevance scoring to prioritize the retrieved context, which is then provided to LLMs for answer generation, thereby reducing the risk of hallucinations. The integration of LangChain further streamlines this process, resulting in a notable and robust increase in the accuracy of both open-source and commercial LLMs, such as Llama-3.1 (from 44% to 65%) and ChatGPT (from 56% to 70%). This framework underscores the critical importance of addressing hallucinations in medical QA systems, ultimately improving clinical decision-making and patient care.

Errors are especially probable when a nuanced understanding is needed of database schemas, questions, and SQL clauses to do proper Text-to-SQL conversion. We introduce SelECT-SQL, a novel in-context learning solution that uses an algorithmic combination of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, self-correction, and ensemble methods to yield a new state-of-the-art result on challenging Text-to-SQL benchmarks.

Gaps or Hallucinations? Gazing into Machine-Generated Legal Analysis for Fine-grained Text Evaluations,"Abe Bohan Hou, William Jurayj, Nils Holzenberger, Andrew Blair-Stanek, Benjamin Van Durme","Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise as a writing aid for professionals performing legal analyses. However, LLMs can often hallucinate in this setting, in ways difficult to recognize by non-professionals and existing text evaluation metrics. In this work, we pose the question: when can machine-generated legal analysis be evaluated as acceptable? We introduce the neutral notion of gaps, as opposed to hallucinations in a strict erroneous sense, to refer to the difference between human-written and machine-generated legal analysis. Gaps do not always equate to invalid generation. Working with legal experts, we consider the CLERC generation task proposed in Hou et al. (2024b), leading to a taxonomy, a fine-grained detector for predicting gap categories, and an annotated dataset for automatic evaluation. Our best detector achieves 67% F1 score and 80% precision on the test set.

"Towards Data Contamination Detection for Modern Large Language Models: Limitations, Inconsistencies, and Oracle Challenges","Vinay Samuel, Yue Zhou, Henry Peng Zou","As large language models achieve increasingly impressive results, questions arise about whether such performance is from generalizability or mere data memorization. Thus, numerous data contamination detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches are often validated with traditional benchmarks and early-stage LLMs, leaving uncertainty about their effectiveness when evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on the contamination of more challenging benchmarks. To address this gap and provide a dual investigation of SOTA LLM contamination status and detection method robustness, we evaluate five contamination detection approaches with four state-of-the-art LLMs across eight challenging datasets often used in modern LLM evaluation. Our analysis reveals that (1) Current methods have non-trivial limitations in their assumptions and practical applications; (2) Notable difficulties exist in detecting contamination introduced during instruction fine-tuning with answer augmentation; and (3) Limited consistencies between SOTA contamination detection techniques. These findings highlight the complexity of contamination detection in advanced LLMs and the urgent need for further research on robust and generalizable contamination evaluation.

The LLMs used in RAG applications are required to faithfully and completely comprehend the provided context and users' questions, avoid hallucination, handle unanswerable, counterfactual or otherwise low-quality and irrelevant contexts, perform complex multi-hop reasoning and produce reliable citations. In this paper, we introduce SFR-RAG, a small LLM that is instruction-tuned with an emphasis on context-grounded generation and hallucination minimization. We also present ContextualBench, a new evaluation framework compiling multiple popular and diverse RAG benchmarks, such as HotpotQA and TriviaQA, with consistent RAG settings to ensure reproducibility and consistency in model assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that our SFR-RAG-9B model outperforms leading baselines such as Command-R+ (104B) and GPT-4o, achieving state-of-the-art results in 3 out of 7 benchmarks in ContextualBench with significantly fewer parameters. The model is also shown to be resilient to alteration in the contextual information and behave appropriately when relevant context is removed.

Rediscovering the Latent Dimensions of Personality with Large Language Models as Trait Descriptors,"Joseph Suh, Suhong Moon, Minwoo Kang, David M. Chan","Assessing personality traits using large language models (LLMs) has emerged as an interesting and challenging area of research. While previous methods employ explicit questionnaires, often derived from the Big Five model of personality, we hypothesize that LLMs implicitly encode notions of personality when modeling next-token responses. To demonstrate this, we introduce a novel approach that uncovers latent personality dimensions in LLMs by applying singular value de-composition (SVD) to the log-probabilities of trait-descriptive adjectives. Our experiments show that LLMs ""rediscover"" core personality traits such as extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness without relying on direct questionnaire inputs, with the top-5 factors corresponding to Big Five traits explaining 74.3% of the variance in the latent space. Moreover, we can use the derived principal components to assess personality along the Big Five dimensions, and achieve improvements in average personality prediction accuracy of up to 5% over fine-tuned models, and up to 21% over direct LLM-based scoring techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09905v1,2024-09
Acquiring Pronunciation Knowledge from Transcribed Speech Audio via Multi-task Learning,"Siqi Sun, Korin Richmond","Recent work has shown the feasibility and benefit of bootstrapping an integrated sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) linguistic frontend from a traditional pipeline-based frontend for text-to-speech (TTS). To overcome the fixed lexical coverage of bootstrapping training data, previous work has proposed to leverage easily accessible transcribed speech audio as an additional training source for acquiring novel pronunciation knowledge for uncovered words, which relies on an auxiliary ASR model as part of a cumbersome implementation flow. In this work, we propose an alternative method to leverage transcribed speech audio as an additional training source, based on multi-task learning (MTL). Experiments show that, compared to a baseline Seq2Seq frontend, the proposed MTL-based method reduces PER from 2.5% to 1.6% for those word types covered exclusively in transcribed speech audio, achieving a similar performance to the previous method but with a much simpler implementation flow.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09891v1,2024-09
Optimizing the Songwriting Process: Genre-Based Lyric Generation Using Deep Learning Models,"Tracy Cai, Wilson Liang, Donte Townes","The traditional songwriting process is rather complex and this is evident in the time it takes to produce lyrics that fit the genre and form comprehensive verses. Our project aims to simplify this process with deep learning techniques, thus optimizing the songwriting process and enabling an artist to hit their target audience by staying in genre. Using a dataset of 18,000 songs off Spotify, we developed a unique preprocessing format using tokens to parse lyrics into individual verses. These results were used to train a baseline pretrained seq2seq model, and a LSTM-based neural network models according to song genres. We found that generation yielded higher recall (ROUGE) in the baseline model, but similar precision (BLEU) for both models. Qualitatively, we found that many of the lyrical phrases generated by the original model were still comprehensible and discernible between which genres they fit into, despite not necessarily being the exact the same as the true lyrics. Overall, our results yielded that lyric generation can reasonably be sped up to produce genre-based lyrics and aid in hastening the songwriting process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13758v1,2024-09
Constructing a Singing Style Caption Dataset,"Hyunjong Ok, Jaeho Lee","Singing voice synthesis and conversion have emerged as significant subdomains of voice generation, leading to much demands on prompt-conditioned generation. Unlike common voice data, generating a singing voice requires an understanding of various associated vocal and musical characteristics, such as the vocal tone of the singer or emotional expressions. However, existing open-source audio-text datasets for voice generation tend to capture only a very limited range of attributes, often missing musical characteristics of the audio. To fill this gap, we introduce S2Cap, an audio-text pair dataset with a diverse set of attributes. S2Cap consists of pairs of textual prompts and music audio samples with a wide range of vocal and musical attributes, including pitch, volume, tempo, mood, singer's gender and age, and musical genre and emotional expression. Utilizing S2Cap, we suggest an effective novel baseline algorithm for singing style captioning. Singing style captioning is a relative task to voice generation that generates text descriptions of vocal characteristics, which we first suggested. First, to mitigate the misalignment between the audio encoder and the text decoder, we present a novel mechanism called CRESCENDO, which utilizes positive-pair similarity learning to synchronize the embedding spaces of a pretrained audio encoder to get similar embeddings with a text encoder. We additionally supervise the model using the singer's voice, which is demixed by the accompaniment. This supervision allows the model to more accurately capture vocal characteristics, leading to improved singing style captions that better reflect the style of the singer. The dataset and the codes are available at \bulurl{https://github.com/HJ-Ok/S2cap}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09866v1,2024-09
A Benchmark Dataset with Larger Context for Non-Factoid Question Answering over Islamic Text,"Faiza Qamar, Seemab Latif, Rabia Latif","Accessing and comprehending religious texts, particularly the Quran (the sacred scripture of Islam) and Ahadith (the corpus of the sayings or traditions of the Prophet Muhammad), in today's digital era necessitates efficient and accurate Question-Answering (QA) systems. Yet, the scarcity of QA systems tailored specifically to the detailed nature of inquiries about the Quranic Tafsir (explanation, interpretation, context of Quran for clarity) and Ahadith poses significant challenges. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset meticulously crafted for QA purposes within the domain of Quranic Tafsir and Ahadith. This dataset comprises a robust collection of over 73,000 question-answer pairs, standing as the largest reported dataset in this specialized domain. Importantly, both questions and answers within the dataset are meticulously enriched with contextual information, serving as invaluable resources for training and evaluating tailored QA systems. However, while this paper highlights the dataset's contributions and establishes a benchmark for evaluating QA performance in the Quran and Ahadith domains, our subsequent human evaluation uncovered critical insights regarding the limitations of existing automatic evaluation techniques. The discrepancy between automatic evaluation metrics, such as ROUGE scores, and human assessments became apparent. The human evaluation indicated significant disparities: the model's verdict consistency with expert scholars ranged between 11% to 20%, while its contextual understanding spanned a broader spectrum of 50% to 90%. These findings underscore the necessity for evaluation techniques that capture the nuances and complexities inherent in understanding religious texts, surpassing the limitations of traditional automatic metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09844v1,2024-09
Generating Synthetic Free-text Medical Records with Low Re-identification Risk using Masked Language Modeling,"Samuel Belkadi, Libo Ren, Nicolo Micheletti, Lifeng Han, Goran Nenadic","In this paper, we present a system that generates synthetic free-text medical records, such as discharge summaries, admission notes and doctor correspondences, using Masked Language Modeling (MLM). Our system is designed to preserve the critical information of the records while introducing significant diversity and minimizing re-identification risk. The system incorporates a de-identification component that uses Philter to mask Protected Health Information (PHI), followed by a Medical Entity Recognition (NER) model to retain key medical information. We explore various masking ratios and mask-filling techniques to balance the trade-off between diversity and fidelity in the synthetic outputs without affecting overall readability. Our results demonstrate that the system can produce high-quality synthetic data with significant diversity while achieving a HIPAA-compliant PHI recall rate of 0.96 and a low re-identification risk of 0.035. Furthermore, downstream evaluations using a NER task reveal that the synthetic data can be effectively used to train models with performance comparable to those trained on real data. The flexibility of the system allows it to be adapted for specific use cases, making it a valuable tool for privacy-preserving data generation in medical research and healthcare applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09831v2,2024-09

Reasoning Paths with Reference Objects Elicit Quantitative Spatial Reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models,"Yuan-Hong Liao, Rafid Mahmood, Sanja Fidler, David Acuna","Despite recent advances demonstrating vision-language models' (VLMs) abilities to describe complex relationships in images using natural language, their capability to quantitatively reason about object sizes and distances remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a manually annotated benchmark, Q-Spatial Bench, with 271 questions across five categories designed for quantitative spatial reasoning and systematically investigate the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs on this task. Our analysis reveals that reasoning about distances between objects is particularly challenging for SoTA VLMs; however, some VLMs significantly outperform others, with an over 40-point gap between the two best performing models. We also make the surprising observation that the success rate of the top-performing VLM increases by 19 points when a reasoning path using a reference object emerges naturally in the response. Inspired by this observation, we develop a zero-shot prompting technique, SpatialPrompt, that encourages VLMs to answer quantitative spatial questions using reference objects as visual cues. By instructing VLMs to use reference objects in their reasoning paths via SpatialPrompt, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and GPT-4V improve their success rates by over 40, 20, and 30 points, respectively. We emphasize that these significant improvements are obtained without needing more data, model architectural modifications, or fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09788v1,2024-09

Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation for Automated Structured Data Extraction from Diagnostic Reports,"Mohamed Sobhi Jabal, Pranav Warman, Jikai Zhang, Kartikeye Gupta, Ayush Jain, Maciej Mazurowski, Walter Wiggins, Kirti Magudia, Evan Calabrese","Purpose: To develop and evaluate an automated system for extracting structured clinical information from unstructured radiology and pathology reports using open-weights large language models (LMs) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and to assess the effects of model configuration variables on extraction performance. Methods and Materials: The study utilized two datasets: 7,294 radiology reports annotated for Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) scores and 2,154 pathology reports annotated for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. An automated pipeline was developed to benchmark the performance of various LMs and RAG configurations. The impact of model size, quantization, prompting strategies, output formatting, and inference parameters was systematically evaluated. Results: The best performing models achieved over 98% accuracy in extracting BT-RADS scores from radiology reports and over 90% for IDH mutation status extraction from pathology reports. The top model being medical fine-tuned llama3. Larger, newer, and domain fine-tuned models consistently outperformed older and smaller models. Model quantization had minimal impact on performance. Few-shot prompting significantly improved accuracy. RAG improved performance for complex pathology reports but not for shorter radiology reports. Conclusions: Open LMs demonstrate significant potential for automated extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured clinical reports with local privacy-preserving application. Careful model selection, prompt engineering, and semi-automated optimization using annotated data are critical for optimal performance. These approaches could be reliable enough for practical use in research workflows, highlighting the potential for human-machine collaboration in healthcare data extraction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10576v2,2024-09
Efficient Hybrid Inference for LLMs: Reward-Based Token Modelling with Selective Cloud Assistance,"Adarsh MS, Jithin VG, Ditto PS","Large language models (LLMs) are known for their exceptional performance across a range of natural language processing tasks, but their deployment comes at a high computational and financial cost. On the other hand, smaller language models (SLMs), which can be deployed on lower-cost edge devices, struggle to match the performance of their larger counterparts. This paper presents a novel hybrid inference approach that leverages the strengths of both model types while minimizing reliance on costly cloud-based LLMs. Unlike existing methods that route entire queries to either an SLM or a cloud LLM, our approach introduces a reward-based mechanism to dynamically determine the involvement of the cloud LLM during token generation. Specifically, each token predicted by the SLM is evaluated against a reward score, and only when this score falls below a certain threshold is the cloud LLM consulted for assistance in the next token prediction. This method not only reduces the traffic to the cloud LLM, thereby lowering costs, but also allows for flexible control over response quality depending on the reward score threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces cloud LLM usage with minimal impact on overall response quality, offering a cost-effective solution for deploying high-performance language models",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13757v1,2024-09
ELMI: Interactive and Intelligent Sign Language Translation of Lyrics for Song Signing,"Suhyeon Yoo, Khai N.

Our formative study revealed the challenges song-signers face, including semantic, syntactic, expressive, and rhythmic considerations in translations. We present ELMI, an accessible song-signing tool that assists in translating lyrics into sign language. ELMI enables users to edit glosses line-by-line, with real-time synced lyric highlighting and music video snippets. Users can also chat with a large language model-driven AI to discuss meaning, glossing, emoting, and timing. Through an exploratory study with 13 song-signers, we examined how ELMI facilitates their workflows and how song-signers leverage and receive an LLM-driven chat for translation. Participants successfully adopted ELMI to song-signing, with active discussions on the fly. They also reported improved confidence and independence in their translations, finding ELMI encouraging, constructive, and informative.

This paper investigates the optimal way to incorporate metadata into a political stance detection task. We demonstrate that previous methods combining metadata with language-based data for political stance detection have not fully utilized the metadata information; our simple baseline, using only party membership information, surpasses the current state-of-the-art. We then show that prepending metadata (e.g., party and policy) to political speeches performs best, outperforming all baselines, indicating that complex metadata inclusion systems may not learn the task optimally.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13756v1,2024-09
Benchmarking LLMs in Political Content Text-Annotation: Proof-of-Concept with Toxicity and Incivility Data,Bastián González-Bustamante,"This article benchmarked the ability of OpenAI's GPTs and a number of open-source LLMs to perform annotation tasks on political content. We used a novel protest event dataset comprising more than three million digital interactions and created a gold standard that includes ground-truth labels annotated by human coders about toxicity and incivility on social media. We included in our benchmark Google's Perspective algorithm, which, along with GPTs, was employed throughout their respective APIs while the open-source LLMs were deployed locally. The findings show that Perspective API using a laxer threshold, GPT-4o, and Nous Hermes 2 Mixtral outperform other LLM's zero-shot classification annotations. In addition, Nous Hermes 2 and Mistral OpenOrca, with a smaller number of parameters, are able to perform the task with high performance, being attractive options that could offer good trade-offs between performance, implementing costs and computing time.

PersonaMark: Personalized LLM watermarking for model protection and user attribution,"Yuehan Zhang, Peizhuo Lv, Yinpeng Liu, Yongqiang Ma, Wei Lu, Xiaofeng Wang, Xiaozhong Liu, Jiawei Liu","The rapid advancement of customized Large Language Models (LLMs) offers considerable convenience. However, it also intensifies concerns regarding the protection of copyright/confidential information. With the extensive adoption of private LLMs, safeguarding model copyright and ensuring data privacy have become critical. Text watermarking has emerged as a viable solution for detecting AI-generated content and protecting models. However, existing methods fall short in providing individualized watermarks for each user, a critical feature for enhancing accountability and traceability. In this paper, we introduce PersonaMark, a novel personalized text watermarking scheme designed to protect LLMs' copyrights and bolster accountability. PersonaMark leverages sentence structure as a subtle carrier of watermark information and optimizes the generation process to maintain the natural output of the model. By employing a personalized hashing function, unique watermarks are embedded for each user, enabling high-quality text generation without compromising the model's performance. This approach is both time-efficient and scalable, capable of handling large numbers of users through a multi-user hashing mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneer study to explore personalized watermarking in LLMs. We conduct extensive evaluations across four LLMs, analyzing various metrics such as perplexity, sentiment, alignment, and readability. The results validate that PersonaMark preserves text quality, ensures unbiased watermark insertion, and offers robust watermark detection capabilities, all while maintaining the model's behavior with minimal disruption.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09739v2,2024-09
Automatic Control With Human-Like Reasoning: Exploring Language Model Embodied Air Traffic Agents,"Justas Andriuškevičius, Junzi Sun","Recent developments in language models have created new opportunities in air traffic control studies. The current focus is primarily on text and language-based use cases. However, these language models may offer a higher potential impact in the air traffic control domain, thanks to their ability to interact with air traffic environments in an embodied agent form. They also provide a language-like reasoning capability to explain their decisions, which has been a significant roadblock for the implementation of automatic air traffic control.   This paper investigates the application of a language model-based agent with function-calling and learning capabilities to resolve air traffic conflicts without human intervention. The main components of this research are foundational large language models, tools that allow the agent to interact with the simulator, and a new concept, the experience library. An innovative part of this research, the experience library, is a vector database that stores synthesized knowledge that agents have learned from interactions with the simulations and language models.   To evaluate the performance of our language model-based agent, both open-source and closed-source models were tested. The results of our study reveal significant differences in performance across various configurations of the language model-based agents. The best-performing configuration was able to solve almost all 120 but one imminent conflict scenarios, including up to four aircraft at the same time. Most importantly, the agents are able to provide human-level text explanations on traffic situations and conflict resolution strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09717v1,2024-09
AlpaPICO: Extraction of PICO Frames from Clinical Trial Documents Using LLMs,"Madhusudan Ghosh, Shrimon Mukherjee, Asmit Ganguly, Partha Basuchowdhuri, Sudip Kumar Naskar, Debasis Ganguly","In recent years, there has been a surge in the publication of clinical trial reports, making it challenging to conduct systematic reviews. Automatically extracting Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) from clinical trial studies can alleviate the traditionally time-consuming process of manually scrutinizing systematic reviews. Existing approaches of PICO frame extraction involves supervised approach that relies on the existence of manually annotated data points in the form of BIO label tagging. Recent approaches, such as In-Context Learning (ICL), which has been shown to be effective for a number of downstream NLP tasks, require the use of labeled examples. In this work, we adopt ICL strategy by employing the pretrained knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), gathered during the pretraining phase of an LLM, to automatically extract the PICO-related terminologies from clinical trial documents in unsupervised set up to bypass the availability of large number of annotated data instances. Additionally, to showcase the highest effectiveness of LLM in oracle scenario where large number of annotated samples are available, we adopt the instruction tuning strategy by employing Low Rank Adaptation (LORA) to conduct the training of gigantic model in low resource environment for the PICO frame extraction task. Our empirical results show that our proposed ICL-based framework produces comparable results on all the version of EBM-NLP datasets and the proposed instruction tuned version of our framework produces state-of-the-art results on all the different EBM-NLP datasets.

Entity-Aware Self-Attention and Contextualized GCN for Enhanced Relation Extraction in Long Sentences,"Xin Wang, Xinyi Bai","Relation extraction as an important natural Language processing (NLP) task is to identify relations between named entities in text. Recently, graph convolutional networks over dependency trees have been widely used to capture syntactic features and achieved attractive performance. However, most existing dependency-based approaches ignore the positive influence of the words outside the dependency trees, sometimes conveying rich and useful information on relation extraction. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Entity-aware Self-attention Contextualized GCN (ESC-GCN), which efficiently incorporates syntactic structure of input sentences and semantic context of sequences. To be specific, relative position self-attention obtains the overall semantic pairwise correlation related to word position, and contextualized graph convolutional networks capture rich intra-sentence dependencies between words by adequately pruning operations. Furthermore, entity-aware attention layer dynamically selects which token is more decisive to make final relation prediction. In this way, our proposed model not only reduces the noisy impact from dependency trees, but also obtains easily-ignored entity-related semantic representation. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that our model achieves encouraging performance as compared to existing dependency-based and sequence-based models. Specially, our model excels in extracting relations between entities of long sentences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13755v2,2024-09
ExploreSelf: Fostering User-driven Exploration and Reflection on Personal Challenges with Adaptive Guidance by Large Language Models,"Inhwa Song, SoHyun Park, Sachin R.

Reflective prompts have been used to provide direction, and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to provide tailored guidance. Current systems often limit users' flexibility to direct their reflections. We thus present ExploreSelf, an LLM-driven application designed to empower users to control their reflective journey. ExploreSelf allows users to receive adaptive support through dynamically generated questions. Through an exploratory study with 19 participants, we examine how participants explore and reflect on personal challenges using ExploreSelf.

Leveraging Open-Source Large Language Models for Native Language Identification,"Yee Man Ng, Ilia Markov","Native Language Identification (NLI) - the task of identifying the native language (L1) of a person based on their writing in the second language (L2) - has applications in forensics, marketing, and second language acquisition. Historically, conventional machine learning approaches that heavily rely on extensive feature engineering have outperformed transformer-based language models on this task. Recently, closed-source generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable performance on NLI in a zero-shot setting, including promising results in open-set classification. However, closed-source LLMs have many disadvantages, such as high costs and undisclosed nature of training data. This study explores the potential of using open-source LLMs for NLI. Our results indicate that open-source LLMs do not reach the accuracy levels of closed-source LLMs when used out-of-the-box. However, when fine-tuned on labeled training data, open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to that of commercial LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09659v1,2024-09
Unveiling Gender Bias in Large Language Models: Using Teacher's Evaluation in Higher Education As an Example,Yuanning Huang,"This paper investigates gender bias in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated teacher evaluations in higher education setting, focusing on evaluations produced by GPT-4 across six academic subjects. By applying a comprehensive analytical framework that includes Odds Ratio (OR) analysis, Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT), sentiment analysis, and contextual analysis, this paper identified patterns of gender-associated language reflecting societal stereotypes. Specifically, words related to approachability and support were used more frequently for female instructors, while words related to entertainment were predominantly used for male instructors, aligning with the concepts of communal and agentic behaviors. The study also found moderate to strong associations between male salient adjectives and male names, though career and family words did not distinctly capture gender biases. These findings align with prior research on societal norms and stereotypes, reinforcing the notion that LLM-generated text reflects existing biases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09652v1,2024-09

Confidence Estimation for LLM-Based Dialogue State Tracking,"Yi-Jyun Sun, Suvodip Dey, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Gokhan Tur","Estimation of a model's confidence on its outputs is critical for Conversational AI systems based on large language models (LLMs), especially for reducing hallucination and preventing over-reliance. In this work, we provide an exhaustive exploration of methods, including approaches proposed for open- and closed-weight LLMs, aimed at quantifying and leveraging model uncertainty to improve the reliability of LLM-generated responses, specifically focusing on dialogue state tracking (DST) in task-oriented dialogue systems (TODS). Regardless of the model type, well-calibrated confidence scores are essential to handle uncertainties, thereby improving model performance. We evaluate four methods for estimating confidence scores based on softmax, raw token scores, verbalized confidences, and a combination of these methods, using the area under the curve (AUC) metric to assess calibration, with higher AUC indicating better calibration. We also enhance these with a self-probing mechanism, proposed for closed models. Furthermore, we assess these methods using an open-weight model fine-tuned for the task of DST, achieving superior joint goal accuracy (JGA). Our findings also suggest that fine-tuning open-weight LLMs can result in enhanced AUC performance, indicating better confidence score calibration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09629v2,2024-09

Rethinking KenLM: Good and Bad Model Ensembles for Efficient Text Quality Filtering in Large Web Corpora,"Yungi Kim, Hyunsoo Ha, Sukyung Lee, Jihoo Kim, Seonghoon Yang, Chanjun Park","With the increasing demand for substantial amounts of high-quality data to train large language models (LLMs), efficiently filtering large web corpora has become a critical challenge. For this purpose, KenLM, a lightweight n-gram-based language model that operates on CPUs, is widely used. However, the traditional method of training KenLM utilizes only high-quality data and, consequently, does not explicitly learn the linguistic patterns of low-quality data. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble approach that leverages two contrasting KenLMs: (i) Good KenLM, trained on high-quality data; and (ii) Bad KenLM, trained on low-quality data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces noisy content while preserving high-quality content compared to the traditional KenLM training method. This indicates that our method can be a practical solution with minimal computational overhead for resource-constrained environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09613v1,2024-09
Towards Data-Centric RLHF: Simple Metrics for Preference Dataset Comparison,"Judy Hanwen Shen, Archit Sharma, Jun Qin","The goal of aligning language models to human preferences requires data that reveal these preferences. Ideally, time and money can be spent carefully collecting and tailoring bespoke preference data to each downstream application. However, in practice, a select few publicly available preference datasets are often used to train reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While new preference datasets are being introduced with increasing frequency, there are currently no existing efforts to measure and compare these datasets. In this paper, we systematically study preference datasets through three perspectives: scale, label noise, and information content. We propose specific metrics for each of these perspectives and uncover different axes of comparison for a better understanding of preference datasets. Our work is a first step towards a data-centric approach to alignment by providing perspectives that aid in training efficiency and iterative data collection for RLHF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09603v1,2024-09
Improving Statistical Significance in Human Evaluation of Automatic Metrics via Soft Pairwise Accuracy,"Brian Thompson, Nitika Mathur, Daniel Deutsch, Huda Khayrallah","Selecting an automatic metric that best emulates human annotators is often non-trivial, because there is no clear definition of ""best emulates."" A meta-metric is required to compare the human judgments to the automatic metric scores, and metric rankings depend on the choice of meta-metric. We propose Soft Pairwise Accuracy (SPA), a new meta-metric that builds on Pairwise Accuracy (PA) but incorporates the statistical significance of both the human judgments and the metric scores. We show that SPA is more stable than PA with respect to changes in the number of systems/segments used for evaluation. We also show that PA can only assign a small set of distinct output values to metrics, and this results in many metrics being artificially assigned the exact same PA score. We demonstrate that SPA fixes this issue. Finally, we show that SPA is more discriminative than PA, producing more statistically significant comparisons between metrics. SPA was selected as the official system-level metric for the 2024 WMT Metrics Shared Task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09598v2,2024-09

We apply ValueCompass to measure the value alignment of humans and language models (LMs) across four real-world vignettes: collaborative writing, education, public sectors, and healthcare. Our findings uncover risky misalignment between humans and LMs, such as LMs agreeing with values like ""Choose Own Goals"", which are largely disagreed by humans. We also observe values vary across vignettes, underscoring the necessity for context-aware AI alignment strategies. This work provides insights into the design space of human-AI alignment, offering foundations for developing AI that responsibly reflects societal values and ethics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09586v1,2024-09
RethinkMCTS: Refining Erroneous Thoughts in Monte Carlo Tree Search for Code Generation,"Qingyao Li, Wei Xia, Kounianhua Du, Xinyi Dai, Ruiming Tang, Yasheng Wang, Yong Yu, Weinan Zhang","LLM agents enhanced by tree search algorithms have yielded notable performances in code generation. However, current search algorithms in this domain suffer from low search quality due to several reasons: 1) Ineffective design of the search space for the high-reasoning demands of code generation tasks, 2) Inadequate integration of code feedback with the search algorithm, and 3) Poor handling of negative feedback during the search, leading to reduced search efficiency and quality. To address these challenges, we propose to search for the reasoning process of the code and use the detailed feedback of code execution to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. In this paper, we introduce RethinkMCTS, which employs the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to conduct thought-level searches before generating code, thereby exploring a wider range of strategies. More importantly, we construct verbal feedback from fine-grained code execution feedback to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. This ensures that the search progresses along the correct reasoning paths, thus improving the overall search quality of the tree by leveraging execution feedback. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RethinkMCTS outperforms previous search-based and feedback-based code generation baselines. On the HumanEval dataset, it improves the pass@1 of GPT-3.5-turbo from 70.12 to 89.02 and GPT-4o-mini from 87.20 to 94.51. It effectively conducts more thorough exploration through thought-level searches and enhances the search quality of the entire tree by incorporating rethink operation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09584v1,2024-09
Thesis proposal: Are We Losing Textual Diversity to Natural Language Processing?,Josef Jon,"This thesis argues that the currently widely used Natural Language Processing algorithms possibly have various limitations related to the properties of the texts they handle and produce. With the wide adoption of these tools in rapid progress, we must ask what these limitations are and what are the possible implications of integrating such tools even more deeply into our daily lives.   As a testbed, we have chosen the task of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Nevertheless, we aim for general insights and outcomes, applicable even to current Large Language Models (LLMs). We ask whether the algorithms used in NMT have inherent inductive biases that are beneficial for most types of inputs but might harm the processing of untypical texts. To explore this hypothesis, we define a set of measures to quantify text diversity based on its statistical properties, like uniformity or rhythmicity of word-level surprisal, on multiple scales (sentence, discourse, language). We then conduct a series of experiments to investigate whether NMT systems struggle with maintaining the diversity of such texts, potentially reducing the richness of the language generated by these systems, compared to human translators.   We search for potential causes of these limitations rooted in training objectives and decoding algorithms. Our ultimate goal is to develop alternatives that do not enforce uniformity in the distribution of statistical properties in the output and that allow for better global planning of the translation, taking into account the intrinsic ambiguity of the translation task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09568v1,2024-09
ASR Error Correction using Large Language Models,"Rao Ma, Mengjie Qian, Mark Gales, Kate Knill","Error correction (EC) models play a crucial role in refining Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcriptions, enhancing the readability and quality of transcriptions. Without requiring access to the underlying code or model weights, EC can improve performance and provide domain adaptation for black-box ASR systems. This work investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for error correction across diverse scenarios. 1-best ASR hypotheses are commonly used as the input to EC models. We propose building high-performance EC models using ASR N-best lists which should provide more contextual information for the correction process. Additionally, the generation process of a standard EC model is unrestricted in the sense that any output sequence can be generated. For some scenarios, such as unseen domains, this flexibility may impact performance. To address this, we introduce a constrained decoding approach based on the N-best list or an ASR lattice. Finally, most EC models are trained for a specific ASR system requiring retraining whenever the underlying ASR system is changed. This paper explores the ability of EC models to operate on the output of different ASR systems. This concept is further extended to zero-shot error correction using LLMs, such as ChatGPT. Experiments on three standard datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods for both Transducer and attention-based encoder-decoder ASR systems. In addition, the proposed method can serve as an effective method for model ensembling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09554v1,2024-09
Synergistic Simulations: Multi-Agent Problem Solving with Large Language Models,"Asher Sprigler, Alexander Drobek, Keagan Weinstock, Wendpanga Tapsoba, Gavin Childress, Andy Dao, Lucas Gral","Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly demonstrated the ability to facilitate the development of multi-agent systems that allow the interpretation of thoughts and actions generated by each individual. Promising advancements have also been made in LLM-based interaction with existing worlds, particularly in interacting with simulated environments. This paper aims to integrate both aforementioned topics (agents & world interaction) into a single simulation where multiple agents can work together to solve a problem, modeling how groups of humans can often solve problems better than individuals. By showing whether LLMs demonstrate the synergy of human collaboration, it could lead to advancements in the applications of LLMs. We implemented two simulations: a physical studio apartment with two roommates, and another where agents collaborate to complete a programming task. We provide a multi-agent framework, discuss the performance of the agents in each simulation, and discuss potential future additions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13753v1,2024-09
Planning Transformer: Long-Horizon Offline Reinforcement Learning with Planning Tokens,"Joseph Clinton, Robert Lieck","Supervised learning approaches to offline reinforcement learning, particularly those utilizing the Decision Transformer, have shown effectiveness in continuous environments and for sparse rewards. However, they often struggle with long-horizon tasks due to the high compounding error of auto-regressive models. To overcome this limitation, we go beyond next-token prediction and introduce Planning Tokens, which contain high-level, long time-scale information about the agent's future. Predicting dual time-scale tokens at regular intervals enables our model to use these long-horizon Planning Tokens as a form of implicit planning to guide its low-level policy and reduce compounding error. This architectural modification significantly enhances performance on long-horizon tasks, establishing a new state-of-the-art in complex D4RL environments. Additionally, we demonstrate that Planning Tokens improve the interpretability of the model's policy through the interpretable plan visualisations and attention map.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09513v1,2024-09
Comparing Retrieval-Augmentation and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Privacy-Preserving Personalization of Large Language Models,"Alireza Salemi, Hamed Zamani","Privacy-preserving methods for personalizing large language models (LLMs) are relatively under-explored. There are two schools of thought on this topic: (1) generating personalized outputs by personalizing the input prompt through retrieval augmentation from the user's personal information (RAG-based methods), and (2) parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs per user that considers efficiency and space limitations (PEFT-based methods). This paper presents the first systematic comparison between two approaches on a wide range of personalization tasks using seven diverse datasets. Our results indicate that RAG-based and PEFT-based personalization methods on average yield 14.92% and 1.07% improvements over the non-personalized LLM, respectively. We find that combining RAG with PEFT elevates these improvements to 15.98%. Additionally, we identify a positive correlation between the amount of user data and PEFT's effectiveness, indicating that RAG is a better choice for cold-start users (i.e., user's with limited personal data).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09510v1,2024-09
Uddessho: An Extensive Benchmark Dataset for Multimodal Author Intent Classification in Low-Resource Bangla Language,"Fatema Tuj Johora Faria, Mukaffi Bin Moin, Md. Mahfuzur Rahman, Md Morshed Alam Shanto, Asif Iftekher Fahim, Md. Moinul Hoque","With the increasing popularity of daily information sharing and acquisition on the Internet, this paper introduces an innovative approach for intent classification in Bangla language, focusing on social media posts where individuals share their thoughts and opinions. The proposed method leverages multimodal data with particular emphasis on authorship identification, aiming to understand the underlying purpose behind textual content, especially in the context of varied user-generated posts on social media. Current methods often face challenges in low-resource languages like Bangla, particularly when author traits intricately link with intent, as observed in social media posts. To address this, we present the Multimodal-based Author Bangla Intent Classification (MABIC) framework, utilizing text and images to gain deeper insights into the conveyed intentions. We have created a dataset named ""Uddessho,"" comprising 3,048 instances sourced from social media. Our methodology comprises two approaches for classifying textual intent and multimodal author intent, incorporating early fusion and late fusion techniques. In our experiments, the unimodal approach achieved an accuracy of 64.53% in interpreting Bangla textual intent. In contrast, our multimodal approach significantly outperformed traditional unimodal methods, achieving an accuracy of 76.19%. This represents an improvement of 11.66%. To our best knowledge, this is the first research work on multimodal-based author intent classification for low-resource Bangla language social media posts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09504v1,2024-09
Synthetic4Health: Generating Annotated Synthetic Clinical Letters,"Libo Ren, Samuel Belkadi, Lifeng Han, Warren Del-Pinto, Goran Nenadic","Since clinical letters contain sensitive information, clinical-related datasets can not be widely applied in model training, medical research, and teaching. This work aims to generate reliable, various, and de-identified synthetic clinical letters. To achieve this goal, we explored different pre-trained language models (PLMs) for masking and generating text. After that, we worked on Bio\_ClinicalBERT, a high-performing model, and experimented with different masking strategies. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used for evaluation. Additionally, a downstream task, Named Entity Recognition (NER), was also implemented to assess the usability of these synthetic letters.   The results indicate that 1) encoder-only models outperform encoder-decoder models. 2) Among encoder-only models, those trained on general corpora perform comparably to those trained on clinical data when clinical information is preserved. 3) Additionally, preserving clinical entities and document structure better aligns with our objectives than simply fine-tuning the model. 4) Furthermore, different masking strategies can impact the quality of synthetic clinical letters. Masking stopwords has a positive impact, while masking nouns or verbs has a negative effect. 5) For evaluation, BERTScore should be the primary quantitative evaluation metric, with other metrics serving as supplementary references. 6) Contextual information does not significantly impact the models' understanding, so the synthetic clinical letters have the potential to replace the original ones in downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09501v1,2024-09
Keeping Humans in the Loop: Human-Centered Automated Annotation with Generative AI,"Nicholas Pangakis, Samuel Wolken","Automated text annotation is a compelling use case for generative large language models (LLMs) in social media research. Recent work suggests that LLMs can achieve strong performance on annotation tasks; however, these studies evaluate LLMs on a small number of tasks and likely suffer from contamination due to a reliance on public benchmark datasets. Here, we test a human-centered framework for responsibly evaluating artificial intelligence tools used in automated annotation. We use GPT-4 to replicate 27 annotation tasks across 11 password-protected datasets from recently published computational social science articles in high-impact journals. For each task, we compare GPT-4 annotations against human-annotated ground-truth labels and against annotations from separate supervised classification models fine-tuned on human-generated labels. Although the quality of LLM labels is generally high, we find significant variation in LLM performance across tasks, even within datasets. Our findings underscore the importance of a human-centered workflow and careful evaluation standards: Automated annotations significantly diverge from human judgment in numerous scenarios, despite various optimization strategies such as prompt tuning. Grounding automated annotation in validation labels generated by humans is essential for responsible evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09467v2,2024-09
Rethinking the Influence of Source Code on Test Case Generation,"Dong Huang, Jie M. Zhang, Mingzhe Du, Mark Harman, Heming Cui","Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist test generation with the source code under test provided as the context. This paper aims to answer the question: If the source code under test is incorrect, will LLMs be misguided when generating tests? The effectiveness of test cases is measured by their accuracy, coverage, and bug detection effectiveness. Our evaluation results with five open- and six closed-source LLMs on four datasets demonstrate that incorrect code can significantly mislead LLMs in generating correct, high-coverage, and bug-revealing tests. For instance, in the HumanEval dataset, LLMs achieve 80.45% test accuracy when provided with task descriptions and correct code, but only 57.12% when given task descriptions and incorrect code. For the APPS dataset, prompts with correct code yield tests that detect 39.85% of the bugs, while prompts with incorrect code detect only 19.61%. These findings have important implications for the deployment of LLM-based testing: using it on mature code may help protect against future regression, but on early-stage immature code, it may simply bake in errors. Our findings also underscore the need for further research to improve LLMs resilience against incorrect code in generating reliable and bug-revealing tests.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09464v2,2024-09
"Enhancing LLM Problem Solving with REAP: Reflection, Explicit Problem Deconstruction, and Advanced Prompting","Ryan Lingo, Martin Arroyo, Rajeev Chhajer","Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, yet improving their problem-solving capabilities, particularly for complex, reasoning-intensive tasks, remains a persistent challenge. This paper introduces the REAP (Reflection, Explicit Problem Deconstruction, and Advanced Prompting) method, an innovative approach within the dynamic context generation framework. REAP guides LLMs through reflection on the query, deconstructing it into manageable components, and generating relevant context to enhance the solution process. We evaluated REAP using a dataset designed to expose LLM limitations, comparing zero-shot prompting with REAP-enhanced prompts across six state-of-the-art models: OpenAI's o1-preview, o1-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The results demonstrate notable performance gains, with o1-mini improving by 40.97%, GPT-4o by 66.26%, and GPT-4o-mini by 112.93%. Despite the already strong baseline performance of OpenAI's o1-preview, modest gains were observed. Beyond performance improvements, REAP offers a cost-effective solution; for example, GPT-4o-mini, which is approximately 100 times cheaper than o1-preview, delivered competitive results. REAP also improves the clarity of model outputs, making it easier for humans to understand the reasoning behind the results and simplifying the process of identifying and addressing any issues. These findings demonstrate REAP's potential to greatly improve the capabilities of LLMs, providing both better performance and increased cost-efficiency across a wide range of applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09415v1,2024-09
Constructive Approach to Bidirectional Causation between Qualia Structure and Language Emergence,"Tadahiro Taniguchi, Masafumi Oizumi, Noburo Saji, Takato Horii, Naotsugu Tsuchiya","This paper presents a novel perspective on the bidirectional causation between language emergence and relational structure of subjective experiences, termed qualia structure, and lays out the constructive approach to the intricate dependency between the two. We hypothesize that languages with distributional semantics, e.g., syntactic-semantic structures, may have emerged through the process of aligning internal representations among individuals, and such alignment of internal representations facilitates more structured language. This mutual dependency is suggested by the recent advancements in AI and symbol emergence robotics, and collective predictive coding (CPC) hypothesis, in particular. Computational studies show that neural network-based language models form systematically structured internal representations, and multimodal language models can share representations between language and perceptual information. This perspective suggests that language emergence serves not only as a mechanism creating a communication tool but also as a mechanism for allowing people to realize shared understanding of qualitative experiences. The paper discusses the implications of this bidirectional causation in the context of consciousness studies, linguistics, and cognitive science, and outlines future constructive research directions to further explore this dynamic relationship between language emergence and qualia structure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09413v1,2024-09
Towards Diverse and Efficient Audio Captioning via Diffusion Models,"Manjie Xu, Chenxing Li, Xinyi Tu, Yong Ren, Ruibo Fu, Wei Liang, Dong Yu","We introduce Diffusion-based Audio Captioning (DAC), a non-autoregressive diffusion model tailored for diverse and efficient audio captioning. Although existing captioning models relying on language backbones have achieved remarkable success in various captioning tasks, their insufficient performance in terms of generation speed and diversity impede progress in audio understanding and multimedia applications. Our diffusion-based framework offers unique advantages stemming from its inherent stochasticity and holistic context modeling in captioning. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that DAC not only achieves SOTA performance levels compared to existing benchmarks in the caption quality, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of generation speed and diversity. The success of DAC illustrates that text generation can also be seamlessly integrated with audio and visual generation tasks using a diffusion backbone, paving the way for a unified, audio-related generative model across different modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09401v1,2024-09
LLM-Powered Ensemble Learning for Paper Source Tracing: A GPU-Free Approach,"Kunlong Chen, Junjun Wang, Zhaoqun Chen, Kunjin Chen, Yitian Chen","We participated in the KDD CUP 2024 paper source tracing competition and achieved the 3rd place. This competition tasked participants with identifying the reference sources (i.e., ref-sources, as referred to by the organizers of the competition) of given academic papers. Unlike most teams that addressed this challenge by fine-tuning pre-trained neural language models such as BERT or ChatGLM, our primary approach utilized closed-source large language models (LLMs). With recent advancements in LLM technology, closed-source LLMs have demonstrated the capability to tackle complex reasoning tasks in zero-shot or few-shot scenarios. Consequently, in the absence of GPUs, we employed closed-source LLMs to directly generate predicted reference sources from the provided papers. We further refined these predictions through ensemble learning. Notably, our method was the only one among the award-winning approaches that did not require the use of GPUs for model training.

StressPrompt: Does Stress Impact Large Language Models and Human Performance Similarly?,"Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Aorigele Bao, Xiang He, Yiting Dong, Yi Zeng","Human beings often experience stress, which can significantly influence their performance. This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit stress responses similar to those of humans and whether their performance fluctuates under different stress-inducing prompts. To investigate this, we developed a novel set of prompts, termed StressPrompt, designed to induce varying levels of stress. These prompts were derived from established psychological frameworks and carefully calibrated based on ratings from human participants. We then applied these prompts to several LLMs to assess their responses across a range of tasks, including instruction-following, complex reasoning, and emotional intelligence. The findings suggest that LLMs, like humans, perform optimally under moderate stress, consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson law. Notably, their performance declines under both low and high-stress conditions. Our analysis further revealed that these StressPrompts significantly alter the internal states of LLMs, leading to changes in their neural representations that mirror human responses to stress. This research provides critical insights into the operational robustness and flexibility of LLMs, demonstrating the importance of designing AI systems capable of maintaining high performance in real-world scenarios where stress is prevalent, such as in customer service, healthcare, and emergency response contexts. Moreover, this study contributes to the broader AI research community by offering a new perspective on how LLMs handle different scenarios and their similarities to human cognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17167v1,2024-09
Generating Event-oriented Attribution for Movies via Two-Stage Prefix-Enhanced Multimodal LLM,"Yuanjie Lyu, Tong Xu, Zihan Niu, Bo Peng, Jing Ke, Enhong Chen","The prosperity of social media platforms has raised the urgent demand for semantic-rich services, e.g., event and storyline attribution. However, most existing research focuses on clip-level event understanding, primarily through basic captioning tasks, without analyzing the causes of events across an entire movie. This is a significant challenge, as even advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with extensive multimodal information due to limited context length. To address this issue, we propose a Two-Stage Prefix-Enhanced MLLM (TSPE) approach for event attribution, i.e., connecting associated events with their causal semantics, in movie videos. In the local stage, we introduce an interaction-aware prefix that guides the model to focus on the relevant multimodal information within a single clip, briefly summarizing the single event. Correspondingly, in the global stage, we strengthen the connections between associated events using an inferential knowledge graph, and design an event-aware prefix that directs the model to focus on associated events rather than all preceding clips, resulting in accurate event attribution. Comprehensive evaluations of two real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09362v1,2024-09

The adapter was developed to improve the performance of the base model in tasks related to programming and understanding the Russian language. Considering the high quality of the original model in tasks in the English language, the goal of the research was to expand its linguistic and technical spectrum. The proposed adapter was trained using a large and diverse dataset, including question-answer pairs related to programming, as well code-related texts in Russian language. The applied training methodology ensures an improvement in the model's quality of answers in understanding and generating Python code based on Russian instructions. We evaluated the performance of the base model with the installed adapter using various metrics, comparing it to the base model as well as other state-of-the-art models in this field.

Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models for Automated Medical Documentation,"Hui Yi Leong, Yi Fan Gao, Ji Shuai, Yang Zhang, Uktu Pamuksuz","Scientific research indicates that for every hour spent in direct patient care, physicians spend nearly two additional hours on administrative tasks, particularly on electronic health records (EHRs) and desk work. This excessive administrative burden not only reduces the time available for patient care but also contributes to physician burnout and inefficiencies in healthcare delivery. To address these challenges, this study introduces MediGen, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to automate the generation of medical reports from medical dialogues. By leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies for fine-tuning open-source pretrained models, including LLaMA3-8B, MediGen achieves high accuracy in transcribing and summarizing clinical interactions. The fine-tuned LLaMA3-8B model demonstrated promising results, achieving a ROUGE score of 58% and a BERTScore-F1 of 72%, indicating its effectiveness in generating accurate and clinically relevant medical reports.

A Compressive Memory-based Retrieval Approach for Event Argument Extraction,"Wanlong Liu, Enqi Zhang, Li Zhou, Dingyi Zeng, Shaohuan Cheng, Chen Zhang, Malu Zhang, Wenyu Chen","Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of retrieval augmentation in the Event Argument Extraction (EAE) task. However, existing retrieval-based EAE methods have two main limitations: (1) input length constraints and (2) the gap between the retriever and the inference model. These issues limit the diversity and quality of the retrieved information. In this paper, we propose a Compressive Memory-based Retrieval (CMR) mechanism for EAE, which addresses the two limitations mentioned above. Our compressive memory, designed as a dynamic matrix that effectively caches retrieved information and supports continuous updates, overcomes the limitations of the input length. Additionally, after pre-loading all candidate demonstrations into the compressive memory, the model further retrieves and filters relevant information from memory based on the input query, bridging the gap between the retriever and the inference model. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets (RAMS, WikiEvents, ACE05), significantly outperforming existing retrieval-based EAE methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09322v1,2024-09
IW-Bench: Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Converting Image-to-Web,"Hongcheng Guo, Wei Zhang, Junhao Chen, Yaonan Gu, Jian Yang, Junjia Du, Binyuan Hui, Tianyu Liu, Jianxin Ma, Chang Zhou, Zhoujun Li","Recently advancements in large multimodal models have led to significant strides in image comprehension capabilities. Despite these advancements, there is a lack of the robust benchmark specifically for assessing the Image-to-Web conversion proficiency of these large models. Primarily, it is essential to ensure the integrity of the web elements generated. These elements comprise visible and invisible categories. Previous evaluation methods (e.g., BLEU) are notably susceptible to significant alterations due to the presence of invisible elements in Web. Furthermore, it is crucial to measure the layout information of web pages, referring to the positional relationships between elements, which is overlooked by previous work. To address challenges, we have curated and aligned a benchmark of images and corresponding web codes (IW-Bench). Specifically, we propose the Element Accuracy, which tests the completeness of the elements by parsing the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. Layout Accuracy is also proposed to analyze the positional relationships of elements by converting DOM tree into a common subsequence. Besides, we design a five-hop multimodal Chain-of-Thought Prompting for better performance, which contains five hop: 1) SoM prompt injection. 2) Inferring Elements. 3) Inferring Layout. 4) Inferring Web code. 5) Reflection. Our benchmark comprises 1200 pairs of images and web codes with varying levels of difficulty.

ODE: Open-Set Evaluation of Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models,"Yahan Tu, Rui Hu, Jitao Sang","Hallucination poses a persistent challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks for evaluating hallucinations are generally static, which may overlook the potential risk of data contamination. To address this issue, we propose ODE, an open-set, dynamic protocol designed to evaluate object hallucinations in MLLMs at both the existence and attribute levels. ODE employs a graph-based structure to represent real-world object concepts, their attributes, and the distributional associations between them. This structure facilitates the extraction of concept combinations based on diverse distributional criteria, generating varied samples for structured queries that evaluate hallucinations in both generative and discriminative tasks. Through the generation of new samples, dynamic concept combinations, and varied distribution frequencies, ODE mitigates the risk of data contamination and broadens the scope of evaluation. This protocol is applicable to both general and specialized scenarios, including those with limited data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol, revealing that MLLMs exhibit higher hallucination rates when evaluated with ODE-generated samples, which indicates potential data contamination. Furthermore, these generated samples aid in analyzing hallucination patterns and fine-tuning models, offering an effective approach to mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09318v3,2024-09
"Language Models ""Grok"" to Copy","Ang Lv, Ruobing Xie, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Rui Yan","We examine the pre-training dynamics of language models, focusing on their ability to copy text from preceding context--a fundamental skill for various LLM applications, including in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a novel perspective that Transformer-based language models develop copying abilities similarly to grokking, which refers to sudden generalization on test set long after the model fit to the training set. Our experiments yield three arguments: (1) The pre-training loss decreases rapidly, while the context copying ability of models initially lags and then abruptly saturates. (2) The speed of developing copying ability is independent of the number of tokens trained, similarly to how grokking speed is unaffected by dataset size as long as the data distribution is preserved. (3) Induction heads, the attention heads responsible for copying, form from shallow to deep layers during training, mirroring the development of circuits in deeper layers during grokking. We contend that the connection between grokking and context copying can provide valuable insights for more effective language model training, ultimately improving in-context performance. For example, we demonstrated that techniques that enhance grokking, such as regularization, either accelerate or enhance the development of context copying.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09281v1,2024-09
An empirical evaluation of using ChatGPT to summarize disputes for recommending similar labor and employment cases in Chinese,"Po-Hsien Wu, Chao-Lin Liu, Wei-Jie Li","We present a hybrid mechanism for recommending similar cases of labor and employment litigations. The classifier determines the similarity based on the itemized disputes of the two cases, that the courts prepared. We cluster the disputes, compute the cosine similarity between the disputes, and use the results as the features for the classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that this hybrid approach outperformed our previous system, which considered only the information about the clusters of the disputes. We replaced the disputes that were prepared by the courts with the itemized disputes that were generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and repeated the same experiments. Using the disputes generated by GPT-4 led to better results. Although our classifier did not perform as well when using the disputes that the ChatGPT generated, the results were satisfactory. Hence, we hope that the future large-language models will become practically useful.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09280v1,2024-09
Thinking Before Speaking: A Role-playing Model with Mindset,"Baohua Zhang, Yongyi Huang, Wenyao Cui, Huaping Zhang","Role-playing is an easy task for Large Language Models (LLMs), as they are skilled at simulating human behaviors. Many current studies have enabled LLMs to generate responses in the tone of a specific role by fine-tuning the models or using specialized prompts. However, it is typically easy to recognize when a role is being played by LLMs. These models tend to perform poorly when confronted with knowledge that the assumed role does not possess, or a question that requires the specific experience or logic of the role to answer. To address this problem and make LLMs act more like real roles, we propose a Thinking Before Speaking (TBS) model in this paper. Unlike other studies, we first extend the data based on the character's real-life scenarios and the historical dialogue, supplementing each pair of dialogue with the character's mindset. Then we add few data points that include elements beyond the role's knowledge, and fine-tune the LLMs. This approach can help LLMs adopt the role's thought process and logic, avoiding responses that fall outside the role's knowledge base. We have also prepared a dataset and evaluation metrics to test these capabilities. Experimental results show that our TBS model can better emulate a role in terms of tone, knowledge, and mindset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13752v1,2024-09

We also address the challenges facing MLLM implementation, including data limitations, technical hurdles, and ethical considerations. By identifying key research gaps, this paper aims to guide future investigations in areas such as dataset development, modality alignment methods, and the establishment of ethical guidelines. As MLLMs continue to shape the future of healthcare, understanding their potential and limitations is crucial for their responsible and effective integration into medical practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01812v5,2024-09
Block-Attention for Efficient RAG,"East Sun, Yan Wang, Lan Tian","We introduce Block-Attention, an attention mechanism designed to address the increased inference latency and cost in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. Traditional approaches often encode the entire context. Instead, Block-Attention divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, with each block independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. In RAG scenarios, by defining each passage as a block, Block-Attention enables us to reuse the KV states of passages that have been seen before, thereby significantly reducing the latency and the computation overhead during inference. The implementation of Block-Attention involves block segmentation, position re-encoding, and fine-tuning the LLM to adapt to the Block-Attention mechanism. Experiments on four RAG benchmarks demonstrate that after block fine-tuning, the Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to self-attention models (68.4\% vs 67.9\% on Llama3) or even superior performance (62.8\% vs 59.6\% on Mistral). Notably, Block-Attention significantly reduces the time to first token (TTFT) and floating point operations (FLOPs) to a very low level. It only takes 45 ms to output the first token for an input sequence with a total length of 32K. Compared to the self-attention models, the time consumption and corresponding FLOPs are reduced by 98.7\% and 99.8\%, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15355v4,2024-09
"Guiding Vision-Language Model Selection for Visual Question-Answering Across Tasks, Domains, and Knowledge Types","Neelabh Sinha, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha","Visual Question-Answering (VQA) has become key to user experience, particularly after improved generalization capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). But evaluating VLMs for an application requirement using a standardized framework in practical settings is still challenging. This paper aims to solve that using an end-to-end framework. We present VQA360 - a novel dataset derived from established VQA benchmarks, annotated with task types, application domains, and knowledge types, for a comprehensive evaluation. We also introduce GoEval, a multimodal evaluation metric developed using GPT-4o, achieving a correlation factor of 56.71% with human judgments. Our experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that no single model excels universally, thus, making a right choice a key design decision. Proprietary models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, but open-source models like InternVL-2-8B and CogVLM-2-Llama-3-19B also demonstrate competitive strengths, while providing additional advantages. Our framework can also be extended to other tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09269v3,2024-09
"Evaluating Cultural Awareness of LLMs for Yoruba, Malayalam, and English","Fiifi Dawson, Zainab Mosunmola, Sahil Pocker, Raj Abhijit Dandekar, Rajat Dandekar, Sreedath Panat","Although LLMs have been extremely effective in a large number of complex tasks, their understanding and functionality for regional languages and cultures are not well studied. In this paper, we explore the ability of various LLMs to comprehend the cultural aspects of two regional languages: Malayalam (state of Kerala, India) and Yoruba (West Africa). Using Hofstede's six cultural dimensions: Power Distance (PDI), Individualism (IDV), Motivation towards Achievement and Success (MAS), Uncertainty Avoidance (UAV), Long Term Orientation (LTO), and Indulgence (IVR), we quantify the cultural awareness of LLM-based responses. We demonstrate that although LLMs show a high cultural similarity for English, they fail to capture the cultural nuances across these 6 metrics for Malayalam and Yoruba. We also highlight the need for large-scale regional language LLM training with culturally enriched datasets. This will have huge implications for enhancing the user experience of chat-based LLMs and also improving the validity of large-scale LLM agent-based market research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01811v1,2024-09
What Is Wrong with My Model? Identifying Systematic Problems with Semantic Data Slicing,"Chenyang Yang, Yining Hong, Grace A. Lewis, Tongshuang Wu, Christian Kästner","Machine learning models make mistakes, yet sometimes it is difficult to identify the systematic problems behind the mistakes. Practitioners engage in various activities, including error analysis, testing, auditing, and red-teaming, to form hypotheses of what can go (or has gone) wrong with their models. To validate these hypotheses, practitioners employ data slicing to identify relevant examples. However, traditional data slicing is limited by available features and programmatic slicing functions. In this work, we propose SemSlicer, a framework that supports semantic data slicing, which identifies a semantically coherent slice, without the need for existing features. SemSlicer uses Large Language Models to annotate datasets and generate slices from any user-defined slicing criteria. We show that SemSlicer generates accurate slices with low cost, allows flexible trade-offs between different design dimensions, reliably identifies under-performing data slices, and helps practitioners identify useful data slices that reflect systematic problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09261v1,2024-09
Analyzing Correlations Between Intrinsic and Extrinsic Bias Metrics of Static Word Embeddings With Their Measuring Biases Aligned,"Taisei Katô, Yusuke Miyao","We examine the abilities of intrinsic bias metrics of static word embeddings to predict whether Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems exhibit biased behavior. A word embedding is one of the fundamental NLP technologies that represents the meanings of words through real vectors, and problematically, it also learns social biases such as stereotypes. An intrinsic bias metric measures bias by examining a characteristic of vectors, while an extrinsic bias metric checks whether an NLP system trained with a word embedding is biased. A previous study found that a common intrinsic bias metric usually does not correlate with extrinsic bias metrics. However, the intrinsic and extrinsic bias metrics did not measure the same bias in most cases, which makes us question whether the lack of correlation is genuine. In this paper, we extract characteristic words from datasets of extrinsic bias metrics and analyze correlations with intrinsic bias metrics with those words to ensure both metrics measure the same bias. We observed moderate to high correlations with some extrinsic bias metrics but little to no correlations with the others. This result suggests that intrinsic bias metrics can predict biased behavior in particular settings but not in others. Experiment codes are available at GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09260v1,2024-09
Unleash LLMs Potential for Recommendation by Coordinating Twin-Tower Dynamic Semantic Token Generator,"Jun Yin, Zhengxin Zeng, Mingzheng Li, Hao Yan, Chaozhuo Li, Weihao Han, Jianjin Zhang, Ruochen Liu, Allen Sun, Denvy Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang, Shirui Pan, Senzhang Wang","Owing to the unprecedented capability in semantic understanding and logical reasoning, the pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have shown fantastic potential in developing the next-generation recommender systems (RSs). However, the static index paradigm adopted by current methods greatly restricts the utilization of LLMs capacity for recommendation, leading to not only the insufficient alignment between semantic and collaborative knowledge, but also the neglect of high-order user-item interaction patterns. In this paper, we propose Twin-Tower Dynamic Semantic Recommender (TTDS), the first generative RS which adopts dynamic semantic index paradigm, targeting at resolving the above problems simultaneously. To be more specific, we for the first time contrive a dynamic knowledge fusion framework which integrates a twin-tower semantic token generator into the LLM-based recommender, hierarchically allocating meaningful semantic index for items and users, and accordingly predicting the semantic index of target item. Furthermore, a dual-modality variational auto-encoder is proposed to facilitate multi-grained alignment between semantic and collaborative knowledge. Eventually, a series of novel tuning tasks specially customized for capturing high-order user-item interaction patterns are proposed to take advantages of user historical behavior. Extensive experiments across three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methodology in developing LLM-based generative RSs. The proposed TTDS recommender achieves an average improvement of 19.41% in Hit-Rate and 20.84% in NDCG metric, compared with the leading baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09253v1,2024-09
NovAScore: A New Automated Metric for Evaluating Document Level Novelty,"Lin Ai, Ziwei Gong, Harshsaiprasad Deshpande, Alexander Johnson, Emmy Phung, Ahmad Emami, Julia Hirschberg","The rapid expansion of online content has intensified the issue of information redundancy, underscoring the need for solutions that can identify genuinely new information. Despite this challenge, the research community has seen a decline in focus on novelty detection, particularly with the rise of large language models (LLMs). Additionally, previous approaches have relied heavily on human annotation, which is time-consuming, costly, and particularly challenging when annotators must compare a target document against a vast number of historical documents. In this work, we introduce NovAScore (Novelty Evaluation in Atomicity Score), an automated metric for evaluating document-level novelty. NovAScore aggregates the novelty and salience scores of atomic information, providing high interpretability and a detailed analysis of a document's novelty. With its dynamic weight adjustment scheme, NovAScore offers enhanced flexibility and an additional dimension to assess both the novelty level and the importance of information within a document. Our experiments show that NovAScore strongly correlates with human judgments of novelty, achieving a 0.626 Point-Biserial correlation on the TAP-DLND 1.0 dataset and a 0.920 Pearson correlation on an internal human-annotated dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09249v2,2024-09
Robust Training of Neural Networks at Arbitrary Precision and Sparsity,"Chengxi Ye, Grace Chu, Yanfeng Liu, Yichi Zhang, Lukasz Lew, Andrew Howard","The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce obstacles to backpropagation. This is particularly challenging when training deep neural networks in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. We propose a novel, robust, and universal solution: a denoising affine transform that stabilizes training under these challenging conditions. By formulating quantization and sparsification as perturbations during training, we derive a perturbation-resilient approach based on ridge regression. Our solution employs a piecewise constant backbone model to ensure a performance lower bound and features an inherent noise reduction mechanism to mitigate perturbation-induced corruption. This formulation allows existing models to be trained at arbitrarily low precision and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes. Furthermore, our method provides a novel perspective on training temporal binary neural networks, contributing to ongoing efforts to narrow the gap between artificial and biological neural networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09245v1,2024-09
Autoregressive + Chain of Thought = Recurrent: Recurrence's Role in Language Models' Computability and a Revisit of Recurrent Transformer,"Xiang Zhang, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, Laks V. S. Lakshmanan","The Transformer architecture excels in a variety of language modeling tasks, outperforming traditional neural architectures such as RNN and LSTM. This is partially due to its elimination of recurrent connections, which allows for parallel training and a smoother flow of gradients. However, this move away from recurrent structures places the Transformer model at the lower end of Chomsky's computational hierarchy, imposing limitations on its computational abilities. Consequently, even advanced Transformer-based models face considerable difficulties in tasks like counting, string reversal, and multiplication. These tasks, though seemingly elementary, require a level of computational complexity that exceeds the capabilities of the Transformer architecture. Concurrently, the emergence of ``Chain of Thought"" (CoT) prompting has enabled Transformer-based language models to tackle tasks that were previously impossible or poorly executed. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the influence of recurrent structures in neural models on their reasoning abilities and computability, contrasting the role autoregression plays in the neural models' computational power. We then shed light on how the CoT approach can mimic recurrent computation and act as a bridge between autoregression and recurrence in the context of language models. It is this approximated recurrence that notably improves the model's performance and computational capacity. Moreover, we revisit recent recurrent-based Transformer model designs, focusing on their computational abilities through our proposed concept of ``recurrence-completeness"" and identify key theoretical limitations in models like Linear Transformer and RWKV. Through this, we aim to provide insight into the neural model architectures and prompt better model design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09239v3,2024-09
Multi-modal Speech Transformer Decoders: When Do Multiple Modalities Improve Accuracy?,"Yiwen Guan, Viet Anh Trinh, Vivek Voleti, Jacob Whitehill","Decoder-only discrete-token language models have recently achieved significant success in automatic speech recognition. However, systematic analyses of how different modalities impact performance in specific scenarios remain limited. In this paper, we investigate the effects of multiple modalities on recognition accuracy on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experiments suggest that: (1) Integrating more modalities can increase accuracy; in particular, our paper is, to our best knowledge, the first to show the benefit of combining audio, image context, and lip information; (2) Images as a supplementary modality for speech recognition provide the greatest benefit at moderate noise levels, moreover, they exhibit a different trend compared to inherently synchronized modalities like lip movements; (3) Performance improves on both synthetic and real-world datasets when the most relevant visual information is filtered as a preprocessing step.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09221v1,2024-09
ReCLAP: Improving Zero Shot Audio Classification by Describing Sounds,"Sreyan Ghosh, Sonal Kumar, Chandra Kiran Reddy Evuru, Oriol Nieto, Ramani Duraiswami, Dinesh Manocha","Open-vocabulary audio-language models, like CLAP, offer a promising approach for zero-shot audio classification (ZSAC) by enabling classification with any arbitrary set of categories specified with natural language prompts. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method to improve ZSAC with CLAP. Specifically, we shift from the conventional method of using prompts with abstract category labels (e.g., Sound of an organ) to prompts that describe sounds using their inherent descriptive features in a diverse context (e.g.,The organ's deep and resonant tones filled the cathedral.). To achieve this, we first propose ReCLAP, a CLAP model trained with rewritten audio captions for improved understanding of sounds in the wild. These rewritten captions describe each sound event in the original caption using their unique discriminative characteristics. ReCLAP outperforms all baselines on both multi-modal audio-text retrieval and ZSAC. Next, to improve zero-shot audio classification with ReCLAP, we propose prompt augmentation. In contrast to the traditional method of employing hand-written template prompts, we generate custom prompts for each unique label in the dataset. These custom prompts first describe the sound event in the label and then employ them in diverse scenes. Our proposed method improves ReCLAP's performance on ZSAC by 1%-18% and outperforms all baselines by 1% - 55%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09213v1,2024-09

Transformer with Controlled Attention for Synchronous Motion Captioning,"Karim Radouane, Sylvie Ranwez, Julien Lagarde, Andon Tchechmedjiev","In this paper, we address a challenging task, synchronous motion captioning, that aim to generate a language description synchronized with human motion sequences. This task pertains to numerous applications, such as aligned sign language transcription, unsupervised action segmentation and temporal grounding. Our method introduces mechanisms to control self- and cross-attention distributions of the Transformer, allowing interpretability and time-aligned text generation. We achieve this through masking strategies and structuring losses that push the model to maximize attention only on the most important frames contributing to the generation of a motion word. These constraints aim to prevent undesired mixing of information in attention maps and to provide a monotonic attention distribution across tokens. Thus, the cross attentions of tokens are used for progressive text generation in synchronization with human motion sequences. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach through evaluation on the two available benchmark datasets, KIT-ML and HumanML3D. As visual evaluation is essential for this task, we provide a comprehensive set of animated visual illustrations in the code repository: https://github.com/rd20karim/Synch-Transformer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09177v1,2024-09

DomURLs_BERT: Pre-trained BERT-based Model for Malicious Domains and URLs Detection and Classification,"Abdelkader El Mahdaouy, Salima Lamsiyah, Meryem Janati Idrissi, Hamza Alami, Zakaria Yartaoui, Ismail Berrada","Detecting and classifying suspicious or malicious domain names and URLs is fundamental task in cybersecurity. To leverage such indicators of compromise, cybersecurity vendors and practitioners often maintain and update blacklists of known malicious domains and URLs. However, blacklists frequently fail to identify emerging and obfuscated threats. Over the past few decades, there has been significant interest in developing machine learning models that automatically detect malicious domains and URLs, addressing the limitations of blacklists maintenance and updates. In this paper, we introduce DomURLs_BERT, a pre-trained BERT-based encoder adapted for detecting and classifying suspicious/malicious domains and URLs. DomURLs_BERT is pre-trained using the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective on a large multilingual corpus of URLs, domain names, and Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) dataset. In order to assess the performance of DomURLs_BERT, we have conducted experiments on several binary and multi-class classification tasks involving domain names and URLs, covering phishing, malware, DGA, and DNS tunneling. The evaluations results show that the proposed encoder outperforms state-of-the-art character-based deep learning models and cybersecurity-focused BERT models across multiple tasks and datasets.

Multimodal Fusion with LLMs for Engagement Prediction in Natural Conversation,"Cheng Charles Ma, Kevin Hyekang Joo, Alexandria K. Vail, Sunreeta Bhattacharya, Álvaro Fernández García, Kailana Baker-Matsuoka, Sheryl Mathew, Lori L. Holt, Fernando De la Torre","Over the past decade, wearable computing devices (``smart glasses'') have undergone remarkable advancements in sensor technology, design, and processing power, ushering in a new era of opportunity for high-density human behavior data. Equipped with wearable cameras, these glasses offer a unique opportunity to analyze non-verbal behavior in natural settings as individuals interact. Our focus lies in predicting engagement in dyadic interactions by scrutinizing verbal and non-verbal cues, aiming to detect signs of disinterest or confusion. Leveraging such analyses may revolutionize our understanding of human communication, foster more effective collaboration in professional environments, provide better mental health support through empathetic virtual interactions, and enhance accessibility for those with communication barriers.   In this work, we collect a dataset featuring 34 participants engaged in casual dyadic conversations, each providing self-reported engagement ratings at the end of each conversation. We introduce a novel fusion strategy using Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate multiple behavior modalities into a ``multimodal transcript'' that can be processed by an LLM for behavioral reasoning tasks. Remarkably, this method achieves performance comparable to established fusion techniques even in its preliminary implementation, indicating strong potential for further research and optimization. This fusion method is one of the first to approach ``reasoning'' about real-world human behavior through a language model. Smart glasses provide us the ability to unobtrusively gather high-density multimodal data on human behavior, paving the way for new approaches to understanding and improving human communication with the potential for important societal benefits.

Eureka: Evaluating and Understanding Large Foundation Models,"Vidhisha Balachandran, Jingya Chen, Neel Joshi, Besmira Nushi, Hamid Palangi, Eduardo Salinas, Vibhav Vineet, James Woffinden-Luey, Safoora Yousefi","Rigorous and reproducible evaluation is critical for assessing the state of the art and for guiding scientific advances in Artificial Intelligence. Evaluation is challenging in practice due to several reasons, including benchmark saturation, lack of transparency in methods used for measurement, development challenges in extracting measurements for generative tasks, and, more generally, the extensive number of capabilities required for a well-rounded comparison across models. We make three contributions to alleviate the above challenges. First, we present Eureka, an open-source framework for standardizing evaluations of large foundation models beyond single-score reporting and rankings. Second, we introduce Eureka-Bench as an extensible collection of benchmarks testing capabilities that (i) are still challenging for state-of-the-art models and (ii) represent fundamental but overlooked language and multimodal capabilities. The inherent space for improvement in non-saturated benchmarks enables us to discover meaningful differences between models at a capability level. Third, using Eureka, we conduct an analysis of 12 state-of-the-art models, providing in-depth insights into failure understanding and model comparison, which can be leveraged to plan targeted improvements. In contrast to recent trends in reports and leaderboards showing absolute rankings and claims for one model or another to be the best, our analysis shows that there is no such best model. Different models have different strengths, but there are models that appear more often than others as best performers for some capabilities. Despite the recent improvements, current models still struggle with several fundamental capabilities including detailed image understanding, benefiting from multimodal input when available rather than fully relying on language, factuality and grounding for information retrieval, and over refusals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10566v1,2024-09
"Agents in Software Engineering: Survey, Landscape, and Vision","Yanlin Wang, Wanjun Zhong, Yanxian Huang, Ensheng Shi, Min Yang, Jiachi Chen, Hui Li, Yuchi Ma, Qianxiang Wang, Zibin Zheng","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and have been widely used in various downstream tasks, especially in the tasks of the software engineering (SE) field.

AI-LieDar: Examine the Trade-off Between Utility and Truthfulness in LLM Agents,"Zhe Su, Xuhui Zhou, Sanketh Rangreji, Anubha Kabra, Julia Mendelsohn, Faeze Brahman, Maarten Sap","To be safely and successfully deployed, LLMs must simultaneously satisfy truthfulness and utility goals. Yet, often these two goals compete (e.g., an AI agent assisting a used car salesman selling a car with flaws), partly due to ambiguous or misleading user instructions. We propose AI-LieDar, a framework to study how LLM-based agents navigate scenarios with utility-truthfulness conflicts in a multi-turn interactive setting. We design a set of realistic scenarios where language agents are instructed to achieve goals that are in conflict with being truthful during a multi-turn conversation with simulated human agents. To evaluate the truthfulness at large scale, we develop a truthfulness detector inspired by psychological literature to assess the agents' responses. Our experiment demonstrates that all models are truthful less than 50% of the time, although truthfulness and goal achievement (utility) rates vary across models. We further test the steerability of LLMs towards truthfulness, finding that models follow malicious instructions to deceive, and even truth-steered models can still lie. These findings reveal the complex nature of truthfulness in LLMs and underscore the importance of further research to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of LLMs and AI agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09013v1,2024-09
Optimizing Rare Word Accuracy in Direct Speech Translation with a Retrieval-and-Demonstration Approach,"Siqi Li, Danni Liu, Jan Niehues","Direct speech translation (ST) models often struggle with rare words. Incorrect translation of these words can have severe consequences, impacting translation quality and user trust. While rare word translation is inherently challenging for neural models due to sparse learning signals, real-world scenarios often allow access to translations of past recordings on similar topics. To leverage these valuable resources, we propose a retrieval-and-demonstration approach to enhance rare word translation accuracy in direct ST models. First, we adapt existing ST models to incorporate retrieved examples for rare word translation, which allows the model to benefit from prepended examples, similar to in-context learning. We then develop a cross-modal (speech-to-speech, speech-to-text, text-to-text) retriever to locate suitable examples. We demonstrate that standard ST models can be effectively adapted to leverage examples for rare word translation, improving rare word translation accuracy over the baseline by 17.6% with gold examples and 8.5% with retrieved examples. Moreover, our speech-to-speech retrieval approach outperforms other modalities and exhibits higher robustness to unseen speakers.

Pronoun Logic,"Rose Bohrer, Ashe Neth","Particularly in transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) communities, it is an increasingly common practice to publicly share one's personal pronouns so that we may be gendered correctly in others' speech. Many of us have nuanced desires for how we are gendered, leading us to use more complex descriptions of our wishes; for example, the descriptor 'she/they'. We observe that these descriptions of our wishes have the structure of a little language all their own. We thus propose formal logic as a tool for expressing one's personal pronouns and potentially other aspects of gender. We explore three potential logical foundations (linear logic, temporal logic, and free logic with definite descriptions) and their trade-offs. Our foremost motivation for this proposal is play, affirming that one can be both a logician and TGNB at the same time. We present formalization as something that can continue to evolve over time with society's understanding of gender. This implies that outreach is a major potential application: we can show TGNB youth that they belong in logic and have a unique contribution to make. Tools for evaluating whether one's pronouns are respected are an application as well.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18978v1,2024-09

KodeXv0.1: A Family of State-of-the-Art Financial Large Language Models,"Neel Rajani, Lilli Kiessling, Aleksandr Ogaltsov, Claus Lang","Although powerful, current cutting-edge LLMs may not fulfil the needs of highly specialised sectors. We introduce KodeXv0.1, a family of large language models that outclass GPT-4 in financial question answering. We utilise the base variants of Llama 3.1 8B and 70B and adapt them to the financial domain through a custom training regime. To this end, we collect and process a large number of publicly available financial documents such as earnings calls and business reports. These are used to generate a high-quality, synthetic dataset consisting of Context-Question-Answer triplets which closely mirror real-world financial tasks. Using the train split of this dataset, we perform RAG-aware 4bit LoRA instruction tuning runs of Llama 3.1 base variants to produce KodeX-8Bv0.1 and KodeX-70Bv0.1. We then complete extensive model evaluations using FinanceBench, FinQABench and the withheld test split of our dataset. Our results show that KodeX-8Bv0.1 is more reliable in financial contexts than cutting-edge instruct models in the same parameter regime, surpassing them by up to 9.24%. In addition, it is even capable of outperforming state-of-the-art proprietary models such as GPT-4 by up to 7.07%.

Safeguarding Decentralized Social Media: LLM Agents for Automating Community Rule Compliance,"Lucio La Cava, Andrea Tagarelli","Ensuring content compliance with community guidelines is crucial for maintaining healthy online social environments. However, traditional human-based compliance checking struggles with scaling due to the increasing volume of user-generated content and a limited number of moderators. Recent advancements in Natural Language Understanding demonstrated by Large Language Models unlock new opportunities for automated content compliance verification. This work evaluates six AI-agents built on Open-LLMs for automated rule compliance checking in Decentralized Social Networks, a challenging environment due to heterogeneous community scopes and rules. Analyzing over 50,000 posts from hundreds of Mastodon servers, we find that AI-agents effectively detect non-compliant content, grasp linguistic subtleties, and adapt to diverse community contexts. Most agents also show high inter-rater reliability and consistency in score justification and suggestions for compliance. Human-based evaluation with domain experts confirmed the agents' reliability and usefulness, rendering them promising tools for semi-automated or human-in-the-loop content moderation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08963v1,2024-09

We then prompt a large language model (GPT-4o) to generate a clinical note related to this patient encounter, describing the patient symptoms and additional context. The SynSUM dataset is primarily designed to facilitate research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text - the symptoms, in the case of SynSUM. Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation.

We even observe an incursion of these models into disciplines related to human psychology, such as the Affective Computing domain, suggesting their affective, emerging capabilities. In this work, we aim to raise awareness of the power of Foundation Models in the field of Affective Computing by synthetically generating and analysing multimodal affective data, focusing on vision, linguistics, and speech (acoustics).

Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction: A Robust Benchmark,"Xuchen Li, Shiyu Hu, Xiaokun Feng, Dailing Zhang, Meiqi Wu, Jing Zhang, Kaiqi Huang","Visual Language Tracking (VLT) enhances tracking by mitigating the limitations of relying solely on the visual modality, utilizing high-level semantic information through language. This integration of the language enables more advanced human-machine interaction. The essence of interaction is cognitive alignment, which typically requires multiple information exchanges, especially in the sequential decision-making process of VLT. However, current VLT benchmarks do not account for multi-round interactions during tracking. They provide only an initial text and bounding box (bbox) in the first frame, with no further interaction as tracking progresses, deviating from the original motivation of the VLT task. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and robust benchmark, VLT-MI (Visual Language Tracking with Multi-modal Interaction), which introduces multi-round interaction into the VLT task for the first time. (1) We generate diverse, multi-granularity texts for multi-round, multi-modal interaction based on existing mainstream VLT benchmarks using DTLLM-VLT, leveraging the world knowledge of LLMs. (2) We propose a new VLT interaction paradigm that achieves multi-round interaction through text updates and object recovery. When multiple tracking failures occur, we provide the tracker with more aligned texts and corrected bboxes through interaction, thereby expanding the scope of VLT downstream tasks. (3) We conduct comparative experiments on both traditional VLT benchmarks and VLT-MI, evaluating and analyzing the accuracy and robustness of trackers under the interactive paradigm. This work offers new insights and paradigms for the VLT task, enabling a fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal trackers. We believe this approach can be extended to additional datasets in the future, supporting broader evaluations and comparisons of video-language model capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08887v1,2024-09
Exploring the Impact of Data Quantity on ASR in Extremely Low-resource Languages,"Yao-Fei Cheng, Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Hsin-Min Wang","This study investigates the efficacy of data augmentation techniques for low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on two endangered Austronesian languages, Amis and Seediq. Recognizing the potential of self-supervised learning (SSL) in low-resource settings, we explore the impact of data volume on the continued pre-training of SSL models. We propose a novel data-selection scheme leveraging a multilingual corpus to augment the limited target language data. This scheme utilizes a language classifier to extract utterance embeddings and employs one-class classifiers to identify utterances phonetically and phonologically proximate to the target languages. Utterances are ranked and selected based on their decision scores, ensuring the inclusion of highly relevant data in the SSL-ASR pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, yielding substantial improvements in ASR performance for both Amis and Seediq. These findings underscore the feasibility and promise of data augmentation through cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource language ASR.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08872v1,2024-09
FP-VEC: Fingerprinting Large Language Models via Efficient Vector Addition,"Zhenhua Xu, Wenpeng Xing, Zhebo Wang, Chang Hu, Chen Jie, Meng Han","Training Large Language Models (LLMs) requires immense computational power and vast amounts of data. As a result, protecting the intellectual property of these models through fingerprinting is essential for ownership authentication. While adding fingerprints to LLMs through fine-tuning has been attempted, it remains costly and unscalable. In this paper, we introduce FP-VEC, a pilot study on using fingerprint vectors as an efficient fingerprinting method for LLMs. Our approach generates a fingerprint vector that represents a confidential signature embedded in the model, allowing the same fingerprint to be seamlessly incorporated into an unlimited number of LLMs via vector addition. Results on several LLMs show that FP-VEC is lightweight by running on CPU-only devices for fingerprinting, scalable with a single training and unlimited fingerprinting process, and preserves the model's normal behavior.

AIPO: Improving Training Objective for Iterative Preference Optimization,"Yaojie Shen, Xinyao Wang, Yulei Niu, Ying Zhou, Lexin Tang, Libo Zhang, Fan Chen, Longyin Wen","Preference Optimization (PO), is gaining popularity as an alternative choice of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research on aligning LLMs iteratively with synthetic or partially synthetic data shows promising results in scaling up PO training for both academic settings and proprietary trained models such as Llama3. Despite its success, our study shows that the length exploitation issue present in PO is even more severe in Iterative Preference Optimization (IPO) due to the iterative nature of the process. In this work, we study iterative preference optimization with synthetic data. We share the findings and analysis along the way of building the iterative preference optimization pipeline. More specifically, we discuss the length exploitation issue during iterative preference optimization and propose our training objective for iterative preference optimization, namely Agreement-aware Iterative Preference Optimization (AIPO). To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MT-Bench, AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard.

Your Weak LLM is Secretly a Strong Teacher for Alignment,"Leitian Tao, Yixuan Li","The burgeoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have underscored the need for alignment to ensure these models act in accordance with human values and intentions. Existing alignment frameworks present constraints either in the form of expensive human effort or high computational costs. This paper explores a promising middle ground, where we employ a weak LLM that is significantly less resource-intensive than top-tier models, yet offers more automation than purely human feedback. We present a systematic study to evaluate and understand weak LLM's ability to generate feedback for alignment. Our empirical findings demonstrate that weak LLMs can provide feedback that rivals or even exceeds that of fully human-annotated data. Our study indicates a minimized impact of model size on feedback efficacy, shedding light on a scalable and sustainable alignment strategy. To deepen our understanding of alignment under weak LLM feedback, we conduct a series of qualitative and quantitative analyses, offering novel insights into the quality discrepancies between human feedback vs. weak LLM feedback.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08813v1,2024-09
Exploring SSL Discrete Tokens for Multilingual ASR,"Mingyu Cui, Daxin Tan, Yifan Yang, Dingdong Wang, Huimeng Wang, Xiao Chen, Xie Chen, Xunying Liu","With the advancement of Self-supervised Learning (SSL) in speech-related tasks, there has been growing interest in utilizing discrete tokens generated by SSL for automatic speech recognition (ASR), as they offer faster processing techniques. However, previous studies primarily focused on multilingual ASR with Fbank features or English ASR with discrete tokens, leaving a gap in adapting discrete tokens for multilingual ASR scenarios. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of discrete tokens generated by various leading SSL models across multiple language domains. We aim to explore the performance and efficiency of speech discrete tokens across multiple language domains for both monolingual and multilingual ASR scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that discrete tokens achieve comparable results against systems trained on Fbank features in ASR tasks across seven language domains with an average word error rate (WER) reduction of 0.31% and 1.76% absolute (2.80% and 15.70% relative) on dev and test sets respectively, with particularly WER reduction of 6.82% absolute (41.48% relative) on the Polish test set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08805v1,2024-09

In this paper, SSL discrete speech features extracted from WavLM models are used as additional cross-utterance acoustic context features in Zipformer-Transducer ASR systems. The efficacy of replacing Fbank features with discrete token features for modelling either cross-utterance contexts (from preceding and future segments), or current utterance's internal contexts alone, or both at the same time, are demonstrated thoroughly on the Gigaspeech 1000-hr corpus. The best Zipformer-Transducer system using discrete tokens based cross-utterance context features outperforms the baseline using utterance internal context only with statistically significant word error rate (WER) reductions of 0.32% to 0.41% absolute (2.78% to 3.54% relative) on the dev and test data.

Optimizing Ingredient Substitution Using Large Language Models to Enhance Phytochemical Content in Recipes,"Luis Rita, Josh Southern, Ivan Laponogov, Kyle Higgins, Kirill Veselkov","In the emerging field of computational gastronomy, aligning culinary practices with scientifically supported nutritional goals is increasingly important. This study explores how large language models (LLMs) can be applied to optimize ingredient substitutions in recipes, specifically to enhance the phytochemical content of meals. Phytochemicals are bioactive compounds found in plants, which, based on preclinical studies, may offer potential health benefits. We fine-tuned models, including OpenAI's GPT-3.5, DaVinci, and Meta's TinyLlama, using an ingredient substitution dataset. These models were used to predict substitutions that enhance phytochemical content and create a corresponding enriched recipe dataset. Our approach improved Hit@1 accuracy on ingredient substitution tasks, from the baseline 34.53 plus-minus 0.10% to 38.03 plus-minus 0.28% on the original GISMo dataset, and from 40.24 plus-minus 0.36% to 54.46 plus-minus 0.29% on a refined version of the same dataset. These substitutions led to the creation of 1,951 phytochemically enriched ingredient pairings and 1,639 unique recipes. While this approach demonstrates potential in optimizing ingredient substitutions, caution must be taken when drawing conclusions about health benefits, as the claims are based on preclinical evidence. Future work should include clinical validation and broader datasets to further evaluate the nutritional impact of these substitutions. This research represents a step forward in using AI to promote healthier eating practices, providing potential pathways for integrating computational methods with nutritional science.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08792v1,2024-09
Sign Language Sense Disambiguation,"Jana Grimm, Miriam Winkler, Oliver Kraus, Tanalp Agustoslu","This project explores methods to enhance sign language translation of German sign language, specifically focusing on disambiguation of homonyms.

To determine the impact of, e.g., the hand or mouth representations, we experiment with different combinations. The results show that focusing on the mouth increases the performance in small dataset settings while shifting the focus on the hands retrieves better results in larger dataset settings. Our results contribute to better accessibility for non-hearing persons by improving the systems powering digital assistants, enabling a more accurate interaction.

Distilling Monolingual and Crosslingual Word-in-Context Representations,"Yuki Arase, Tomoyuki Kajiwara","In this study, we propose a method that distils representations of word meaning in context from a pre-trained masked language model in both monolingual and crosslingual settings. Word representations are the basis for context-aware lexical semantics and unsupervised semantic textual similarity (STS) estimation. Different from existing approaches, our method does not require human-annotated corpora nor updates of the parameters of the pre-trained model. The latter feature is appealing for practical scenarios where the off-the-shelf pre-trained model is a common asset among different applications. Specifically, our method learns to combine the outputs of different hidden layers of the pre-trained model using self-attention. Our auto-encoder based training only requires an automatically generated corpus. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we performed extensive experiments using various benchmark tasks. The results on the monolingual tasks confirmed that our representations exhibited a competitive performance compared to that of the previous study for the context-aware lexical semantic tasks and outperformed it for STS estimation. The results of the crosslingual tasks revealed that the proposed method largely improved crosslingual word representations of multilingual pre-trained models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08719v1,2024-09
Layerwise Change of Knowledge in Neural Networks,"Xu Cheng, Lei Cheng, Zhaoran Peng, Yang Xu, Tian Han, Quanshi Zhang","This paper aims to explain how a deep neural network (DNN) gradually extracts new knowledge and forgets noisy features through layers in forward propagation. Up to now, although the definition of knowledge encoded by the DNN has not reached a consensus, Previous studies have derived a series of mathematical evidence to take interactions as symbolic primitive inference patterns encoded by a DNN. We extend the definition of interactions and, for the first time, extract interactions encoded by intermediate layers. We quantify and track the newly emerged interactions and the forgotten interactions in each layer during the forward propagation, which shed new light on the learning behavior of DNNs. The layer-wise change of interactions also reveals the change of the generalization capacity and instability of feature representations of a DNN.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08712v1,2024-09
L3Cube-IndicQuest: A Benchmark Question Answering Dataset for Evaluating Knowledge of LLMs in Indic Context,"Pritika Rohera, Chaitrali Ginimav, Akanksha Salunke, Gayatri Sawant, Raviraj Joshi","Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in incorporating Indic languages within multilingual models. However, it is crucial to quantitatively assess whether these languages perform comparably to globally dominant ones, such as English.

In this paper, we present the L3Cube-IndicQuest, a gold-standard factual question-answering benchmark dataset designed to evaluate how well multilingual LLMs capture regional knowledge across various Indic languages. The dataset contains 200 question-answer pairs, each for English and 19 Indic languages, covering five domains specific to the Indic region.

B4: Towards Optimal Assessment of Plausible Code Solutions with Plausible Tests,"Mouxiang Chen, Zhongxin Liu, He Tao, Yusu Hong, David Lo, Xin Xia, Jianling Sun","Selecting the best code solution from multiple generated ones is an essential task in code generation, which can be achieved by using some reliable validators (e.g., developer-written test cases) for assistance. Since reliable test cases are not always available and can be expensive to build in practice, researchers propose to automatically generate test cases to assess code solutions. However, when both code solutions and test cases are plausible and not reliable, selecting the best solution becomes challenging. Although some heuristic strategies have been proposed to tackle this problem, they lack a strong theoretical guarantee and it is still an open question whether an optimal selection strategy exists. Our work contributes in two ways. First, we show that within a Bayesian framework, the optimal selection strategy can be defined based on the posterior probability of the observed passing states between solutions and tests. The problem of identifying the best solution is then framed as an integer programming problem. Second, we propose an efficient approach for approximating this optimal (yet uncomputable) strategy, where the approximation error is bounded by the correctness of prior knowledge. We then incorporate effective prior knowledge to tailor code generation tasks. Both theoretical and empirical studies confirm that existing heuristics are limited in selecting the best solutions with plausible test cases. Our proposed approximated optimal strategy B4 significantly surpasses existing heuristics in selecting code solutions generated by large language models (LLMs) with LLM-generated tests, achieving a relative performance improvement by up to 50% over the strongest heuristic and 246% over the random selection in the most challenging scenarios.

NEST-RQ: Next Token Prediction for Speech Self-Supervised Pre-Training,"Minglun Han, Ye Bai, Chen Shen, Youjia Huang, Mingkun Huang, Zehua Lin, Linhao Dong, Lu Lu, Yuxuan Wang","Speech self-supervised pre-training can effectively improve the performance of downstream tasks. However, previous self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for speech, such as HuBERT and BEST-RQ, focus on utilizing non-causal encoders with bidirectional context, and lack sufficient support for downstream streaming models. To address this issue, we introduce the next token prediction based speech pre-training method with random-projection quantizer (NEST-RQ). NEST-RQ employs causal encoders with only left context and uses next token prediction (NTP) as the training task. On the large-scale dataset, compared to BEST-RQ, the proposed NEST-RQ achieves comparable performance on non-streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR) and better performance on streaming ASR. We also conduct analytical experiments in terms of the future context size of streaming ASR, the codebook quality of SSL and the model size of the encoder. In summary, the paper demonstrates the feasibility of the NTP in speech SSL and provides empirical evidence and insights for speech SSL research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08680v1,2024-09
Investigating Disentanglement in a Phoneme-level Speech Codec for Prosody Modeling,"Sotirios Karapiperis, Nikolaos Ellinas, Alexandra Vioni, Junkwang Oh, Gunu Jho, Inchul Hwang, Spyros Raptis","Most of the prevalent approaches in speech prosody modeling rely on learning global style representations in a continuous latent space which encode and transfer the attributes of reference speech. However, recent work on neural codecs which are based on Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) already shows great potential offering distinct advantages. We investigate the prosody modeling capabilities of the discrete space of such an RVQ-VAE model, modifying it to operate on the phoneme-level. We condition both the encoder and decoder of the model on linguistic representations and apply a global speaker embedding in order to factor out both phonetic and speaker information. We conduct an extensive set of investigations based on subjective experiments and objective measures to show that the phoneme-level discrete latent representations obtained this way achieves a high degree of disentanglement, capturing fine-grained prosodic information that is robust and transferable. The latent space turns out to have interpretable structure with its principal components corresponding to pitch and energy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08664v1,2024-09

Expediting and Elevating Large Language Model Reasoning via Hidden Chain-of-Thought Decoding,"Tianqiao Liu, Zui Chen, Zitao Liu, Mi Tian, Weiqi Luo","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks requiring reasoning and multi-step problem-solving through the use of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. However, generating the full CoT process results in significantly longer output sequences, leading to increased computational costs and latency during inference. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to compress the CoT process through semantic alignment, enabling more efficient decoding while preserving the benefits of CoT reasoning. Our method introduces an auxiliary CoT model that learns to generate and compress the full thought process into a compact special token representation semantically aligned with the original CoT output. This compressed representation is then integrated into the input of the Hidden Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) model. The training process follows a two-stage procedure: First, the CoT model is optimized to generate the compressed token representations aligned with the ground-truth CoT outputs using a contrastive loss. Subsequently, with the CoT model parameters frozen, the HCoT model is fine-tuned to generate accurate subsequent predictions conditioned on the prefix instruction and the compressed CoT representations from the CoT model. Extensive experiments across three challenging domains - mathematical reasoning, agent invocation, and question answering - demonstrate that our semantic compression approach achieves competitive or improved performance compared to the full CoT baseline, while providing significant speedups of at least 1.5x in decoding time. Moreover, incorporating contrastive learning objectives further enhances the quality of the compressed representations, leading to better CoT prompting and improved task accuracy. Our work paves the way for more efficient exploitation of multi-step reasoning capabilities in LLMs across a wide range of applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08561v1,2024-09

In this paper, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in G2P conversion and introduce prompting and post-processing methods that enhance LLM outputs without additional training or labeled data. We also present a benchmarking dataset designed to assess G2P performance on sentence-level phonetic challenges of the Persian language.

MAPX: An explainable model-agnostic framework for the detection of false information on social media networks,"Sarah Condran, Michael Bewong, Selasi Kwashie, Md Zahidul Islam, Irfan Altas, Joshua Condran","The automated detection of false information has become a fundamental task in combating the spread of ""fake news"" on online social media networks (OSMN) as it reduces the need for manual discernment by individuals. In the literature, leveraging various content or context features of OSMN documents have been found useful. However, most of the existing detection models often utilise these features in isolation without regard to the temporal and dynamic changes oft-seen in reality, thus, limiting the robustness of the models. Furthermore, there has been little to no consideration of the impact of the quality of documents' features on the trustworthiness of the final prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-agnostic framework, called MAPX, which allows evidence based aggregation of predictions from existing models in an explainable manner. Indeed, the developed aggregation method is adaptive, dynamic and considers the quality of OSMN document features. Further, we perform extensive experiments on benchmarked fake news datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of MAPX using various real-world data quality scenarios. Our empirical results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art models evaluated.

A BERT-Based Summarization approach for depression detection,"Hossein Salahshoor Gavalan, Mohmmad Naim Rastgoo, Bahareh Nakisa","Depression is a globally prevalent mental disorder with potentially severe repercussions if not addressed, especially in individuals with recurrent episodes. Prior research has shown that early intervention has the potential to mitigate or alleviate symptoms of depression. However, implementing such interventions in a real-world setting may pose considerable challenges. A promising strategy involves leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to autonomously detect depression indicators from diverse data sources. One of the most widely available and informative data sources is text, which can reveal a person's mood, thoughts, and feelings. In this context, virtual agents programmed to conduct interviews using clinically validated questionnaires, such as those found in the DAIC-WOZ dataset, offer a robust means for depression detection through linguistic analysis. Utilizing BERT-based models, which are powerful and versatile yet use fewer resources than contemporary large language models, to convert text into numerical representations significantly enhances the precision of depression diagnosis. These models adeptly capture complex semantic and syntactic nuances, improving the detection accuracy of depressive symptoms. Given the inherent limitations of these models concerning text length, our study proposes text summarization as a preprocessing technique to diminish the length and intricacies of input texts. Implementing this method within our uniquely developed framework for feature extraction and classification yielded an F1-score of 0.67 on the test set surpassing all prior benchmarks and 0.81 on the validation set exceeding most previous results on the DAIC-WOZ dataset.

Explaining Datasets in Words: Statistical Models with Natural Language Parameters,"Ruiqi Zhong, Heng Wang, Dan Klein, Jacob Steinhardt","To make sense of massive data, we often fit simplified models and then interpret the parameters; for example, we cluster the text embeddings and then interpret the mean parameters of each cluster. However, these parameters are often high-dimensional and hard to interpret. To make model parameters directly interpretable, we introduce a family of statistical models -- including clustering, time series, and classification models -- parameterized by natural language predicates. For example, a cluster of text about COVID could be parameterized by the predicate ""discusses COVID"". To learn these statistical models effectively, we develop a model-agnostic algorithm that optimizes continuous relaxations of predicate parameters with gradient descent and discretizes them by prompting language models (LMs). Finally, we apply our framework to a wide range of problems: taxonomizing user chat dialogues, characterizing how they evolve across time, finding categories where one language model is better than the other, clustering math problems based on subareas, and explaining visual features in memorable images. Our framework is highly versatile, applicable to both textual and visual domains, can be easily steered to focus on specific properties (e.g. subareas), and explains sophisticated concepts that classical methods (e.g. n-gram analysis) struggle to produce.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08466v1,2024-09
When Context Leads but Parametric Memory Follows in Large Language Models,"Yufei Tao, Adam Hiatt, Erik Haake, Antonie J. Jetter, Ameeta Agrawal","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in leveraging diverse knowledge sources. This study investigates how nine widely used LLMs allocate knowledge between local context and global parameters when answering open-ended questions in knowledge-consistent scenarios. We introduce a novel dataset, WikiAtomic, and systematically vary context sizes to analyze how LLMs prioritize and utilize the provided information and their parametric knowledge in knowledge-consistent scenarios. Additionally, we also study their tendency to hallucinate under varying context sizes. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across models, including a consistent reliance on both contextual (around 70%) and parametric (around 30%) knowledge, and a decrease in hallucinations with increasing context. These insights highlight the importance of more effective context organization and developing models that use input more deterministically for robust performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08435v4,2024-09
Retro-li: Small-Scale Retrieval Augmented Generation Supporting Noisy Similarity Searches and Domain Shift Generalization,"Gentiana Rashiti, Geethan Karunaratne, Mrinmaya Sachan, Abu Sebastian, Abbas Rahimi","The retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system such as Retro has been shown to improve language modeling capabilities and reduce toxicity and hallucinations by retrieving from a database of non-parametric memory containing trillions of entries. We introduce Retro-li that shows retrieval can also help using a small-scale database, but it demands more accurate and better neighbors when searching in a smaller hence sparser non-parametric memory. This can be met by using a proper semantic similarity search. We further propose adding a regularization to the non-parametric memory for the first time: it significantly reduces perplexity when the neighbor search operations are noisy during inference, and it improves generalization when a domain shift occurs. We also show that Retro-li's non-parametric memory can potentially be implemented on analog in-memory computing hardware, exhibiting O(1) search time while causing noise in retrieving neighbors, with minimal (<1%) performance loss. Our code is available at: https://github.com/IBM/Retrieval-Enhanced-Transformer-Little.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00004v1,2024-09
Knowledge Tagging with Large Language Model based Multi-Agent System,"Hang Li, Tianlong Xu, Ethan Chang, Qingsong Wen","Knowledge tagging for questions is vital in modern intelligent educational applications, including learning progress diagnosis, practice question recommendations, and course content organization. Traditionally, these annotations have been performed by pedagogical experts, as the task demands not only a deep semantic understanding of question stems and knowledge definitions but also a strong ability to link problem-solving logic with relevant knowledge concepts. With the advent of advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, such as pre-trained language models and large language models (LLMs), pioneering studies have explored automating the knowledge tagging process using various machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the use of a multi-agent system to address the limitations of previous algorithms, particularly in handling complex cases involving intricate knowledge definitions and strict numerical constraints. By demonstrating its superior performance on the publicly available math question knowledge tagging dataset, MathKnowCT, we highlight the significant potential of an LLM-based multi-agent system in overcoming the challenges that previous methods have encountered. Finally, through an in-depth discussion of the implications of automating knowledge tagging, we underscore the promising results of deploying LLM-based algorithms in educational contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08406v2,2024-09
Self-Supervised Inference of Agents in Trustless Environments,"Vladyslav Larin, Ivan Nikitin, Alexander Firsov","In this paper, we propose a novel approach where agents can form swarms to produce high-quality responses effectively. This is accomplished by utilizing agents capable of data inference and ranking, which can be effectively implemented using LLMs as response classifiers. We assess existing approaches for trustless agent inference, define our methodology, estimate practical parameters, and model various types of malicious agent attacks. Our method leverages the collective intelligence of swarms, ensuring robust and efficient decentralized AI inference with better accuracy, security, and reliability. We show that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than other trustless inference strategies reaching less than 125 ms validation latency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08386v1,2024-09
Rethinking Prompting Strategies for Multi-Label Recognition with Partial Annotations,"Samyak Rawlekar, Shubhang Bhatnagar, Narendra Ahuja","Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have been adapted for Multi-Label Recognition (MLR) with partial annotations by leveraging prompt-learning, where positive and negative prompts are learned for each class to associate their embeddings with class presence or absence in the shared vision-text feature space. While this approach improves MLR performance by relying on VLM priors, we hypothesize that learning negative prompts may be suboptimal, as the datasets used to train VLMs lack image-caption pairs explicitly focusing on class absence. To analyze the impact of positive and negative prompt learning on MLR, we introduce PositiveCoOp and NegativeCoOp, where only one prompt is learned with VLM guidance while the other is replaced by an embedding vector learned directly in the shared feature space without relying on the text encoder. Through empirical analysis, we observe that negative prompts degrade MLR performance, and learning only positive prompts, combined with learned negative embeddings (PositiveCoOp), outperforms dual prompt learning approaches. Moreover, we quantify the performance benefits that prompt-learning offers over a simple vision-features-only baseline, observing that the baseline displays strong performance comparable to dual prompt learning approach (DualCoOp), when the proportion of missing labels is low, while requiring half the training compute and 16 times fewer parameters",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08381v1,2024-09
Towards Quantifying and Reducing Language Mismatch Effects in Cross-Lingual Speech Anti-Spoofing,"Tianchi Liu, Ivan Kukanov, Zihan Pan, Qiongqiong Wang, Hardik B. Sailor, Kong Aik Lee","The effects of language mismatch impact speech anti-spoofing systems, while investigations and quantification of these effects remain limited. Existing anti-spoofing datasets are mainly in English, and the high cost of acquiring multilingual datasets hinders training language-independent models. We initiate this work by evaluating top-performing speech anti-spoofing systems that are trained on English data but tested on other languages, observing notable performance declines. We propose an innovative approach - Accent-based data expansion via TTS (ACCENT), which introduces diverse linguistic knowledge to monolingual-trained models, improving their cross-lingual capabilities. We conduct experiments on a large-scale dataset consisting of over 3 million samples, including 1.8 million training samples and nearly 1.2 million testing samples across 12 languages. The language mismatch effects are preliminarily quantified and remarkably reduced over 15% by applying the proposed ACCENT. This easily implementable method shows promise for multilingual and low-resource language scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08346v1,2024-09
Real or Robotic? Assessing Whether LLMs Accurately Simulate Qualities of Human Responses in Dialogue,"Jonathan Ivey, Shivani Kumar, Jiayu Liu, Hua Shen, Sushrita Rakshit, Rohan Raju, Haotian Zhang, Aparna Ananthasubramaniam, Junghwan Kim, Bowen Yi, Dustin Wright, Abraham Israeli, Anders Giovanni Møller, Lechen Zhang, David Jurgens","Studying and building datasets for dialogue tasks is both expensive and time-consuming due to the need to recruit, train, and collect data from study participants. In response, much recent work has sought to use large language models (LLMs) to simulate both human-human and human-LLM interactions, as they have been shown to generate convincingly human-like text in many settings. However, to what extent do LLM-based simulations \textit{actually} reflect human dialogues? In this work, we answer this question by generating a large-scale dataset of 100,000 paired LLM-LLM and human-LLM dialogues from the WildChat dataset and quantifying how well the LLM simulations align with their human counterparts. Overall, we find relatively low alignment between simulations and human interactions, demonstrating a systematic divergence along the multiple textual properties, including style and content. Further, in comparisons of English, Chinese, and Russian dialogues, we find that models perform similarly. Our results suggest that LLMs generally perform better when the human themself writes in a way that is more similar to the LLM's own style.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08330v2,2024-09
The Design of Informative Take-Over Requests for Semi-Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems: Combining Spoken Language and Visual Icons in a Drone-Controller Setting,"Ashwini Gundappa, Emilia Ellsiepen, Lukas Schmitz, Frederik Wiehr, Vera Demberg","The question of how cyber-physical systems should interact with human partners that can take over control or exert oversight is becoming more pressing, as these systems are deployed for an ever larger range of tasks. Drawing on the literatures on handing over control during semi-autonomous driving and human-robot interaction, we propose a design of a take-over request that combines an abstract pre-alert with an informative TOR: Relevant sensor information is highlighted on the controller's display, while a spoken message verbalizes the reason for the TOR. We conduct our study in the context of a semi-autonomous drone control scenario as our testbed. The goal of our online study is to assess in more detail what form a language-based TOR should take. Specifically, we compare a full sentence condition to shorter fragments, and test whether the visual highlighting should be done synchronously or asynchronously with the speech. Participants showed a higher accuracy in choosing the correct solution with our bi-modal TOR and felt that they were better able to recognize the critical situation. Using only fragments in the spoken message rather than full sentences did not lead to improved accuracy or faster reactions. Also, synchronizing the visual highlighting with the spoken message did not result in better accuracy and response times were even increased in this condition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08253v2,2024-09
Source2Synth: Synthetic Data Generation and Curation Grounded in Real Data Sources,"Alisia Lupidi, Carlos Gemmell, Nicola Cancedda, Jane Dwivedi-Yu, Jason Weston, Jakob Foerster, Roberta Raileanu, Maria Lomeli","Large Language Models still struggle in challenging scenarios that leverage structured data, complex reasoning, or tool usage. In this paper, we propose Source2Synth: a new method that can be used for teaching LLMs new skills without relying on costly human annotations. Source2Synth takes as input a custom data source and produces synthetic data points with intermediate reasoning steps grounded in real-world sources. Source2Synth improves the dataset quality by discarding low-quality generations based on their answerability. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by applying it to two challenging domains: we test reasoning abilities in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), and tool usage in tabular question answering (TQA). Our method improves performance by 25.51% for TQA on WikiSQL and 22.57% for MHQA on HotPotQA compared to the fine-tuned baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08239v1,2024-09

Honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure and interact with attackers, have emerged as a critical component in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to creating realistic and interactive honeypot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning a pre-trained open-source language model on a diverse dataset of attacker-generated commands and responses, we developed a honeypot capable of sophisticated engagement with attackers. Our methodology involved several key steps: data collection and processing, prompt engineering, model selection, and supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance. Evaluation through similarity metrics and live deployment demonstrated that our approach effectively generates accurate and informative responses.

What Makes a Maze Look Like a Maze?,"Joy Hsu, Jiayuan Mao, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Noah D. Goodman, Jiajun Wu","A unique aspect of human visual understanding is the ability to flexibly interpret abstract concepts: acquiring lifted rules explaining what they symbolize, grounding them across familiar and unfamiliar contexts, and making predictions or reasoning about them. While off-the-shelf vision-language models excel at making literal interpretations of images (e.g., recognizing object categories such as tree branches), they still struggle to make sense of such visual abstractions (e.g., how an arrangement of tree branches may form the walls of a maze). To address this challenge, we introduce Deep Schema Grounding (DSG), a framework that leverages explicit structured representations of visual abstractions for grounding and reasoning. At the core of DSG are schemas--dependency graph descriptions of abstract concepts that decompose them into more primitive-level symbols. DSG uses large language models to extract schemas, then hierarchically grounds concrete to abstract components of the schema onto images with vision-language models. The grounded schema is used to augment visual abstraction understanding. We systematically evaluate DSG and different methods in reasoning on our new Visual Abstractions Dataset, which consists of diverse, real-world images of abstract concepts and corresponding question-answer pairs labeled by humans. We show that DSG significantly improves the abstract visual reasoning performance of vision-language models, and is a step toward human-aligned understanding of visual abstractions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08202v1,2024-09
AudioBERT: Audio Knowledge Augmented Language Model,"Hyunjong Ok, Suho Yoo, Jaeho Lee","Recent studies have identified that language models, pretrained on text-only datasets, often lack elementary visual knowledge, \textit{e.g.,} colors of everyday objects. Motivated by this observation, we ask whether a similar shortcoming exists in terms of the \textit{auditory} knowledge. To answer this question, we construct a new dataset called AuditoryBench, which consists of two novel tasks for evaluating auditory knowledge. Based on our analysis using the benchmark, we find that language models also suffer from a severe lack of auditory knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose AudioBERT, a novel method to augment the auditory knowledge of BERT through a retrieval-based approach. First, we detect auditory knowledge spans in prompts to query our retrieval model efficiently. Then, we inject audio knowledge into BERT and switch on low-rank adaptation for effective adaptation when audio knowledge is required. Our experiments demonstrate that AudioBERT is quite effective, achieving superior performance on the AuditoryBench.

Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Entity Matching,"Aaron Steiner, Ralph Peeters, Christian Bizer","Generative large language models (LLMs) are a promising alternative to pre-trained language models for entity matching due to their high zero-shot performance and their ability to generalize to unseen entities. Existing research on using LLMs for entity matching has focused on prompt engineering and in-context learning. This paper explores the potential of fine-tuning LLMs for entity matching. We analyze fine-tuning along two dimensions: 1) The representation of training examples, where we experiment with adding different types of LLM-generated explanations to the training set, and 2) the selection and generation of training examples using LLMs. In addition to the matching performance on the source dataset, we investigate how fine-tuning affects the model's ability to generalize to other in-domain datasets as well as across topical domains. Our experiments show that fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of the smaller models while the results for the larger models are mixed. Fine-tuning also improves the generalization to in-domain datasets while hurting cross-domain transfer. We show that adding structured explanations to the training set has a positive impact on the performance of three out of four LLMs, while the proposed example selection and generation methods only improve the performance of Llama 3.1 8B while decreasing the performance of GPT-4o Mini.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08185v1,2024-09
On the Role of Context in Reading Time Prediction,"Andreas Opedal, Eleanor Chodroff, Ryan Cotterell, Ethan Gotlieb Wilcox","We present a new perspective on how readers integrate context during real-time language comprehension. Our proposals build on surprisal theory, which posits that the processing effort of a linguistic unit (e.g., a word) is an affine function of its in-context information content. We first observe that surprisal is only one out of many potential ways that a contextual predictor can be derived from a language model. Another one is the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between a unit and its context, which turns out to yield the same predictive power as surprisal when controlling for unigram frequency. Moreover, both PMI and surprisal are correlated with frequency. This means that neither PMI nor surprisal contains information about context alone. In response to this, we propose a technique where we project surprisal onto the orthogonal complement of frequency, yielding a new contextual predictor that is uncorrelated with frequency. Our experiments show that the proportion of variance in reading times explained by context is a lot smaller when context is represented by the orthogonalized predictor. From an interpretability standpoint, this indicates that previous studies may have overstated the role that context has in predicting reading times.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08160v3,2024-09
LLM-POTUS Score: A Framework of Analyzing Presidential Debates with Large Language Models,"Zhengliang Liu, Yiwei Li, Oleksandra Zolotarevych, Rongwei Yang, Tianming Liu","Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, yet their application to political discourse analysis remains underexplored. This paper introduces a novel approach to evaluating presidential debate performances using LLMs, addressing the longstanding challenge of objectively assessing debate outcomes. We propose a framework that analyzes candidates' ""Policies, Persona, and Perspective"" (3P) and how they resonate with the ""Interests, Ideologies, and Identity"" (3I) of four key audience groups: voters, businesses, donors, and politicians. Our method employs large language models to generate the LLM-POTUS Score, a quantitative measure of debate performance based on the alignment between 3P and 3I. We apply this framework to analyze transcripts from recent U.S. presidential debates, demonstrating its ability to provide nuanced, multi-dimensional assessments of candidate performances. Our results reveal insights into the effectiveness of different debating strategies and their impact on various audience segments. This study not only offers a new tool for political analysis but also explores the potential and limitations of using LLMs as impartial judges in complex social contexts. In addition, this framework provides individual citizens with an independent tool to evaluate presidential debate performances, which enhances democratic engagement and reduces reliance on potentially biased media interpretations and institutional influence, thereby strengthening the foundation of informed civic participation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08147v1,2024-09

Building on recent advancements in open NER research, we augment a large synthetic dataset with synthetic speech samples. This allows us to train WhisperNER on a large number of examples with diverse NER tags. During training, the model is prompted with NER labels and optimized to output the transcribed utterance along with the corresponding tagged entities.

To address the challenge of extensive manual annotation, the study employs a large language model (LLM) for automatic annotation, resulting in the creation of the CLC-UKET dataset. The dataset consists of approximately 19,000 UKET cases and their metadata. Comprehensive legal annotations cover facts, claims, precedent references, statutory references, case outcomes, reasons and jurisdiction codes. Facilitated by the CLC-UKET data, we examine a multi-class case outcome prediction task in the UKET. Human predictions are collected to establish a performance reference for model comparison. Empirical results from baseline models indicate that finetuned transformer models outperform zero-shot and few-shot LLMs on the UKET prediction task. The performance of zero-shot LLMs can be enhanced by integrating task-related information into few-shot examples. We hope that the CLC-UKET dataset, along with human annotations and empirical findings, can serve as a valuable benchmark for employment-related dispute resolution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08098v3,2024-09
TravelAgent: An AI Assistant for Personalized Travel Planning,"Aili Chen, Xuyang Ge, Ziquan Fu, Yanghua Xiao, Jiangjie Chen","As global tourism expands and artificial intelligence technology advances, intelligent travel planning services have emerged as a significant research focus.

Enhanced Online Grooming Detection Employing Context Determination and Message-Level Analysis,"Jake Street, Isibor Ihianle, Funminiyi Olajide, Ahmad Lotfi","Online Grooming (OG) is a prevalent threat facing predominately children online, with groomers using deceptive methods to prey on the vulnerability of children on social media/messaging platforms. These attacks can have severe psychological and physical impacts, including a tendency towards revictimization. Current technical measures are inadequate, especially with the advent of end-to-end encryption which hampers message monitoring. Existing solutions focus on the signature analysis of child abuse media, which does not effectively address real-time OG detection. This paper proposes that OG attacks are complex, requiring the identification of specific communication patterns between adults and children. It introduces a novel approach leveraging advanced models such as BERT and RoBERTa for Message-Level Analysis and a Context Determination approach for classifying actor interactions, including the introduction of Actor Significance Thresholds and Message Significance Thresholds. The proposed method aims to enhance accuracy and robustness in detecting OG by considering the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of these attacks.

A corpus-based investigation of pitch contours of monosyllabic words in conversational Taiwan Mandarin,"Xiaoyun Jin, Mirjam Ernestus, R. Harald Baayen","In Mandarin, the tonal contours of monosyllabic words produced in isolation or in careful speech are characterized by four lexical tones: a high-level tone (T1), a rising tone (T2), a dipping tone (T3) and a falling tone (T4). However, in spontaneous speech, the actual tonal realization of monosyllabic words can deviate significantly from these canonical tones due to intra-syllabic co-articulation and inter-syllabic co-articulation with adjacent tones. In addition, Chuang et al. (2024) recently reported that the tonal contours of disyllabic Mandarin words with T2-T4 tone pattern are co-determined by their meanings. Following up on their research, we present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of contextual predictors on the one hand, and the way in words' meanings co-determine pitch contours on the other hand. We analyze the F0 contours of 3824 tokens of 63 different word types in a spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin corpus, using the generalized additive (mixed) model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours. We show that the tonal context substantially modify a word's canonical tone. Once the effect of tonal context is controlled for, T2 and T3 emerge as low flat tones, contrasting with T1 as a high tone, and with T4 as a high-to-mid falling tone. The neutral tone (T0), which in standard descriptions, is realized based on the preceding tone, emerges as a low tone in its own right, modified by the other predictors in the same way as the standard tones T1, T2, T3, and T4. We also show that word, and even more so, word sense, co-determine words' F0 contours. Analyses of variable importance using random forests further supported the substantial effect of tonal context and an effect of word sense.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07891v3,2024-09
Learning Rules from KGs Guided by Language Models,"Zihang Peng, Daria Stepanova, Vinh Thinh Ho, Heike Adel, Alessandra Russo, Simon Ott","Advances in information extraction have enabled the automatic construction of large knowledge graphs (e.g., Yago, Wikidata or Google KG), which are widely used in many applications like semantic search or data analytics. However, due to their semi-automatic construction, KGs are often incomplete. Rule learning methods, concerned with the extraction of frequent patterns from KGs and casting them into rules, can be applied to predict potentially missing facts. A crucial step in this process is rule ranking. Ranking of rules is especially challenging over highly incomplete or biased KGs (e.g., KGs predominantly storing facts about famous people), as in this case biased rules might fit the data best and be ranked at the top based on standard statistical metrics like rule confidence. To address this issue, prior works proposed to rank rules not only relying on the original KG but also facts predicted by a KG embedding model. At the same time, with the recent rise of Language Models (LMs), several works have claimed that LMs can be used as alternative means for KG completion. In this work, our goal is to verify to which extent the exploitation of LMs is helpful for improving the quality of rule learning systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07869v1,2024-09
FPMT: Enhanced Semi-Supervised Model for Traffic Incident Detection,"Xinying Lu, Jianli Xiao","For traffic incident detection, the acquisition of data and labels is notably resource-intensive, rendering semi-supervised traffic incident detection both a formidable and consequential challenge.

The data augmentation module introduces Generative Adversarial Networks to balance and expand the dataset. During the mix-up process in the hidden space, it employs a probabilistic pseudo-mixing mechanism to enhance regularization and elevate model precision. In terms of training strategy, it initiates with unsupervised training on all data, followed by supervised fine-tuning on a subset of labeled data, and ultimately completing the goal of semi-supervised training. Through empirical validation on four authentic datasets, our FPMT model exhibits outstanding performance across various metrics. Particularly noteworthy is its robust performance even in scenarios with low label rates.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07839v1,2024-09
Online vs Offline: A Comparative Study of First-Party and Third-Party Evaluations of Social Chatbots,"Ekaterina Svikhnushina, Pearl Pu","This paper explores the efficacy of online versus offline evaluation methods in assessing conversational chatbots, specifically comparing first-party direct interactions with third-party observational assessments. By extending a benchmarking dataset of user dialogs with empathetic chatbots with offline third-party evaluations, we present a systematic comparison between the feedback from online interactions and the more detached offline third-party evaluations. Our results reveal that offline human evaluations fail to capture the subtleties of human-chatbot interactions as effectively as online assessments. In comparison, automated third-party evaluations using a GPT-4 model offer a better approximation of first-party human judgments given detailed instructions. This study highlights the limitations of third-party evaluations in grasping the complexities of user experiences and advocates for the integration of direct interaction feedback in conversational AI evaluation to enhance system development and user satisfaction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07823v1,2024-09
Controllable Synthetic Clinical Note Generation with Privacy Guarantees,"Tal Baumel, Andre Manoel, Daniel Jones, Shize Su, Huseyin Inan, Aaron, Bornstein, Robert Sim","In the field of machine learning, domain-specific annotated data is an invaluable resource for training effective models. However, in the medical domain, this data often includes Personal Health Information (PHI), raising significant privacy concerns. The stringent regulations surrounding PHI limit the availability and sharing of medical datasets, which poses a substantial challenge for researchers and practitioners aiming to develop advanced machine learning models. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to ""clone"" datasets containing PHI. Our approach ensures that the cloned datasets retain the essential characteristics and utility of the original data without compromising patient privacy. By leveraging differential-privacy techniques and a novel fine-tuning task, our method produces datasets that are free from identifiable information while preserving the statistical properties necessary for model training.

Full-text Error Correction for Chinese Speech Recognition with Large Language Model,"Zhiyuan Tang, Dong Wang, Shen Huang, Shidong Shang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential for error correction in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most research focuses on utterances from short-duration speech recordings, which are the predominant form of speech data for supervised ASR training. This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLMs for error correction in full-text generated by ASR systems from longer speech recordings, such as transcripts from podcasts, news broadcasts, and meetings. First, we develop a Chinese dataset for full-text error correction, named ChFT, utilizing a pipeline that involves text-to-speech synthesis, ASR, and error-correction pair extractor. This dataset enables us to correct errors across contexts, including both full-text and segment, and to address a broader range of error types, such as punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization, thus making the correction process comprehensive. Second, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on the constructed dataset using a diverse set of prompts and target formats, and evaluate its performance on full-text error correction. Specifically, we design prompts based on full-text and segment, considering various output formats, such as directly corrected text and JSON-based error-correction pairs. Through various test settings, including homogeneous, up-to-date, and hard test sets, we find that the fine-tuned LLMs perform well in the full-text setting with different prompts, each presenting its own strengths and weaknesses. This establishes a promising baseline for further research. The dataset is available on the website.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07790v2,2024-09
Stable Language Model Pre-training by Reducing Embedding Variability,"Woojin Chung, Jiwoo Hong, Na Min An, James Thorne, Se-Young Yun","Stable pre-training is essential for achieving better-performing language models. However, tracking pre-training stability by calculating gradient variance at every step is impractical due to the significant computational costs. We explore Token Embedding Variability (TEV) as a simple and efficient proxy for assessing pre-training stability in language models with pre-layer normalization, given that shallower layers are more prone to gradient explosion (section 2.2). Moreover, we propose Multi-head Low-Rank Attention (MLRA) as an architecture to alleviate such instability by limiting the exponential growth of output embedding variance, thereby preventing the gradient explosion (section 3.2). Empirical results on GPT-2 with MLRA demonstrate increased stability and lower perplexity, particularly in deeper models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07787v1,2024-09

Top-down Activity Representation Learning for Video Question Answering,"Yanan Wang, Shuichiro Haruta, Donghuo Zeng, Julio Vizcarra, Mori Kurokawa","Capturing complex hierarchical human activities, from atomic actions (e.g., picking up one present, moving to the sofa, unwrapping the present) to contextual events (e.g., celebrating Christmas) is crucial for achieving high-performance video question answering (VideoQA). Recent works have expanded multimodal models (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA) to process continuous video sequences, enhancing the model's temporal reasoning capabilities. However, these approaches often fail to capture contextual events that can be decomposed into multiple atomic actions non-continuously distributed over relatively long-term sequences. In this paper, to leverage the spatial visual context representation capability of the CLIP model for obtaining non-continuous visual representations in terms of contextual events in videos, we convert long-term video sequences into a spatial image domain and finetune the multimodal model LLaVA for the VideoQA task. Our approach achieves competitive performance on the STAR task, in particular, with a 78.4% accuracy score, exceeding the current state-of-the-art score by 2.8 points on the NExTQA task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07748v1,2024-09
Multi-object event graph representation learning for Video Question Answering,"Yanan Wang, Shuichiro Haruta, Donghuo Zeng, Julio Vizcarra, Mori Kurokawa","Video question answering (VideoQA) is a task to predict the correct answer to questions posed about a given video. The system must comprehend spatial and temporal relationships among objects extracted from videos to perform causal and temporal reasoning. While prior works have focused on modeling individual object movements using transformer-based methods, they falter when capturing complex scenarios involving multiple objects (e.g., ""a boy is throwing a ball in a hoop""). We propose a contrastive language event graph representation learning method called CLanG to address this limitation. Aiming to capture event representations associated with multiple objects, our method employs a multi-layer GNN-cluster module for adversarial graph representation learning, enabling contrastive learning between the question text and its relevant multi-object event graph. Our method outperforms a strong baseline, achieving up to 2.2% higher accuracy on two challenging VideoQA datasets, NExT-QA and TGIF-QA-R. In particular, it is 2.8% better than baselines in handling causal and temporal questions, highlighting its strength in reasoning multiple object-based events.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07747v1,2024-09

While the development of general-purpose text embedding models in English and multilingual contexts has been active in recent years, model development in Japanese remains insufficient. The primary reasons for this are the lack of datasets and the absence of necessary expertise. In this report, we provide a detailed account of the development process of Ruri. Specifically, we discuss the training of embedding models using synthesized datasets generated by LLMs, the construction of the reranker for dataset filtering and knowledge distillation, and the performance evaluation of the resulting general-purpose text embedding models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07737v1,2024-09
Large Language Models are Pattern Matchers: Editing Semi-Structured and Structured Documents with ChatGPT,Irene Weber,"Large Language Models (LLMs) offer numerous applications, the full extent of which is not yet understood. This paper investigates if LLMs can be applied for editing structured and semi-structured documents with minimal effort. Using a qualitative research approach, we conduct two case studies with ChatGPT and thoroughly analyze the results. Our experiments indicate that LLMs can effectively edit structured and semi-structured documents when provided with basic, straightforward prompts. ChatGPT demonstrates a strong ability to recognize and process the structure of annotated documents. This suggests that explicitly structuring tasks and data in prompts might enhance an LLM's ability to understand and solve tasks. Furthermore, the experiments also reveal impressive pattern matching skills in ChatGPT. This observation deserves further investigation, as it may contribute to understanding the processes leading to hallucinations in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07732v1,2024-09
On the Vulnerability of Applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation within Knowledge-Intensive Application Domains,"Xun Xian, Ganghua Wang, Xuan Bi, Jayanth Srinivasa, Ashish Kundu, Charles Fleming, Mingyi Hong, Jie Ding","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been empirically shown to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal contexts. Given a query, RAG retrieves relevant documents from a corpus and integrates them into the LLMs' generation process. In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of RAG, focusing specifically on examining the retrieval system. First, across 225 different setup combinations of corpus, retriever, query, and targeted information, we show that retrieval systems are vulnerable to universal poisoning attacks in medical Q\&A. In such attacks, adversaries generate poisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as personally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted into a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as attacker-specified queries are used. To understand this vulnerability, we discovered that the deviation from the query's embedding to that of the poisoned document tends to follow a pattern in which the high similarity between the poisoned document and the query is retained, thereby enabling precise retrieval. Based on these findings, we develop a new detection-based defense to ensure the safe use of RAG. Through extensive experiments spanning various Q\&A domains, we observed that our proposed method consistently achieves excellent detection rates in nearly all cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17275v1,2024-09
Experimenting with Legal AI Solutions: The Case of Question-Answering for Access to Justice,"Jonathan Li, Rohan Bhambhoria, Samuel Dahan, Xiaodan Zhu","Generative AI models, such as the GPT and Llama series, have significant potential to assist laypeople in answering legal questions. However, little prior work focuses on the data sourcing, inference, and evaluation of these models in the context of laypersons. To this end, we propose a human-centric legal NLP pipeline, covering data sourcing, inference, and evaluation. We introduce and release a dataset, LegalQA, with real and specific legal questions spanning from employment law to criminal law, corresponding answers written by legal experts, and citations for each answer. We develop an automatic evaluation protocol for this dataset, then show that retrieval-augmented generation from only 850 citations in the train set can match or outperform internet-wide retrieval, despite containing 9 orders of magnitude less data. Finally, we propose future directions for open-sourced efforts, which fall behind closed-sourced models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07713v1,2024-09
DSBench: How Far Are Data Science Agents to Becoming Data Science Experts?,"Liqiang Jing, Zhehui Huang, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenlin Yao, Wenhao Yu, Kaixin Ma, Hongming Zhang, Xinya Du, Dong Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive language/vision reasoning abilities, igniting the recent trend of building agents for targeted applications such as shopping assistants or AI software engineers. Recently, many data science benchmarks have been proposed to investigate their performance in the data science domain. However, existing data science benchmarks still fall short when compared to real-world data science applications due to their simplified settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce DSBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate data science agents with realistic tasks. This benchmark includes 466 data analysis tasks and 74 data modeling tasks, sourced from Eloquence and Kaggle competitions. DSBench offers a realistic setting by encompassing long contexts, multimodal task backgrounds, reasoning with large data files and multi-table structures, and performing end-to-end data modeling tasks.

"Enhancing Q&A Text Retrieval with Ranking Models: Benchmarking, fine-tuning and deploying Rerankers for RAG","Gabriel de Souza P. Moreira, Ronay Ak, Benedikt Schifferer, Mengyao Xu, Radek Osmulski, Even Oldridge","Ranking models play a crucial role in enhancing overall accuracy of text retrieval systems. These multi-stage systems typically utilize either dense embedding models or sparse lexical indices to retrieve relevant passages based on a given query, followed by ranking models that refine the ordering of the candidate passages by its relevance to the query.   This paper benchmarks various publicly available ranking models and examines their impact on ranking accuracy. We focus on text retrieval for question-answering tasks, a common use case for Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. Our evaluation benchmarks include models some of which are commercially viable for industrial applications.   We introduce a state-of-the-art ranking model, NV-RerankQA-Mistral-4B-v3, which achieves a significant accuracy increase of ~14% compared to pipelines with other rerankers. We also provide an ablation study comparing the fine-tuning of ranking models with different sizes, losses and self-attention mechanisms.

An Unsupervised Dialogue Topic Segmentation Model Based on Utterance Rewriting,"Xia Hou, Qifeng Li, Tongliang Li","Dialogue topic segmentation plays a crucial role in various types of dialogue modeling tasks. The state-of-the-art unsupervised DTS methods learn topic-aware discourse representations from conversation data through adjacent discourse matching and pseudo segmentation to further mine useful clues in unlabeled conversational relations. However, in multi-round dialogs, discourses often have co-references or omissions, leading to the fact that direct use of these discourses for representation learning may negatively affect the semantic similarity computation in the neighboring discourse matching task. In order to fully utilize the useful cues in conversational relations, this study proposes a novel unsupervised dialog topic segmentation method that combines the Utterance Rewriting (UR) technique with an unsupervised learning algorithm to efficiently utilize the useful cues in unlabeled dialogs by rewriting the dialogs in order to recover the co-referents and omitted words. Compared with existing unsupervised models, the proposed Discourse Rewriting Topic Segmentation Model (UR-DTS) significantly improves the accuracy of topic segmentation. The main finding is that the performance on DialSeg711 improves by about 6% in terms of absolute error score and WD, achieving 11.42% in terms of absolute error score and 12.97% in terms of WD. on Doc2Dial the absolute error score and WD improves by about 3% and 2%, respectively, resulting in SOTA reaching 35.17% in terms of absolute error score and 38.49% in terms of WD. This shows that the model is very effective in capturing the nuances of conversational topics, as well as the usefulness and challenges of utilizing unlabeled conversations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07672v1,2024-09

SimulBench: Evaluating Language Models with Creative Simulation Tasks,"Qi Jia, Xiang Yue, Tianyu Zheng, Jie Huang, Bill Yuchen Lin","We introduce SimulBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) across a diverse collection of creative simulation scenarios, such as acting as a Linux terminal or playing text games with users. While these simulation tasks serve as effective measures of an LLM's general intelligence, they are seldom incorporated into existing benchmarks. A major challenge is to develop an evaluation framework for testing different LLMs fairly while preserving the multi-round interactive nature of simulation tasks between users and AI. To tackle this issue, we suggest using a fixed LLM as a user agent to engage with an LLM to collect dialogues first under different tasks. Then, challenging dialogue scripts are extracted for evaluating different target LLMs. To facilitate automatic assessment on \DataName{}, GPT-4 is employed as the evaluator, tasked with reviewing the quality of the final response generated by the target LLMs given multi-turn dialogue scripts. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that these simulation tasks continue to pose a significant challenge with their unique natures and show the gap between proprietary models and the most advanced open LLMs. For example, GPT-4-turbo outperforms LLaMA-3-70b-Chat on 18.55\% more cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07641v1,2024-09
Can We Count on LLMs? The Fixed-Effect Fallacy and Claims of GPT-4 Capabilities,"Thomas Ball, Shuo Chen, Cormac Herley","In this paper we explore evaluation of LLM capabilities. We present measurements of GPT-4 performance on several deterministic tasks; each task involves a basic calculation and takes as input parameter some element drawn from a large well-defined population (e.g., count elements in a list, multiply two k-digit numbers, etc). We examine several conditions per-task and perform enough trials so that statistically significant differences can be detected. This allows us to investigate the sensitivity of task-accuracy both to query phrasing and input parameter population. We find that seemingly trivial modifications in the task-prompt or input population can yield differences far larger than can be explained by sampling effects. For example, performance on a simple list-counting task varies with query-phrasing and list-length, but also with list composition (i.e., the thing-to-be-counted) and object frequency (e.g., success when an element accounts for $\approx$ 50\% of a list is different from when it accounts for $\approx$ 70\% etc).   We conclude that efforts to quantify LLM capabilities easily succumb to the language-as-fixed-effect fallacy, where experimental observations are improperly generalized beyond what the data supports. A consequence appears to be that intuitions that have been formed based on interactions with humans form a very unreliable guide as to which input modifications should ``make no difference'' to LLM performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07638v2,2024-09
When Less Is Not More: Large Language Models Normalize Less-Frequent Terms with Lower Accuracy,"Daniel B. Hier, Thanh Son Do, Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi","Term normalization is the process of mapping a term from free text to a standardized concept and its machine-readable code in an ontology. Accurate normalization of terms that capture phenotypic differences between patients and diseases is critical to the success of precision medicine initiatives. A large language model (LLM), such as GPT-4o, can normalize terms to the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), but it may retrieve incorrect HPO IDs. Reported accuracy rates for LLMs on these tasks may be inflated due to imbalanced test datasets skewed towards high-frequency terms. In our study, using a comprehensive dataset of 268,776 phenotype annotations for 12,655 diseases from the HPO, GPT-4o achieved an accuracy of 13.1% in normalizing 11,225 unique terms. However, the accuracy was unevenly distributed, with higher-frequency and shorter terms normalized more accurately than lower-frequency and longer terms. Feature importance analysis, using SHAP and permutation methods, identified low-term frequency as the most significant predictor of normalization errors. These findings suggest that training and evaluation datasets for LLM-based term normalization should balance low- and high-frequency terms to improve model performance, particularly for infrequent terms critical to precision medicine.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13746v1,2024-09
Leveraging User-Generated Reviews for Recommender Systems with Dynamic Headers,"Shanu Vashishtha, Abhay Kumar, Lalitesh Morishetti, Kaushiki Nag, Kannan Achan","E-commerce platforms have a vast catalog of items to cater to their customers' shopping interests. Most of these platforms assist their customers in the shopping process by offering optimized recommendation carousels, designed to help customers quickly locate their desired items. Many models have been proposed in academic literature to generate and enhance the ranking and recall set of items in these carousels. Conventionally, the accompanying carousel title text (header) of these carousels remains static. In most instances, a generic text such as ""Items similar to your current viewing"" is utilized. Fixed variations such as the inclusion of specific attributes ""Other items from a similar seller"" or ""Items from a similar brand"" in addition to ""frequently bought together"" or ""considered together"" are observed as well. This work proposes a novel approach to customize the header generation process of these carousels. Our work leverages user-generated reviews that lay focus on specific attributes (aspects) of an item that were favorably perceived by users during their interaction with the given item. We extract these aspects from reviews and train a graph neural network-based model under the framework of a conditional ranking task. We refer to our innovative methodology as Dynamic Text Snippets (DTS) which generates multiple header texts for an anchor item and its recall set. Our approach demonstrates the potential of utilizing user-generated reviews and presents a unique paradigm for exploring increasingly context-aware recommendation systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07627v1,2024-09

Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Using Mixture of Large Language Models,"Matthieu Dubois, François Yvon, Pablo Piantanida","The dissemination of Large Language Models (LLMs), trained at scale, and endowed with powerful text-generating abilities has vastly increased the threats posed by generative AI technologies by reducing the cost of producing harmful, toxic, faked or forged content. In response, various proposals have been made to automatically discriminate artificially generated from human-written texts, typically framing the problem as a classification problem. Most approaches evaluate an input document by a well-chosen detector LLM, assuming that low-perplexity scores reliably signal machine-made content. As using one single detector can induce brittleness of performance, we instead consider several and derive a new, theoretically grounded approach to combine their respective strengths. Our experiments, using a variety of generator LLMs, suggest that our method effectively increases the robustness of detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07615v1,2024-09
Contextualization of ASR with LLM using phonetic retrieval-based augmentation,"Zhihong Lei, Xingyu Na, Mingbin Xu, Ernest Pusateri, Christophe Van Gysel, Yuanyuan Zhang, Shiyi Han, Zhen Huang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown superb capability of modeling multimodal signals including audio and text, allowing the model to generate spoken or textual response given a speech input. However, it remains a challenge for the model to recognize personal named entities, such as contacts in a phone book, when the input modality is speech. In this work, we start with a speech recognition task and propose a retrieval-based solution to contextualize the LLM: we first let the LLM detect named entities in speech without any context, then use this named entity as a query to retrieve phonetically similar named entities from a personal database and feed them to the LLM, and finally run context-aware LLM decoding. In a voice assistant task, our solution achieved up to 30.2% relative word error rate reduction and 73.6% relative named entity error rate reduction compared to a baseline system without contextualization. Notably, our solution by design avoids prompting the LLM with the full named entity database, making it highly efficient and applicable to large named entity databases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15353v1,2024-09
SUPER: Evaluating Agents on Setting Up and Executing Tasks from Research Repositories,"Ben Bogin, Kejuan Yang, Shashank Gupta, Kyle Richardson, Erin Bransom, Peter Clark, Ashish Sabharwal, Tushar Khot","Given that Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in writing code, can they now be used to autonomously reproduce results from research repositories? Such a capability would be a boon to the research community, helping researchers validate, understand, and extend prior work. To advance towards this goal, we introduce SUPER, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capability of LLMs in setting up and executing tasks from research repositories. SUPERaims to capture the realistic challenges faced by researchers working with Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) research repositories. Our benchmark comprises three distinct problem sets: 45 end-to-end problems with annotated expert solutions, 152 sub problems derived from the expert set that focus on specific challenges (e.g., configuring a trainer), and 602 automatically generated problems for larger-scale development. We introduce various evaluation measures to assess both task success and progress, utilizing gold solutions when available or approximations otherwise.

A Suite for Acoustic Language Model Evaluation,"Gallil Maimon, Amit Roth, Yossi Adi","Speech language models have recently demonstrated great potential as universal speech processing systems. Such models have the ability to model the rich acoustic information existing in audio signals, beyond spoken content, such as emotion, background noise, etc. Despite this, evaluation benchmarks which evaluate awareness to a wide range of acoustic aspects, are lacking. To help bridge this gap, we introduce SALMon, a novel evaluation suite encompassing background noise, emotion, speaker identity and room impulse response. The proposed benchmarks both evaluate the consistency of the inspected element and how much it matches the spoken text. We follow a modelling based approach, measuring whether a model gives correct samples higher scores than incorrect ones. This approach makes the benchmark fast to compute even for large models. We evaluated several speech language models on SALMon, thus highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each evaluated method.

Synthetic continued pretraining,"Zitong Yang, Neil Band, Shuangping Li, Emmanuel Candès, Tatsunori Hashimoto","Pretraining on large-scale, unstructured internet text enables language models to acquire a significant amount of world knowledge. However, this knowledge acquisition is data-inefficient--to learn a given fact, models must be trained on hundreds to thousands of diverse representations of it. This poses a challenge when adapting a pretrained model to a small corpus of domain-specific documents, where each fact may appear rarely or only once. We propose to bridge this gap with synthetic continued pretraining: using the small domain-specific corpus to synthesize a large corpus more amenable to learning, and then performing continued pretraining on the synthesized corpus. We instantiate this proposal with EntiGraph, a synthetic data augmentation algorithm that extracts salient entities from the source documents and then generates diverse text by drawing connections between the sampled entities. Synthetic continued pretraining with EntiGraph enables a language model to answer questions and follow generic instructions related to the source documents without access to them. If, instead, the source documents are available at inference time, we show that the knowledge acquired through our approach compounds with retrieval-augmented generation. To better understand these results, we build a simple mathematical model of EntiGraph, and show how synthetic data augmentation can ""rearrange"" knowledge to enable more data-efficient learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07431v2,2024-09
Agent Workflow Memory,"Zora Zhiruo Wang, Jiayuan Mao, Daniel Fried, Graham Neubig","Despite the potential of language model-based agents to solve real-world tasks such as web navigation, current methods still struggle with long-horizon tasks with complex action trajectories. In contrast, humans can flexibly solve complex tasks by learning reusable task workflows from past experiences and using them to guide future actions. To build agents that can similarly benefit from this process, we introduce Agent Workflow Memory (AWM), a method for inducing commonly reused routines, i.e., workflows, and selectively providing workflows to the agent to guide subsequent generations. AWM flexibly applies to both offline and online scenarios, where agents induce workflows from training examples beforehand or from test queries on the fly. We experiment on two major web navigation benchmarks -- Mind2Web and WebArena -- that collectively cover 1000+ tasks from 200+ domains across travel, shopping, and social media, among others. AWM substantially improves the baseline results by 24.6% and 51.1% relative success rate on Mind2Web and WebArena while reducing the number of steps taken to solve WebArena tasks successfully.

Towards Fairer Health Recommendations: finding informative unbiased samples via Word Sense Disambiguation,"Gavin Butts, Pegah Emdad, Jethro Lee, Shannon Song, Chiman Salavati, Willmar Sosa Diaz, Shiri Dori-Hacohen, Fabricio Murai","There have been growing concerns around high-stake applications that rely on models trained with biased data, which consequently produce biased predictions, often harming the most vulnerable. In particular, biased medical data could cause health-related applications and recommender systems to create outputs that jeopardize patient care and widen disparities in health outcomes. A recent framework titled Fairness via AI posits that, instead of attempting to correct model biases, researchers must focus on their root causes by using AI to debias data. Inspired by this framework, we tackle bias detection in medical curricula using NLP models, including LLMs, and evaluate them on a gold standard dataset containing 4,105 excerpts annotated by medical experts for bias from a large corpus. We build on previous work by coauthors which augments the set of negative samples with non-annotated text containing social identifier terms. However, some of these terms, especially those related to race and ethnicity, can carry different meanings (e.g., ""white matter of spinal cord""). To address this issue, we propose the use of Word Sense Disambiguation models to refine dataset quality by removing irrelevant sentences. We then evaluate fine-tuned variations of BERT models as well as GPT models with zero- and few-shot prompting. We found LLMs, considered SOTA on many NLP tasks, unsuitable for bias detection, while fine-tuned BERT models generally perform well across all evaluated metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07424v1,2024-09
Enhancing adversarial robustness in Natural Language Inference using explanations,"Alexandros Koulakos, Maria Lymperaiou, Giorgos Filandrianos, Giorgos Stamou","The surge of state-of-the-art Transformer-based models has undoubtedly pushed the limits of NLP model performance, excelling in a variety of tasks. We cast the spotlight on the underexplored task of Natural Language Inference (NLI), since models trained on popular well-suited datasets are susceptible to adversarial attacks, allowing subtle input interventions to mislead the model. In this work, we validate the usage of natural language explanation as a model-agnostic defence strategy through extensive experimentation: only by fine-tuning a classifier on the explanation rather than premise-hypothesis inputs, robustness under various adversarial attacks is achieved in comparison to explanation-free baselines. Moreover, since there is no standard strategy of testing the semantic validity of the generated explanations, we research the correlation of widely used language generation metrics with human perception, in order for them to serve as a proxy towards robust NLI models. Our approach is resource-efficient and reproducible without significant computational limitations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07423v2,2024-09
What to align in multimodal contrastive learning?,"Benoit Dufumier, Javiera Castillo-Navarro, Devis Tuia, Jean-Philippe Thiran","Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the information of different modalities to adapt their behavior. Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves state-of-the-art results on the six multimodal benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07402v1,2024-09
AdaCAD: Adaptively Decoding to Balance Conflicts between Contextual and Parametric Knowledge,"Han Wang, Archiki Prasad, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal","Knowledge conflict arises from discrepancies between information in the context of a large language model (LLM) and the knowledge stored in its parameters. This can hurt performance when using standard decoding techniques, which tend to ignore the context. Existing test-time contrastive methods seek to address this by comparing the LLM's output distribution with and without the context and adjust the model according to the contrast between them. However, we find that these methods frequently misjudge the degree of conflict and struggle to handle instances that vary in their amount of conflict, with static methods over-adjusting when conflict is absent. We propose a fine-grained, instance-level approach called AdaCAD, which dynamically infers the weight of adjustment based on the degree of conflict, as measured by the Jensen-Shannon divergence between distributions representing contextual and parametric knowledge. Our experiments across four models on six diverse question-answering (QA) datasets and three summarization tasks demonstrate that our training-free adaptive method consistently outperforms other decoding methods on QA, with average accuracy gains of 14.21% (absolute) over a static contrastive baseline, and improves the factuality of summaries by 5.59 (AlignScore). Furthermore, our analysis shows that while decoding with contrastive baselines hurts performance when conflict is absent, AdaCAD mitigates these losses, making it more applicable to real-world datasets in which some examples have conflict and others do not.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07394v1,2024-09

However, effectively leveraging lecture slides to serve students is difficult due to the multi-modal nature of slide content and the heterogeneous teaching actions. We study the problem of discovering effective designs that convert a slide into an interactive lecture. We develop Slide2Lecture, a tuning-free and knowledge-regulated intelligent tutoring system that can (1) effectively convert an input lecture slide into a structured teaching agenda consisting of a set of heterogeneous teaching actions; (2) create and manage an interactive lecture that generates responsive interactions catering to student learning demands while regulating the interactions to follow teaching actions. Slide2Lecture contains a complete pipeline for learners to obtain an interactive classroom experience to learn the slide. For teachers and developers, Slide2Lecture enables customization to cater to personalized demands. The evaluation rated by annotators and students shows that Slide2Lecture is effective in outperforming the remaining implementation.

Think Together and Work Better: Combining Humans' and LLMs' Think-Aloud Outcomes for Effective Text Evaluation,"SeongYeub Chu, JongWoo Kim, MunYong Yi","This study introduces \textbf{InteractEval}, a framework that integrates human expertise and Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Think-Aloud (TA) method to generate attributes for checklist-based text evaluation. By combining human flexibility and reasoning with LLM consistency, InteractEval outperforms traditional non-LLM-based and LLM-based baselines across four distinct dimensions, consisting of Coherence, Fluency, Consistency, and Relevance. The experiment also investigates the effectiveness of the TA method, showing that it promotes divergent thinking in both humans and LLMs, leading to the generation of a wider range of relevant attributes and enhance text evaluation performance. Comparative analysis reveals that humans excel at identifying attributes related to internal quality (Coherence and Fluency), but LLMs perform better at those attributes related to external alignment (Consistency and Relevance). Consequently, leveraging both humans and LLMs together produces the best evaluation outcomes. In other words, this study emphasizes the necessity of effectively combining humans and LLMs in an automated checklist-based text evaluation framework.

"Explanation, Debate, Align: A Weak-to-Strong Framework for Language Model Generalization","Mehrdad Zakershahrak, Samira Ghodratnama","The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence systems has brought the challenge of AI alignment to the forefront of research, particularly in complex decision-making and task execution. As these systems surpass human-level performance in sophisticated problems, ensuring their alignment with human values, intentions, and ethical guidelines becomes crucial. Building on previous work in explanation generation for human-agent alignment, we address the more complex dynamics of multi-agent systems and human-AI teams. This paper introduces a novel approach to model alignment through weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language models. We present a framework where a strong model facilitates the improvement of a weaker model, bridging the gap between explanation generation and model alignment. Our method, formalized as a facilitation function, allows for the transfer of capabilities from advanced models to less capable ones without direct access to extensive training data. Our results suggest that this facilitation-based approach not only enhances model performance but also provides insights into the nature of model alignment and the potential for scalable oversight of AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07335v1,2024-09
MEDIC: Towards a Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating LLMs in Clinical Applications,"Praveen K Kanithi, Clément Christophe, Marco AF Pimentel, Tathagata Raha, Nada Saadi, Hamza Javed, Svetlana Maslenkova, Nasir Hayat, Ronnie Rajan, Shadab Khan","The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare applications has spurred calls for holistic evaluation beyond frequently-cited benchmarks like USMLE, to better reflect real-world performance. While real-world assessments are valuable indicators of utility, they often lag behind the pace of LLM evolution, likely rendering findings obsolete upon deployment. This temporal disconnect necessitates a comprehensive upfront evaluation that can guide model selection for specific clinical applications. We introduce MEDIC, a framework assessing LLMs across five critical dimensions of clinical competence: medical reasoning, ethics and bias, data and language understanding, in-context learning, and clinical safety. MEDIC features a novel cross-examination framework quantifying LLM performance across areas like coverage and hallucination detection, without requiring reference outputs. We apply MEDIC to evaluate LLMs on medical question-answering, safety, summarization, note generation, and other tasks. Our results show performance disparities across model sizes, baseline vs medically finetuned models, and have implications on model selection for applications requiring specific model strengths, such as low hallucination or lower cost of inference. MEDIC's multifaceted evaluation reveals these performance trade-offs, bridging the gap between theoretical capabilities and practical implementation in healthcare settings, ensuring that the most promising models are identified and adapted for diverse healthcare applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07314v1,2024-09
Using Generative Agents to Create Tip Sheets for Investigative Data Reporting,"Joris Veerbeek, Nicholas Diakopoulos","This paper introduces a system using generative AI agents to create tip sheets for investigative data reporting. Our system employs three specialized agents--an analyst, a reporter, and an editor--to collaboratively generate and refine tips from datasets. We validate this approach using real-world investigative stories, demonstrating that our agent-based system generally generates more newsworthy and accurate insights compared to a baseline model without agents, although some variability was noted between different stories. Our findings highlight the potential of generative AI to provide leads for investigative data reporting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07286v1,2024-09
Cross-Dialect Text-To-Speech in Pitch-Accent Language Incorporating Multi-Dialect Phoneme-Level BERT,"Kazuki Yamauchi, Yuki Saito, Hiroshi Saruwatari","We explore cross-dialect text-to-speech (CD-TTS), a task to synthesize learned speakers' voices in non-native dialects, especially in pitch-accent languages. CD-TTS is important for developing voice agents that naturally communicate with people across regions. We present a novel TTS model comprising three sub-modules to perform competitively at this task. We first train a backbone TTS model to synthesize dialect speech from a text conditioned on phoneme-level accent latent variables (ALVs) extracted from speech by a reference encoder. Then, we train an ALV predictor to predict ALVs tailored to a target dialect from input text leveraging our novel multi-dialect phoneme-level BERT. We conduct multi-dialect TTS experiments and evaluate the effectiveness of our model by comparing it with a baseline derived from conventional dialect TTS methods. The results show that our model improves the dialectal naturalness of synthetic speech in CD-TTS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07265v1,2024-09
Propaganda to Hate: A Multimodal Analysis of Arabic Memes with Multi-Agent LLMs,"Firoj Alam, Md. Rafiul Biswas, Uzair Shah, Wajdi Zaghouani, Georgios Mikros","In the past decade, social media platforms have been used for information dissemination and consumption. While a major portion of the content is posted to promote citizen journalism and public awareness, some content is posted to mislead users. Among different content types such as text, images, and videos, memes (text overlaid on images) are particularly prevalent and can serve as powerful vehicles for propaganda, hate, and humor. In the current literature, there have been efforts to individually detect such content in memes. However, the study of their intersection is very limited. In this study, we explore the intersection between propaganda and hate in memes using a multi-agent LLM-based approach. We extend the propagandistic meme dataset with coarse and fine-grained hate labels. Our finding suggests that there is an association between propaganda and hate in memes. We provide detailed experimental results that can serve as a baseline for future studies. We will make the experimental resources publicly available to the community (https://github.com/firojalam/propaganda-and-hateful-memes).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07246v2,2024-09
Learning Efficient Recursive Numeral Systems via Reinforcement Learning,"Jonathan D. Thomas, Andrea Silvi, Devdatt Dubhashi, Emil Carlsson, Moa Johansson","The emergence of mathematical concepts, such as number systems, is an understudied area in AI for mathematics and reasoning. It has previously been shown Carlsson et al. (2021) that by using reinforcement learning (RL), agents can derive simple approximate and exact-restricted numeral systems. However, it is a major challenge to show how more complex recursive numeral systems, similar to the one utilised in English, could arise via a simple learning mechanism such as RL. Here, we introduce an approach towards deriving a mechanistic explanation of the emergence of recursive number systems where we consider an RL agent which directly optimizes a lexicon under a given meta-grammar. Utilising a slightly modified version of the seminal meta-grammar of Hurford (1975), we demonstrate that our RL agent can effectively modify the lexicon towards Pareto-optimal configurations which are comparable to those observed within human numeral systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07170v1,2024-09
A Fine-grained Sentiment Analysis of App Reviews using Large Language Models: An Evaluation Study,"Faiz Ali Shah, Ahmed Sabir, Rajesh Sharma","Analyzing user reviews for sentiment towards app features can provide valuable insights into users' perceptions of app functionality and their evolving needs. Given the volume of user reviews received daily, an automated mechanism to generate feature-level sentiment summaries of user reviews is needed. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown impressive performance on several new tasks without updating the model's parameters i.e. using zero or a few labeled examples. Despite these advancements, LLMs' capabilities to perform feature-specific sentiment analysis of user reviews remain unexplored. This study compares the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and LLama-2-chat variants, for extracting app features and associated sentiments under 0-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot scenarios. Results indicate the best-performing GPT-4 model outperforms rule-based approaches by 23.6% in f1-score with zero-shot feature extraction; 5-shot further improving it by 6%. GPT-4 achieves a 74% f1-score for predicting positive sentiment towards correctly predicted app features, with 5-shot enhancing it by 7%. Our study suggests that LLM models are promising for generating feature-specific sentiment summaries of user reviews.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07162v2,2024-09
Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling,"Yu Zhang, Songlin Yang, Ruijie Zhu, Yue Zhang, Leyang Cui, Yiqiao Wang, Bolun Wang, Freda Shi, Bailin Wang, Wei Bi, Peng Zhou, Guohong Fu","Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via $\operatorname{softmax}$, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the $\operatorname{softmax}$ operation is particularly beneficial in ""finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs"" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07146v2,2024-09
Leveraging Unstructured Text Data for Federated Instruction Tuning of Large Language Models,"Rui Ye, Rui Ge, Yuchi Fengting, Jingyi Chai, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen","Federated instruction tuning enables multiple clients to collaboratively fine-tune a shared large language model (LLM) that can follow humans' instructions without directly sharing raw data. However, existing literature impractically requires that all the clients readily hold instruction-tuning data (i.e., structured instruction-response pairs), which necessitates massive human annotations since clients' data is usually unstructured text instead. Addressing this, we propose a novel and flexible framework FedIT-U2S, which can automatically transform unstructured corpus into structured data for federated instruction tuning. FedIT-U2S consists two key steps: (1) few-shot instruction-tuning data generation, where each unstructured data piece together with several examples is combined to prompt an LLM in generating an instruction-response pair. To further enhance the flexibility, a retrieval-based example selection technique is proposed, where the examples are automatically selected based on the relatedness between the client's data piece and example pool, bypassing the need of determining examples in advance. (2) A typical federated instruction tuning process based on the generated data. Overall, FedIT-U2S can be applied to diverse scenarios as long as the client holds valuable text corpus, broadening the application scope of federated instruction tuning. We conduct a series of experiments on three domains (medicine, knowledge, and math), showing that our proposed FedIT-U2S can consistently and significantly brings improvement over the base LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07136v1,2024-09
LLM-based feature generation from text for interpretable machine learning,"Vojtěch Balek, Lukáš Sýkora, Vilém Sklenák, Tomáš Kliegr","Existing text representations such as embeddings and bag-of-words are not suitable for rule learning due to their high dimensionality and absent or questionable feature-level interpretability. This article explores whether large language models (LLMs) could address this by extracting a small number of interpretable features from text. We demonstrate this process on two datasets (CORD-19 and M17+) containing several thousand scientific articles from multiple disciplines and a target being a proxy for research impact. An evaluation based on testing for the statistically significant correlation with research impact has shown that LLama 2-generated features are semantically meaningful. We consequently used these generated features in text classification to predict the binary target variable representing the citation rate for the CORD-19 dataset and the ordinal 5-class target representing an expert-awarded grade in the M17+ dataset. Machine-learning models trained on the LLM-generated features provided similar predictive performance to the state-of-the-art embedding model SciBERT for scientific text. The LLM used only 62 features compared to 768 features in SciBERT embeddings, and these features were directly interpretable, corresponding to notions such as article methodological rigor, novelty, or grammatical correctness. As the final step, we extract a small number of well-interpretable action rules. Consistently competitive results obtained with the same LLM feature set across both thematically diverse datasets show that this approach generalizes across domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07132v1,2024-09
Reranking Laws for Language Generation: A Communication-Theoretic Perspective,"António Farinhas, Haau-Sing Li, André F. T. Martins","To ensure large language models (LLMs) are used safely, one must reduce their propensity to hallucinate or to generate unacceptable answers. A simple and often used strategy is to first let the LLM generate multiple hypotheses and then employ a reranker to choose the best one. In this paper, we draw a parallel between this strategy and the use of redundancy to decrease the error rate in noisy communication channels. We conceptualize the generator as a sender transmitting multiple descriptions of a message through parallel noisy channels. The receiver decodes the message by ranking the (potentially corrupted) descriptions and selecting the one found to be most reliable. We provide conditions under which this protocol is asymptotically error-free (i.e., yields an acceptable answer almost surely) even in scenarios where the reranker is imperfect (governed by Mallows or Zipf-Mandelbrot models) and the channel distributions are statistically dependent. We use our framework to obtain reranking laws which we validate empirically on two real-world tasks using LLMs: text-to-code generation with DeepSeek-Coder 7B and machine translation of medical data with TowerInstruct 13B.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07131v1,2024-09
Cross-Refine: Improving Natural Language Explanation Generation by Learning in Tandem,"Qianli Wang, Tatiana Anikina, Nils Feldhus, Simon Ostermann, Sebastian Möller, Vera Schmitt","Natural language explanations (NLEs) are vital for elucidating the reasoning behind large language model (LLM) decisions. Many techniques have been developed to generate NLEs using LLMs. However, like humans, LLMs might not always produce optimal NLEs on first attempt. Inspired by human learning processes, we introduce Cross-Refine, which employs role modeling by deploying two LLMs as generator and critic, respectively. The generator outputs a first NLE and then refines this initial explanation using feedback and suggestions provided by the critic. Cross-Refine does not require any supervised training data or additional training. We validate Cross-Refine across three NLP tasks using three state-of-the-art open-source LLMs through automatic and human evaluation. We select Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) as the baseline, which only utilizes self-feedback to refine the explanations. Our findings from automatic evaluation and a user study indicate that Cross-Refine outperforms Self-Refine. Meanwhile, Cross-Refine can perform effectively with less powerful LLMs, whereas Self-Refine only yields strong results with ChatGPT. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to assess the importance of feedback and suggestions. Both of them play an important role in refining explanations. We further evaluate Cross-Refine on a bilingual dataset in English and German.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07123v2,2024-09
Ontology-Free General-Domain Knowledge Graph-to-Text Generation Dataset Synthesis using Large Language Model,"Daehee Kim, Deokhyung Kang, Sangwon Ryu, Gary Geunbae Lee","Knowledge Graph-to-Text (G2T) generation involves verbalizing structured knowledge graphs into natural language text. Recent advancements in Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have improved G2T performance, but their effectiveness depends on datasets with precise graph-text alignment. However, the scarcity of high-quality, general-domain G2T generation datasets restricts progress in the general-domain G2T generation research. To address this issue, we introduce Wikipedia Ontology-Free Graph-text dataset (WikiOFGraph), a new large-scale G2T dataset generated using a novel method that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) and Data-QuestEval. Our new dataset, which contains 5.85M general-domain graph-text pairs, offers high graph-text consistency without relying on external ontologies. Experimental results demonstrate that PLM fine-tuned on WikiOFGraph outperforms those trained on other datasets across various evaluation metrics.

Understanding Knowledge Drift in LLMs through Misinformation,"Alina Fastowski, Gjergji Kasneci","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, making them an integral part of our digital ecosystem. However, their reliability becomes critical, especially when these models are exposed to misinformation. We primarily analyze the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LLMs to factual inaccuracies when they encounter false information in a QnA scenario, an issue that can lead to a phenomenon we refer to as *knowledge drift*, which significantly undermines the trustworthiness of these models. We evaluate the factuality and the uncertainty of the models' responses relying on Entropy, Perplexity, and Token Probability metrics. Our experiments reveal that an LLM's uncertainty can increase up to 56.6% when the question is answered incorrectly due to the exposure to false information. At the same time, repeated exposure to the same false information can decrease the models uncertainty again (-52.8% w.r.t. the answers on the untainted prompts), potentially manipulating the underlying model's beliefs and introducing a drift from its original knowledge. These findings provide insights into LLMs' robustness and vulnerability to adversarial inputs, paving the way for developing more reliable LLM applications across various domains.

Latent Space Interpretation for Stylistic Analysis and Explainable Authorship Attribution,"Milad Alshomary, Narutatsu Ri, Marianna Apidianaki, Ajay Patel, Smaranda Muresan, Kathleen McKeown","Recent state-of-the-art authorship attribution methods learn authorship representations of texts in a latent, non-interpretable space, hindering their usability in real-world applications. Our work proposes a novel approach to interpreting these learned embeddings by identifying representative points in the latent space and utilizing LLMs to generate informative natural language descriptions of the writing style of each point. We evaluate the alignment of our interpretable space with the latent one and find that it achieves the best prediction agreement compared to other baselines. Additionally, we conduct a human evaluation to assess the quality of these style descriptions, validating their utility as explanations for the latent space. Finally, we investigate whether human performance on the challenging AA task improves when aided by our system's explanations, finding an average improvement of around +20% in accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07072v1,2024-09
Automated Speaking Assessment of Conversation Tests with Novel Graph-based Modeling on Spoken Response Coherence,"Jiun-Ting Li, Bi-Cheng Yan, Tien-Hong Lo, Yi-Cheng Wang, Yung-Chang Hsu, Berlin Chen","Automated speaking assessment in conversation tests (ASAC) aims to evaluate the overall speaking proficiency of an L2 (second-language) speaker in a setting where an interlocutor interacts with one or more candidates. Although prior ASAC approaches have shown promising performance on their respective datasets, there is still a dearth of research specifically focused on incorporating the coherence of the logical flow within a conversation into the grading model. To address this critical challenge, we propose a hierarchical graph model that aptly incorporates both broad inter-response interactions (e.g., discourse relations) and nuanced semantic information (e.g., semantic words and speaker intents), which is subsequently fused with contextual information for the final prediction. Extensive experimental results on the NICT-JLE benchmark dataset suggest that our proposed modeling approach can yield considerable improvements in prediction accuracy with respect to various assessment metrics, as compared to some strong baselines. This also sheds light on the importance of investigating coherence-related facets of spoken responses in ASAC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07064v2,2024-09

They form the basis for the determination of court judgments. This paper introduces a novel NLP task: legal fact prediction, which aims to predict the legal fact based on a list of evidence. The predicted facts can instruct the parties and their lawyers involved in a trial to strengthen their submissions and optimize their strategies during the trial. Moreover, since real legal facts are difficult to obtain before the final judgment, the predicted facts also serve as an important basis for legal judgment prediction. We construct a benchmark dataset consisting of evidence lists and ground-truth legal facts for real civil loan cases, LFPLoan.

Native vs Non-Native Language Prompting: A Comparative Analysis,"Mohamed Bayan Kmainasi, Rakif Khan, Ali Ezzat Shahroor, Boushra Bendou, Maram Hasanain, Firoj Alam","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in different fields, including standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. To elicit knowledge from LLMs, prompts play a key role, consisting of natural language instructions. Most open and closed source LLMs are trained on available labeled and unlabeled resources--digital content such as text, images, audio, and videos. Hence, these models have better knowledge for high-resourced languages but struggle with low-resourced languages. Since prompts play a crucial role in understanding their capabilities, the language used for prompts remains an important research question. Although there has been significant research in this area, it is still limited, and less has been explored for medium to low-resourced languages. In this study, we investigate different prompting strategies (native vs. non-native) on 11 different NLP tasks associated with 12 different Arabic datasets (9.7K data points). In total, we conducted 197 experiments involving 3 LLMs, 12 datasets, and 3 prompting strategies.

Beyond IID: Optimizing Instruction Learning from the Perspective of Instruction Interaction and Dependency,"Hanyu Zhao, Li Du, Yiming Ju, Chengwei Wu, Tengfei Pan","With the availability of various instruction datasets, a pivotal challenge is how to effectively select and integrate these instructions to fine-tune large language models (LLMs). Previous research mainly focuses on selecting individual high-quality instructions. However, these works overlooked the joint interactions and dependencies between different categories of instructions, leading to suboptimal selection strategies. Moreover, the nature of these interaction patterns remains largely unexplored, let alone optimize the instruction set with regard to them. To fill these gaps, in this paper, we: (1) systemically investigate interaction and dependency patterns between different categories of instructions, (2) manage to optimize the instruction set concerning the interaction patterns using a linear programming-based method, and optimize the learning schema of SFT using an instruction dependency taxonomy guided curriculum learning. Experimental results across different LLMs demonstrate improved performance over strong baselines on widely adopted benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07045v1,2024-09

Representation Tuning,Christopher M. Ackerman,"Activation engineering is becoming increasingly popular as a means of online control of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we extend the idea of inference-time steering with vectors that represent a behavioral direction of interest to tuning those vectors directly into the model, obviating the need for online control. First, we identify activation vectors related to honesty in an open-source LLM (Llama-2-13b-chat). Next, we demonstrate that model output can be made more or less honest by adding positive or negative multiples of these vectors to residual stream activations during generation. Then, we show that a similar effect can be achieved by fine-tuning the vectors directly into the model, by use of a dual loss function based on the cosine similarity of residual stream activations to the vectors combined with a standard token-based loss (""representation tuning""). Finally, we compare the generations in response to honesty-probing prompts from the resulting models to those from models fine-tuned with a token-based loss alone, and to those from the untuned model subjected to online steering. Overall, fine-tuning the vectors into the models using the cosine similarity plus token loss showed a stronger effect than online steering, and generalized better than using the standard loss, suggesting the potential utility of this approach as a safety measure.

In this work, we introduce a simplified retriever that enhances LLM accuracy by searching the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) for candidate matches using contextual word embeddings from BioBERT without the need for explicit term definitions. Testing this method on terms derived from the clinical synopses of Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), we demonstrate that the normalization accuracy of a state-of-the-art LLM increases from a baseline of 62.3% without augmentation to 90.3% with retriever augmentation. This approach is potentially generalizable to other biomedical term normalization tasks and offers an efficient alternative to more complex retrieval methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13744v1,2024-09
AdaPPA: Adaptive Position Pre-Fill Jailbreak Attack Approach Targeting LLMs,"Lijia Lv, Weigang Zhang, Xuehai Tang, Jie Wen, Feng Liu, Jizhong Han, Songlin Hu","Jailbreak vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) refer to methods that extract malicious content from the model by carefully crafting prompts or suffixes, which has garnered significant attention from the research community. However, traditional attack methods, which primarily focus on the semantic level, are easily detected by the model. These methods overlook the difference in the model's alignment protection capabilities at different output stages. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive position pre-fill jailbreak attack approach for executing jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Our method leverages the model's instruction-following capabilities to first output pre-filled safe content, then exploits its narrative-shifting abilities to generate harmful content. Extensive black-box experiments demonstrate our method can improve the attack success rate by 47% on the widely recognized secure model (Llama2) compared to existing approaches.

BERTScoreVisualizer: A Web Tool for Understanding Simplified Text Evaluation with BERTScore,"Sebastian Jaskowski, Sahasra Chava, Agam Shah","The BERTScore metric is commonly used to evaluate automatic text simplification systems. However, current implementations of the metric fail to provide complete visibility into all information the metric can produce. Notably, the specific token matchings can be incredibly useful in generating clause-level insight into the quality of simplified text. We address this by introducing BERTScoreVisualizer, a web application that goes beyond reporting precision, recall, and F1 score and provides a visualization of the matching between tokens. We believe that our software can help improve the analysis of text simplification systems by specifically showing where generated, simplified text deviates from reference text. We host our code and demo on GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17160v1,2024-09
A Dataset for Evaluating LLM-based Evaluation Functions for Research Question Extraction Task,"Yuya Fujisaki, Shiro Takagi, Hideki Asoh, Wataru Kumagai","The progress in text summarization techniques has been remarkable. However the task of accurately extracting and summarizing necessary information from highly specialized documents such as research papers has not been sufficiently investigated. We are focusing on the task of extracting research questions (RQ) from research papers and construct a new dataset consisting of machine learning papers, RQ extracted from these papers by GPT-4, and human evaluations of the extracted RQ from multiple perspectives. Using this dataset, we systematically compared recently proposed LLM-based evaluation functions for summarizations, and found that none of the functions showed sufficiently high correlations with human evaluations. We expect our dataset provides a foundation for further research on developing better evaluation functions tailored to the RQ extraction task, and contribute to enhance the performance of the task. The dataset is available at https://github.com/auto-res/PaperRQ-HumanAnno-Dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06883v1,2024-09
A Large Dataset of Spontaneous Speech with the Accent Spoken in São Paulo for Automatic Speech Recognition Evaluation,"Rodrigo Lima, Sidney Evaldo Leal, Arnaldo Candido Junior, Sandra Maria Aluísio","We present a freely available spontaneous speech corpus for the Brazilian Portuguese language and report preliminary automatic speech recognition (ASR) results, using both the Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 and Distil-Whisper models fine-tuned and trained on our corpus. The NURC-SP Audio Corpus comprises 401 different speakers (204 females, 197 males) with a total of 239.30 hours of transcribed audio recordings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large Paulistano accented spontaneous speech corpus dedicated to the ASR task in Portuguese. We first present the design and development procedures of the NURC-SP Audio Corpus, and then describe four ASR experiments in detail. The experiments demonstrated promising results for the applicability of the corpus for ASR. Specifically, we fine-tuned two versions of Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 model, trained a Distil-Whisper model using our dataset with labels determined by Whisper Large-V3 model, and fine-tuned this Distil-Whisper model with our corpus. Our best results were the Distil-Whisper fine-tuned over NURC-SP Audio Corpus with a WER of 24.22% followed by a fine-tuned versions of Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53 model with a WER of 33.73%, that is almost 10% point worse than Distil-Whisper's. To enable experiment reproducibility, we share the NURC-SP Audio Corpus dataset, pre-trained models, and training recipes in Hugging-Face and Github repositories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15350v1,2024-09
NSP: A Neuro-Symbolic Natural Language Navigational Planner,"William English, Dominic Simon, Sumit Jha, Rickard Ewetz","Path planners that can interpret free-form natural language instructions hold promise to automate a wide range of robotics applications. These planners simplify user interactions and enable intuitive control over complex semi-autonomous systems. While existing symbolic approaches offer guarantees on the correctness and efficiency, they struggle to parse free-form natural language inputs. Conversely, neural approaches based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) can manage natural language inputs but lack performance guarantees. In this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework for path planning from natural language inputs called NSP. The framework leverages the neural reasoning abilities of LLMs to i) craft symbolic representations of the environment and ii) a symbolic path planning algorithm. Next, a solution to the path planning problem is obtained by executing the algorithm on the environment representation. The framework uses a feedback loop from the symbolic execution environment to the neural generation process to self-correct syntax errors and satisfy execution time constraints. We evaluate our neuro-symbolic approach using a benchmark suite with 1500 path-planning problems. The experimental evaluation shows that our neuro-symbolic approach produces 90.1% valid paths that are on average 19-77% shorter than state-of-the-art neural approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06859v2,2024-09
What is the Role of Small Models in the LLM Era: A Survey,"Lihu Chen, Gaël Varoquaux","Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI), leading to the development of increasingly large models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-405B. However, scaling up model sizes results in exponentially higher computational costs and energy consumption, making these models impractical for academic researchers and businesses with limited resources. At the same time, Small Models (SMs) are frequently used in practical settings, although their significance is currently underestimated. This raises important questions about the role of small models in the era of LLMs, a topic that has received limited attention in prior research. In this work, we systematically examine the relationship between LLMs and SMs from two key perspectives: Collaboration and Competition. We hope this survey provides valuable insights for practitioners, fostering a deeper understanding of the contribution of small models and promoting more efficient use of computational resources.

PingPong: A Benchmark for Role-Playing Language Models with User Emulation and Multi-Model Evaluation,Ilya Gusev,"We introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the role-playing capabilities of language models. Our approach leverages language models themselves to emulate users in dynamic, multi-turn conversations and to assess the resulting dialogues. The framework consists of three main components: a player model assuming a specific character role, an interrogator model simulating user behavior, and a judge model evaluating conversation quality. We conducted experiments comparing automated evaluations with human annotations to validate our approach, demonstrating strong correlations across multiple criteria. This work provides a foundation for a robust and dynamic evaluation of model capabilities in interactive scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06820v1,2024-09
Decomposition of surprisal: Unified computational model of ERP components in language processing,"Jiaxuan Li, Richard Futrell","The functional interpretation of language-related ERP components has been a central debate in psycholinguistics for decades. We advance an information-theoretic model of human language processing in the brain in which incoming linguistic input is processed at first shallowly and later with more depth, with these two kinds of information processing corresponding to distinct electroencephalographic signatures. Formally, we show that the information content (surprisal) of a word in context can be decomposed into two quantities: (A) shallow surprisal, which signals shallow processing difficulty for a word, and corresponds with the N400 signal; and (B) deep surprisal, which reflects the discrepancy between shallow and deep representations, and corresponds to the P600 signal and other late positivities. Both of these quantities can be estimated straightforwardly using modern NLP models. We validate our theory by successfully simulating ERP patterns elicited by a variety of linguistic manipulations in previously-reported experimental data from six experiments, with successful novel qualitative and quantitative predictions. Our theory is compatible with traditional cognitive theories assuming a `good-enough' shallow representation stage, but with a precise information-theoretic formulation. The model provides an information-theoretic model of ERP components grounded on cognitive processes, and brings us closer to a fully-specified neuro-computational model of language processing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06803v2,2024-09
Translating Step-by-Step: Decomposing the Translation Process for Improved Translation Quality of Long-Form Texts,"Eleftheria Briakou, Jiaming Luo, Colin Cherry, Markus Freitag","In this paper we present a step-by-step approach to long-form text translation, drawing on established processes in translation studies. Instead of viewing machine translation as a single, monolithic task, we propose a framework that engages language models in a multi-turn interaction, encompassing pre-translation research, drafting, refining, and proofreading, resulting in progressively improved translations. Extensive automatic evaluations using Gemini 1.5 Pro across ten language pairs show that translating step-by-step yields large translation quality improvements over conventional zero-shot prompting approaches and earlier human-like baseline strategies, resulting in state-of-the-art results on WMT2024.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06790v1,2024-09
Geometric-Averaged Preference Optimization for Soft Preference Labels,"Hiroki Furuta, Kuang-Huei Lee, Shixiang Shane Gu, Yutaka Matsuo, Aleksandra Faust, Heiga Zen, Izzeddin Gur","Many algorithms for aligning LLMs with human preferences assume that human preferences are binary and deterministic. However, human preferences can vary across individuals, and therefore should be represented distributionally. In this work, we introduce the distributional soft preference labels and improve Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a weighted geometric average of the LLM output likelihood in the loss function. This approach adjusts the scale of learning loss based on the soft labels such that the loss would approach zero when the responses are closer to equally preferred. This simple modification can be easily applied to any DPO-based methods and mitigate over-optimization and objective mismatch, which prior works suffer from. Our experiments simulate the soft preference labels with AI feedback from LLMs and demonstrate that geometric averaging consistently improves performance on standard benchmarks for alignment research. In particular, we observe more preferable responses than binary labels and significant improvements where modestly-confident labels are in the majority.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06691v3,2024-09
Knowing When to Ask -- Bridging Large Language Models and Data,"Prashanth Radhakrishnan, Jennifer Chen, Bo Xu, Prem Ramaswami, Hannah Pho, Adriana Olmos, James Manyika, R. V. Guha","Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating factually incorrect information when responding to queries that involve numerical and statistical data or other timely facts. In this paper, we present an approach for enhancing the accuracy of LLMs by integrating them with Data Commons, a vast, open-source repository of public statistics from trusted organizations like the United Nations (UN), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and global census bureaus. We explore two primary methods: Retrieval Interleaved Generation (RIG), where the LLM is trained to produce natural language queries to retrieve data from Data Commons, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where relevant data tables are fetched from Data Commons and used to augment the LLM's prompt. We evaluate these methods on a diverse set of queries, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving the factual accuracy of LLM outputs. Our work represents an early step towards building more trustworthy and reliable LLMs that are grounded in verifiable statistical data and capable of complex factual reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13741v1,2024-09
E2LLM: Encoder Elongated Large Language Models for Long-Context Understanding and Reasoning,"Zihan Liao, Jun Wang, Hang Yu, Lingxiao Wei, Jianguo Li, Jun Wang, Wei Zhang","In the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), the ability to process long contexts is increasingly crucial for tasks such as multi-round dialogues, code generation, and document summarization. This paper addresses the challenges of enhancing the long-context performance, reducing computational complexity, and leveraging pretrained models collectively termed the ""impossible triangle."" We introduce E2LLM (Encoder Elongated Large Language Models), a novel approach that effectively navigates this paradox. The method involves splitting long contexts into chunks, compressing each into embedding vectors via a pretrained text encoder, and utilizing an adapter to align these representations with a decoder-only LLM. Two training objectives, focusing on reconstruction of the encoder output and long-context instruction fine-tuning, are employed to facilitate the understanding of soft prompts by the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that E2LLM achieves superior performance in long-context scenarios while balancing efficiency, performance, and compatibility with pretrained models. Our framework thus represents a significant advancement in the field, contributing to effective long-text modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06679v1,2024-09
LLaMA-Omni: Seamless Speech Interaction with Large Language Models,"Qingkai Fang, Shoutao Guo, Yan Zhou, Zhengrui Ma, Shaolei Zhang, Yang Feng","Models like GPT-4o enable real-time interaction with large language models (LLMs) through speech, significantly enhancing user experience compared to traditional text-based interaction. However, there is still a lack of exploration on how to build speech interaction models based on open-source LLMs. To address this, we propose LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture designed for low-latency and high-quality speech interaction with LLMs. LLaMA-Omni integrates a pretrained speech encoder, a speech adaptor, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder. It eliminates the need for speech transcription, and can simultaneously generate text and speech responses directly from speech instructions with extremely low latency. We build our model based on the latest Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. To align the model with speech interaction scenarios, we construct a dataset named InstructS2S-200K, which includes 200K speech instructions and corresponding speech responses. Experimental results show that compared to previous speech-language models, LLaMA-Omni provides better responses in both content and style, with a response latency as low as 226ms. Additionally, training LLaMA-Omni takes less than 3 days on just 4 GPUs, paving the way for the efficient development of speech-language models in the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06666v1,2024-09
Sortformer: Seamless Integration of Speaker Diarization and ASR by Bridging Timestamps and Tokens,"Taejin Park, Ivan Medennikov, Kunal Dhawan, Weiqing Wang, He Huang, Nithin Rao Koluguri, Krishna C. Puvvada, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg","We propose Sortformer, a novel neural model for speaker diarization, trained with unconventional objectives compared to existing end-to-end diarization models. The permutation problem in speaker diarization has long been regarded as a critical challenge. Most prior end-to-end diarization systems employ permutation invariant loss (PIL), which optimizes for the permutation that yields the lowest error. In contrast, we introduce Sort Loss, which enables a diarization model to autonomously resolve permutation, with or without PIL. We demonstrate that combining Sort Loss and PIL achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end diarization models trained exclusively with PIL. Crucially, we present a streamlined multispeaker ASR architecture that leverages Sortformer as a speaker supervision model, embedding speaker label estimation within the ASR encoder state using a sinusoidal kernel function. This approach resolves the speaker permutation problem through sorted objectives, effectively bridging speaker-label timestamps and speaker tokens. In our experiments, we show that the proposed multispeaker ASR architecture, enhanced with speaker supervision, improves performance via adapter techniques. Code and trained models will be made publicly available via the NVIDIA NeMo framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06656v2,2024-09
TeXBLEU: Automatic Metric for Evaluate LaTeX Format,"Kyudan Jung, Nam-Joon Kim, Hyongon Ryu, Sieun Hyeon, Seung-jun Lee, Hyeok-jae Lee","LaTeX is suitable for creating specially formatted documents in science, technology, mathematics, and computer science. Although the use of mathematical expressions in LaTeX format along with language models is increasing, there are no proper evaluation matrices to evaluate them. In this study, we propose TeXBLEU, a metric for evaluating mathematical expressions in the LaTeX format built on the n-gram-based BLEU metric widely used in translation tasks. The proposed TeXBLEU consists of a predefined tokenizer trained on the arXiv paper dataset and a fine-tuned embedding model with positional encoding. The TeXBLEU score was calculated by replacing BLUE's modified precision score with the similarity of n-gram-based tokens. TeXBLEU showed improvements of 86\%, 121\%, and 610\% over traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, sacreBLEU, and Rouge, respectively, on the MathBridge dataset with 1,000 data points.

MoWE-Audio: Multitask AudioLLMs with Mixture of Weak Encoders,"Wenyu Zhang, Shuo Sun, Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Zhuohan Liu, Yingxu He, Geyu Lin, Nancy F. Chen, Ai Ti Aw","The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, facilitating the development of AudioLLMs that process and understand speech and audio inputs alongside text. Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06635v2,2024-09
Language agents achieve superhuman synthesis of scientific knowledge,"Michael D. Skarlinski, Sam Cox, Jon M. Laurent, James D. Braza, Michaela Hinks, Michael J. Hammerling, Manvitha Ponnapati, Samuel G. Rodriques, Andrew D. White","Language models are known to hallucinate incorrect information, and it is unclear if they are sufficiently accurate and reliable for use in scientific research. We developed a rigorous human-AI comparison methodology to evaluate language model agents on real-world literature search tasks covering information retrieval, summarization, and contradiction detection tasks. We show that PaperQA2, a frontier language model agent optimized for improved factuality, matches or exceeds subject matter expert performance on three realistic literature research tasks without any restrictions on humans (i.e., full access to internet, search tools, and time). PaperQA2 writes cited, Wikipedia-style summaries of scientific topics that are significantly more accurate than existing, human-written Wikipedia articles. We also introduce a hard benchmark for scientific literature research called LitQA2 that guided design of PaperQA2, leading to it exceeding human performance. Finally, we apply PaperQA2 to identify contradictions within the scientific literature, an important scientific task that is challenging for humans. PaperQA2 identifies 2.34 +/- 1.99 contradictions per paper in a random subset of biology papers, of which 70% are validated by human experts. These results demonstrate that language model agents are now capable of exceeding domain experts across meaningful tasks on scientific literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13740v2,2024-09
A Practice of Post-Training on Llama-3 70B with Optimal Selection of Additional Language Mixture Ratio,"Ningyuan Xi, Yetao Wu, Kun Fan, Teng Chen, Qingqing Gu, Peng Yu, Jinxian Qu, Chenxi Liu, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji","Large Language Models (LLM) often needs to be Continual Pre-Trained (CPT) to obtain the unfamiliar language skill or adapt into new domains. The huge training cost of CPT often asks for cautious choice of key hyper-parameters such as the mixture ratio of extra language or domain corpus. However, there is no systematic study which bridge the gap between the optimal mixture ratio and the actual model performance, and the gap between experimental scaling law and the actual deployment in the full model size. In this paper, we perform CPT on Llama-3 8B and 70B to enhance its Chinese ability. We study the optimal correlation between the Additional Language Mixture Ratio (ALMR) and the Learning Rate (LR) on the 8B size which directly indicate the optimal experimental set up. By thorough choice of hyper-parameter, and subsequent fine-tuning, the model capability is improved not only on the Chinese-related benchmark, but also some specific domains including math, coding and emotional intelligence. We deploy the final 70B version of LLM on an real-life chat system which obtain satisfying performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06624v1,2024-09
Exploring Italian sentence embeddings properties through multi-tasking,"Vivi Nastase, Giuseppe Samo, Chunyang Jiang, Paola Merlo","We investigate to what degree existing LLMs encode abstract linguistic information in Italian in a multi-task setting. We exploit curated synthetic data on a large scale -- several Blackbird Language Matrices (BLMs) problems in Italian -- and use them to study how sentence representations built using pre-trained language models encode specific syntactic and semantic information. We use a two-level architecture to model separately a compression of the sentence embeddings into a representation that contains relevant information for a task, and a BLM task. We then investigate whether we can obtain compressed sentence representations that encode syntactic and semantic information relevant to several BLM tasks. While we expected that the sentence structure -- in terms of sequence of phrases/chunks -- and chunk properties could be shared across tasks, performance and error analysis show that the clues for the different tasks are encoded in different manners in the sentence embeddings, suggesting that abstract linguistic notions such as constituents or thematic roles does not seem to be present in the pretrained sentence embeddings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06622v2,2024-09
Alleviating Hallucinations in Large Language Models with Scepticism Modeling,"Yetao Wu, Yihong Wang, Teng Chen, Chenxi Liu, Ningyuan Xi, Qingqing Gu, Hongyang Lei, Zhonglin Jiang, Yong Chen, Luo Ji","Hallucinations is a major challenge for large language models (LLMs), prevents adoption in diverse fields. Uncertainty estimation could be used for alleviating the damages of hallucinations. The skeptical emotion of human could be useful for enhancing the ability of self estimation. Inspirited by this observation, we proposed a new approach called Skepticism Modeling (SM). This approach is formalized by combining the information of token and logits for self estimation. We construct the doubt emotion aware data, perform continual pre-training, and then fine-tune the LLMs, improve their ability of self estimation. Experimental results demonstrate this new approach effectively enhances a model's ability to estimate their uncertainty, and validate its generalization ability of other tasks by out-of-domain experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06601v1,2024-09
GroUSE: A Benchmark to Evaluate Evaluators in Grounded Question Answering,"Sacha Muller, António Loison, Bilel Omrani, Gautier Viaud","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a common paradigm to use Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside private and up-to-date knowledge bases. In this work, we address the challenges of using LLM-as-a-Judge when evaluating grounded answers generated by RAG systems. To assess the calibration and discrimination capabilities of judge models, we identify 7 generator failure modes and introduce GroUSE (Grounded QA Unitary Scoring of Evaluators), a meta-evaluation benchmark of 144 unit tests. This benchmark reveals that existing automated RAG evaluation frameworks often overlook important failure modes, even when using GPT-4 as a judge.   To improve on the current design of automated RAG evaluation frameworks, we propose a novel pipeline and find that while closed models perform well on GroUSE, state-of-the-art open-source judges do not generalize to our proposed criteria, despite strong correlation with GPT-4's judgement. Our findings suggest that correlation with GPT-4 is an incomplete proxy for the practical performance of judge models and should be supplemented with evaluations on unit tests for precise failure mode detection.   We further show that finetuning Llama-3 on GPT-4's reasoning traces significantly boosts its evaluation capabilities, improving upon both correlation with GPT-4's evaluations and calibration on reference situations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06595v1,2024-09
Table-to-Text Generation with Pretrained Diffusion Models,"Aleksei S. Krylov, Oleg D. Somov","Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential in achieving state-of-the-art performance across various text generation tasks. In this systematic study, we investigate their application to the table-to-text problem by adapting the diffusion model to the task and conducting an in-depth analysis. Our experiments cover multiple aspects of diffusion models training. We explore sampling strategy influence by inducing recent diffusion model accelerator DPM-Solver++ into our core model. We have tested different prediction aggregation methods, like ROVER and Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR). Our studies cover the impact of the pre-training phase in diffusion models and the generation length constraints influence. We also have compared diffusion model generation with auto-regressive text-to-text models with different temperature settings for diversity evaluation. Our key observation is that diffusion models demonstrate the balance between quality and diversity while auto-regressive text-to-text models are not successful at handling both at the same time. Furthermore, we found out that to achieve the highest quality possible, it is preferable to use a regular sampler with the strictest length constraint to create multiple samples, and then use MBR to aggregate the predictions. However, if you are prepared to give up high level of diversity and to accelerate the process, you can also utilize a fast sampler DPM-Solver++. Our findings reveal that diffusion models achieve comparable results in the table-to-text domain, highlighting their viability in the table-to-text challenge as a promising research direction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13739v1,2024-09

Exploring syntactic information in sentence embeddings through multilingual subject-verb agreement,"Vivi Nastase, Chunyang Jiang, Giuseppe Samo, Paola Merlo","In this paper, our goal is to investigate to what degree multilingual pretrained language models capture cross-linguistically valid abstract linguistic representations. We take the approach of developing curated synthetic data on a large scale, with specific properties, and using them to study sentence representations built using pretrained language models. We use a new multiple-choice task and datasets, Blackbird Language Matrices (BLMs), to focus on a specific grammatical structural phenomenon -- subject-verb agreement across a variety of sentence structures -- in several languages. Finding a solution to this task requires a system detecting complex linguistic patterns and paradigms in text representations. Using a two-level architecture that solves the problem in two steps -- detect syntactic objects and their properties in individual sentences, and find patterns across an input sequence of sentences -- we show that despite having been trained on multilingual texts in a consistent manner, multilingual pretrained language models have language-specific differences, and syntactic structure is not shared, even across closely related languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06567v2,2024-09
From LIMA to DeepLIMA: following a new path of interoperability,"Victor Bocharov, Romaric Besançon, Gaël de Chalendar, Olivier Ferret, Nasredine Semmar","In this article, we describe the architecture of the LIMA (Libre Multilingual Analyzer) framework and its recent evolution with the addition of new text analysis modules based on deep neural networks. We extended the functionality of LIMA in terms of the number of supported languages while preserving existing configurable architecture and the availability of previously developed rule-based and statistical analysis components. Models were trained for more than 60 languages on the Universal Dependencies 2.5 corpora, WikiNer corpora, and CoNLL-03 dataset. Universal Dependencies allowed us to increase the number of supported languages and to generate models that could be integrated into other platforms.

Mapping News Narratives Using LLMs and Narrative-Structured Text Embeddings,Jan Elfes,"Given the profound impact of narratives across various societal levels, from personal identities to international politics, it is crucial to understand their distribution and development over time. This is particularly important in online spaces. On the Web, narratives can spread rapidly and intensify societal divides and conflicts. While many qualitative approaches exist, quantifying narratives remains a significant challenge. Computational narrative analysis lacks frameworks that are both comprehensive and generalizable. To address this gap, we introduce a numerical narrative representation grounded in structuralist linguistic theory. Chiefly, Greimas' Actantial Model represents a narrative through a constellation of six functional character roles. These so-called actants are genre-agnostic, making the model highly generalizable. We extract the actants using an open-source LLM and integrate them into a Narrative-Structured Text Embedding that captures both the semantics and narrative structure of a text. We demonstrate the analytical insights of the method on the example of 5000 full-text news articles from Al Jazeera and The Washington Post on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Our method successfully distinguishes articles that cover the same topics but differ in narrative structure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06540v1,2024-09
Questioning Internal Knowledge Structure of Large Language Models Through the Lens of the Olympic Games,"Juhwan Choi, YoungBin Kim","Large language models (LLMs) have become a dominant approach in natural language processing, yet their internal knowledge structures remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the internal knowledge structures of LLMs using historical medal tallies from the Olympic Games. We task the models with providing the medal counts for each team and identifying which teams achieved specific rankings. Our results reveal that while state-of-the-art LLMs perform remarkably well in reporting medal counts for individual teams, they struggle significantly with questions about specific rankings. This suggests that the internal knowledge structures of LLMs are fundamentally different from those of humans, who can easily infer rankings from known medal counts. To support further research, we publicly release our code, dataset, and model outputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06518v1,2024-09
An Effective Context-Balanced Adaptation Approach for Long-Tailed Speech Recognition,"Yi-Cheng Wang, Li-Ting Pai, Bi-Cheng Yan, Hsin-Wei Wang, Chi-Han Lin, Berlin Chen","End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have become standard practice for various commercial applications. However, in real-world scenarios, the long-tailed nature of word distribution often leads E2E ASR models to perform well on common words but fall short in recognizing uncommon ones. Recently, the notion of a contextual adapter (CA) was proposed to infuse external knowledge represented by a context word list into E2E ASR models. Although CA can improve recognition performance on rare words, two crucial data imbalance problems remain. First, when using low-frequency words as context words during training, since these words rarely occur in the utterance, CA becomes prone to overfit on attending to the <no-context> token due to higher-frequency words not being present in the context list. Second, the long-tailed distribution within the context list itself still causes the model to perform poorly on low-frequency context words. In light of this, we explore in-depth the impact of altering the context list to have words with different frequency distributions on model performance, and meanwhile extend CA with a simple yet effective context-balanced learning objective. A series of experiments conducted on the AISHELL-1 benchmark dataset suggests that using all vocabulary words from the training corpus as the context list and pairing them with our balanced objective yields the best performance, demonstrating a significant reduction in character error rate (CER) by up to 1.21% and a more pronounced 9.44% reduction in the error rate of zero-shot words.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06468v1,2024-09
HexaCoder: Secure Code Generation via Oracle-Guided Synthetic Training Data,"Hossein Hajipour, Lea Schönherr, Thorsten Holz, Mario Fritz","Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for automatic code generation and form the basis for various tools such as GitHub Copilot. However, recent studies highlight that many LLM-generated code contains serious security vulnerabilities. While previous work tries to address this by training models that generate secure code, these attempts remain constrained by limited access to training data and labor-intensive data preparation.   In this paper, we introduce HexaCoder, a novel approach to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate secure codes by automatically synthesizing secure codes, which reduces the effort of finding suitable training data. HexaCoder comprises two key components: an oracle-guided data synthesis pipeline and a two-step process for secure code generation. The data synthesis pipeline generates pairs of vulnerable and fixed codes for specific Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types by utilizing a state-of-the-art LLM for repairing vulnerable code. A security oracle identifies vulnerabilities, and a state-of-the-art LLM repairs them by extending and/or editing the codes, creating data pairs for fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method. Each example of our fine-tuning dataset includes the necessary security-related libraries and code that form the basis of our novel two-step generation approach. This allows the model to integrate security-relevant libraries before generating the main code, significantly reducing the number of generated vulnerable codes by up to 85% compared to the baseline methods. We perform extensive evaluations on three different benchmarks for four LLMs, demonstrating that HexaCoder not only improves the security of the generated code but also maintains a high level of functional correctness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06446v1,2024-09
Fine-tuning and Prompt Engineering with Cognitive Knowledge Graphs for Scholarly Knowledge Organization,"Gollam Rabby, Sören Auer, Jennifer D'Souza, Allard Oelen","The increasing amount of published scholarly articles, exceeding 2.5 million yearly, raises the challenge for researchers in following scientific progress. Integrating the contributions from scholarly articles into a novel type of cognitive knowledge graph (CKG) will be a crucial element for accessing and organizing scholarly knowledge, surpassing the insights provided by titles and abstracts. This research focuses on effectively conveying structured scholarly knowledge by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to categorize scholarly articles and describe their contributions in a structured and comparable manner. While previous studies explored language models within specific research domains, the extensive domain-independent knowledge captured by LLMs offers a substantial opportunity for generating structured contribution descriptions as CKGs. Additionally, LLMs offer customizable pathways through prompt engineering or fine-tuning, thus facilitating to leveraging of smaller LLMs known for their efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental considerations. Our methodology involves harnessing LLM knowledge, and complementing it with domain expert-verified scholarly data sourced from a CKG. This strategic fusion significantly enhances LLM performance, especially in tasks like scholarly article categorization and predicate recommendation. Our method involves fine-tuning LLMs with CKG knowledge and additionally injecting knowledge from a CKG with a novel prompting technique significantly increasing the accuracy of scholarly knowledge extraction. We integrated our approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), thus enabling precise access to organized scholarly knowledge, crucially benefiting domain-independent scholarly knowledge exchange and dissemination among policymakers, industrial practitioners, and the general public.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06433v1,2024-09
How Redundant Is the Transformer Stack in Speech Representation Models?,"Teresa Dorszewski, Albert Kjøller Jacobsen, Lenka Tětková, Lars Kai Hansen","Self-supervised speech representation models, particularly those leveraging transformer architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks such as speech recognition, speaker identification, and emotion detection. Recent studies on transformer models revealed a high redundancy between layers and the potential for significant pruning, which we will investigate here for transformer-based speech representation models. We perform a detailed analysis of layer similarity in speech representation models using three similarity metrics: cosine similarity, centered kernel alignment, and mutual nearest-neighbor alignment. Our findings reveal a block-like structure of high similarity, suggesting two main processing steps and significant redundancy of layers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of pruning transformer-based speech representation models without the need for post-training, achieving up to 40% reduction in transformer layers while maintaining over 95% of the model's predictive capacity. Furthermore, we employ a knowledge distillation method to substitute the entire transformer stack with mimicking layers, reducing the network size 95-98% and the inference time by up to 94%. This substantial decrease in computational load occurs without considerable performance loss, suggesting that the transformer stack is almost completely redundant for downstream applications of speech representation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16302v1,2024-09
Length Desensitization in Direct Preference Optimization,"Wei Liu, Yang Bai, Chengcheng Han, Rongxiang Weng, Jun Xu, Xuezhi Cao, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai","Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely utilized in the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) phase to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, thereby enhancing both their harmlessness and efficacy. However, it has been observed that DPO tends to over-optimize for verbosity, which can detrimentally affect both performance and user experience. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth theoretical analysis of DPO's optimization objective and reveal a strong correlation between its implicit reward and data length. This correlation misguides the optimization direction, resulting in length sensitivity during the DPO training and leading to verbosity. To address this issue, we propose a length-desensitization improvement method for DPO, termed LD-DPO. The proposed method aims to desensitize DPO to data length by decoupling explicit length preference, which is relatively insignificant, from the other implicit preferences, thereby enabling more effective learning of the intrinsic preferences. We utilized two settings (Base and Instruct) of Llama2-13B, Llama3-8B, and Qwen2-7B for experimental validation on various benchmarks including MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2. The experimental results indicate that LD-DPO consistently outperforms DPO and other baseline methods, achieving more concise responses with a 10-40% reduction in length compared to DPO. We conducted in-depth experimental analyses to demonstrate that LD-DPO can indeed achieve length desensitization and align the model more closely with human-like preferences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06411v2,2024-09
Coarse-Grained Sense Inventories Based on Semantic Matching between English Dictionaries,"Masato Kikuchi, Masatsugu Ono, Toshioki Soga, Tetsu Tanabe, Tadachika Ozono","WordNet is one of the largest handcrafted concept dictionaries visualizing word connections through semantic relationships. It is widely used as a word sense inventory in natural language processing tasks. However, WordNet's fine-grained senses have been criticized for limiting its usability. In this paper, we semantically match sense definitions from Cambridge dictionaries and WordNet and develop new coarse-grained sense inventories. We verify the effectiveness of our inventories by comparing their semantic coherences with that of Coarse Sense Inventory. The advantages of the proposed inventories include their low dependency on large-scale resources, better aggregation of closely related senses, CEFR-level assignments, and ease of expansion and improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06386v1,2024-09
Enhancing Sequential Recommendations through Multi-Perspective Reflections and Iteration,"Weicong Qin, Yi Xu, Weijie Yu, Chenglei Shen, Xiao Zhang, Ming He, Jianping Fan, Jun Xu","Sequence recommendation (SeqRec) aims to predict the next item a user will interact with by understanding user intentions and leveraging collaborative filtering information. Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise in recommendation tasks through prompt-based, fixed reflection libraries, and fine-tuning techniques. However, these methods face challenges, including lack of supervision, inability to optimize reflection sources, inflexibility to diverse user needs, and high computational costs. Despite promising results, current studies primarily focus on reflections of users' explicit preferences (e.g., item titles) while neglecting implicit preferences (e.g., brands) and collaborative filtering information. This oversight hinders the capture of preference shifts and dynamic user behaviors. Additionally, existing approaches lack mechanisms for reflection evaluation and iteration, often leading to suboptimal recommendations. To address these issues, we propose the Mixture of REflectors (MoRE) framework, designed to model and learn dynamic user preferences in SeqRec. Specifically, MoRE introduces three reflectors for generating LLM-based reflections on explicit preferences, implicit preferences, and collaborative signals. Each reflector incorporates a self-improving strategy, termed refining-and-iteration, to evaluate and iteratively update reflections. Furthermore, a meta-reflector employs a contextual bandit algorithm to select the most suitable expert and corresponding reflections for each user's recommendation, effectively capturing dynamic preferences. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MoRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, requiring less training time and GPU memory compared to other LLM-based approaches in SeqRec.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06377v1,2024-09
SpeechTaxi: On Multilingual Semantic Speech Classification,"Lennart Keller, Goran Glavaš","Recent advancements in multilingual speech encoding as well as transcription raise the question of the most effective approach to semantic speech classification. Concretely, can (1) end-to-end (E2E) classifiers obtained by fine-tuning state-of-the-art multilingual speech encoders (MSEs) match or surpass the performance of (2) cascading (CA), where speech is first transcribed into text and classification is delegated to a text-based classifier. To answer this, we first construct SpeechTaxi, an 80-hour multilingual dataset for semantic speech classification of Bible verses, covering 28 diverse languages. We then leverage SpeechTaxi to conduct a wide range of experiments comparing E2E and CA in monolingual semantic speech classification as well as in cross-lingual transfer. We find that E2E based on MSEs outperforms CA in monolingual setups, i.e., when trained on in-language data. However, MSEs seem to have poor cross-lingual transfer abilities, with E2E substantially lagging CA both in (1) zero-shot transfer to languages unseen in training and (2) multilingual training, i.e., joint training on multiple languages. Finally, we devise a novel CA approach based on transcription to Romanized text as a language-agnostic intermediate representation and show that it represents a robust solution for languages without native ASR support. Our SpeechTaxi dataset is publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/ datasets/LennartKeller/SpeechTaxi/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06372v1,2024-09
Retrieval Or Holistic Understanding? Dolce: Differentiate Our Long Context Evaluation Tasks,Zi Yang,"We argue that there are two major distinct capabilities in long context understanding: retrieval and holistic understanding. Understanding and further improving LLMs' long context capabilities would not be possible without knowing the tasks' focus categories. We aim to automatically identify retrieval focused and holistic understanding focused problems from suites of benchmarks and quantitatively measure the difficulty within each focus. In this paper, we present the Dolce framework, which parameterizes each problem by $\lambda$ (complexity) and $k$ (redundancy) and assigns to one of five predefined focus categories. We propose to sample short contexts from the full context and estimate the probability an LLM solves the problem using the sampled spans. To find the $\lambda$ and $k$ for each problem, we further propose a mixture model of a non-parametric background noise component and a parametric/non-parametric hybrid oracle component, where we derive the probability functions parameterized by $\lambda$ and $k$ for both the correct-or-wrong (COW) scenario and the partial-point-in-grading (PIG) scenario. Our proposed methods can identify 0% to 67% of the problems are retrieval focused and 0% to 90% of the problems are holistic understanding focused across 44 existing long context evaluation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06338v1,2024-09

This study investigates the degree to which these models decide the content of a paragraph at its onset, shedding light on their contextual understanding.

Enhancing Kurdish Text-to-Speech with Native Corpus Training: A High-Quality WaveGlow Vocoder Approach,"Abdulhady Abas Abdullah, Sabat Salih Muhamad, Hadi Veisi","The ability to synthesize spoken language from text has greatly facilitated access to digital content with the advances in text-to-speech technology. However, effective TTS development for low-resource languages, such as Central Kurdish (CKB), still faces many challenges due mainly to the lack of linguistic information and dedicated resources. In this paper, we improve the Kurdish TTS system based on Tacotron by training the Kurdish WaveGlow vocoder on a 21-hour central Kurdish speech corpus instead of using a pre-trained English vocoder WaveGlow. Vocoder training on the target language corpus is required to accurately and fluently adapt phonetic and prosodic changes in Kurdish language. The effectiveness of these enhancements is that our model is significantly better than the baseline system with English pretrained models. In particular, our adaptive WaveGlow model achieves an impressive MOS of 4.91, which sets a new benchmark for Kurdish speech synthesis. On one hand, this study empowers the advanced features of the TTS system for Central Kurdish, and on the other hand, it opens the doors for other dialects in Kurdish and other related languages to further develop.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13734v2,2024-09
RNR: Teaching Large Language Models to Follow Roles and Rules,"Kuan Wang, Alexander Bukharin, Haoming Jiang, Qingyu Yin, Zhengyang Wang, Tuo Zhao, Jingbo Shang, Chao Zhang, Bing Yin, Xian Li, Jianshu Chen, Shiyang Li","Instruction fine-tuning (IFT) elicits instruction following capabilities and steers the behavior of large language models (LLMs) via supervised learning. However, existing models trained on open-source IFT datasets only have the ability to follow instructions from users, and often fail to follow complex role and rules specified by developers, a.k.a. system prompts. The ability to follow these roles and rules is essential for deployment, as it ensures that the model safely interacts with users within developer defined guidelines. To improve such role and rule following ability, we propose \model, an automated data generation pipeline that generates diverse roles and rules from existing IFT instructions, along with corresponding responses. This data can then be used to train models that follow complex system prompts. The models are evaluated on our newly created benchmarks for role and rule following ability, as well as standard instruction-following benchmarks and general NLP tasks. Our framework significantly improves role and rule following capability in LLMs, as evidenced by over 25% increase in pass-rate on rule adherence, i.e. following all requirements, in our experiments with the Alpaca and Ultrachat datasets. Moreover, our models achieves this increase without any regression on popular instruction following benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13733v1,2024-09
Enhancing Large Language Models with Domain-Specific Knowledge: The Case in Topological Materials,"HuangChao Xu, Baohua Zhang, Zhong Jin, Tiannian Zhu, Quansheng Wu, Hongming Weng","Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive performance in the text generation task, showing the ability to understand and respond to complex instructions. However, the performance of naive LLMs in speciffc domains is limited due to the scarcity of domain-speciffc corpora and specialized training. Moreover, training a specialized large-scale model necessitates signiffcant hardware resources, which restricts researchers from leveraging such models to drive advances. Hence, it is crucial to further improve and optimize LLMs to meet speciffc domain demands and enhance their scalability. Based on the condensed matter data center, we establish a material knowledge graph (MaterialsKG) and integrate it with literature. Using large language models and prompt learning, we develop a specialized dialogue system for topological materials called TopoChat. Compared to naive LLMs, TopoChat exhibits superior performance in structural and property querying, material recommendation, and complex relational reasoning.

This framework automates the retrieval, summarization, and clustering of academic literature within a specific research domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce CyLit, an NLP-powered repository specifically designed for the cyber risk literature. CyLit empowers researchers by providing access to context-specific resources and enabling the tracking of trends in the dynamic and rapidly evolving field of cyber risk. Through the automatic processing of large volumes of data, our NLP-powered solution significantly enhances the efficiency and specificity of academic literature searches.

Enhancing Temporal Understanding in Audio Question Answering for Large Audio Language Models,"Arvind Krishna Sridhar, Yinyi Guo, Erik Visser","The Audio Question Answering (AQA) task includes audio event classification, audio captioning, and open-ended reasoning. Recently, AQA has garnered attention due to the advent of Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). Current literature focuses on constructing LALMs by integrating audio encoders with text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) through a projection module. While LALMs excel in general audio understanding, they are limited in temporal reasoning, which may hinder their commercial applications and on-device deployment. This paper addresses these challenges and limitations in audio temporal reasoning. First, we introduce a data augmentation technique for generating reliable audio temporal questions and answers using an LLM. Second, we perform a further fine-tuning of an existing baseline using curriculum learning strategy to specialize in temporal reasoning without compromising performance on fine-tuned tasks.

Advancing Topic Segmentation of Broadcasted Speech with Multilingual Semantic Embeddings,"Sakshi Deo Shukla, Pavel Denisov, Tugtekin Turan","Recent advancements in speech-based topic segmentation have highlighted the potential of pretrained speech encoders to capture semantic representations directly from speech. Traditionally, topic segmentation has relied on a pipeline approach in which transcripts of the automatic speech recognition systems are generated, followed by text-based segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end scheme that bypasses this conventional two-step process by directly employing semantic speech encoders for segmentation. Focused on the broadcasted news domain, which poses unique challenges due to the diversity of speakers and topics within single recordings, we address the challenge of accessing topic change points efficiently in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we propose a new benchmark for spoken news topic segmentation by utilizing a dataset featuring approximately 1000 hours of publicly available recordings across six European languages and including an evaluation set in Hindi to test the model's cross-domain performance in a cross-lingual, zero-shot scenario. This setup reflects real-world diversity and the need for models adapting to various linguistic settings. Our results demonstrate that while the traditional pipeline approach achieves a state-of-the-art $P_k$ score of 0.2431 for English, our end-to-end model delivers a competitive $P_k$ score of 0.2564. When trained multilingually, these scores further improve to 0.1988 and 0.2370, respectively. To support further research, we release our model along with data preparation scripts, facilitating open research on multilingual spoken news topic segmentation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06222v1,2024-09

Researchers have attempted to develop methods to reduce the adverse effect of errors in datasets automatically. However, an existing method is time-consuming because it requires many trained models to detect errors. We propose a novel method to reduce the time of error detection. Specifically, we use a tokenization technique called subword regularization to create pseudo-multiple models which are used to detect errors. Our proposed method, SubRegWeigh, can perform annotation weighting four to five times faster than the existing method. Additionally, SubRegWeigh improved performance in both document classification and named entity recognition tasks.

STUN: Structured-Then-Unstructured Pruning for Scalable MoE Pruning,"Jaeseong Lee, seung-won hwang, Aurick Qiao, Daniel F Campos, Zhewei Yao, Yuxiong He","Mixture-of-experts (MoEs) have been adopted for reducing inference costs by sparsely activating experts in Large language models (LLMs). Despite this reduction, the massive number of experts in MoEs still makes them expensive to serve. In this paper, we study how to address this, by pruning MoEs. Among pruning methodologies, unstructured pruning has been known to achieve the highest performance for a given pruning ratio, compared to structured pruning, since the latter imposes constraints on the sparsification structure. This is intuitive, as the solution space of unstructured pruning subsumes that of structured pruning. However, our counterintuitive finding reveals that expert pruning, a form of structured pruning, can actually precede unstructured pruning to outperform unstructured-only pruning. As existing expert pruning, requiring $O(\frac{k^n}{\sqrt{n}})$ forward passes for $n$ experts, cannot scale for recent MoEs, we propose a scalable alternative with $O(1)$ complexity, yet outperforming the more expensive methods. The key idea is leveraging a latent structure between experts, based on behavior similarity, such that the greedy decision of whether to prune closely captures the joint pruning effect. Ours is highly effective -- for Snowflake Arctic, a 480B-sized MoE with 128 experts, our method needs only one H100 and two hours to achieve nearly no loss in performance with 40% sparsity, even in generative tasks such as GSM8K, where state-of-the-art unstructured pruning fails to.

We describe the foundational aspects necessary for such a system, including the identification of key generative elements (primitive, animation, and interaction) and design requirements to enhance user interaction, based on formative exploration and iterative design processes. Based on these insights, we develop SHAPE-IT, an LLM-based authoring tool for a 24 x 24 shape display, which translates the user's textual command into executable code and allows for quick exploration through a web-based control interface. We evaluate the effectiveness of SHAPE-IT in two ways: 1) performance evaluation and 2) user evaluation (N= 10).

Larger Language Models Don't Care How You Think: Why Chain-of-Thought Prompting Fails in Subjective Tasks,"Georgios Chochlakis, Niyantha Maruthu Pandiyan, Kristina Lerman, Shrikanth Narayanan","In-Context Learning (ICL) in Large Language Models (LLM) has emerged as the dominant technique for performing natural language tasks, as it does not require updating the model parameters with gradient-based methods. ICL promises to ""adapt"" the LLM to perform the present task at a competitive or state-of-the-art level at a fraction of the computational cost. ICL can be augmented by incorporating the reasoning process to arrive at the final label explicitly in the prompt, a technique called Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. However, recent work has found that ICL relies mostly on the retrieval of task priors and less so on ""learning"" to perform tasks, especially for complex subjective domains like emotion and morality, where priors ossify posterior predictions. In this work, we examine whether ""enabling"" reasoning also creates the same behavior in LLMs, wherein the format of CoT retrieves reasoning priors that remain relatively unchanged despite the evidence in the prompt. We find that, surprisingly, CoT indeed suffers from the same posterior collapse as ICL for larger language models.

Deep Learning and Large Language Models for Audio and Text Analysis in Predicting Suicidal Acts in Chinese Psychological Support Hotlines,"Yining Chen, Jianqiang Li, Changwei Song, Qing Zhao, Yongsheng Tong, Guanghui Fu","Suicide is a pressing global issue, demanding urgent and effective preventive interventions. Among the various strategies in place, psychological support hotlines had proved as a potent intervention method. Approximately two million people in China attempt suicide annually, with many individuals making multiple attempts. Prompt identification and intervention for high-risk individuals are crucial to preventing tragedies. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), especially the development of large-scale language models (LLMs), new technological tools have been introduced to the field of mental health. This study included 1284 subjects, and was designed to validate whether deep learning models and LLMs, using audio and transcribed text from support hotlines, can effectively predict suicide risk. We proposed a simple LLM-based pipeline that first summarizes transcribed text from approximately one hour of speech to extract key features, and then predict suicidial bahaviours in the future. We compared our LLM-based method with the traditional manual scale approach in a clinical setting and with five advanced deep learning models. Surprisingly, the proposed simple LLM pipeline achieved strong performance on a test set of 46 subjects, with an F1 score of 76\% when combined with manual scale rating. This is 7\% higher than the best speech-based deep learning models and represents a 27.82\% point improvement in F1 score compared to using the manual scale apporach alone. Our study explores new applications of LLMs and demonstrates their potential for future use in suicide prevention efforts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06164v1,2024-09
KAG: Boosting LLMs in Professional Domains via Knowledge Augmented Generation,"Lei Liang, Mengshu Sun, Zhengke Gui, Zhongshu Zhu, Zhouyu Jiang, Ling Zhong, Yuan Qu, Peilong Zhao, Zhongpu Bo, Jin Yang, Huaidong Xiong, Lin Yuan, Jun Xu, Zaoyang Wang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Wen Zhang, Huajun Chen, Wenguang Chen, Jun Zhou","The recently developed retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology has enabled the efficient construction of domain-specific applications. However, it also has limitations, including the gap between vector similarity and the relevance of knowledge reasoning, as well as insensitivity to knowledge logic, such as numerical values, temporal relations, expert rules, and others, which hinder the effectiveness of professional knowledge services. In this work, we introduce a professional domain knowledge service framework called Knowledge Augmented Generation (KAG). KAG is designed to address the aforementioned challenges with the motivation of making full use of the advantages of knowledge graph(KG) and vector retrieval, and to improve generation and reasoning performance by bidirectionally enhancing large language models (LLMs) and KGs through five key aspects: (1) LLM-friendly knowledge representation, (2) mutual-indexing between knowledge graphs and original chunks, (3) logical-form-guided hybrid reasoning engine, (4) knowledge alignment with semantic reasoning, and (5) model capability enhancement for KAG. We compared KAG with existing RAG methods in multihop question answering and found that it significantly outperforms state-of-theart methods, achieving a relative improvement of 19.6% on 2wiki and 33.5% on hotpotQA in terms of F1 score. We have successfully applied KAG to two professional knowledge Q&A tasks of Ant Group, including E-Government Q&A and E-Health Q&A, achieving significant improvement in professionalism compared to RAG methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13731v3,2024-09
VisScience: An Extensive Benchmark for Evaluating K12 Educational Multi-modal Scientific Reasoning,"Zhihuan Jiang, Zhen Yang, Jinhao Chen, Zhengxiao Du, Weihan Wang, Bin Xu, Jie Tang","Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities across various tasks by integrating textual and visual information to achieve visual understanding in complex scenarios. Despite the availability of several benchmarks aims to evaluating MLLMs in tasks from visual question answering to complex problem-solving, most focus predominantly on mathematics or general visual understanding tasks. This reveals a critical gap in current benchmarks, which often overlook the inclusion of other key scientific disciplines such as physics and chemistry. To address this gap, we meticulously construct a comprehensive benchmark, named VisScience, which is utilized to assess the multi-modal scientific reasoning across the three disciplines of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. This benchmark comprises 3,000 questions drawn from K12 education - spanning elementary school through high school - equally distributed across three disciplines, with 1,000 questions per discipline. The questions within VisScience span 21 distinct subjects and are categorized into five difficulty levels, offering a broad spectrum of topics within each discipline. With VisScience, we present a detailed evaluation of the performance of 25 representative MLLMs in scientific reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that closed-source MLLMs generally outperform open-source models. The best performance observed include a 53.4\% accuracy in mathematics by Claude3.5-Sonnet, 38.2\% in physics by GPT-4o, and 47.0\% in chemistry by Gemini-1.5-Pro. These results underscore the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, suggesting areas for future improvement and highlighting the importance of developing models that can effectively handle the diverse demands of multi-modal scientific reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13730v2,2024-09
MathGLM-Vision: Solving Mathematical Problems with Multi-Modal Large Language Model,"Zhen Yang, Jinhao Chen, Zhengxiao Du, Wenmeng Yu, Weihan Wang, Wenyi Hong, Zhihuan Jiang, Bin Xu, Jie Tang","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in mathematical reasoning, particularly with text-based mathematical problems. However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), especially those specialized in mathematics, tend to focus predominantly on solving geometric problems but ignore the diversity of visual information available in other areas of mathematics. Moreover, the geometric information for these specialized mathematical MLLMs is derived from several public datasets, which are typically limited in diversity and complexity. To address these limitations, we aim to construct a fine-tuning dataset named MathVL, and develop a series of specialized mathematical MLLMs termed MathGLM-Vision by conducting Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on MathVL with various parameter-scale backbones. To extensively evaluate the effectiveness of MathGLM-Vision, we conduct experiments on several public benchmarks and our curated MathVL-test consisting of 2,000 problems. Experimental results demonstrate that MathGLM-Vision achieves significant improvements compared with some existing models, including backbone models and open-source mathematical MLLMs. These findings indicate the importance of diversity dataset in enhancing the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13729v2,2024-09
"Accelerating Large Language Model Pretraining via LFR Pedagogy: Learn, Focus, and Review","Neha Prakriya, Jui-Nan Yen, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jason Cong","Large Language Model (LLM) pretraining traditionally relies on autoregressive language modeling on randomly sampled data blocks from web-scale datasets. We take inspiration from human learning techniques like spaced repetition to hypothesize that random data sampling for LLMs leads to high training cost and low quality models which tend to forget data. In order to effectively commit web-scale information to long-term memory, we propose the LFR (Learn, Focus, and Review) pedagogy, a new dynamic training paradigm which focuses and repeatedly reviews complex data blocks at systematic intervals based on the model's learning pace and progress. LFR records the model perplexities for different data blocks and frequently revisits blocks with higher perplexity which are more likely to be forgotten. We pretrain the GPT-2 models (124M - 1.5B) from scratch on the OpenWebText dataset using LFR. We test on downstream tasks from the language modeling, question answering, translation, and problem solving domains to achieve consistently lower perplexity and higher accuracy than the baseline OpenAI models, while obtaining a 20x pretraining speed-up.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06131v1,2024-09
Estimating the Completeness of Discrete Speech Units,"Sung-Lin Yeh, Hao Tang","Representing speech with discrete units has been widely used in speech codec and speech generation. However, there are several unverified claims about self-supervised discrete units, such as disentangling phonetic and speaker information with k-means, or assuming information loss after k-means. In this work, we take an information-theoretic perspective to answer how much information is present (information completeness) and how much information is accessible (information accessibility), before and after residual vector quantization. We show a lower bound for information completeness and estimate completeness on discretized HuBERT representations after residual vector quantization. We find that speaker information is sufficiently present in HuBERT discrete units, and that phonetic information is sufficiently present in the residual, showing that vector quantization does not achieve disentanglement. Our results offer a comprehensive assessment on the choice of discrete units, and suggest that a lot more information in the residual should be mined rather than discarded.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06109v2,2024-09

Rule Extrapolation in Language Models: A Study of Compositional Generalization on OOD Prompts,"Anna Mészáros, Szilvia Ujváry, Wieland Brendel, Patrik Reizinger, Ferenc Huszár","LLMs show remarkable emergent abilities, such as inferring concepts from presumably out-of-distribution prompts, known as in-context learning. Though this success is often attributed to the Transformer architecture, our systematic understanding is limited. In complex real-world data sets, even defining what is out-of-distribution is not obvious. To better understand the OOD behaviour of autoregressive LLMs, we focus on formal languages, which are defined by the intersection of rules. We define a new scenario of OOD compositional generalization, termed rule extrapolation. Rule extrapolation describes OOD scenarios, where the prompt violates at least one rule. We evaluate rule extrapolation in formal languages with varying complexity in linear and recurrent architectures, the Transformer, and state space models to understand the architectures' influence on rule extrapolation. We also lay the first stones of a normative theory of rule extrapolation, inspired by the Solomonoff prior in algorithmic information theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13728v2,2024-09
ClarQ-LLM: A Benchmark for Models Clarifying and Requesting Information in Task-Oriented Dialog,"Yujian Gan, Changling Li, Jinxia Xie, Luou Wen, Matthew Purver, Massimo Poesio","We introduce ClarQ-LLM, an evaluation framework consisting of bilingual English-Chinese conversation tasks, conversational agents and evaluation metrics, designed to serve as a strong benchmark for assessing agents' ability to ask clarification questions in task-oriented dialogues. The benchmark includes 31 different task types, each with 10 unique dialogue scenarios between information seeker and provider agents. The scenarios require the seeker to ask questions to resolve uncertainty and gather necessary information to complete tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks that evaluate agents based on fixed dialogue content, ClarQ-LLM includes a provider conversational agent to replicate the original human provider in the benchmark. This allows both current and future seeker agents to test their ability to complete information gathering tasks through dialogue by directly interacting with our provider agent. In tests, LLAMA3.1 405B seeker agent managed a maximum success rate of only 60.05\%, showing that ClarQ-LLM presents a strong challenge for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06097v2,2024-09
Classification performance and reproducibility of GPT-4 omni for information extraction from veterinary electronic health records,"Judit M Wulcan, Kevin L Jacques, Mary Ann Lee, Samantha L Kovacs, Nicole Dausend, Lauren E Prince, Jonatan Wulcan, Sina Marsilio, Stefan M Keller","Large language models (LLMs) can extract information from veterinary electronic health records (EHRs), but performance differences between models, the effect of temperature settings, and the influence of text ambiguity have not been previously evaluated. This study addresses these gaps by comparing the performance of GPT-4 omni (GPT-4o) and GPT-3.5 Turbo under different conditions and investigating the relationship between human interobserver agreement and LLM errors. The LLMs and five humans were tasked with identifying six clinical signs associated with Feline chronic enteropathy in 250 EHRs from a veterinary referral hospital. At temperature 0, the performance of GPT-4o compared to the majority opinion of human respondents, achieved 96.9% sensitivity (interquartile range [IQR] 92.9-99.3%), 97.6% specificity (IQR 96.5-98.5%), 80.7% positive predictive value (IQR 70.8-84.6%), 99.5% negative predictive value (IQR 99.0-99.9%), 84.4% F1 score (IQR 77.3-90.4%), and 96.3% balanced accuracy (IQR 95.0-97.9%). The performance of GPT-4o was significantly better than that of its predecessor, GPT-3.5 Turbo, particularly with respect to sensitivity where GPT-3.5 Turbo only achieved 81.7% (IQR 78.9-84.8%). Adjusting the temperature for GPT-4o did not significantly impact classification performance. GPT-4o demonstrated greater reproducibility than human pairs regardless of temperature, with an average Cohen's kappa of 0.98 (IQR 0.98-0.99) at temperature 0 compared to 0.8 (IQR 0.78-0.81) for humans. Most GPT-4o errors occurred in instances where humans disagreed (35/43 errors, 81.4%), suggesting that these errors were more likely caused by ambiguity of the EHR than explicit model faults. Using GPT-4o to automate information extraction from veterinary EHRs is a viable alternative to manual extraction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13727v1,2024-09
DetoxBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Multitask Fraud & Abuse Detection,"Joymallya Chakraborty, Wei Xia, Anirban Majumder, Dan Ma, Walid Chaabene, Naveed Janvekar","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, their practical application in high-stake domains, such as fraud and abuse detection, remains an area that requires further exploration. The existing applications often narrowly focus on specific tasks like toxicity or hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to assess the performance of LLMs in identifying and mitigating fraudulent and abusive language across various real-world scenarios. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse set of tasks, including detecting spam emails, hate speech, misogynistic language, and more. We evaluated several state-of-the-art LLMs, including models from Anthropic, Mistral AI, and the AI21 family, to provide a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities in this critical domain. The results indicate that while LLMs exhibit proficient baseline performance in individual fraud and abuse detection tasks, their performance varies considerably across tasks, particularly struggling with tasks that demand nuanced pragmatic reasoning, such as identifying diverse forms of misogynistic language. These findings have important implications for the responsible development and deployment of LLMs in high-risk applications. Our benchmark suite can serve as a tool for researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate LLMs for multi-task fraud detection and drive the creation of more robust, trustworthy, and ethically-aligned systems for fraud and abuse detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06072v1,2024-09
MLLM-LLaVA-FL: Multimodal Large Language Model Assisted Federated Learning,"Jianyi Zhang, Hao Frank Yang, Ang Li, Xin Guo, Pu Wang, Haiming Wang, Yiran Chen, Hai Li","Previous studies on federated learning (FL) often encounter performance degradation due to data heterogeneity among different clients. In light of the recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4v and LLaVA, which demonstrate their exceptional proficiency in multimodal tasks, such as image captioning and multimodal question answering. We introduce a novel federated learning framework, named Multimodal Large Language Model Assisted Federated Learning (MLLM-LLaVA-FL), which employs powerful MLLMs at the server end to address the heterogeneous and long-tailed challenges. Owing to the advanced cross-modality representation capabilities and the extensive open-vocabulary prior knowledge of MLLMs, our framework is adept at harnessing the extensive, yet previously underexploited, open-source data accessible from websites and powerful server-side computational resources. Hence, the MLLM-LLaVA-FL not only enhances the performance but also avoids increasing the risk of privacy leakage and the computational burden on local devices, distinguishing it from prior methodologies. Our framework has three key stages. Initially, we conduct global visual-text pretraining of the model. This pretraining is facilitated by utilizing the extensive open-source data available online, with the assistance of MLLMs. Subsequently, the pretrained model is distributed among various clients for local training. Finally, once the locally trained models are transmitted back to the server, a global alignment is carried out under the supervision of MLLMs to further enhance the performance. Experimental evaluations on established benchmarks, show that our framework delivers promising performance in the typical scenarios with data heterogeneity and long-tail distribution across different clients in FL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06067v2,2024-09
Identifying the sources of ideological bias in GPT models through linguistic variation in output,"Christina Walker, Joan C. Timoneda","Extant work shows that generative AI models such as GPT-3.5 and 4 perpetuate social stereotypes and biases. One concerning but less explored source of bias is ideology. Do GPT models take ideological stances on politically sensitive topics? In this article, we provide an original approach to identifying ideological bias in generative models, showing that bias can stem from both the training data and the filtering algorithm. We leverage linguistic variation in countries with contrasting political attitudes to evaluate bias in average GPT responses to sensitive political topics in those languages. First, we find that GPT output is more conservative in languages that map well onto conservative societies (i.e., Polish), and more liberal in languages used uniquely in liberal societies (i.e., Swedish). This result provides strong evidence of training data bias in GPT models. Second, differences across languages observed in GPT-3.5 persist in GPT-4, even though GPT-4 is significantly more liberal due to OpenAI's filtering policy. Our main takeaway is that generative model training must focus on high-quality, curated datasets to reduce bias, even if it entails a compromise in training data size. Filtering responses after training only introduces new biases and does not remove the underlying training biases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06043v1,2024-09
Investigating Causal Cues: Strengthening Spoofed Audio Detection with Human-Discernible Linguistic Features,"Zahra Khanjani, Tolulope Ale, Jianwu Wang, Lavon Davis, Christine Mallinson, Vandana P. Janeja","Several types of spoofed audio, such as mimicry, replay attacks, and deepfakes, have created societal challenges to information integrity. Recently, researchers have worked with sociolinguistics experts to label spoofed audio samples with Expert Defined Linguistic Features (EDLFs) that can be discerned by the human ear: pitch, pause, word-initial and word-final release bursts of consonant stops, audible intake or outtake of breath, and overall audio quality. It is established that there is an improvement in several deepfake detection algorithms when they augmented the traditional and common features of audio data with these EDLFs. In this paper, using a hybrid dataset comprised of multiple types of spoofed audio augmented with sociolinguistic annotations, we investigate causal discovery and inferences between the discernible linguistic features and the label in the audio clips, comparing the findings of the causal models with the expert ground truth validation labeling process. Our findings suggest that the causal models indicate the utility of incorporating linguistic features to help discern spoofed audio, as well as the overall need and opportunity to incorporate human knowledge into models and techniques for strengthening AI models. The causal discovery and inference can be used as a foundation of training humans to discern spoofed audio as well as automating EDLFs labeling for the purpose of performance improvement of the common AI-based spoofed audio detectors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06033v1,2024-09
Improved Visually Prompted Keyword Localisation in Real Low-Resource Settings,"Leanne Nortje, Dan Oneata, Herman Kamper","Given an image query, visually prompted keyword localisation (VPKL) aims to find occurrences of the depicted word in a speech collection. This can be useful when transcriptions are not available for a low-resource language (e.g. if it is unwritten). Previous work showed that VPKL can be performed with a visually grounded speech model trained on paired images and unlabelled speech. But all experiments were done on English. Moreover, transcriptions were used to get positive and negative pairs for the contrastive loss. This paper introduces a few-shot learning scheme to mine pairs automatically without transcriptions. On English, this results in only a small drop in performance. We also - for the first time - consider VPKL on a real low-resource language, Yoruba. While scores are reasonable, here we see a bigger drop in performance compared to using ground truth pairs because the mining is less accurate in Yoruba.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06013v1,2024-09
TransformerRanker: A Tool for Efficiently Finding the Best-Suited Language Models for Downstream Classification Tasks,"Lukas Garbas, Max Ploner, Alan Akbik","Classification tasks in NLP are typically addressed by selecting a pre-trained language model (PLM) from a model hub, and fine-tuning it for the task at hand. However, given the very large number of PLMs that are currently available, a practical challenge is to determine which of them will perform best for a specific downstream task. With this paper, we introduce TransformerRanker, a lightweight library that efficiently ranks PLMs for classification tasks without the need for computationally costly fine-tuning. Our library implements current approaches for transferability estimation (LogME, H-Score, kNN), in combination with layer aggregation options, which we empirically showed to yield state-of-the-art rankings of PLMs (Garbas et al., 2024). We designed the interface to be lightweight and easy to use, allowing users to directly connect to the HuggingFace Transformers and Dataset libraries. Users need only select a downstream classification task and a list of PLMs to create a ranking of likely best-suited PLMs for their task. We make TransformerRanker available as a pip-installable open-source library https://github.com/flairNLP/transformer-ranker.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05997v1,2024-09

Multilingual Dyadic Interaction Corpus NoXi+J: Toward Understanding Asian-European Non-verbal Cultural Characteristics and their Influences on Engagement,"Marius Funk, Shogo Okada, Elisabeth André","Non-verbal behavior is a central challenge in understanding the dynamics of a conversation and the affective states between interlocutors arising from the interaction. Although psychological research has demonstrated that non-verbal behaviors vary across cultures, limited computational analysis has been conducted to clarify these differences and assess their impact on engagement recognition. To gain a greater understanding of engagement and non-verbal behaviors among a wide range of cultures and language spheres, in this study we conduct a multilingual computational analysis of non-verbal features and investigate their role in engagement and engagement prediction. To achieve this goal, we first expanded the NoXi dataset, which contains interaction data from participants living in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, by collecting session data of dyadic conversations in Japanese and Chinese, resulting in the enhanced dataset NoXi+J. Next, we extracted multimodal non-verbal features, including speech acoustics, facial expressions, backchanneling and gestures, via various pattern recognition techniques and algorithms. Then, we conducted a statistical analysis of listening behaviors and backchannel patterns to identify culturally dependent and independent features in each language and common features among multiple languages. These features were also correlated with the engagement shown by the interlocutors. Finally, we analyzed the influence of cultural differences in the input features of LSTM models trained to predict engagement for five language datasets. A SHAP analysis combined with transfer learning confirmed a considerable correlation between the importance of input features for a language set and the significant cultural characteristics analyzed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13726v1,2024-09
Mathematical Formalized Problem Solving and Theorem Proving in Different Fields in Lean 4,Xichen Tang,"Formalizing mathematical proofs using computerized verification languages like Lean 4 has the potential to significantly impact the field of mathematics, it offers prominent capabilities for advancing mathematical reasoning. However, existing efforts are largely limited to creating formalized versions of proofs from extensive online mathematical corpora, struggling to keep pace with the rapidly evolving nature of mathematics. To bridge the gap between traditional and computerized proof techniques, this paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate formal proof steps and complete formalized proofs. By converting natural language (NL) mathematical proofs into formalized versions, this work introduces the basic structure and tactics of the Lean 4 language. The goal is to determine how AI can be leveraged to assist the mathematical formalization process and improve its performance. Several examples are provided that demonstrate solving problems using both traditional and Lean 4-based approaches. Ultimately, this paper presents an explanation of the foundations of Lean 4 and comparative analyses of the mathematical formalization process using traditional and AI-augmented techniques. The findings indicate that AI- powered tools have significant potential to accelerate and enhance the formalization of mathematical proofs, paving the way for more efficient and reliable theorem-proving for AI for Math in the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05977v3,2024-09
Unveiling Induction Heads: Provable Training Dynamics and Feature Learning in Transformers,"Siyu Chen, Heejune Sheen, Tianhao Wang, Zhuoran Yang","In-context learning (ICL) is a cornerstone of large language model (LLM) functionality, yet its theoretical foundations remain elusive due to the complexity of transformer architectures. In particular, most existing work only theoretically explains how the attention mechanism facilitates ICL under certain data models. It remains unclear how the other building blocks of the transformer contribute to ICL. To address this question, we study how a two-attention-layer transformer is trained to perform ICL on $n$-gram Markov chain data, where each token in the Markov chain statistically depends on the previous $n$ tokens. We analyze a sophisticated transformer model featuring relative positional embedding, multi-head softmax attention, and a feed-forward layer with normalization. We prove that the gradient flow with respect to a cross-entropy ICL loss converges to a limiting model that performs a generalized version of the induction head mechanism with a learned feature, resulting from the congruous contribution of all the building blocks. In the limiting model, the first attention layer acts as a $\mathit{copier}$, copying past tokens within a given window to each position, and the feed-forward network with normalization acts as a $\mathit{selector}$ that generates a feature vector by only looking at informationally relevant parents from the window. Finally, the second attention layer is a $\mathit{classifier}$ that compares these features with the feature at the output position, and uses the resulting similarity scores to generate the desired output. Our theory is further validated by experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10559v1,2024-09
A Small Claims Court for the NLP: Judging Legal Text Classification Strategies With Small Datasets,"Mariana Yukari Noguti, Edduardo Vellasques, Luiz Eduardo Soares Oliveira","Recent advances in language modelling has significantly decreased the need of labelled data in text classification tasks. Transformer-based models, pre-trained on unlabeled data, can outmatch the performance of models trained from scratch for each task. However, the amount of labelled data need to fine-tune such type of model is still considerably high for domains requiring expert-level annotators, like the legal domain. This paper investigates the best strategies for optimizing the use of a small labeled dataset and large amounts of unlabeled data and perform a classification task in the legal area with 50 predefined topics. More specifically, we use the records of demands to a Brazilian Public Prosecutor's Office aiming to assign the descriptions in one of the subjects, which currently demands deep legal knowledge for manual filling. The task of optimizing the performance of classifiers in this scenario is especially challenging, given the low amount of resources available regarding the Portuguese language, especially in the legal domain. Our results demonstrate that classic supervised models such as logistic regression and SVM and the ensembles random forest and gradient boosting achieve better performance along with embeddings extracted with word2vec when compared to BERT language model. The latter demonstrates superior performance in association with the architecture of the model itself as a classifier, having surpassed all previous models in that regard. The best result was obtained with Unsupervised Data Augmentation (UDA), which jointly uses BERT, data augmentation, and strategies of semi-supervised learning, with an accuracy of 80.7% in the aforementioned task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05972v1,2024-09
MMEvol: Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models with Evol-Instruct,"Run Luo, Haonan Zhang, Longze Chen, Ting-En Lin, Xiong Liu, Yuchuan Wu, Min Yang, Minzheng Wang, Pengpeng Zeng, Lianli Gao, Heng Tao Shen, Yunshui Li, Xiaobo Xia, Fei Huang, Jingkuan Song, Yongbin Li","The development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements with increasing demands in various fields (e.g., multimodal agents, embodied intelligence). While model-driven approaches attempt to enhance MLLMs capabilities through diverse architectures, the gains have become increasingly marginal. Conversely, data-driven methods, which scale up image-text instruction data, are more effective but face limited data diversity and complexity challenges. The absence of high-quality data constitutes a significant development barrier for MLLMs. To address the data quality bottleneck, we propose MMEvol, a novel multimodal instruction data evolution framework. This framework iteratively improve data quality through a refined combination of fine-grained perception, cognitive reasoning, and interaction evolution, generating a more complex and diverse image-text instruction dataset that empowers MLLMs with enhanced capabilities. Beginning with an initial set of instructions, SEED-163K, we utilize MMEvol to systematically broaden the diversity of instruction types, extend visual reasoning steps to improve cognitive reasoning abilities, and thoroughly explore fine-grained information within images to enhance visual understanding and robustness. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive qualitative analysis and quantitative experiments across 13 vision-language tasks. Compared to baseline models trained with the initial seed data, the results demonstrate that our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.1 percentage points. Furthermore, our approach reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in nine tasks using significantly less data compared to state-of-the-art models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05840v5,2024-09
Improving Pretraining Data Using Perplexity Correlations,"Tristan Thrush, Christopher Potts, Tatsunori Hashimoto","Quality pretraining data is often seen as the key to high-performance language models. However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own. Our work is based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method. We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of thousands of web domains. In controlled pretraining experiments at the 160M parameter scale on 8 benchmarks, our approach outperforms DSIR on every benchmark, while matching the best data selector found in DataComp-LM, a hand-engineered bigram classifier.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05816v1,2024-09
Benchmarking Chinese Knowledge Rectification in Large Language Models,"Tianhe Lu, Jizhan Fang, Yunzhi Yao, Xin Xu, Ningyu Zhang, Huajun Chen","While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities, they are not without flaws, particularly in the form of hallucinations. This issue is even more pronounced when LLMs are applied to specific languages and domains. For example, LLMs may generate nonsense information when handling Chinese ancient poetry, proverbs, or idioms, owing to the lack of specific knowledge. To this end, this paper introduces a benchmark for rectifying Chinese knowledge in LLMs via knowledge editing. Specifically, we introduce a new Chinese dataset, CKnowEdit, by collecting seven type of knowledge from various sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, thereby accounting for the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical constructs inherent in the Chinese language. Through the analysis of this dataset, we uncover the challenges faced by current LLMs in mastering Chinese.

PDAF: A Phonetic Debiasing Attention Framework For Speaker Verification,"Massa Baali, Abdulhamid Aldoobi, Hira Dhamyal, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj","Speaker verification systems are crucial for authenticating identity through voice. Traditionally, these systems focus on comparing feature vectors, overlooking the speech's content. However, this paper challenges this by highlighting the importance of phonetic dominance, a measure of the frequency or duration of phonemes, as a crucial cue in speaker verification. A novel Phoneme Debiasing Attention Framework (PDAF) is introduced, integrating with existing attention frameworks to mitigate biases caused by phonetic dominance. PDAF adjusts the weighting for each phoneme and influences feature extraction, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of speech. This approach paves the way for more accurate and reliable identity authentication through voice. Furthermore, by employing various weighting strategies, we evaluate the influence of phonetic features on the efficacy of the speaker verification system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05799v1,2024-09
OneEdit: A Neural-Symbolic Collaboratively Knowledge Editing System,"Ningyu Zhang, Zekun Xi, Yujie Luo, Peng Wang, Bozhong Tian, Yunzhi Yao, Jintian Zhang, Shumin Deng, Mengshu Sun, Lei Liang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Xiaowei Zhu, Jun Zhou, Huajun Chen","Knowledge representation has been a central aim of AI since its inception. Symbolic Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and neural Large Language Models (LLMs) can both represent knowledge. KGs provide highly accurate and explicit knowledge representation, but face scalability issue; while LLMs offer expansive coverage of knowledge, but incur significant training costs and struggle with precise and reliable knowledge manipulation. To this end, we introduce OneEdit, a neural-symbolic prototype system for collaborative knowledge editing using natural language, which facilitates easy-to-use knowledge management with KG and LLM. OneEdit consists of three modules: 1) The Interpreter serves for user interaction with natural language; 2) The Controller manages editing requests from various users, leveraging the KG with rollbacks to handle knowledge conflicts and prevent toxic knowledge attacks; 3) The Editor utilizes the knowledge from the Controller to edit KG and LLM. We conduct experiments on two new datasets with KGs which demonstrate that OneEdit can achieve superior performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07497v1,2024-09
Evidence from fMRI Supports a Two-Phase Abstraction Process in Language Models,"Emily Cheng, Richard J. Antonello","Research has repeatedly demonstrated that intermediate hidden states extracted from large language models are able to predict measured brain response to natural language stimuli. Yet, very little is known about the representation properties that enable this high prediction performance. Why is it the intermediate layers, and not the output layers, that are most capable for this unique and highly general transfer task? In this work, we show that evidence from language encoding models in fMRI supports the existence of a two-phase abstraction process within LLMs. We use manifold learning methods to show that this abstraction process naturally arises over the course of training a language model and that the first ""composition"" phase of this abstraction process is compressed into fewer layers as training continues. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correspondence between layerwise encoding performance and the intrinsic dimensionality of representations from LLMs. We give initial evidence that this correspondence primarily derives from the inherent compositionality of LLMs and not their next-word prediction properties.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05771v1,2024-09
Towards Democratizing Multilingual Large Language Models For Medicine Through A Two-Stage Instruction Fine-tuning Approach,"Meng Zhou, Surajsinh Parmar, Anubhav Bhatti","Open-source, multilingual medical large language models (LLMs) have the potential to serve linguistically diverse populations across different regions. Adapting generic LLMs for healthcare often requires continual pretraining, but this approach is computationally expensive and sometimes impractical. Instruction fine-tuning on a specific task may not always guarantee optimal performance due to the lack of broader domain knowledge that the model needs to understand and reason effectively in diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce two multilingual instruction fine-tuning datasets, MMed-IFT and MMed-IFT-MC, containing over 200k high-quality medical samples in six languages. We propose a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage injects general medical knowledge using MMed-IFT, while the second stage fine-tunes task-specific multiple-choice questions with MMed-IFT-MC. Our method achieves competitive results on both English and multilingual benchmarks, striking a balance between computational efficiency and performance. We plan to make our dataset and model weights public at \url{https://github.com/SpassMed/Med-Llama3} in the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05732v1,2024-09
Referring Expression Generation in Visually Grounded Dialogue with Discourse-aware Comprehension Guiding,"Bram Willemsen, Gabriel Skantze","We propose an approach to referring expression generation (REG) in visually grounded dialogue that is meant to produce referring expressions (REs) that are both discriminative and discourse-appropriate. Our method constitutes a two-stage process. First, we model REG as a text- and image-conditioned next-token prediction task. REs are autoregressively generated based on their preceding linguistic context and a visual representation of the referent. Second, we propose the use of discourse-aware comprehension guiding as part of a generate-and-rerank strategy through which candidate REs generated with our REG model are reranked based on their discourse-dependent discriminatory power. Results from our human evaluation indicate that our proposed two-stage approach is effective in producing discriminative REs, with higher performance in terms of text-image retrieval accuracy for reranked REs compared to those generated using greedy decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05721v1,2024-09
RIRAG: Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation,"Tuba Gokhan, Kexin Wang, Iryna Gurevych, Ted Briscoe","Regulatory documents, issued by governmental regulatory bodies, establish rules, guidelines, and standards that organizations must adhere to for legal compliance. These documents, characterized by their length, complexity and frequent updates, are challenging to interpret, requiring significant allocation of time and expertise on the part of organizations to ensure ongoing compliance. Regulatory Natural Language Processing (RegNLP) is a multidisciplinary field aimed at simplifying access to and interpretation of regulatory rules and obligations. We introduce a task of generating question-passages pairs, where questions are automatically created and paired with relevant regulatory passages, facilitating the development of regulatory question-answering systems. We create the ObliQA dataset, containing 27,869 questions derived from the collection of Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) financial regulation documents, design a baseline Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation (RIRAG) system and evaluate it with RePASs, a novel evaluation metric that tests whether generated answers accurately capture all relevant obligations while avoiding contradictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05677v2,2024-09
Evaluation of real-time transcriptions using end-to-end ASR models,"Carlos Arriaga, Alejandro Pozo, Javier Conde, Alvaro Alonso","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Speech-to-text (STT) has greatly evolved in the last few years. Traditional architectures based on pipelines have been replaced by joint end-to-end (E2E) architectures that simplify and streamline the model training process. In addition, new AI training methods, such as weak-supervised learning have reduced the need for high-quality audio datasets for model training. However, despite all these advancements, little to no research has been done on real-time transcription. In real-time scenarios, the audio is not pre-recorded, and the input audio must be fragmented to be processed by the ASR systems. To achieve real-time requirements, these fragments must be as short as possible to reduce latency. However, audio cannot be split at any point as dividing an utterance into two separate fragments will generate an incorrect transcription. Also, shorter fragments provide less context for the ASR model. For this reason, it is necessary to design and test different splitting algorithms to optimize the quality and delay of the resulting transcription. In this paper, three audio splitting algorithms are evaluated with different ASR models to determine their impact on both the quality of the transcription and the end-to-end delay. The algorithms are fragmentation at fixed intervals, voice activity detection (VAD), and fragmentation with feedback. The results are compared to the performance of the same model, without audio fragmentation, to determine the effects of this division. The results show that VAD fragmentation provides the best quality with the highest delay, whereas fragmentation at fixed intervals provides the lowest quality and the lowest delay. The newly proposed feedback algorithm exchanges a 2-4% increase in WER for a reduction of 1.5-2s delay, respectively, to the VAD splitting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05674v2,2024-09
Identity-related Speech Suppression in Generative AI Content Moderation,"Oghenefejiro Isaacs Anigboro, Charlie M. Crawford, Danaë Metaxa, Sorelle A. Friedler","Automated content moderation has long been used to help identify and filter undesired user-generated content online. Generative AI systems now use such filters to keep undesired generated content from being created by or shown to users. From classrooms to Hollywood, as generative AI is increasingly used for creative or expressive text generation, whose stories will these technologies allow to be told, and whose will they suppress? In this paper, we define and introduce measures of speech suppression, focusing on speech related to different identity groups incorrectly filtered by a range of content moderation APIs. Using both short-form, user-generated datasets traditional in content moderation and longer generative AI-focused data, including two datasets we introduce in this work, we create a benchmark for measurement of speech suppression for nine identity groups. Across one traditional and four generative AI-focused automated content moderation services tested, we find that identity-related speech is more likely to be incorrectly suppressed than other speech except in the cases of a few non-marginalized groups. Additionally, we find differences between APIs in their abilities to correctly moderate generative AI content.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13725v1,2024-09
"WinoPron: Revisiting English Winogender Schemas for Consistency, Coverage, and Grammatical Case","Vagrant Gautam, Julius Steuer, Eileen Bingert, Ray Johns, Anne Lauscher, Dietrich Klakow","While measuring bias and robustness in coreference resolution are important goals, such measurements are only as good as the tools we use to measure them. Winogender Schemas (Rudinger et al., 2018) are an influential dataset proposed to evaluate gender bias in coreference resolution, but a closer look reveals issues with the data that compromise its use for reliable evaluation, including treating different pronominal forms as equivalent, violations of template constraints, and typographical errors. We identify these issues and fix them, contributing a new dataset: WinoPron. Using WinoPron, we evaluate two state-of-the-art supervised coreference resolution systems, SpanBERT, and five sizes of FLAN-T5, and demonstrate that accusative pronouns are harder to resolve for all models. We also propose a new method to evaluate pronominal bias in coreference resolution that goes beyond the binary. With this method, we also show that bias characteristics vary not just across pronoun sets (e.g., he vs. she), but also across surface forms of those sets (e.g., him vs. his).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05653v3,2024-09
Longer is (Not Necessarily) Stronger: Punctuated Long-Sequence Training for Enhanced Speech Recognition and Translation,"Nithin Rao Koluguri, Travis Bartley, Hainan Xu, Oleksii Hrinchuk, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg, Georg Kucsko","This paper presents a new method for training sequence-to-sequence models for speech recognition and translation tasks. Instead of the traditional approach of training models on short segments containing only lowercase or partial punctuation and capitalization (PnC) sentences, we propose training on longer utterances that include complete sentences with proper punctuation and capitalization. We achieve this by using the FastConformer architecture which allows training 1 Billion parameter models with sequences up to 60 seconds long with full attention. However, while training with PnC enhances the overall performance, we observed that accuracy plateaus when training on sequences longer than 40 seconds across various evaluation settings. Our proposed method significantly improves punctuation and capitalization accuracy, showing a 25% relative word error rate (WER) improvement on the Earnings-21 and Earnings-22 benchmarks. Additionally, training on longer audio segments increases the overall model accuracy across speech recognition and translation benchmarks.

ExDDI: Explaining Drug-Drug Interaction Predictions with Natural Language,"Zhaoyue Sun, Jiazheng Li, Gabriele Pergola, Yulan He","Predicting unknown drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial for improving medication safety. Previous efforts in DDI prediction have typically focused on binary classification or predicting DDI categories, with the absence of explanatory insights that could enhance trust in these predictions. In this work, we propose to generate natural language explanations for DDI predictions, enabling the model to reveal the underlying pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics mechanisms simultaneously as making the prediction. To do this, we have collected DDI explanations from DDInter and DrugBank and developed various models for extensive experiments and analysis. Our models can provide accurate explanations for unknown DDIs between known drugs. This paper contributes new tools to the field of DDI prediction and lays a solid foundation for further research on generating explanations for DDI predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05592v1,2024-09
MemoRAG: Moving towards Next-Gen RAG Via Memory-Inspired Knowledge Discovery,"Hongjin Qian, Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Kelong Mao, Zhicheng Dou","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages retrieval tools to access external databases, thereby enhancing the generation quality of large language models (LLMs) through optimized context. However, the existing retrieval methods are constrained inherently, as they can only perform relevance matching between explicitly stated queries and well-formed knowledge, but unable to handle tasks involving ambiguous information needs or unstructured knowledge. Consequently, existing RAG systems are primarily effective for straightforward question-answering tasks. In this work, we propose MemoRAG, a novel retrieval-augmented generation paradigm empowered by long-term memory. MemoRAG adopts a dual-system architecture. On the one hand, it employs a light but long-range LLM to form the global memory of database. Once a task is presented, it generates draft answers, cluing the retrieval tools to locate useful information within the database. On the other hand, it leverages an expensive but expressive LLM, which generates the ultimate answer based on the retrieved information. Building on this general framework, we further optimize MemoRAG's performance by enhancing its cluing mechanism and memorization capacity. In our experiment, MemoRAG achieves superior performance across a variety of evaluation tasks, including both complex ones where conventional RAG fails and straightforward ones where RAG is commonly applied.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05591v2,2024-09
Spatially-Aware Speaker for Vision-and-Language Navigation Instruction Generation,"Muraleekrishna Gopinathan, Martin Masek, Jumana Abu-Khalaf, David Suter","Embodied AI aims to develop robots that can \textit{understand} and execute human language instructions, as well as communicate in natural languages. On this front, we study the task of generating highly detailed navigational instructions for the embodied robots to follow. Although recent studies have demonstrated significant leaps in the generation of step-by-step instructions from sequences of images, the generated instructions lack variety in terms of their referral to objects and landmarks. Existing speaker models learn strategies to evade the evaluation metrics and obtain higher scores even for low-quality sentences. In this work, we propose SAS (Spatially-Aware Speaker), an instruction generator or \textit{Speaker} model that utilises both structural and semantic knowledge of the environment to produce richer instructions. For training, we employ a reward learning method in an adversarial setting to avoid systematic bias introduced by language evaluation metrics. Empirically, our method outperforms existing instruction generation models, evaluated using standard metrics.

SciAgents: Automating scientific discovery through multi-agent intelligent graph reasoning,"Alireza Ghafarollahi, Markus J. Buehler","A key challenge in artificial intelligence is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, we present SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts: (1) the use of large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses traditional human-driven research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the intelligent system yields material discoveries, critique and improve existing hypotheses, retrieve up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights their strengths and limitations. Our case studies demonstrate scalable capabilities to combine generative AI, ontological representations, and multi-agent modeling, harnessing a `swarm of intelligence' similar to biological systems. This provides new avenues for materials discovery and accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05556v1,2024-09
QiBERT -- Classifying Online Conversations Messages with BERT as a Feature,"Bruno D. Ferreira-Saraiva, Zuil Pirola, João P.

Thus, the need to classify this type of text based on its content has a significant implication in many areas. Online debates are no exception, once these provide access to information about opinions, positions and preferences of its users. This paper aims to use data obtained from online social conversations in Portuguese schools (short text) to observe behavioural trends and to see if students remain engaged in the discussion when stimulated. This project used the state of the art (SoA) Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and methods, through BERT based models to classify if utterances are in or out of the debate subject. Using SBERT embeddings as a feature, with supervised learning, the proposed model achieved results above 0.95 average accuracy for classifying online messages.

Harmonic Reasoning in Large Language Models,Anna Kruspe,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming very popular and are used for many different purposes, including creative tasks in the arts. However, these models sometimes have trouble with specific reasoning tasks, especially those that involve logical thinking and counting. This paper looks at how well LLMs understand and reason when dealing with musical tasks like figuring out notes from intervals and identifying chords and scales. We tested GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o to see how they handle these tasks. Our results show that while LLMs do well with note intervals, they struggle with more complicated tasks like recognizing chords and scales. This points out clear limits in current LLM abilities and shows where we need to make them better, which could help improve how they think and work in both artistic and other complex areas. We also provide an automatically generated benchmark data set for the described tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05521v1,2024-09
Logically Consistent Language Models via Neuro-Symbolic Integration,"Diego Calanzone, Stefano Teso, Antonio Vergari","Large language models (LLMs) are a promising venue for natural language understanding and generation. However, current LLMs are far from reliable: they are prone to generating non-factual information and, more crucially, to contradicting themselves when prompted to reason about relations between entities of the world. These problems are currently addressed with large scale fine-tuning or by delegating reasoning to external tools. In this work, we strive for a middle ground and introduce a loss based on neuro-symbolic reasoning that teaches an LLM to be logically consistent with an external set of facts and rules and improves self-consistency even when the LLM is fine-tuned on a limited set of facts. Our approach also allows to easily combine multiple logical constraints at once in a principled way, delivering LLMs that are more consistent w.r.t. all constraints and improve over several baselines w.r.t. a given constraint. Moreover, our method allows LLMs to extrapolate to unseen but semantically similar factual knowledge, represented in unseen datasets, more systematically.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13724v1,2024-09
Efficient Training of Self-Supervised Speech Foundation Models on a Compute Budget,"Andy T. Liu, Yi-Cheng Lin, Haibin Wu, Stefan Winkler, Hung-yi Lee","Despite their impressive success, training foundation models remains computationally costly. This paper investigates how to efficiently train speech foundation models with self-supervised learning (SSL) under a limited compute budget. We examine critical factors in SSL that impact the budget, including model architecture, model size, and data size. Our goal is to make analytical steps toward understanding the training dynamics of speech foundation models. We benchmark SSL objectives in an entirely comparable setting and find that other factors contribute more significantly to the success of SSL. Our results show that slimmer model architectures outperform common small architectures under the same compute and parameter budget. We demonstrate that the size of the pre-training data remains crucial, even with data augmentation during SSL training, as performance suffers when iterating over limited data. Finally, we identify a trade-off between model size and data size, highlighting an optimal model size for a given compute budget.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16295v1,2024-09

Representational Analysis of Binding in Language Models,"Qin Dai, Benjamin Heinzerling, Kentaro Inui","Entity tracking is essential for complex reasoning. To perform in-context entity tracking, language models (LMs) must bind an entity to its attribute (e.g., bind a container to its content) to recall attribute for a given entity. For example, given a context mentioning ``The coffee is in Box Z, the stone is in Box M, the map is in Box H'', to infer ``Box Z contains the coffee'' later, LMs must bind ``Box Z'' to ``coffee''. To explain the binding behaviour of LMs, existing research introduces a Binding ID mechanism and states that LMs use a abstract concept called Binding ID (BI) to internally mark entity-attribute pairs. However, they have not captured the Ordering ID (OI) from entity activations that directly determines the binding behaviour. In this work, we provide a novel view of the BI mechanism by localizing OI and proving the causality between OI and binding behaviour. Specifically, by leveraging dimension reduction methods (e.g., PCA), we discover that there exists a low-rank subspace in the activations of LMs, that primarily encodes the order (i.e., OI) of entity and attribute. Moreover, we also discover the causal effect of OI on binding that when editing representations along the OI encoding direction, LMs tend to bind a given entity to other attributes accordingly. For example, by patching activations along the OI encoding direction we can make the LM to infer ``Box Z contains the stone'' and ``Box Z contains the map''.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05448v3,2024-09
SVFit: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Pre-Trained Models Using Singular Values,"Chengwei Sun, Jiwei Wei, Yujia Wu, Yiming Shi, Shiyuan He, Zeyu Ma, Ning Xie, Yang Yang","Large pre-trained models (LPMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in diverse natural language processing and computer vision tasks. However, fully fine-tuning these models poses substantial memory challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, mitigate this issue by adjusting only a small subset of parameters. Nevertheless, these methods typically employ random initialization for low-rank matrices, which can lead to inefficiencies in gradient descent and diminished generalizability due to suboptimal starting points. To address these limitations, we propose SVFit, a novel PEFT approach that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to initialize low-rank matrices using critical singular values as trainable parameters. Specifically, SVFit performs SVD on the pre-trained weight matrix to obtain the best rank-r approximation matrix, emphasizing the most critical singular values that capture over 99% of the matrix's information. These top-r singular values are then used as trainable parameters to scale the fundamental subspaces of the matrix, facilitating rapid domain adaptation. Extensive experiments across various pre-trained models in natural language understanding, text-to-image generation, and image classification tasks reveal that SVFit outperforms LoRA while requiring 16 times fewer trainable parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05926v1,2024-09
Assessing SPARQL capabilities of Large Language Models,"Lars-Peter Meyer, Johannes Frey, Felix Brei, Natanael Arndt","The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offers significant synergistic potential for knowledge-driven applications. One possible integration is the interpretation and generation of formal languages, such as those used in the Semantic Web, with SPARQL being a core technology for accessing KGs. In this paper, we focus on measuring out-of-the box capabilities of LLMs to work with SPARQL and more specifically with SPARQL SELECT queries applying a quantitative approach.   We implemented various benchmarking tasks in the LLM-KG-Bench framework for automated execution and evaluation with several LLMs. The tasks assess capabilities along the dimensions of syntax, semantic read, semantic create, and the role of knowledge graph prompt inclusion.   With this new benchmarking tasks, we evaluated a selection of GPT, Gemini, and Claude models. Our findings indicate that working with SPARQL SELECT queries is still challenging for LLMs and heavily depends on the specific LLM as well as the complexity of the task. While fixing basic syntax errors seems to pose no problems for the best of the current LLMs evaluated, creating semantically correct SPARQL SELECT queries is difficult in several cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05925v1,2024-09
STLM Engineering Report: Dropout,"Dylan Hillier, Leon Guertler, Bobby Cheng, Cheston Tan","In this work we explore the relevance of dropout for modern language models, particularly in the context of models on the scale of <100M parameters. We explore it's relevance firstly in the regime of improving the sample efficiency of models given small, high quality datasets, and secondly in the regime of improving the quality of its fit on larger datasets where models may underfit. We find that concordant with conventional wisdom, dropout remains effective in the overfitting scenario, and that furthermore it may have some relevance for improving the fit of models even in the case of excess data, as suggested by previous research. In the process we find that the existing explanation for the mechanism behind this performance gain is not applicable in the case of language modelling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05423v1,2024-09
Benchmarking and Building Zero-Shot Hindi Retrieval Model with Hindi-BEIR and NLLB-E5,"Arkadeep Acharya, Rudra Murthy, Vishwajeet Kumar, Jaydeep Sen","Given the large number of Hindi speakers worldwide, there is a pressing need for robust and efficient information retrieval systems for Hindi.

Towards Building a Robust Knowledge Intensive Question Answering Model with Large Language Models,"Xingyun Hong, Yan Shao, Zhilin Wang, Manni Duan, Jin Xiongnan","The development of LLMs has greatly enhanced the intelligence and fluency of question answering, while the emergence of retrieval enhancement has enabled models to better utilize external information. However, the presence of noise and errors in retrieved information poses challenges to the robustness of LLMs. In this work, to evaluate the model's performance under multiple interferences, we first construct a dataset based on machine reading comprehension datasets simulating various scenarios, including critical information absence, noise, and conflicts. To address the issue of model accuracy decline caused by noisy external information, we propose a data augmentation-based fine-tuning method to enhance LLM's robustness against noise. Additionally, contrastive learning approach is utilized to preserve the model's discrimination capability of external information.

Application Specific Compression of Deep Learning Models,"Rohit Raj Rai, Angana Borah, Amit Awekar","Large Deep Learning models are compressed and deployed for specific applications. However, current Deep Learning model compression methods do not utilize the information about the target application. As a result, the compressed models are application agnostic. Our goal is to customize the model compression process to create a compressed model that will perform better for the target application. Our method, Application Specific Compression (ASC), identifies and prunes components of the large Deep Learning model that are redundant specifically for the given target application. The intuition of our work is to prune the parts of the network that do not contribute significantly to updating the data representation for the given application. We have experimented with the BERT family of models for three applications: Extractive QA, Natural Language Inference, and Paraphrase Identification. We observe that customized compressed models created using ASC method perform better than existing model compression methods and off-the-shelf compressed models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05368v1,2024-09
Diagnostic Reasoning in Natural Language: Computational Model and Application,"Nils Dycke, Matej Zečević, Ilia Kuznetsov, Beatrix Suess, Kristian Kersting, Iryna Gurevych","Diagnostic reasoning is a key component of expert work in many domains. It is a hard, time-consuming activity that requires expertise, and AI research has investigated the ways automated systems can support this process. Yet, due to the complexity of natural language, the applications of AI for diagnostic reasoning to language-related tasks are lacking. To close this gap, we investigate diagnostic abductive reasoning (DAR) in the context of language-grounded tasks (NL-DAR). We propose a novel modeling framework for NL-DAR based on Pearl's structural causal models and instantiate it in a comprehensive study of scientific paper assessment in the biomedical domain. We use the resulting dataset to investigate the human decision-making process in NL-DAR and determine the potential of LLMs to support structured decision-making over text.

IndicVoices-R: Unlocking a Massive Multilingual Multi-speaker Speech Corpus for Scaling Indian TTS,"Ashwin Sankar, Srija Anand, Praveen Srinivasa Varadhan, Sherry Thomas, Mehak Singal, Shridhar Kumar, Deovrat Mehendale, Aditi Krishana, Giri Raju, Mitesh Khapra","Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis show that large-scale models trained with extensive web data produce highly natural-sounding output. However, such data is scarce for Indian languages due to the lack of high-quality, manually subtitled data on platforms like LibriVox or YouTube. To address this gap, we enhance existing large-scale ASR datasets containing natural conversations collected in low-quality environments to generate high-quality TTS training data. Our pipeline leverages the cross-lingual generalization of denoising and speech enhancement models trained on English and applied to Indian languages. This results in IndicVoices-R (IV-R), the largest multilingual Indian TTS dataset derived from an ASR dataset, with 1,704 hours of high-quality speech from 10,496 speakers across 22 Indian languages. IV-R matches the quality of gold-standard TTS datasets like LJSpeech, LibriTTS, and IndicTTS. We also introduce the IV-R Benchmark, the first to assess zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot speaker generalization capabilities of TTS models on Indian voices, ensuring diversity in age, gender, and style. We demonstrate that fine-tuning an English pre-trained model on a combined dataset of high-quality IndicTTS and our IV-R dataset results in better zero-shot speaker generalization compared to fine-tuning on the IndicTTS dataset alone. Further, our evaluation reveals limited zero-shot generalization for Indian voices in TTS models trained on prior datasets, which we improve by fine-tuning the model on our data containing diverse set of speakers across language families. We open-source all data and code, releasing the first TTS model for all 22 official Indian languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05356v2,2024-09
"Mpox Narrative on Instagram: A Labeled Multilingual Dataset of Instagram Posts on Mpox for Sentiment, Hate Speech, and Anxiety Analysis",Nirmalya Thakur,"The world is currently experiencing an outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by WHO. No prior work related to social media mining has focused on the development of a dataset of Instagram posts about the mpox outbreak. The work presented in this paper aims to address this research gap and makes two scientific contributions to this field. First, it presents a multilingual dataset of 60,127 Instagram posts about mpox, published between July 23, 2022, and September 5, 2024. The dataset, available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/7fvc-y093, contains Instagram posts about mpox in 52 languages. For each of these posts, the Post ID, Post Description, Date of publication, language, and translated version of the post (translation to English was performed using the Google Translate API) are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. After developing this dataset, sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, and anxiety or stress detection were performed. This process included classifying each post into (i) one of the sentiment classes, i.e., fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, or neutral, (ii) hate or not hate, and (iii) anxiety/stress detected or no anxiety/stress detected. These results are presented as separate attributes in the dataset. Second, this paper presents the results of performing sentiment analysis, hate speech analysis, and anxiety or stress analysis. The variation of the sentiment classes - fear, surprise, joy, sadness, anger, disgust, and neutral were observed to be 27.95%, 2.57%, 8.69%, 5.94%, 2.69%, 1.53%, and 50.64%, respectively. In terms of hate speech detection, 95.75% of the posts did not contain hate and the remaining 4.25% of the posts contained hate. Finally, 72.05% of the posts did not indicate any anxiety/stress, and the remaining 27.95% of the posts represented some form of anxiety/stress.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05292v4,2024-09
Seek and Solve Reasoning for Table Question Answering,"Ruya Jiang, Chun Wang, Weihong Deng","The complexities of table structures and question logic make table-based question answering (TQA) tasks challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs), often requiring task simplification before solving. This paper reveals that the reasoning process during task simplification may be more valuable than the simplified tasks themselves and aims to improve TQA performance by leveraging LLMs' reasoning capabilities. We propose a Seek-and-Solve pipeline that instructs the LLM to first seek relevant information and then answer questions, integrating these two stages at the reasoning level into a coherent Seek-and-Solve Chain of Thought (SS-CoT). Additionally, we distill a single-step TQA-solving prompt from this pipeline, using demonstrations with SS-CoT paths to guide the LLM in solving complex TQA tasks under In-Context Learning settings. Our experiments show that our approaches result in improved performance and reliability while being efficient. Our findings emphasize the importance of eliciting LLMs' reasoning capabilities to handle complex TQA tasks effectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05286v2,2024-09
On the Relationship between Truth and Political Bias in Language Models,"Suyash Fulay, William Brannon, Shrestha Mohanty, Cassandra Overney, Elinor Poole-Dayan, Deb Roy, Jad Kabbara","Language model alignment research often attempts to ensure that models are not only helpful and harmless, but also truthful and unbiased. However, optimizing these objectives simultaneously can obscure how improving one aspect might impact the others. In this work, we focus on analyzing the relationship between two concepts essential in both language model alignment and political science: truthfulness and political bias. We train reward models on various popular truthfulness datasets and subsequently evaluate their political bias. Our findings reveal that optimizing reward models for truthfulness on these datasets tends to result in a left-leaning political bias. We also find that existing open-source reward models (i.e., those trained on standard human preference datasets) already show a similar bias and that the bias is larger for larger models. These results raise important questions about the datasets used to represent truthfulness, potential limitations of aligning models to be both truthful and politically unbiased, and what language models capture about the relationship between truth and politics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05283v2,2024-09
LegiLM: A Fine-Tuned Legal Language Model for Data Compliance,"Linkai Zhu, Lu Yang, Chaofan Li, Shanwen Hu, Lu Liu, Bin Yin","Ensuring compliance with international data protection standards for privacy and data security is a crucial but complex task, often requiring substantial legal expertise. This paper introduces LegiLM, a novel legal language model specifically tailored for consulting on data or information compliance. LegiLM leverages a pre-trained GDPR Fines dataset and has been fine-tuned to automatically assess whether particular actions or events breach data security and privacy regulations. By incorporating a specialized dataset that includes global data protection laws, meticulously annotated policy documents, and relevant privacy policies, LegiLM is optimized for addressing data compliance challenges. The model integrates advanced legal reasoning methods and information retrieval enhancements to enhance accuracy and reliability in practical legal consulting scenarios. Our evaluation using a custom benchmark dataset demonstrates that LegiLM excels in detecting data regulation breaches, offering sound legal justifications, and recommending necessary compliance modifications, setting a new benchmark for AI-driven legal compliance solutions.

RexUniNLU: Recursive Method with Explicit Schema Instructor for Universal NLU,"Chengyuan Liu, Shihang Wang, Fubang Zhao, Kun Kuang, Yangyang Kang, Weiming Lu, Changlong Sun, Fei Wu","Information Extraction (IE) and Text Classification (CLS) serve as the fundamental pillars of NLU, with both disciplines relying on analyzing input sequences to categorize outputs into pre-established schemas. However, there is no existing encoder-based model that can unify IE and CLS tasks from this perspective. To fully explore the foundation shared within NLU tasks, we have proposed a Recursive Method with Explicit Schema Instructor for Universal NLU. Specifically, we firstly redefine the true universal information extraction (UIE) with a formal formulation that covers almost all extraction schemas, including quadruples and quintuples which remain unsolved for previous UIE models. Then, we expands the formulation to all CLS and multi-modal NLU tasks. Based on that, we introduce RexUniNLU, an universal NLU solution that employs explicit schema constraints for IE and CLS, which encompasses all IE and CLS tasks and prevent incorrect connections between schema and input sequence. To avoid interference between different schemas, we reset the position ids and attention mask matrices. Extensive experiments are conducted on IE, CLS in both English and Chinese, and multi-modality, revealing the effectiveness and superiority. Our codes are publicly released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05275v1,2024-09
UPCS: Unbiased Persona Construction for Dialogue Generation,"Kuiyun Chen, Yanbin Wei","Narrative systems, such as dialogue and storytelling systems, often utilize persona profiles to enhance personalized interactions. Existing persona profiles frequently exhibit biases, posing risks to system integrity and fairness.

Experimental results demonstrate UPCS's superiority in accuracy, diversity, bias elimination, and user satisfaction, marking a significant advancement in persona construction for reliable narrative systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05257v4,2024-09
Socially Responsible Data for Large Multilingual Language Models,"Andrew Smart, Ben Hutchinson, Lameck Mbangula Amugongo, Suzanne Dikker, Alex Zito, Amber Ebinama, Zara Wudiri, Ding Wang, Erin van Liemt, João Sedoc, Seyi Olojo, Stanley Uwakwe, Edem Wornyo, Sonja Schmer-Galunder, Jamila Smith-Loud","Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly increased in size and apparent capabilities in the last three years, but their training data is largely English text. There is growing interest in multilingual LLMs, and various efforts are striving for models to accommodate languages of communities outside of the Global North, which include many languages that have been historically underrepresented in digital realms. These languages have been coined as ""low resource languages"" or ""long-tail languages"", and LLMs performance on these languages is generally poor. While expanding the use of LLMs to more languages may bring many potential benefits, such as assisting cross-community communication and language preservation, great care must be taken to ensure that data collection on these languages is not extractive and that it does not reproduce exploitative practices of the past. Collecting data from languages spoken by previously colonized people, indigenous people, and non-Western languages raises many complex sociopolitical and ethical questions, e.g., around consent, cultural safety, and data sovereignty. Furthermore, linguistic complexity and cultural nuances are often lost in LLMs. This position paper builds on recent scholarship, and our own work, and outlines several relevant social, cultural, and ethical considerations and potential ways to mitigate them through qualitative research, community partnerships, and participatory design approaches. We provide twelve recommendations for consideration when collecting language data on underrepresented language communities outside of the Global North.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05247v1,2024-09
Exploring Intrinsic Language-specific Subspaces in Fine-tuning Multilingual Neural Machine Translation,"Zhe Cao, Zhi Qu, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Taro Watanabe","Multilingual neural machine translation models support fine-tuning hundreds of languages simultaneously. However, fine-tuning on full parameters solely is inefficient potentially leading to negative interactions among languages. In this work, we demonstrate that the fine-tuning for a language occurs in its intrinsic language-specific subspace with a tiny fraction of entire parameters. Thus, we propose language-specific LoRA to isolate intrinsic language-specific subspaces. Furthermore, we propose architecture learning techniques and introduce a gradual pruning schedule during fine-tuning to exhaustively explore the optimal setting and the minimal intrinsic subspaces for each language, resulting in a lightweight yet effective fine-tuning procedure. The experimental results on a 12-language subset and a 30-language subset of FLORES-101 show that our methods not only outperform full-parameter fine-tuning up to 2.25 spBLEU scores but also reduce trainable parameters to $0.4\%$ for high and medium-resource languages and $1.6\%$ for low-resource ones.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05224v1,2024-09
Interactive Machine Teaching by Labeling Rules and Instances,"Giannis Karamanolakis, Daniel Hsu, Luis Gravano","Weakly supervised learning aims to reduce the cost of labeling data by using expert-designed labeling rules. However, existing methods require experts to design effective rules in a single shot, which is difficult in the absence of proper guidance and tooling. Therefore, it is still an open question whether experts should spend their limited time writing rules or instead providing instance labels via active learning. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit an expert's limited time to create effective supervision. First, to develop practical guidelines for rule creation, we conduct an exploratory analysis of diverse collections of existing expert-designed rules and find that rule precision is more important than coverage across datasets. Second, we compare rule creation to individual instance labeling via active learning and demonstrate the importance of both across 6 datasets. Third, we propose an interactive learning framework, INTERVAL, that achieves efficiency by automatically extracting candidate rules based on rich patterns (e.g., by prompting a language model), and effectiveness by soliciting expert feedback on both candidate rules and individual instances. Across 6 datasets, INTERVAL outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches by 7% in F1. Furthermore, it requires as few as 10 queries for expert feedback to reach F1 values that existing active learning methods cannot match even with 100 queries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05199v1,2024-09
Seemingly Plausible Distractors in Multi-Hop Reasoning: Are Large Language Models Attentive Readers?,"Neeladri Bhuiya, Viktor Schlegel, Stefan Winkler","State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) are accredited with an increasing number of different capabilities, ranging from reading comprehension, over advanced mathematical and reasoning skills to possessing scientific knowledge. In this paper we focus on their multi-hop reasoning capability: the ability to identify and integrate information from multiple textual sources.   Given the concerns with the presence of simplifying cues in existing multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, which allow models to circumvent the reasoning requirement, we set out to investigate, whether LLMs are prone to exploiting such simplifying cues. We find evidence that they indeed circumvent the requirement to perform multi-hop reasoning, but they do so in more subtle ways than what was reported about their fine-tuned pre-trained language model (PLM) predecessors. Motivated by this finding, we propose a challenging multi-hop reasoning benchmark, by generating seemingly plausible multi-hop reasoning chains, which ultimately lead to incorrect answers. We evaluate multiple open and proprietary state-of-the-art LLMs, and find that their performance to perform multi-hop reasoning is affected, as indicated by up to 45% relative decrease in F1 score when presented with such seemingly plausible alternatives. We conduct a deeper analysis and find evidence that while LLMs tend to ignore misleading lexical cues, misleading reasoning paths indeed present a significant challenge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05197v3,2024-09
OneGen: Efficient One-Pass Unified Generation and Retrieval for LLMs,"Jintian Zhang, Cheng Peng, Mengshu Sun, Xiang Chen, Lei Liang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang","Despite the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have significantly enhanced the generative capabilities for various NLP tasks, LLMs still face limitations in directly handling retrieval tasks. However, many practical applications demand the seamless integration of both retrieval and generation. This paper introduces a novel and efficient One-pass Generation and retrieval framework (OneGen), designed to improve LLMs' performance on tasks that require both generation and retrieval. The proposed framework bridges the traditionally separate training approaches for generation and retrieval by incorporating retrieval tokens generated autoregressively. This enables a single LLM to handle both tasks simultaneously in a unified forward pass. We conduct experiments on two distinct types of composite tasks, RAG and Entity Linking, to validate the pluggability, effectiveness, and efficiency of OneGen in training and inference. Furthermore, our results show that integrating generation and retrieval within the same context preserves the generative capabilities of LLMs while improving retrieval performance. To the best of our knowledge, OneGen is the first to enable LLMs to conduct vector retrieval during the generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05152v2,2024-09
Better Spanish Emotion Recognition In-the-wild: Bringing Attention to Deep Spectrum Voice Analysis,"Elena Ortega-Beltrán, Josep Cabacas-Maso, Ismael Benito-Altamirano, Carles Ventura","Within the context of creating new Socially Assistive Robots, emotion recognition has become a key development factor, as it allows the robot to adapt to the user's emotional state in the wild. In this work, we focused on the analysis of two voice recording Spanish datasets: ELRA-S0329 and EmoMatchSpanishDB. Specifically, we centered our work in the paralanguage, e.~g. the vocal characteristics that go along with the message and clarifies the meaning. We proposed the use of the DeepSpectrum method, which consists of extracting a visual representation of the audio tracks and feeding them to a pretrained CNN model. For the classification task, DeepSpectrum is often paired with a Support Vector Classifier --DS-SVC--, or a Fully-Connected deep-learning classifier --DS-FC--. We compared the results of the DS-SVC and DS-FC architectures with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) for ELRA-S0329 and EmoMatchSpanishDB. Moreover, we proposed our own classifier based upon Attention Mechanisms, namely DS-AM. We trained all models against both datasets, and we found that our DS-AM model outperforms the SOTA models for the datasets and the SOTA DeepSpectrum architectures. Finally, we trained our DS-AM model in one dataset and tested it in the other, to simulate real-world conditions on how biased is the model to the dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05148v1,2024-09
READoc: A Unified Benchmark for Realistic Document Structured Extraction,"Zichao Li, Aizier Abulaiti, Yaojie Lu, Xuanang Chen, Jia Zheng, Hongyu Lin, Xianpei Han, Le Sun","Document Structured Extraction (DSE) aims to extract structured content from raw documents. Despite the emergence of numerous DSE systems, their unified evaluation remains inadequate, significantly hindering the field's advancement. This problem is largely attributed to existing benchmark paradigms, which exhibit fragmented and localized characteristics. To address these limitations and offer a thorough evaluation of DSE systems, we introduce a novel benchmark named READoc, which defines DSE as a realistic task of converting unstructured PDFs into semantically rich Markdown. The READoc dataset is derived from 2,233 diverse and real-world documents from arXiv and GitHub. In addition, we develop a DSE Evaluation S$^3$uite comprising Standardization, Segmentation and Scoring modules, to conduct a unified evaluation of state-of-the-art DSE approaches. By evaluating a range of pipeline tools, expert visual models, and general VLMs, we identify the gap between current work and the unified, realistic DSE objective for the first time. We aspire that READoc will catalyze future research in DSE, fostering more comprehensive and practical solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05137v2,2024-09
MHS-STMA: Multimodal Hate Speech Detection via Scalable Transformer-Based Multilevel Attention Framework,"Anusha Chhabra, Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma","Social media has a significant impact on people's lives. Hate speech on social media has emerged as one of society's most serious issues in recent years. Text and pictures are two forms of multimodal data that are distributed within articles. Unimodal analysis has been the primary emphasis of earlier approaches. Additionally, when doing multimodal analysis, researchers neglect to preserve the distinctive qualities associated with each modality. To address these shortcomings, the present article suggests a scalable architecture for multimodal hate content detection called transformer-based multilevel attention (STMA). This architecture consists of three main parts: a combined attention-based deep learning mechanism, a vision attention-mechanism encoder, and a caption attention-mechanism encoder. To identify hate content, each component uses various attention processes and handles multimodal data in a unique way. Several studies employing multiple assessment criteria on three hate speech datasets such as Hateful memes, MultiOff, and MMHS150K, validate the suggested architecture's efficacy. The outcomes demonstrate that on all three datasets, the suggested strategy performs better than the baseline approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05136v2,2024-09
Hate Content Detection via Novel Pre-Processing Sequencing and Ensemble Methods,"Anusha Chhabra, Dinesh Kumar Vishwakarma","Social media, particularly Twitter, has seen a significant increase in incidents like trolling and hate speech. Thus, identifying hate speech is the need of the hour. This paper introduces a computational framework to curb the hate content on the web. Specifically, this study presents an exhaustive study of pre-processing approaches by studying the impact of changing the sequence of text pre-processing operations for the identification of hate content. The best-performing pre-processing sequence, when implemented with popular classification approaches like Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and K-Neighbor provides a considerable boost in performance. Additionally, the best pre-processing sequence is used in conjunction with different ensemble methods, such as bagging, boosting and stacking to improve the performance further. Three publicly available benchmark datasets (WZ-LS, DT, and FOUNTA), were used to evaluate the proposed approach for hate speech identification. The proposed approach achieves a maximum accuracy of 95.14% highlighting the effectiveness of the unique pre-processing approach along with an ensemble classifier.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05134v1,2024-09
WaterSeeker: Pioneering Efficient Detection of Watermarked Segments in Large Documents,"Leyi Pan, Aiwei Liu, Yijian Lu, Zitian Gao, Yichen Di, Shiyu Huang, Lijie Wen, Irwin King, Philip S. Yu","Watermarking algorithms for large language models (LLMs) have attained high accuracy in detecting LLM-generated text. However, existing methods primarily focus on distinguishing fully watermarked text from non-watermarked text, overlooking real-world scenarios where LLMs generate only small sections within large documents. In this scenario, balancing time complexity and detection performance poses significant challenges. This paper presents WaterSeeker, a novel approach to efficiently detect and locate watermarked segments amid extensive natural text. It first applies an efficient anomaly extraction method to preliminarily locate suspicious watermarked regions. Following this, it conducts a local traversal and performs full-text detection for more precise verification. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that WaterSeeker achieves a superior balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, its localization capability lays the foundation for building interpretable AI detection systems.

EdaCSC: Two Easy Data Augmentation Methods for Chinese Spelling Correction,"Lei Sheng, Shuai-Shuai Xu","Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) aims to detect and correct spelling errors in Chinese sentences caused by phonetic or visual similarities. While current CSC models integrate pinyin or glyph features and have shown significant progress,they still face challenges when dealing with sentences containing multiple typos and are susceptible to overcorrection in real-world scenarios. In contrast to existing model-centric approaches, we propose two data augmentation methods to address these limitations. Firstly, we augment the dataset by either splitting long sentences into shorter ones or reducing typos in sentences with multiple typos. Subsequently, we employ different training processes to select the optimal model. Experimental evaluations on the SIGHAN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over most existing models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the SIGHAN15 test set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05105v1,2024-09
Evaluating Large Language Models with Tests of Spanish as a Foreign Language: Pass or Fail?,"Marina Mayor-Rocher, Nina Melero, Elena Merino-Gómez, María Grandury, Javier Conde, Pedro Reviriego","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been profusely evaluated on their ability to answer questions on many topics and their performance on different natural language understanding tasks. Those tests are usually conducted in English, but most LLM users are not native English speakers. Therefore, it is of interest to analyze how LLMs understand other languages at different levels: from paragraphs to morphems. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in TELEIA, a recently released benchmark with similar questions to those of Spanish exams for foreign students, covering topics such as reading comprehension, word formation, meaning and compositional semantics, and grammar. The results show that LLMs perform well at understanding Spanish but are still far from achieving the level of a native speaker in terms of grammatical competence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15334v1,2024-09
LLM-based Abstraction and Concretization for GUI Test Migration,"Yakun Zhang, Chen Liu, Xiaofei Xie, Yun Lin, Jin Song Dong, Dan Hao, Lu Zhang","GUI test migration aims to produce test cases with events and assertions to test specific functionalities of a target app. Existing migration approaches typically focus on the widget-mapping paradigm that maps widgets from source apps to target apps. However, since different apps may implement the same functionality in different ways, direct mapping may result in incomplete or buggy test cases, thus significantly impacting the effectiveness of testing target functionality and the practical applicability.   In this paper, we propose a new migration paradigm (i.e., abstraction-concretization paradigm) that first abstracts the test logic for the target functionality and then utilizes this logic to generate the concrete GUI test case. Furthermore, we introduce MACdroid, the first approach that migrates GUI test cases based on this paradigm. Specifically, we propose an abstraction technique that utilizes source test cases from source apps targeting the same functionality to extract a general test logic for that functionality. Then, we propose a concretization technique that utilizes the general test logic to guide an LLM in generating the corresponding GUI test case (including events and assertions) for the target app. We evaluate MACdroid on two widely-used datasets (including 31 apps, 34 functionalities, and 123 test cases). On the FrUITeR dataset, the test cases generated by MACdroid successfully test 64% of the target functionalities, improving the baselines by 191%. On the Lin dataset, MACdroid successfully tests 75% of the target functionalities, outperforming the baselines by 42%. These results underscore the effectiveness of MACdroid in GUI test migration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05028v1,2024-09
Vision-fused Attack: Advancing Aggressive and Stealthy Adversarial Text against Neural Machine Translation,"Yanni Xue, Haojie Hao, Jiakai Wang, Qiang Sheng, Renshuai Tao, Yu Liang, Pu Feng, Xianglong Liu","While neural machine translation (NMT) models achieve success in our daily lives, they show vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Despite being harmful, these attacks also offer benefits for interpreting and enhancing NMT models, thus drawing increased research attention. However, existing studies on adversarial attacks are insufficient in both attacking ability and human imperceptibility due to their sole focus on the scope of language. This paper proposes a novel vision-fused attack (VFA) framework to acquire powerful adversarial text, i.e., more aggressive and stealthy. Regarding the attacking ability, we design the vision-merged solution space enhancement strategy to enlarge the limited semantic solution space, which enables us to search for adversarial candidates with higher attacking ability. For human imperceptibility, we propose the perception-retained adversarial text selection strategy to align the human text-reading mechanism. Thus, the finally selected adversarial text could be more deceptive. Extensive experiments on various models, including large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA and GPT-3.5, strongly support that VFA outperforms the comparisons by large margins (up to 81%/14% improvements on ASR/SSIM).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05021v1,2024-09
Towards Patronizing and Condescending Language in Chinese Videos: A Multimodal Dataset and Detector,"Hongbo Wang, Junyu Lu, Yan Han, Kai Ma, Liang Yang, Hongfei Lin","Patronizing and Condescending Language (PCL) is a form of discriminatory toxic speech targeting vulnerable groups, threatening both online and offline safety. While toxic speech research has mainly focused on overt toxicity, such as hate speech, microaggressions in the form of PCL remain underexplored. Additionally, dominant groups' discriminatory facial expressions and attitudes toward vulnerable communities can be more impactful than verbal cues, yet these frame features are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce the PCLMM dataset, the first Chinese multimodal dataset for PCL, consisting of 715 annotated videos from Bilibili, with high-quality PCL facial frame spans. We also propose the MultiPCL detector, featuring a facial expression detection module for PCL recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of modality complementarity in this challenging task.

InstInfer: In-Storage Attention Offloading for Cost-Effective Long-Context LLM Inference,"Xiurui Pan, Endian Li, Qiao Li, Shengwen Liang, Yizhou Shan, Ke Zhou, Yingwei Luo, Xiaolin Wang, Jie Zhang","The widespread of Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant milestone in generative AI. Nevertheless, the increasing context length and batch size in offline LLM inference escalate the memory requirement of the key-value (KV) cache, which imposes a huge burden on the GPU VRAM, especially for resource-constraint scenarios (e.g., edge computing and personal devices). Several cost-effective solutions leverage host memory or SSDs to reduce storage costs for offline inference scenarios and improve the throughput. Nevertheless, they suffer from significant performance penalties imposed by intensive KV cache accesses due to limited PCIe bandwidth. To address these issues, we propose InstInfer, a novel LLM inference system that offloads the most performance-critical computation (i.e., attention in decoding phase) and data (i.e., KV cache) parts to Computational Storage Drives (CSDs), which minimize the enormous KV transfer overheads. InstInfer designs a dedicated flash-aware in-storage attention engine with KV cache management mechanisms to exploit the high internal bandwidths of CSDs instead of being limited by the PCIe bandwidth. The optimized P2P transmission between GPU and CSDs further reduces data migration overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that for a 13B model using an NVIDIA A6000 GPU, InstInfer improves throughput for long-sequence inference by up to 11.1$\times$, compared to existing SSD-based solutions such as FlexGen.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04992v1,2024-09
Evaluation of Google Translate for Mandarin Chinese translation using sentiment and semantic analysis,"Xuechun Wang, Rodney Beard, Rohitash Chandra","Machine translation using large language models (LLMs) is having a significant global impact, making communication easier. Mandarin Chinese is the official language used for communication by the government and media in China. In this study, we provide an automated assessment of translation quality of Google Translate with human experts using sentiment and semantic analysis. In order to demonstrate our framework, we select the classic early twentieth-century novel 'The True Story of Ah Q' with selected Mandarin Chinese to English translations. We use Google Translate to translate the given text into English and then conduct a chapter-wise sentiment analysis and semantic analysis to compare the extracted sentiments across the different translations. Our results indicate that the precision of Google Translate differs both in terms of semantic and sentiment analysis when compared to human expert translations. We find that Google Translate is unable to translate some of the specific words or phrases in Chinese, such as Chinese traditional allusions. The mistranslations may be due to lack of contextual significance and historical knowledge of China.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04964v2,2024-09
Maximizing Relation Extraction Potential: A Data-Centric Study to Unveil Challenges and Opportunities,"Anushka Swarup, Avanti Bhandarkar, Olivia P. Dizon-Paradis, Ronald Wilson, Damon L. Woodard","Relation extraction is a Natural Language Processing task that aims to extract relationships from textual data. It is a critical step for information extraction. Due to its wide-scale applicability, research in relation extraction has rapidly scaled to using highly advanced neural networks. Despite their computational superiority, modern relation extractors fail to handle complicated extraction scenarios. However, a comprehensive performance analysis of the state-of-the-art extractors that compile these challenges has been missing from the literature, and this paper aims to bridge this gap. The goal has been to investigate the possible data-centric characteristics that impede neural relation extraction. Based on extensive experiments conducted using 15 state-of-the-art relation extraction algorithms ranging from recurrent architectures to large language models and seven large-scale datasets, this research suggests that modern relation extractors are not robust to complex data and relation characteristics. It emphasizes pivotal issues, such as contextual ambiguity, correlating relations, long-tail data, and fine-grained relation distributions. In addition, it sets a marker for future directions to alleviate these issues, thereby proving to be a critical resource for novice and advanced researchers. Efficient handling of the challenges described can have significant implications for the field of information extraction, which is a critical part of popular systems such as search engines and chatbots.

Just ASR + LLM? A Study on Speech Large Language Models' Ability to Identify and Understand Speaker in Spoken Dialogue,"Junkai Wu, Xulin Fan, Bo-Ru Lu, Xilin Jiang, Nima Mesgarani, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, Mari Ostendorf","In recent years, we have observed a rapid advancement in speech language models (SpeechLLMs), catching up with humans' listening and reasoning abilities. SpeechLLMs have demonstrated impressive spoken dialog question-answering (SQA) performance in benchmarks like Gaokao, the English listening test of the college entrance exam in China, which seemingly requires understanding both the spoken content and voice characteristics of speakers in a conversation. However, after carefully examining Gaokao's questions, we find the correct answers to many questions can be inferred from the conversation transcript alone, i.e.\ without speaker segmentation and identification. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models Qwen-Audio and WavLLM on both Gaokao and our proposed ""What Do You Like?"" dataset shows a significantly higher accuracy in these context-based questions than in identity-critical questions, which can only be answered reliably with correct speaker identification. The results and analysis suggest that when solving SQA, the current SpeechLLMs exhibit limited speaker awareness from the audio and behave similarly to an LLM reasoning from the conversation transcription without sound. We propose that tasks focused on identity-critical questions could offer a more accurate evaluation framework of SpeechLLMs in SQA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04927v3,2024-09
DiVA-DocRE: A Discriminative and Voice-Aware Paradigm for Document-Level Relation Extraction,"Yiheng Wu, Roman Yangarber, Xian Mao","The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text comprehension and generation have revolutionized Information Extraction (IE). One such advancement is in Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (DocRTE), a critical task in information systems that aims to extract entities and their semantic relationships from documents. However, existing methods are primarily designed for Sentence level Relation Triplet Extraction (SentRTE), which typically handles a limited set of relations and triplet facts within a single sentence. Additionally, some approaches treat relations as candidate choices integrated into prompt templates, resulting in inefficient processing and suboptimal performance when determining the relation elements in triplets. To address these limitations, we introduce a Discriminative and Voice Aware Paradigm DiVA. DiVA involves only two steps: performing document-level relation extraction (DocRE) and then identifying the subject object entities based on the relation. No additional processing is required simply input the document to directly obtain the triplets. This streamlined process more accurately reflects real-world scenarios for triplet extraction. Our innovation lies in transforming DocRE into a discriminative task, where the model pays attention to each relation and to the often overlooked issue of active vs. passive voice within the triplet. Our experiments on the Re-DocRED and DocRED datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results for the DocRTE task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13717v1,2024-09
Constrained Multi-Layer Contrastive Learning for Implicit Discourse Relationship Recognition,"Yiheng Wu, Junhui Li, Muhua Zhu","Previous approaches to the task of implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) generally view it as a classification task. Even with pre-trained language models, like BERT and RoBERTa, IDRR still relies on complicated neural networks with multiple intermediate layers to proper capture the interaction between two discourse units. As a result, the outputs of these intermediate layers may have different capability in discriminating instances of different classes. To this end, we propose to adapt a supervised contrastive learning (CL) method, label- and instance-centered CL, to enhance representation learning. Moreover, we propose a novel constrained multi-layer CL approach to properly impose a constraint that the contrastive loss of higher layers should be smaller than that of lower layers. Experimental results on PDTB 2.0 and PDTB 3.0 show that our approach can significantly improve the performance on both multi-class classification and binary classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13716v1,2024-09
Introducing MeMo: A Multimodal Dataset for Memory Modelling in Multiparty Conversations,"Maria Tsfasman, Bernd Dudzik, Kristian Fenech, Andras Lorincz, Catholijn M. Jonker, Catharine Oertel","Conversational memory is the process by which humans encode, retain and retrieve verbal, non-verbal and contextual information from a conversation. Since human memory is selective, differing recollections of the same events can lead to misunderstandings and misalignments within a group. Yet, conversational facilitation systems, aimed at advancing the quality of group interactions, usually focus on tracking users' states within an individual session, ignoring what remains in each participant's memory after the interaction. Understanding conversational memory can be used as a source of information on the long-term development of social connections within a group. This paper introduces the MeMo corpus, the first conversational dataset annotated with participants' memory retention reports, aimed at facilitating computational modelling of human conversational memory. The MeMo corpus includes 31 hours of small-group discussions on Covid-19, repeated 3 times over the term of 2 weeks. It integrates validated behavioural and perceptual measures, audio, video, and multimodal annotations, offering a valuable resource for studying and modelling conversational memory and group dynamics. By introducing the MeMo corpus, analysing its validity, and demonstrating its usefulness for future research, this paper aims to pave the way for future research in conversational memory modelling for intelligent system development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13715v2,2024-09
Achieving Peak Performance for Large Language Models: A Systematic Review,"Zhyar Rzgar K Rostam, Sándor Szénási, Gábor Kertész","In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP). LLMs require an extreme amount of parameters to attain high performance. As models grow into the trillion-parameter range, computational and memory costs increase significantly. This makes it difficult for many researchers to access the resources needed to train or apply these models. Optimizing LLM performance involves two main approaches: fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific tasks to achieve state-of-the-art performance, and reducing costs or improving training time while maintaining similar performance. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. We reviewed 65 publications out of 983 from 2017 to December 2023, retrieved from 5 databases. The study presents methods to optimize and accelerate LLMs while achieving cutting-edge results without sacrificing accuracy. We begin with an overview of the development of language modeling, followed by a detailed explanation of commonly used frameworks and libraries, and a taxonomy for improving and speeding up LLMs based on three classes: LLM training, LLM inference, and system serving. We then delve into recent optimization and acceleration strategies such as training optimization, hardware optimization, scalability and reliability, accompanied by the taxonomy and categorization of these strategies. Finally, we provide an in-depth comparison of each class and strategy, with two case studies on optimizing model training and enhancing inference efficiency. These case studies showcase practical approaches to address LLM resource limitations while maintaining performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04833v1,2024-09
MILE: A Mutation Testing Framework of In-Context Learning Systems,"Zeming Wei, Yihao Zhang, Meng Sun","In-context Learning (ICL) has achieved notable success in the applications of large language models (LLMs). By adding only a few input-output pairs that demonstrate a new task, the LLM can efficiently learn the task during inference without modifying the model parameters. Such mysterious ability of LLMs has attracted great research interests in understanding, formatting, and improving the in-context demonstrations, while still suffering from drawbacks like black-box mechanisms and sensitivity against the selection of examples. In this work, inspired by the foundations of adopting testing techniques in machine learning (ML) systems, we propose a mutation testing framework designed to characterize the quality and effectiveness of test data for ICL systems. First, we propose several mutation operators specialized for ICL demonstrations, as well as corresponding mutation scores for ICL test sets. With comprehensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of our framework in evaluating the reliability and quality of ICL test suites. Our code is available at https://github.com/weizeming/MILE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04831v1,2024-09
Exploring Straightforward Conversational Red-Teaming,"George Kour, Naama Zwerdling, Marcel Zalmanovici, Ateret Anaby-Tavor, Ora Nova Fandina, Eitan Farchi","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in business dialogue systems but they pose security and ethical risks. Multi-turn conversations, where context influences the model's behavior, can be exploited to produce undesired responses. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of utilizing off-the-shelf LLMs in straightforward red-teaming approaches, where an attacker LLM aims to elicit undesired output from a target LLM, comparing both single-turn and conversational red-teaming tactics. Our experiments offer insights into various usage strategies that significantly affect their performance as red teamers. They suggest that off-the-shelf models can act as effective red teamers and even adjust their attack strategy based on past attempts, although their effectiveness decreases with greater alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04822v1,2024-09
Phrase-Level Adversarial Training for Mitigating Bias in Neural Network-based Automatic Essay Scoring,"Haddad Philip, Tsegaye Misikir Tashu","Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) is widely used to evaluate candidates for educational purposes. However, due to the lack of representative data, most existing AES systems are not robust, and their scoring predictions are biased towards the most represented data samples. In this study, we propose a model-agnostic phrase-level method to generate an adversarial essay set to address the biases and robustness of AES models. Specifically, we construct an attack test set comprising samples from the original test set and adversarially generated samples using our proposed method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the attack strategy and data augmentation, we conducted a comprehensive analysis utilizing various neural network scoring models. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves AES model performance in the presence of adversarial examples and scenarios without such attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04795v1,2024-09
Selective Self-Rehearsal: A Fine-Tuning Approach to Improve Generalization in Large Language Models,"Sonam Gupta, Yatin Nandwani, Asaf Yehudai, Mayank Mishra, Gaurav Pandey, Dinesh Raghu, Sachindra Joshi","Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) on specific datasets is a common practice to improve performance on target tasks. However, this performance gain often leads to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized in either the task or the characteristics of the training data, resulting in a loss of generalization. This paper introduces Selective Self-Rehearsal (SSR), a fine-tuning approach that achieves performance comparable to the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) while improving generalization. SSR leverages the fact that there can be multiple valid responses to a query. By utilizing the model's correct responses, SSR reduces model specialization during the fine-tuning stage. SSR first identifies the correct model responses from the training set by deploying an appropriate LLM as a judge. Then, it fine-tunes the model using the correct model responses and the gold response for the remaining samples. The effectiveness of SSR is demonstrated through experiments on the task of identifying unanswerable queries across various datasets. The results show that standard SFT can lead to an average performance drop of up to $16.7\%$ on multiple benchmarks, such as MMLU and TruthfulQA. In contrast, SSR results in close to $2\%$ drop on average, indicating better generalization capabilities compared to standard SFT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04787v1,2024-09
TracrBench: Generating Interpretability Testbeds with Large Language Models,"Hannes Thurnherr, Jérémy Scheurer","Achieving a mechanistic understanding of transformer-based language models is an open challenge, especially due to their large number of parameters. Moreover, the lack of ground truth mappings between model weights and their functional roles hinders the effective evaluation of interpretability methods, impeding overall progress. Tracr, a method for generating compiled transformers with inherent ground truth mappings in RASP, has been proposed to address this issue. However, manually creating a large number of models needed for verifying interpretability methods is labour-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we present a novel approach for generating interpretability test beds using large language models (LLMs) and introduce TracrBench, a novel dataset consisting of 121 manually written and LLM-generated, human-validated RASP programs and their corresponding transformer weights. During this process, we evaluate the ability of frontier LLMs to autonomously generate RASP programs and find that this task poses significant challenges. GPT-4-turbo, with a 20-shot prompt and best-of-5 sampling, correctly implements only 57 out of 101 test programs, necessitating the manual implementation of the remaining programs. With its 121 samples, TracrBench aims to serve as a valuable testbed for evaluating and comparing interpretability methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13714v1,2024-09
LoCa: Logit Calibration for Knowledge Distillation,"Runming Yang, Taiqiang Wu, Yujiu Yang","Knowledge Distillation (KD), aiming to train a better student model by mimicking the teacher model, plays an important role in model compression. One typical way is to align the output logits. However, we find a common issue named mis-instruction, that the student would be misled when the predictions based on teacher logits do not follow the labels. Meanwhile, there is other useful dark knowledge in the logits such as the class discriminability, which is vital for distillation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Logit Calibration (LoCa) method, which calibrates the logits from the teacher model based on the ground-truth labels. The key insight is to correct the prediction (to address the mis-instruction issue) and maintain useful dark knowledge simultaneously. Our proposed LoCa does not require any additional parameters. Empirical results on image classification and text generation tasks demonstrate that LoCa can effectively improve the performance of baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04778v1,2024-09
Untie the Knots: An Efficient Data Augmentation Strategy for Long-Context Pre-Training in Language Models,"Junfeng Tian, Da Zheng, Yang Cheng, Rui Wang, Colin Zhang, Debing Zhang","Large language models (LLM) have prioritized expanding the context window from which models can incorporate more information. However, training models to handle long contexts presents significant challenges. These include the scarcity of high-quality natural long-context data, the potential for performance degradation on short-context tasks, and the reduced training efficiency associated with attention mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce Untie the Knots (\textbf{UtK}), a novel data augmentation strategy employed during the continue pre-training phase, designed to efficiently enable LLMs to gain long-context capabilities without the need to modify the existing data mixture. In particular, we chunk the documents, shuffle the chunks, and create a complex and knotted structure of long texts; LLMs are then trained to untie these knots and identify relevant segments within seemingly chaotic token sequences. This approach greatly improves the model's performance by accurately attending to relevant information in long context and the training efficiency is also largely increased. We conduct extensive experiments on models with 7B and 72B parameters, trained on 20 billion tokens, demonstrating that UtK achieves 75\% and 84.5\% accurracy on RULER at 128K context length, significantly outperforming other long context strategies. The trained models will open-source for further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04774v1,2024-09
Sentiment Informed Sentence BERT-Ensemble Algorithm for Depression Detection,"Bayode Ogunleye, Hemlata Sharma, Olamilekan Shobayo","The World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed approximately 280 million people in the world suffer from depression. Yet, existing studies on early-stage depression detection using machine learning (ML) techniques are limited. Prior studies have applied a single stand-alone algorithm, which is unable to deal with data complexities, prone to overfitting, and limited in generalization. To this end, our paper examined the performance of several ML algorithms for early-stage depression detection using two benchmark social media datasets (D1 and D2). More specifically, we incorporated sentiment indicators to improve our model performance. Our experimental results showed that sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (SBERT) numerical vectors fitted into the stacking ensemble model achieved comparable F1 scores of 69% in the dataset (D1) and 76% in the dataset (D2). Our findings suggest that utilizing sentiment indicators as an additional feature for depression detection yields an improved model performance, and thus, we recommend the development of a depressive term corpus for future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13713v1,2024-09
Property Neurons in Self-Supervised Speech Transformers,"Tzu-Quan Lin, Guan-Ting Lin, Hung-yi Lee, Hao Tang","There have been many studies on analyzing self-supervised speech Transformers, in particular, with layer-wise analysis. It is, however, desirable to have an approach that can pinpoint exactly a subset of neurons that is responsible for a particular property of speech, being amenable to model pruning and model editing. In this work, we identify a set of property neurons in the feedforward layers of Transformers to study how speech-related properties, such as phones, gender, and pitch, are stored. When removing neurons of a particular property (a simple form of model editing), the respective downstream performance significantly degrades, showing the importance of the property neurons. We apply this approach to pruning the feedforward layers in Transformers, where most of the model parameters are. We show that protecting property neurons during pruning is significantly more effective than norm-based pruning. The code for identifying property neurons is available at https://github.com/nervjack2/PropertyNeurons.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05910v2,2024-09
Late Chunking: Contextual Chunk Embeddings Using Long-Context Embedding Models,"Michael Günther, Isabelle Mohr, Daniel James Williams, Bo Wang, Han Xiao","Many use cases require retrieving smaller portions of text, and dense vector-based retrieval systems often perform better with shorter text segments, as the semantics are less likely to be over-compressed in the embeddings. Consequently, practitioners often split text documents into smaller chunks and encode them separately. However, chunk embeddings created in this way can lose contextual information from surrounding chunks, resulting in sub-optimal representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called late chunking, which leverages long context embedding models to first embed all tokens of the long text, with chunking applied after the transformer model and just before mean pooling - hence the term late in its naming. The resulting chunk embeddings capture the full contextual information, leading to superior results across various retrieval tasks. The method is generic enough to be applied to a wide range of long-context embedding models and works without additional training. To further increase the effectiveness of late chunking, we propose a dedicated fine-tuning approach for embedding models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04701v2,2024-09
"Good Idea or Not, Representation of LLM Could Tell","Yi Xu, Bo Xue, Shuqian Sheng, Cheng Deng, Jiaxin Ding, Zanwei Shen, Luoyi Fu, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou","In the ever-expanding landscape of academic research, the proliferation of ideas presents a significant challenge for researchers: discerning valuable ideas from the less impactful ones. The ability to efficiently evaluate the potential of these ideas is crucial for the advancement of science and paper review. In this work, we focus on idea assessment, which aims to leverage the knowledge of large language models to assess the merit of scientific ideas. First, we investigate existing text evaluation research and define the problem of quantitative evaluation of ideas. Second, we curate and release a benchmark dataset from nearly four thousand manuscript papers with full texts, meticulously designed to train and evaluate the performance of different approaches to this task. Third, we establish a framework for quantifying the value of ideas by employing representations in a specific layer of large language models. Experimental results show that the scores predicted by our method are relatively consistent with those of humans. Our findings suggest that the representations of large language models hold more potential in quantifying the value of ideas than their generative outputs, demonstrating a promising avenue for automating the idea assessment process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13712v1,2024-09
QueryBuilder: Human-in-the-Loop Query Development for Information Retrieval,"Hemanth Kandula, Damianos Karakos, Haoling Qiu, Benjamin Rozonoyer, Ian Soboroff, Lee Tarlin, Bonan Min","Frequently, users of an Information Retrieval (IR) system start with an overarching information need (a.k.a., an analytic task) and proceed to define finer-grained queries covering various important aspects (i.e., sub-topics) of that analytic task. We present a novel, interactive system called $\textit{QueryBuilder}$, which allows a novice, English-speaking user to create queries with a small amount of effort, through efficient exploration of an English development corpus in order to rapidly develop cross-lingual information retrieval queries corresponding to the user's information needs. QueryBuilder performs near real-time retrieval of documents based on user-entered search terms; the user looks through the retrieved documents and marks sentences as relevant to the information needed. The marked sentences are used by the system as additional information in query formation and refinement: query terms (and, optionally, event features, which capture event $'triggers'$ (indicator terms) and agent/patient roles) are appropriately weighted, and a neural-based system, which better captures textual meaning, retrieves other relevant content. The process of retrieval and marking is repeated as many times as desired, giving rise to increasingly refined queries in each iteration. The final product is a fine-grained query used in Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR). Our experiments using analytic tasks and requests from the IARPA BETTER IR datasets show that with a small amount of effort (at most 10 minutes per sub-topic), novice users can form $\textit{useful}$ fine-grained queries including in languages they don't understand. QueryBuilder also provides beneficial capabilities to the traditional corpus exploration and query formation process.

Sparse Rewards Can Self-Train Dialogue Agents,"Barrett Martin Lattimer, Varun Gangal, Ryan McDonald, Yi Yang","Recent advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) Large Language Model (LLM) agents, especially in multi-turn dialogue tasks, have been primarily driven by supervised fine-tuning and high-quality human feedback. However, as base LLM models continue to improve, acquiring meaningful human feedback has become increasingly challenging and costly. In certain domains, base LLM agents may eventually exceed human capabilities, making traditional feedback-driven methods impractical. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-improvement paradigm that empowers LLM agents to autonomously enhance their performance without external human feedback. Our method, Juxtaposed Outcomes for Simulation Harvesting (JOSH), is a self-alignment algorithm that leverages a sparse reward simulation environment to extract ideal behaviors and further train the LLM on its own outputs. We present ToolWOZ, a sparse reward tool-calling simulation environment derived from MultiWOZ. We demonstrate that models trained with JOSH, both small and frontier, significantly improve tool-based interactions while preserving general model capabilities across diverse benchmarks.

BPE Gets Picky: Efficient Vocabulary Refinement During Tokenizer Training,"Pavel Chizhov, Catherine Arnett, Elizaveta Korotkova, Ivan P. Yamshchikov","Language models can largely benefit from efficient tokenization. However, they still mostly utilize the classical BPE algorithm, a simple and reliable method. This has been shown to cause such issues as under-trained tokens and sub-optimal compression that may affect the downstream performance. We introduce Picky BPE, a modified BPE algorithm that carries out vocabulary refinement during tokenizer training. Our method improves vocabulary efficiency, eliminates under-trained tokens, and does not compromise text compression. Our experiments show that our method does not reduce the downstream performance, and in several cases improves it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04599v1,2024-09

Customizing Large Language Model Generation Style using Parameter-Efficient Finetuning,"Xinyue Liu, Harshita Diddee, Daphne Ippolito","One-size-fits-all large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to help people with their writing. However, the style these models are trained to write in may not suit all users or use cases. LLMs would be more useful as writing assistants if their idiolect could be customized to match each user. In this paper, we explore whether parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation can effectively guide the style of LLM generations. We use this method to customize LLaMA-2 to ten different authors and show that the generated text has lexical, syntactic, and surface alignment with the target author but struggles with content memorization. Our findings highlight the potential of PEFT to support efficient, user-level customization of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04574v1,2024-09
How Does Code Pretraining Affect Language Model Task Performance?,"Jackson Petty, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Tal Linzen","Large language models are increasingly trained on corpora containing both natural language and non-linguistic data like source code. Aside from aiding programming-related tasks, anecdotal evidence suggests that including code in pretraining corpora may improve performance on other, unrelated tasks, yet to date no work has been able to establish a causal connection by controlling between language and code data. Here we do just this. We pretrain language models on datasets which interleave natural language and code in two different settings: additive, in which the total volume of data seen during pretraining is held constant; and competitive, in which the volume of language data is held constant. We study how the pretraining mixture affects performance on (a) a diverse collection of tasks included in the BigBench benchmark, and (b) compositionality, measured by generalization accuracy on semantic parsing and syntactic transformations. We find that pretraining on higher proportions of code improves performance on compositional tasks involving structured output (like semantic parsing), and mathematics. Conversely, increase code mixture can harm performance on other tasks, including on tasks that requires sensitivity to linguistic structure such as syntax or morphology, and tasks measuring real-world knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04556v1,2024-09
RLPF: Reinforcement Learning from Prediction Feedback for User Summarization with LLMs,"Jiaxing Wu, Lin Ning, Luyang Liu, Harrison Lee, Neo Wu, Chao Wang, Sushant Prakash, Shawn O'Banion, Bradley Green, Jun Xie","LLM-powered personalization agent systems employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict users' behavior from their past activities. However, their effectiveness often hinges on the ability to effectively leverage extensive, long user historical data due to its inherent noise and length of such data. Existing pretrained LLMs may generate summaries that are concise but lack the necessary context for downstream tasks, hindering their utility in personalization systems. To address these challenges, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Prediction Feedback (RLPF). RLPF fine-tunes LLMs to generate concise, human-readable user summaries that are optimized for downstream task performance. By maximizing the usefulness of the generated summaries, RLPF effectively distills extensive user history data while preserving essential information for downstream tasks. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in both extrinsic downstream task utility and intrinsic summary quality, surpassing baseline methods by up to 22% on downstream task performance and achieving an up to 84.59% win rate on Factuality, Abstractiveness, and Readability. RLPF also achieves a remarkable 74% reduction in context length while improving performance on 16 out of 19 unseen tasks and/or datasets, showcasing its generalizability. This approach offers a promising solution for enhancing LLM personalization by effectively transforming long, noisy user histories into informative and human-readable representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04421v1,2024-09
Chain-of-Translation Prompting (CoTR): A Novel Prompting Technique for Low Resource Languages,"Tejas Deshpande, Nidhi Kowtal, Raviraj Joshi","This paper introduces Chain of Translation Prompting (CoTR), a novel strategy designed to enhance the performance of language models in low-resource languages. CoTR restructures prompts to first translate the input context from a low-resource language into a higher-resource language, such as English. The specified task like generation, classification, or any other NLP function is then performed on the translated text, with the option to translate the output back to the original language if needed. All these steps are specified in a single prompt. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method through a case study on the low-resource Indic language Marathi. The CoTR strategy is applied to various tasks, including sentiment analysis, hate speech classification, subject classification and text generation, and its efficacy is showcased by comparing it with regular prompting methods. Our results underscore the potential of translation-based prompting strategies to significantly improve multilingual LLM performance in low-resource languages, offering valuable insights for future research and applications. We specifically see the highest accuracy improvements with the hate speech detection task. The technique also has the potential to enhance the quality of synthetic data generation for underrepresented languages using LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04512v2,2024-09

Empirical Bayesian image restoration by Langevin sampling with a denoising diffusion implicit prior,"Charlesquin Kemajou Mbakam, Jean-Francois Giovannelli, Marcelo Pereyra","Score-based diffusion methods provide a powerful strategy to solve image restoration tasks by flexibly combining a pre-trained foundational prior model with a likelihood function specified during test time. Such methods are predominantly derived from two stochastic processes: reversing Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, which underpins the celebrated denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM), and the Langevin diffusion process. The solutions delivered by DDPM and DDIM are often remarkably realistic, but they are not always consistent with measurements because of likelihood intractability issues and the associated required approximations. Alternatively, using a Langevin process circumvents the intractable likelihood issue, but usually leads to restoration results of inferior quality and longer computing times. This paper presents a novel and highly computationally efficient image restoration method that carefully embeds a foundational DDPM denoiser within an empirical Bayesian Langevin algorithm, which jointly calibrates key model hyper-parameters as it estimates the model's posterior mean. Extensive experimental results on three canonical tasks (image deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting) demonstrate that the proposed approach improves on state-of-the-art strategies both in image estimation accuracy and computing time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04384v1,2024-09
You can remove GPT2's LayerNorm by fine-tuning,Stefan Heimersheim,"The LayerNorm (LN) layer in GPT-style transformer models has long been a hindrance to mechanistic interpretability. LN is a crucial component required to stabilize the training of large language models, and LN or the similar RMSNorm have been used in practically all large language models based on the transformer architecture. The non-linear nature of the LN layers is a hindrance for mechanistic interpretability as it hinders interpretation of the residual stream, and makes it difficult to decompose the model into circuits. Some researchers have gone so far as to name ""reasons interpretability researchers hate layer norm.""   In this paper we show that it is possible to remove the LN layers from a pre-trained GPT2-small model by fine-tuning on a fraction (500M tokens) of the training data. We demonstrate that this LN-free model achieves similar performance to the original model on the OpenWebText and ThePile datasets (-0.05 cross-entropy loss), and the Hellaswag benchmark (-0.5% accuracy). We provide our implementation at https://github.com/ApolloResearch/gpt2_noLN, and fine-tuned GPT2-small models at https://huggingface.co/apollo-research/gpt2_noLN.   Our work not only provides a simplified model for mechanistic interpretability research, but also provides evidence that the LN layers, at inference time, do not play a crucial role in transformer models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13710v2,2024-09
Programming Refusal with Conditional Activation Steering,"Bruce W. Lee, Inkit Padhi, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Erik Miehling, Pierre Dognin, Manish Nagireddy, Amit Dhurandhar","LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities, but precisely controlling their response behavior remains challenging. Existing activation steering methods alter LLM behavior indiscriminately, limiting their practical applicability in settings where selective responses are essential, such as content moderation or domain-specific assistants. In this paper, we propose Conditional Activation Steering (CAST), which analyzes LLM activation patterns during inference to selectively apply or withhold activation steering based on the input context. Our method is based on the observation that different categories of prompts activate distinct patterns in the model's hidden states. Using CAST, one can systematically control LLM behavior with rules like ""if input is about hate speech or adult content, then refuse"" or ""if input is not about legal advice, then refuse."" This allows for selective modification of responses to specific content while maintaining normal responses to other content, all without requiring weight optimization. We release an open-source implementation of our framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05907v1,2024-09
AGR: Age Group fairness Reward for Bias Mitigation in LLMs,"Shuirong Cao, Ruoxi Cheng, Zhiqiang Wang","LLMs can exhibit age biases, resulting in unequal treatment of individuals across age groups. While much research has addressed racial and gender biases, age bias remains little explored. The scarcity of instruction-tuning and preference datasets for age bias hampers its detection and measurement, and existing fine-tuning methods seldom address age-related fairness. In this paper, we construct age bias preference datasets and instruction-tuning datasets for RLHF. We introduce ARG, an age fairness reward to reduce differences in the response quality of LLMs across different age groups. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reward significantly improves response accuracy and reduces performance disparities across age groups.

This year's SemTab challenge introduced the ``Metadata to KG'' track, which focuses on performing STI by using only metadata information, without access to the underlying data. In response to this new challenge, we introduce a new term: Column Vocabulary Association (CVA). This term refers to the task of semantic annotation of column headers solely based on metadata information. In this study, we evaluate the performance of various methods in executing the CVA task, including a Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, as well as a more traditional similarity approach with SemanticBERT. Our methodology uses a zero-shot setting, with no pretraining or examples passed to the Large Language Models (LLMs), as we aim to avoid a domain-specific setting.   We investigate a total of 7 different LLMs, of which three commercial GPT models (i.e. gpt-3.5-turbo-0.125, gpt-4o and gpt-4-turbo) and four open source models (i.e. llama3-80b, llama3-7b, gemma-7b and mixtral-8x7b). We integrate this models with RAG systems, and we explore how variations in temperature settings affect performances. Moreover, we continue our investigation by performing the CVA task utilizing SemanticBERT, analyzing how various metadata information influence its performance.   Initial findings indicate that LLMs generally perform well at temperatures below 1.0, achieving an accuracy of 100\% in certain cases. Nevertheless, our investigation also reveal that the nature of the data significantly influences CVA task outcomes. In fact, in cases where the input data and glossary are related (for example by being created by the same organizations) traditional methods appear to surpass the performance of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13709v1,2024-09
Learning vs Retrieval: The Role of In-Context Examples in Regression with LLMs,"Aliakbar Nafar, Kristen Brent Venable, Parisa Kordjamshidi","Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of being in-context learners. However, the underlying mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) is still a major research question, and experimental research results about how models exploit ICL are not always consistent. In this work, we propose a framework for evaluating in-context learning mechanisms, which we claim are a combination of retrieving internal knowledge and learning from in-context examples by focusing on regression tasks. First, we show that LLMs can perform regression on real-world datasets and then design experiments to measure the extent to which the LLM retrieves its internal knowledge versus learning from in-context examples. We argue that this process lies on a spectrum between these two extremes. We provide an in-depth analysis of the degrees to which these mechanisms are triggered depending on various factors, such as prior knowledge about the tasks and the type and richness of the information provided by the in-context examples. We employ three LLMs and utilize multiple datasets to corroborate the robustness of our findings. Our results shed light on how to engineer prompts to leverage meta-learning from in-context examples and foster knowledge retrieval depending on the problem being addressed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04318v1,2024-09
Towards Safe Multilingual Frontier AI,"Artūrs Kanepajs, Vladimir Ivanov, Richard Moulange","Linguistically inclusive LLMs -- which maintain good performance regardless of the language with which they are prompted -- are necessary for the diffusion of AI benefits around the world. Multilingual jailbreaks that rely on language translation to evade safety measures undermine the safe and inclusive deployment of AI systems. We provide policy recommendations to enhance the multilingual capabilities of AI while mitigating the risks of multilingual jailbreaks. We examine how a language's level of resourcing relates to how vulnerable LLMs are to multilingual jailbreaks in that language. We do this by testing five advanced AI models across 24 official languages of the EU. Building on prior research, we propose policy actions that align with the EU legal landscape and institutional framework to address multilingual jailbreaks, while promoting linguistic inclusivity. These include mandatory assessments of multilingual capabilities and vulnerabilities, public opinion research, and state support for multilingual AI development. The measures aim to improve AI safety and functionality through EU policy initiatives, guiding the implementation of the EU AI Act and informing regulatory efforts of the European AI Office.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13708v2,2024-09
Using Large Language Models to Generate Authentic Multi-agent Knowledge Work Datasets,"Desiree Heim, Christian Jilek, Adrian Ulges, Andreas Dengel","Current publicly available knowledge work data collections lack diversity, extensive annotations, and contextual information about the users and their documents. These issues hinder objective and comparable data-driven evaluations and optimizations of knowledge work assistance systems. Due to the considerable resources needed to collect such data in real-life settings and the necessity of data censorship, collecting such a dataset appears nearly impossible. For this reason, we propose a configurable, multi-agent knowledge work dataset generator. This system simulates collaborative knowledge work among agents producing Large Language Model-generated documents and accompanying data traces. Additionally, the generator captures all background information, given in its configuration or created during the simulation process, in a knowledge graph. Finally, the resulting dataset can be utilized and shared without privacy or confidentiality concerns.   This paper introduces our approach's design and vision and focuses on generating authentic knowledge work documents using Large Language Models. Our study involving human raters who assessed 53% of the generated and 74% of the real documents as realistic demonstrates the potential of our approach. Furthermore, we analyze the authenticity criteria mentioned in the participants' comments and elaborate on potential improvements for identified common issues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04286v2,2024-09

"An overview of domain-specific foundation model: key technologies, applications and challenges","Haolong Chen, Hanzhi Chen, Zijian Zhao, Kaifeng Han, Guangxu Zhu, Yichen Zhao, Ying Du, Wei Xu, Qingjiang Shi","The impressive performance of ChatGPT and other foundation-model-based products in human language understanding has prompted both academia and industry to explore how these models can be tailored for specific industries and application scenarios. This process, known as the customization of domain-specific foundation models, addresses the limitations of general-purpose models, which may not fully capture the unique patterns and requirements of domain-specific data. Despite its importance, there is a notable lack of comprehensive overview papers on building domain-specific foundation models, while numerous resources exist for general-purpose models. To bridge this gap, this article provides a timely and thorough overview of the methodology for customizing domain-specific foundation models. It introduces basic concepts, outlines the general architecture, and surveys key methods for constructing domain-specific models. Furthermore, the article discusses various domains that can benefit from these specialized models and highlights the challenges ahead. Through this overview, we aim to offer valuable guidance and reference for researchers and practitioners from diverse fields to develop their own customized foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04267v1,2024-09
Retrieval Augmented Generation-Based Incident Resolution Recommendation System for IT Support,"Paulina Toro Isaza, Michael Nidd, Noah Zheutlin, Jae-wook Ahn, Chidansh Amitkumar Bhatt, Yu Deng, Ruchi Mahindru, Martin Franz, Hans Florian, Salim Roukos","Clients wishing to implement generative AI in the domain of IT Support and AIOps face two critical issues: domain coverage and model size constraints due to model choice limitations. Clients might choose to not use larger proprietary models such as GPT-4 due to cost and privacy concerns and so are limited to smaller models with potentially less domain coverage that do not generalize to the client's domain. Retrieval augmented generation is a common solution that addresses both of these issues: a retrieval system first retrieves the necessary domain knowledge which a smaller generative model leverages as context for generation. We present a system developed for a client in the IT Support domain for support case solution recommendation that combines retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for answer generation with an encoder-only model for classification and a generative large language model for query generation. We cover architecture details, data collection and annotation, development journey and preliminary validations, expected final deployment process and evaluation plans, and finally lessons learned.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13707v1,2024-09
Decolonising Data Systems: Using Jyutping or Pinyin as tonal representations of Chinese names for data linkage,"Joseph Lam, Mario Cortina-Borja, Robert Aldridge, Ruth Blackburn, Katie Harron","Data linkage is increasingly used in health research and policy making and is relied on for understanding health inequalities. However, linked data is only as useful as the underlying data quality, and differential linkage rates may induce selection bias in the linked data. A mechanism that selectively compromises data quality is name romanisation. Converting text of a different writing system into Latin based writing, or romanisation, has long been the standard process of representing names in character-based writing systems such as Chinese, Vietnamese, and other languages such as Swahili. Unstandardised romanisation of Chinese characters, due in part to problems of preserving the correct name orders the lack of proper phonetic representation of a tonal language, has resulted in poor linkage rates for Chinese immigrants. This opinion piece aims to suggests that the use of standardised romanisation systems for Cantonese (Jyutping) or Mandarin (Pinyin) Chinese, which incorporate tonal information, could improve linkage rates and accuracy for individuals with Chinese names. We used 771 Chinese and English names scraped from openly available sources, and compared the utility of Jyutping, Pinyin and the Hong Kong Government Romanisation system (HKG-romanisation) for representing Chinese names. We demonstrate that both Jyutping and Pinyin result in fewer errors compared with the HKG-romanisation system. We suggest that collecting and preserving people's names in their original writing systems is ethically and socially pertinent. This may inform development of language-specific pre-processing and linkage paradigms that result in more inclusive research data which better represents the targeted populations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13706v1,2024-09
Fast Forwarding Low-Rank Training,"Adir Rahamim, Naomi Saphra, Sara Kangaslahti, Yonatan Belinkov","Parameter efficient finetuning methods like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) aim to reduce the computational costs of finetuning pretrained Language Models (LMs). Enabled by these low-rank settings, we propose an even more efficient optimization strategy: Fast Forward, a simple and effective approach to accelerate large segments of training. In a Fast Forward stage, we repeat the most recent optimizer step until the loss stops improving on a tiny validation set. By alternating between regular optimization steps and Fast Forward stages, Fast Forward provides up to an 87\% reduction in FLOPs and up to an 81\% reduction in train time over standard SGD with Adam. We validate Fast Forward by finetuning various models on different tasks and demonstrate that it speeds up training without compromising model performance. Additionally, we analyze when and how to apply Fast Forward.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04206v1,2024-09
Residual Stream Analysis with Multi-Layer SAEs,"Tim Lawson, Lucy Farnik, Conor Houghton, Laurence Aitchison","Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising approach to interpreting the internal representations of transformer language models. However, SAEs are usually trained separately on each transformer layer, making it difficult to use them to study how information flows across layers. To solve this problem, we introduce the multi-layer SAE (MLSAE): a single SAE trained on the residual stream activation vectors from every transformer layer. Given that the residual stream is understood to preserve information across layers, we expected MLSAE latents to `switch on' at a token position and remain active at later layers. Interestingly, we find that individual latents are often active at a single layer for a given token or prompt, but this layer may differ for different tokens or prompts. We quantify these phenomena by defining a distribution over layers and considering its variance. We find that the variance of the distributions of latent activations over layers is about two orders of magnitude greater when aggregating over tokens compared with a single token. For larger underlying models, the degree to which latents are active at multiple layers increases, which is consistent with the fact that the residual stream activation vectors at adjacent layers become more similar. Finally, we relax the assumption that the residual stream basis is the same at every layer by applying pre-trained tuned-lens transformations, but our findings remain qualitatively similar. Our results represent a new approach to understanding how representations change as they flow through transformers. We release our code to train and analyze MLSAEs at https://github.com/tim-lawson/mlsae.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04185v2,2024-09
GALLa: Graph Aligned Large Language Models for Improved Source Code Understanding,"Ziyin Zhang, Hang Yu, Shijie Li, Peng Di, Jianguo Li, Rui Wang","Programming languages possess rich semantic information such as data flow that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Model. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with four different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 8B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04183v1,2024-09
Combining LLMs and Knowledge Graphs to Reduce Hallucinations in Question Answering,"Larissa Pusch, Tim O. F. Conrad","Advancements in natural language processing have revolutionized the way we can interact with digital information systems, such as databases, making them more accessible. However, challenges persist, especially when accuracy is critical, as in the biomedical domain. A key issue is the hallucination problem, where models generate information unsupported by the underlying data, potentially leading to dangerous misinformation. This paper presents a novel approach designed to bridge this gap by combining Large Language Models (LLM) and Knowledge Graphs (KG) to improve the accuracy and reliability of question-answering systems, on the example of a biomedical KG. Built on the LangChain framework, our method incorporates a query checker that ensures the syntactical and semantic validity of LLM-generated queries, which are then used to extract information from a Knowledge Graph, substantially reducing errors like hallucinations. We evaluated the overall performance using a new benchmark dataset of 50 biomedical questions, testing several LLMs, including GPT-4 Turbo and llama3:70b. Our results indicate that while GPT-4 Turbo outperforms other models in generating accurate queries, open-source models like llama3:70b show promise with appropriate prompt engineering. To make this approach accessible, a user-friendly web-based interface has been developed, allowing users to input natural language queries, view generated and corrected Cypher queries, and verify the resulting paths for accuracy. Overall, this hybrid approach effectively addresses common issues such as data gaps and hallucinations, offering a reliable and intuitive solution for question answering systems. The source code for generating the results of this paper and for the user-interface can be found in our Git repository: https://git.zib.de/lpusch/cyphergenkg-gui",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04181v2,2024-09
Medical Concept Normalization in a Low-Resource Setting,Tim Patzelt,"In the field of biomedical natural language processing, medical concept normalization is a crucial task for accurately mapping mentions of concepts to a large knowledge base. However, this task becomes even more challenging in low-resource settings, where limited data and resources are available. In this thesis, I explore the challenges of medical concept normalization in a low-resource setting. Specifically, I investigate the shortcomings of current medical concept normalization methods applied to German lay texts. Since there is no suitable dataset available, a dataset consisting of posts from a German medical online forum is annotated with concepts from the Unified Medical Language System. The experiments demonstrate that multilingual Transformer-based models are able to outperform string similarity methods. The use of contextual information to improve the normalization of lay mentions is also examined, but led to inferior results. Based on the results of the best performing model, I present a systematic error analysis and lay out potential improvements to mitigate frequent errors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14579v1,2024-09
From Calculation to Adjudication: Examining LLM judges on Mathematical Reasoning Tasks,"Andreas Stephan, Dawei Zhu, Matthias Aßenmacher, Xiaoyu Shen, Benjamin Roth","To reduce the need for human annotations, large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as judges of the quality of other candidate models. LLM judges are typically evaluated by measuring the correlation with human judgments on generation tasks such as summarization or machine translation. In contrast, we study LLM judges on mathematical reasoning tasks. These tasks require multi-step reasoning, and the correctness of their solutions is verifiable, enabling a more objective evaluation. We perform a detailed performance analysis and find that the used judges are mostly unable to improve task performance but are able to pick the better model. Our analysis uncovers a strong correlation between judgment performance and the candidate model task performance. We observe that judges tend to choose the model of higher quality even if its answer is incorrect. Further, we show that it is possible to use statistics, such as the task performances of the individual models, to predict judgment performance. In an ablation, we either swap or mask the candidate answers and observe that judges often keep the original judgment, providing evidence that judges incorporate writing style in their judgments. In summary, we find that regularities in the judgments are quantifiable using statistical measures and provide various angles on exploiting them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04168v1,2024-09
Can OpenSource beat ChatGPT? -- A Comparative Study of Large Language Models for Text-to-Code Generation,"Luis Mayer, Christian Heumann, Matthias Aßenmacher","In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools with potential applications in various fields, including software engineering. Within the scope of this research, we evaluate five different state-of-the-art LLMs - Bard, BingChat, ChatGPT, Llama2, and Code Llama - concerning their capabilities for text-to-code generation. In an empirical study, we feed prompts with textual descriptions of coding problems sourced from the programming website LeetCode to the models with the task of creating solutions in Python. Subsequently, the quality of the generated outputs is assessed using the testing functionalities of LeetCode. The results indicate large differences in performance between the investigated models. ChatGPT can handle these typical programming challenges by far the most effectively, surpassing even code-specialized models like Code Llama. To gain further insights, we measure the runtime as well as the memory usage of the generated outputs and compared them to the other code submissions on Leetcode. A detailed error analysis, encompassing a comparison of the differences concerning correct indentation and form of the generated code as well as an assignment of the incorrectly solved tasks to certain error categories allows us to obtain a more nuanced picture of the results and potential for improvement. The results also show a clear pattern of increasingly incorrect produced code when the models are facing a lot of context in the form of longer prompts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04164v1,2024-09
A Coin Has Two Sides: A Novel Detector-Corrector Framework for Chinese Spelling Correction,"Xiangke Zeng, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Ping Wang, Hongqiu Wu, Hai Zhao","Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC) stands as a foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, which primarily focuses on the correction of erroneous characters in Chinese texts. Certain existing methodologies opt to disentangle the error correction process, employing an additional error detector to pinpoint error positions. However, owing to the inherent performance limitations of error detector, precision and recall are like two sides of the coin which can not be both facing up simultaneously. Furthermore, it is also worth investigating how the error position information can be judiciously applied to assist the error correction. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach based on error detector-corrector framework. Our detector is designed to yield two error detection results, each characterized by high precision and recall. Given that the occurrence of errors is context-dependent and detection outcomes may be less precise, we incorporate the error detection results into the CSC task using an innovative feature fusion strategy and a selective masking strategy. Empirical experiments conducted on mainstream CSC datasets substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04150v1,2024-09
Prompt-based Personality Profiling: Reinforcement Learning for Relevance Filtering,"Jan Hofmann, Cornelia Sindermann, Roman Klinger","Author profiling is the task of inferring characteristics about individuals by analyzing content they share. Supervised machine learning still dominates automatic systems that perform this task, despite the popularity of prompting large language models to address natural language understanding tasks. One reason is that the classification instances consist of large amounts of posts, potentially a whole user profile, which may exceed the input length of Transformers. Even if a model can use a large context window, the entirety of posts makes the application of API-accessed black box systems costly and slow, next to issues which come with such ""needle-in-the-haystack"" tasks. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a new method for author profiling which aims at distinguishing relevant from irrelevant content first, followed by the actual user profiling only with relevant data. To circumvent the need for relevance-annotated data, we optimize this relevance filter via reinforcement learning with a reward function that utilizes the zero-shot capabilities of large language models. We evaluate our method for Big Five personality trait prediction on two Twitter corpora. On publicly available real-world data with a skewed label distribution, our method shows similar efficacy to using all posts in a user profile, but with a substantially shorter context. An evaluation on a version of these data balanced with artificial posts shows that the filtering to relevant posts leads to a significantly improved accuracy of the predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04122v1,2024-09
Confidence-Aware Document OCR Error Detection,"Arthur Hemmer, Mickaël Coustaty, Nicola Bartolo, Jean-Marc Ogier","Optical Character Recognition (OCR) continues to face accuracy challenges that impact subsequent applications. To address these errors, we explore the utility of OCR confidence scores for enhancing post-OCR error detection. Our study involves analyzing the correlation between confidence scores and error rates across different OCR systems. We develop ConfBERT, a BERT-based model that incorporates OCR confidence scores into token embeddings and offers an optional pre-training phase for noise adjustment. Our experimental results demonstrate that integrating OCR confidence scores can enhance error detection capabilities. This work underscores the importance of OCR confidence scores in improving detection accuracy and reveals substantial disparities in performance between commercial and open-source OCR technologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04117v1,2024-09
Multi-Programming Language Ensemble for Code Generation in Large Language Model,"Tengfei Xue, Xuefeng Li, Tahir Azim, Roman Smirnov, Jianhui Yu, Arash Sadrieh, Babak Pahlavan","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved code generation, particularly in one-pass code generation. However, most existing approaches focus solely on generating code in a single programming language, overlooking the potential of leveraging the multi-language capabilities of LLMs. LLMs have varying patterns of errors across different languages, suggesting that a more robust approach could be developed by leveraging these multi-language outputs. In this study, we propose Multi-Programming Language Ensemble (MPLE), a novel ensemble-based method that utilizes code generation across multiple programming languages to enhance overall performance. By treating each language-specific code generation process as an individual ""weak expert"" and effectively integrating their outputs, our method mitigates language-specific errors and biases. This multi-language ensemble strategy leverages the complementary strengths of different programming languages, enabling the model to produce more accurate and robust code. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with commonly used techniques such as the reflection algorithm and Monte Carlo tree search to improve code generation quality further. Experimental results show that our framework consistently enhances baseline performance by up to 17.92% on existing benchmarks (HumanEval and HumanEval-plus), with a standout result of 96.25% accuracy on the HumanEval benchmark, achieving new state-of-the-art results across various LLM models.

Can LLMs Generate Novel Research Ideas? A Large-Scale Human Study with 100+ NLP Researchers,"Chenglei Si, Diyi Yang, Tatsunori Hashimoto","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked optimism about their potential to accelerate scientific discovery, with a growing number of works proposing research agents that autonomously generate and validate new ideas. Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first head-to-head comparison between expert NLP researchers and an LLM ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, we obtain the first statistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research ideation: we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p < 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying our agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation. Finally, we acknowledge that human judgements of novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study design which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects, enabling us to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in meaningful differences in research outcome.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04109v1,2024-09
Structure and dynamics of growing networks of Reddit threads,"Diletta Goglia, Davide Vega","Millions of people use online social networks to reinforce their sense of belonging, for example by giving and asking for feedback as a form of social validation and self-recognition. It is common to observe disagreement among people beliefs and points of view when expressing this feedback. Modeling and analyzing such interactions is crucial to understand social phenomena that happen when people face different opinions while expressing and discussing their values. In this work, we study a Reddit community in which people participate to judge or be judged with respect to some behavior, as it represents a valuable source to study how users express judgments online. We model threads of this community as complex networks of user interactions growing in time, and we analyze the evolution of their structural properties. We show that the evolution of Reddit networks differ from other real social networks, despite falling in the same category. This happens because their global clustering coefficient is extremely small and the average shortest path length increases over time. Such properties reveal how users discuss in threads, i.e. with mostly one other user and often by a single message. We strengthen such result by analyzing the role that disagreement and reciprocity play in such conversations. We also show that Reddit thread's evolution over time is governed by two subgraphs growing at different speeds. We discover that, in the studied community, the difference of such speed is higher than in other communities because of the user guidelines enforcing specific user interactions. Finally, we interpret the obtained results on user behavior drawing back to Social Judgment Theory.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04085v1,2024-09
UI-JEPA: Towards Active Perception of User Intent through Onscreen User Activity,"Yicheng Fu, Raviteja Anantha, Prabal Vashisht, Jianpeng Cheng, Etai Littwin","Generating user intent from a sequence of user interface (UI) actions is a core challenge in comprehensive UI understanding. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to substantial progress in this area, but their demands for extensive model parameters, computing power, and high latency makes them impractical for scenarios requiring lightweight, on-device solutions with low latency or heightened privacy. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets has hindered the development of such lightweight models. To address these challenges, we propose UI-JEPA, a novel framework that employs masking strategies to learn abstract UI embeddings from unlabeled data through self-supervised learning, combined with an LLM decoder fine-tuned for user intent prediction. We also introduce two new UI-grounded multimodal datasets, ""Intent in the Wild"" (IIW) and ""Intent in the Tame"" (IIT), designed for few-shot and zero-shot UI understanding tasks. IIW consists of 1.7K videos across 219 intent categories, while IIT contains 914 videos across 10 categories. We establish the first baselines for these datasets, showing that representations learned using a JEPA-style objective, combined with an LLM decoder, can achieve user intent predictions that match the performance of state-of-the-art large MLLMs, but with significantly reduced annotation and deployment resources. Measured by intent similarity scores, UI-JEPA outperforms GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet by 10.0% and 7.2% respectively, averaged across two datasets. Notably, UI-JEPA accomplishes the performance with a 50.5x reduction in computational cost and a 6.6x improvement in latency in the IIW dataset. These results underscore the effectiveness of UI-JEPA, highlighting its potential for lightweight, high-performance UI understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04081v3,2024-09
AnyMatch -- Efficient Zero-Shot Entity Matching with a Small Language Model,"Zeyu Zhang, Paul Groth, Iacer Calixto, Sebastian Schelter","Entity matching (EM) is the problem of determining whether two records refer to same real-world entity, which is crucial in data integration, e.g., for product catalogs or address databases. A major drawback of many EM approaches is their dependence on labelled examples. We thus focus on the challenging setting of zero-shot entity matching where no labelled examples are available for an unseen target dataset. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results for zero-shot EM, but their low throughput and high deployment cost limit their applicability and scalability.   We revisit the zero-shot EM problem with AnyMatch, a small language model fine-tuned in a transfer learning setup. We propose several novel data selection techniques to generate fine-tuning data for our model, e.g., by selecting difficult pairs to match via an AutoML filter, by generating additional attribute-level examples, and by controlling label imbalance in the data.   We conduct an extensive evaluation of the prediction quality and deployment cost of our model, in a comparison to thirteen baselines on nine benchmark datasets. We find that AnyMatch provides competitive prediction quality despite its small parameter size: it achieves the second-highest F1 score overall, and outperforms several other approaches that employ models with hundreds of billions of parameters. Furthermore, our approach exhibits major cost benefits: the average prediction quality of AnyMatch is within 4.4% of the state-of-the-art method MatchGPT with the proprietary trillion-parameter model GPT-4, yet AnyMatch requires four orders of magnitude less parameters and incurs a 3,899 times lower inference cost (in dollars per 1,000 tokens).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04073v2,2024-09
Self-Harmonized Chain of Thought,"Ziqi Jin, Wei Lu","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting reveals that large language models are capable of performing complex reasoning via intermediate steps. CoT prompting is primarily categorized into three approaches. The first approach utilizes straightforward prompts like ``Let's think step by step'' to generate a sequential thought process before yielding an answer. The second approach makes use of human-crafted, step-by-step demonstrations to guide the model's reasoning process. The third automates the generation of reasoned demonstrations with the 'Let's think step by step'.This approach sometimes leads to reasoning errors, highlighting the need to diversify demonstrations to mitigate its misleading effects. However, diverse demonstrations pose challenges for effective representations. In this work, we propose ECHO, a self-harmonized chain-of-thought prompting method. It consolidates diverse solution paths into a uniform and effective solution pattern.ECHO demonstrates the best overall performance across three reasoning domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04057v1,2024-09
Refining Wikidata Taxonomy using Large Language Models,"Yiwen Peng, Thomas Bonald, Mehwish Alam","Due to its collaborative nature, Wikidata is known to have a complex taxonomy, with recurrent issues like the ambiguity between instances and classes, the inaccuracy of some taxonomic paths, the presence of cycles, and the high level of redundancy across classes. Manual efforts to clean up this taxonomy are time-consuming and prone to errors or subjective decisions. We present WiKC, a new version of Wikidata taxonomy cleaned automatically using a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and graph mining techniques.

Towards Safer Online Spaces: Simulating and Assessing Intervention Strategies for Eating Disorder Discussions,"Louis Penafiel, Hsien-Te Kao, Isabel Erickson, David Chu, Robert McCormack, Kristina Lerman, Svitlana Volkova","Eating disorders are complex mental health conditions that affect millions of people around the world. Effective interventions on social media platforms are crucial, yet testing strategies in situ can be risky. We present a novel LLM-driven experimental testbed for simulating and assessing intervention strategies in ED-related discussions. Our framework generates synthetic conversations across multiple platforms, models, and ED-related topics, allowing for controlled experimentation with diverse intervention approaches. We analyze the impact of various intervention strategies on conversation dynamics across four dimensions: intervention type, generative model, social media platform, and ED-related community/topic. We employ cognitive domain analysis metrics, including sentiment, emotions, etc., to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Our findings reveal that civility-focused interventions consistently improve positive sentiment and emotional tone across all dimensions, while insight-resetting approaches tend to increase negative emotions. We also uncover significant biases in LLM-generated conversations, with cognitive metrics varying notably between models (Claude-3 Haiku $>$ Mistral $>$ GPT-3.5-turbo $>$ LLaMA3) and even between versions of the same model. These variations highlight the importance of model selection in simulating realistic discussions related to ED. Our work provides valuable information on the complex dynamics of ED-related discussions and the effectiveness of various intervention strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04043v1,2024-09
Large Margin Prototypical Network for Few-shot Relation Classification with Fine-grained Features,"Miao Fan, Yeqi Bai, Mingming Sun, Ping Li","Relation classification (RC) plays a pivotal role in both natural language understanding and knowledge graph completion. It is generally formulated as a task to recognize the relationship between two entities of interest appearing in a free-text sentence. Conventional approaches on RC, regardless of feature engineering or deep learning based, can obtain promising performance on categorizing common types of relation leaving a large proportion of unrecognizable long-tail relations due to insufficient labeled instances for training. In this paper, we consider few-shot learning is of great practical significance to RC and thus improve a modern framework of metric learning for few-shot RC. Specifically, we adopt the large-margin ProtoNet with fine-grained features, expecting they can generalize well on long-tail relations. Extensive experiments were conducted by FewRel, a large-scale supervised few-shot RC dataset, to evaluate our framework: LM-ProtoNet (FGF). The results demonstrate that it can achieve substantial improvements over many baseline approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04009v1,2024-09
OPAL: Outlier-Preserved Microscaling Quantization Accelerator for Generative Large Language Models,"Jahyun Koo, Dahoon Park, Sangwoo Jung, Jaeha Kung","To overcome the burden on the memory size and bandwidth due to ever-increasing size of large language models (LLMs), aggressive weight quantization has been recently studied, while lacking research on quantizing activations. In this paper, we present a hardware-software co-design method that results in an energy-efficient LLM accelerator, named OPAL, for generation tasks. First of all, a novel activation quantization method that leverages the microscaling data format while preserving several outliers per sub-tensor block (e.g., four out of 128 elements) is proposed. Second, on top of preserving outliers, mixed precision is utilized that sets 5-bit for inputs to sensitive layers in the decoder block of an LLM, while keeping inputs to less sensitive layers to 3-bit. Finally, we present the OPAL hardware architecture that consists of FP units for handling outliers and vectorized INT multipliers for dominant non-outlier related operations. In addition, OPAL uses log2-based approximation on softmax operations that only requires shift and subtraction to maximize power efficiency. As a result, we are able to improve the energy efficiency by 1.6~2.2x, and reduce the area by 2.4~3.1x with negligible accuracy loss, i.e., <1 perplexity increase.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05902v3,2024-09
On The Role of Prompt Construction In Enhancing Efficacy and Efficiency of LLM-Based Tabular Data Generation,"Banooqa Banday, Kowshik Thopalli, Tanzima Z. Islam, Jayaraman J. Thiagarajan","LLM-based data generation for real-world tabular data can be challenged by the lack of sufficient semantic context in feature names used to describe columns. We hypothesize that enriching prompts with domain-specific insights can improve both the quality and efficiency of data generation. To test this hypothesis, we explore three prompt construction protocols: Expert-guided, LLM-guided, and Novel-Mapping. Through empirical studies with the recently proposed GReaT framework, we find that context-enriched prompts lead to significantly improved data generation quality and training efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03946v1,2024-09
Experimentation in Content Moderation using RWKV,"Umut Yildirim, Rohan Dutta, Burak Yildirim, Atharva Vaidya","This paper investigates the RWKV model's efficacy in content moderation through targeted experimentation. We introduce a novel dataset specifically designed for distillation into smaller models, enhancing content moderation practices. This comprehensive dataset encompasses images, videos, sounds, and text data that present societal challenges. Leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), we generated an extensive set of responses -- 558,958 for text and 83,625 for images -- to train and refine content moderation systems. Our core experimentation involved fine-tuning the RWKV model, capitalizing on its CPU-efficient architecture to address large-scale content moderation tasks. By highlighting the dataset's potential for knowledge distillation, this study not only demonstrates RWKV's capability in improving the accuracy and efficiency of content moderation systems but also paves the way for developing more compact, resource-efficient models in this domain.

CACER: Clinical Concept Annotations for Cancer Events and Relations,"Yujuan Fu, Giridhar Kaushik Ramachandran, Ahmad Halwani, Bridget T. McInnes, Fei Xia, Kevin Lybarger, Meliha Yetisgen, Özlem Uzuner","Clinical notes contain unstructured representations of patient histories, including the relationships between medical problems and prescription drugs. To investigate the relationship between cancer drugs and their associated symptom burden, we extract structured, semantic representations of medical problem and drug information from the clinical narratives of oncology notes. We present Clinical Concept Annotations for Cancer Events and Relations (CACER), a novel corpus with fine-grained annotations for over 48,000 medical problems and drug events and 10,000 drug-problem and problem-problem relations. Leveraging CACER, we develop and evaluate transformer-based information extraction (IE) models such as BERT, Flan-T5, Llama3, and GPT-4 using fine-tuning and in-context learning (ICL). In event extraction, the fine-tuned BERT and Llama3 models achieved the highest performance at 88.2-88.0 F1, which is comparable to the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) of 88.4 F1. In relation extraction, the fine-tuned BERT, Flan-T5, and Llama3 achieved the highest performance at 61.8-65.3 F1. GPT-4 with ICL achieved the worst performance across both tasks. The fine-tuned models significantly outperformed GPT-4 in ICL, highlighting the importance of annotated training data and model optimization. Furthermore, the BERT models performed similarly to Llama3. For our task, LLMs offer no performance advantage over the smaller BERT models. The results emphasize the need for annotated training data to optimize models. Multiple fine-tuned transformer models achieved performance comparable to IAA for several extraction tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03905v1,2024-09
Sirius: Contextual Sparsity with Correction for Efficient LLMs,"Yang Zhou, Zhuoming Chen, Zhaozhuo Xu, Victoria Lin, Beidi Chen","With the blossom of large language models (LLMs), inference efficiency becomes increasingly important. Various approximation methods are proposed to reduce the cost at inference time. Contextual Sparsity (CS) is appealing for its training-free nature and its ability to reach a higher compression ratio seemingly without quality degradation. However, after a comprehensive evaluation of contextual sparsity methods on various complex generation tasks, we find that although CS succeeds in prompt-understanding tasks, CS significantly degrades the model performance for reasoning, deduction, and knowledge-based tasks. Despite the gap in end-to-end accuracy, we observed that sparse models often share general problem-solving logic and require only a few token corrections to recover the original model performance. This paper introduces Sirius, an efficient correction mechanism, which significantly recovers CS models quality on reasoning tasks while maintaining its efficiency gain. Sirius is evaluated on 6 models with 8 difficult generation tasks in reasoning, math, and coding and shows consistent effectiveness and efficiency. Also, we carefully develop a system implementation for Sirius and show that Sirius achieves roughly 20% reduction in latency for 8B model on-chip and 35% reduction for 70B model offloading. We open-source our implementation of Sirius at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/Sirius.git.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03856v1,2024-09
Persona Setting Pitfall: Persistent Outgroup Biases in Large Language Models Arising from Social Identity Adoption,"Wenchao Dong, Assem Zhunis, Dongyoung Jeong, Hyojin Chin, Jiyoung Han, Meeyoung Cha","Drawing parallels between human cognition and artificial intelligence, we explored how large language models (LLMs) internalize identities imposed by targeted prompts. Informed by Social Identity Theory, these identity assignments lead LLMs to distinguish between ""we"" (the ingroup) and ""they"" (the outgroup). This self-categorization generates both ingroup favoritism and outgroup bias. Nonetheless, existing literature has predominantly focused on ingroup favoritism, often overlooking outgroup bias, which is a fundamental source of intergroup prejudice and discrimination. Our experiment addresses this gap by demonstrating that outgroup bias manifests as strongly as ingroup favoritism. Furthermore, we successfully mitigated the inherent pro-liberal, anti-conservative bias in LLMs by guiding them to adopt the perspectives of the initially disfavored group. These results were replicated in the context of gender bias. Our findings highlight the potential to develop more equitable and balanced language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03843v1,2024-09

However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.

To overcome this challenge, we introduce WildVis, an interactive tool that enables fast, versatile, and large-scale conversation analysis. WildVis provides search and visualization capabilities in the text and embedding spaces based on a list of criteria. To manage million-scale datasets, we implemented optimizations including search index construction, embedding precomputation and compression, and caching to ensure responsive user interactions within seconds.

WildVis is open-source and designed to be extendable, supporting additional datasets and customized search and visualization functionalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03753v2,2024-09
Attention Heads of Large Language Models: A Survey,"Zifan Zheng, Yezhaohui Wang, Yuxin Huang, Shichao Song, Mingchuan Yang, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu Li","Since the advent of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but remain as black-box systems. Understanding the reasoning bottlenecks of LLMs has become a critical challenge, as these limitations are deeply tied to their internal architecture. Among these, attention heads have emerged as a focal point for investigating the underlying mechanics of LLMs. In this survey, we aim to demystify the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by systematically exploring the roles and mechanisms of attention heads. We first introduce a novel four-stage framework inspired by the human thought process: Knowledge Recalling, In-Context Identification, Latent Reasoning, and Expression Preparation. Using this framework, we comprehensively review existing research to identify and categorize the functions of specific attention heads. Additionally, we analyze the experimental methodologies used to discover these special heads, dividing them into two categories: Modeling-Free and Modeling-Required methods. We further summarize relevant evaluation methods and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current research and propose several potential future directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03752v3,2024-09
How Do Your Code LLMs Perform? Empowering Code Instruction Tuning with High-Quality Data,"Yejie Wang, Keqing He, Dayuan Fu, Zhuoma Gongque, Heyang Xu, Yanxu Chen, Zhexu Wang, Yujia Fu, Guanting Dong, Muxi Diao, Jingang Wang, Mengdi Zhang, Xunliang Cai, Weiran Xu","Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying how to construct better code instruction tuning data. However, we observe Code models trained with these datasets exhibit high performance on HumanEval but perform worse on other benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench. Upon further investigation, we find that many datasets suffer from severe data leakage. After cleaning up most of the leaked data, some well-known high-quality datasets perform poorly. This discovery reveals a new challenge: identifying which dataset genuinely qualify as high-quality code instruction data. To address this, we propose an efficient code data pruning strategy for selecting good samples. Our approach is based on three dimensions: instruction complexity, response quality, and instruction diversity. Based on our selected data, we present XCoder, a family of models finetuned from LLaMA3. Our experiments show XCoder achieves new state-of-the-art performance using fewer training data, which verify the effectiveness of our data strategy. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive analysis on the data composition and find existing code datasets have different characteristics according to their construction methods, which provide new insights for future code LLMs. Our models and dataset are released in https://github.com/banksy23/XCoder",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03810v1,2024-09
Planning In Natural Language Improves LLM Search For Code Generation,"Evan Wang, Federico Cassano, Catherine Wu, Yunfeng Bai, Will Song, Vaskar Nath, Ziwen Han, Sean Hendryx, Summer Yue, Hugh Zhang","While scaling training compute has led to remarkable improvements in large language models (LLMs), scaling inference compute has not yet yielded analogous gains. We hypothesize that a core missing component is a lack of diverse LLM outputs, leading to inefficient search due to models repeatedly sampling highly similar, yet incorrect generations. We empirically demonstrate that this lack of diversity can be mitigated by searching over candidate plans for solving a problem in natural language. Based on this insight, we propose PlanSearch, a novel search algorithm which shows strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench (a contamination-free benchmark for competitive coding). PlanSearch generates a diverse set of observations about the problem and then uses these observations to construct plans for solving the problem. By searching over plans in natural language rather than directly over code solutions, PlanSearch explores a significantly more diverse range of potential solutions compared to baseline search methods. Using PlanSearch on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves a state-of-the-art pass@200 of 77.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming both the best score achieved without search (pass@1 = 41.4%) and using standard repeated sampling (pass@200 = 60.6%). Finally, we show that, across all models, search algorithms, and benchmarks analyzed, we can accurately predict performance gains due to search as a direct function of the diversity over generated ideas.

RAG based Question-Answering for Contextual Response Prediction System,"Sriram Veturi, Saurabh Vaichal, Reshma Lal Jagadheesh, Nafis Irtiza Tripto, Nian Yan","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown versatility in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including their potential as effective question-answering systems. However, to provide precise and relevant information in response to specific customer queries in industry settings, LLMs require access to a comprehensive knowledge base to avoid hallucinations. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising technique to address this challenge. Yet, developing an accurate question-answering framework for real-world applications using RAG entails several challenges: 1) data availability issues, 2) evaluating the quality of generated content, and 3) the costly nature of human evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework that employs LLMs with RAG capabilities for industry use cases. Given a customer query, the proposed system retrieves relevant knowledge documents and leverages them, along with previous chat history, to generate response suggestions for customer service agents in the contact centers of a major retail company. Through comprehensive automated and human evaluations, we show that this solution outperforms the current BERT-based algorithms in accuracy and relevance. Our findings suggest that RAG-based LLMs can be an excellent support to human customer service representatives by lightening their workload.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03708v2,2024-09

LAST: Language Model Aware Speech Tokenization,"Arnon Turetzky, Yossi Adi","Speech tokenization serves as the foundation of speech language model (LM), enabling them to perform various tasks such as spoken language modeling, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, etc. Most speech tokenizers are trained independently of the LM training process, relying on separate acoustic models and quantization methods. Following such an approach may create a mismatch between the tokenization process and its usage afterward. In this study, we propose a novel approach to training a speech tokenizer by leveraging objectives from pre-trained textual LMs. We advocate for the integration of this objective into the process of learning discrete speech representations. Our aim is to transform features from a pre-trained speech model into a new feature space that enables better clustering for speech LMs. We empirically investigate the impact of various model design choices, including speech vocabulary size and text LM size. Our results demonstrate the proposed tokenization method outperforms the evaluated baselines considering both spoken language modeling and speech-to-text. More importantly, unlike prior work, the proposed method allows the utilization of a single pre-trained LM for processing both speech and text inputs, setting it apart from conventional tokenization approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03701v2,2024-09
A Fused Large Language Model for Predicting Startup Success,"Abdurahman Maarouf, Stefan Feuerriegel, Nicolas Pröllochs","Investors are continuously seeking profitable investment opportunities in startups and, hence, for effective decision-making, need to predict a startup's probability of success. Nowadays, investors can use not only various fundamental information about a startup (e.g., the age of the startup, the number of founders, and the business sector) but also textual description of a startup's innovation and business model, which is widely available through online venture capital (VC) platforms such as Crunchbase. To support the decision-making of investors, we develop a machine learning approach with the aim of locating successful startups on VC platforms. Specifically, we develop, train, and evaluate a tailored, fused large language model to predict startup success. Thereby, we assess to what extent self-descriptions on VC platforms are predictive of startup success. Using 20,172 online profiles from Crunchbase, we find that our fused large language model can predict startup success, with textual self-descriptions being responsible for a significant part of the predictive power. Our work provides a decision support tool for investors to find profitable investment opportunities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03668v1,2024-09
The representation landscape of few-shot learning and fine-tuning in large language models,"Diego Doimo, Alessandro Serra, Alessio Ansuini, Alberto Cazzaniga","In-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) are two common strategies for improving the performance of modern large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. Despite their different natures, these strategies often lead to comparable performance gains. However, little is known about whether they induce similar representations inside LLMs. We approach this problem by analyzing the probability landscape of their hidden representations in the two cases. More specifically, we compare how LLMs solve the same question-answering task, finding that ICL and SFT create very different internal structures, in both cases undergoing a sharp transition in the middle of the network. In the first half of the network, ICL shapes interpretable representations hierarchically organized according to their semantic content. In contrast, the probability landscape obtained with SFT is fuzzier and semantically mixed. In the second half of the model, the fine-tuned representations develop probability modes that better encode the identity of answers, while the landscape of ICL representations is characterized by less defined peaks. Our approach reveals the diverse computational strategies developed inside LLMs to solve the same task across different conditions, allowing us to make a step towards designing optimal methods to extract information from language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03662v2,2024-09
LLM-based multi-agent poetry generation in non-cooperative environments,"Ran Zhang, Steffen Eger","Despite substantial progress of large language models (LLMs) for automatic poetry generation, the generated poetry lacks diversity while the training process differs greatly from human learning. Under the rationale that the learning process of the poetry generation systems should be more human-like and their output more diverse and novel, we introduce a framework based on social learning where we emphasize non-cooperative interactions besides cooperative interactions to encourage diversity. Our experiments are the first attempt at LLM-based multi-agent systems in non-cooperative environments for poetry generation employing both TRAINING-BASED agents (GPT-2) and PROMPTING-BASED agents (GPT-3 and GPT-4). Our evaluation based on 96k generated poems shows that our framework benefits the poetry generation process for TRAINING-BASED agents resulting in 1) a 3.0-3.7 percentage point (pp) increase in diversity and a 5.6-11.3 pp increase in novelty according to distinct and novel n-grams. The generated poetry from TRAINING-BASED agents also exhibits group divergence in terms of lexicons, styles and semantics. PROMPTING-BASED agents in our framework also benefit from non-cooperative environments and a more diverse ensemble of models with non-homogeneous agents has the potential to further enhance diversity, with an increase of 7.0-17.5 pp according to our experiments. However, PROMPTING-BASED agents show a decrease in lexical diversity over time and do not exhibit the group-based divergence intended in the social network. Our paper argues for a paradigm shift in creative tasks such as automatic poetry generation to include social learning processes (via LLM-based agent modeling) similar to human interaction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03659v2,2024-09
On the Limited Generalization Capability of the Implicit Reward Model Induced by Direct Preference Optimization,"Yong Lin, Skyler Seto, Maartje ter Hoeve, Katherine Metcalf, Barry-John Theobald, Xuan Wang, Yizhe Zhang, Chen Huang, Tong Zhang","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is an effective approach for aligning language models to human preferences. Central to RLHF is learning a reward function for scoring human preferences. Two main approaches for learning a reward model are 1) training an EXplicit Reward Model (EXRM) as in RLHF, and 2) using an implicit reward learned from preference data through methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Prior work has shown that the implicit reward model of DPO (denoted as DPORM) can approximate an EXRM in the limit. DPORM's effectiveness directly implies the optimality of the learned policy, and also has practical implication for LLM alignment methods including iterative DPO. However, it is unclear how well DPORM empirically matches the performance of EXRM. This work studies the accuracy at distinguishing preferred and rejected answers for both DPORM and EXRM. Our findings indicate that even though DPORM fits the training dataset comparably, it generalizes less effectively than EXRM, especially when the validation datasets contain distribution shifts. Across five out-of-distribution settings, DPORM has a mean drop in accuracy of 3% and a maximum drop of 7%. These findings highlight that DPORM has limited generalization ability and substantiates the integration of an explicit reward model in iterative DPO approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03650v2,2024-09
CDM: A Reliable Metric for Fair and Accurate Formula Recognition Evaluation,"Bin Wang, Fan Wu, Linke Ouyang, Zhuangcheng Gu, Rui Zhang, Renqiu Xia, Bo Zhang, Conghui He","Formula recognition presents significant challenges due to the complicated structure and varied notation of mathematical expressions. Despite continuous advancements in formula recognition models, the evaluation metrics employed by these models, such as BLEU and Edit Distance, still exhibit notable limitations. They overlook the fact that the same formula has diverse representations and is highly sensitive to the distribution of training data, thereby causing the unfairness in formula recognition evaluation. To this end, we propose a Character Detection Matching (CDM) metric, ensuring the evaluation objectivity by designing a image-level rather than LaTex-level metric score. Specifically, CDM renders both the model-predicted LaTeX and the ground-truth LaTeX formulas into image-formatted formulas, then employs visual feature extraction and localization techniques for precise character-level matching, incorporating spatial position information. Such a spatially-aware and character-matching method offers a more accurate and equitable evaluation compared with previous BLEU and Edit Distance metrics that rely solely on text-based character matching. Experimentally, we evaluated various formula recognition models using CDM, BLEU, and ExpRate metrics. Their results demonstrate that the CDM aligns more closely with human evaluation standards and provides a fairer comparison across different models by eliminating discrepancies caused by diverse formula representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03643v1,2024-09
"Attend First, Consolidate Later: On the Importance of Attention in Different LLM Layers","Amit Ben-Artzy, Roy Schwartz","In decoder-based LLMs, the representation of a given layer serves two purposes: as input to the next layer during the computation of the current token; and as input to the attention mechanism of future tokens. In this work, we show that the importance of the latter role might be overestimated. To show that, we start by manipulating the representations of previous tokens; e.g. by replacing the hidden states at some layer k with random vectors. Our experimenting with four LLMs and four tasks show that this operation often leads to small to negligible drop in performance. Importantly, this happens if the manipulation occurs in the top part of the model-k is in the final 30-50% of the layers. In contrast, doing the same manipulation in earlier layers might lead to chance level performance. We continue by switching the hidden state of certain tokens with hidden states of other tokens from another prompt; e.g., replacing the word ""Italy"" with ""France"" in ""What is the capital of Italy?"". We find that when applying this switch in the top 1/3 of the model, the model ignores it (answering ""Rome""). However if we apply it before, the model conforms to the switch (""Paris""). Our results hint at a two stage process in transformer-based LLMs: the first part gathers input from previous tokens, while the second mainly processes that information internally.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03621v2,2024-09
Debiasing Text Safety Classifiers through a Fairness-Aware Ensemble,"Olivia Sturman, Aparna Joshi, Bhaktipriya Radharapu, Piyush Kumar, Renee Shelby","Increasing use of large language models (LLMs) demand performant guardrails to ensure the safety of inputs and outputs of LLMs. When these safeguards are trained on imbalanced data, they can learn the societal biases. We present a light-weight, post-processing method for mitigating counterfactual fairness in closed-source text safety classifiers. Our approach involves building an ensemble that not only outperforms the input classifiers and policy-aligns them, but also acts as a debiasing regularizer. We introduce two threshold-agnostic metrics to assess the counterfactual fairness of a model, and demonstrate how combining these metrics with Fair Data Reweighting (FDW) helps mitigate biases. We create an expanded Open AI dataset, and a new templated LLM-generated dataset based on user-prompts, both of which are counterfactually balanced across identity groups and cover four key areas of safety; we will work towards publicly releasing these datasets. Our results show that our approach improves counterfactual fairness with minimal impact on model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13705v2,2024-09
100 instances is all you need: predicting the success of a new LLM on unseen data by testing on a few instances,"Lorenzo Pacchiardi, Lucy G. Cheke, José Hernández-Orallo","Predicting the performance of LLMs on individual task instances is essential to ensure their reliability in high-stakes applications. To do so, a possibility is to evaluate the considered LLM on a set of task instances and train an assessor to predict its performance based on features of the instances. However, this approach requires evaluating each new LLM on a sufficiently large set of task instances to train an assessor specific to it. In this work, we leverage the evaluation results of previously tested LLMs to reduce the number of evaluations required to predict the performance of a new LLM. In practice, we propose to test the new LLM on a small set of reference instances and train a generic assessor which predicts the performance of the LLM on an instance based on the performance of the former on the reference set and features of the instance of interest. We conduct empirical studies on HELM-Lite and KindsOfReasoning, a collection of existing reasoning datasets that we introduce, where we evaluate all instruction-fine-tuned OpenAI models until the January 2024 version of GPT4. When predicting performance on instances with the same distribution as those used to train the generic assessor, we find this achieves performance comparable to the LLM-specific assessors trained on the full set of instances. Additionally, we find that randomly selecting the reference instances performs as well as some advanced selection methods we tested. For out of distribution, however, no clear winner emerges and the overall performance is worse, suggesting that the inherent predictability of LLMs is low.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03563v1,2024-09

How Much Data is Enough Data? Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for In-House Translation: Performance Evaluation Across Multiple Dataset Sizes,"Inacio Vieira, Will Allred, Séamus Lankford, Sheila Castilho, Andy Way","Decoder-only LLMs have shown impressive performance in MT due to their ability to learn from extensive datasets and generate high-quality translations. However, LLMs often struggle with the nuances and style required for organisation-specific translation. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Llama 3 8B Instruct, leveraging translation memories (TMs), as a valuable resource to enhance accuracy and efficiency. We investigate the impact of fine-tuning the Llama 3 model using TMs from a specific organisation in the software sector. Our experiments cover five translation directions across languages of varying resource levels (English to Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, German, Finnish, and Korean). We analyse diverse sizes of training datasets (1k to 207k segments) to evaluate their influence on translation quality. We fine-tune separate models for each training set and evaluate their performance based on automatic metrics, BLEU, chrF++, TER, and COMET. Our findings reveal improvement in translation performance with larger datasets across all metrics. On average, BLEU and COMET scores increase by 13 and 25 points, respectively, on the largest training set against the baseline model. Notably, there is a performance deterioration in comparison with the baseline model when fine-tuning on only 1k and 2k examples; however, we observe a substantial improvement as the training dataset size increases. The study highlights the potential of integrating TMs with LLMs to create bespoke translation models tailored to the specific needs of businesses, thus enhancing translation quality and reducing turn-around times. This approach offers a valuable insight for organisations seeking to leverage TMs and LLMs for optimal translation outcomes, especially in narrower domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03454v2,2024-09
"Fine-tuning large language models for domain adaptation: Exploration of training strategies, scaling, model merging and synergistic capabilities","Wei Lu, Rachel K. Luu, Markus J. Buehler","The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain applications in fields such as materials science and engineering depends on the development of fine-tuning strategies that adapt models for specialized, technical capabilities. In this work, we explore the effects of Continued Pretraining (CPT), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and various preference-based optimization approaches, including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), on fine-tuned LLM performance. Our analysis shows how these strategies influence model outcomes and reveals that the merging of multiple fine-tuned models can lead to the emergence of capabilities that surpass the individual contributions of the parent models. We find that model merging leads to new functionalities that neither parent model could achieve alone, leading to improved performance in domain-specific assessments. Experiments with different model architectures are presented, including Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral 7B models, where similar behaviors are observed. Exploring whether the results hold also for much smaller models, we use a tiny LLM with 1.7 billion parameters and show that very small LLMs do not necessarily feature emergent capabilities under model merging, suggesting that model scaling may be a key component. In open-ended yet consistent chat conversations between a human and AI models, our assessment reveals detailed insights into how different model variants perform and show that the smallest model achieves a high intelligence score across key criteria including reasoning depth, creativity, clarity, and quantitative precision. Other experiments include the development of image generation prompts based on disparate biological material design concepts, to create new microstructures, architectural concepts, and urban design based on biological materials-inspired construction principles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03444v1,2024-09
Rx Strategist: Prescription Verification using LLM Agents System,"Phuc Phan Van, Dat Nguyen Minh, An Dinh Ngoc, Huy Phan Thanh","To protect patient safety, modern pharmaceutical complexity demands strict prescription verification. We offer a new approach - Rx Strategist - that makes use of knowledge graphs and different search strategies to enhance the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) inside an agentic framework. This multifaceted technique allows for a multi-stage LLM pipeline and reliable information retrieval from a custom-built active ingredient database. Different facets of prescription verification, such as indication, dose, and possible drug interactions, are covered in each stage of the pipeline. We alleviate the drawbacks of monolithic LLM techniques by spreading reasoning over these stages, improving correctness and reliability while reducing memory demands. Our findings demonstrate that Rx Strategist surpasses many current LLMs, achieving performance comparable to that of a highly experienced clinical pharmacist. In the complicated world of modern medications, this combination of LLMs with organized knowledge and sophisticated search methods presents a viable avenue for reducing prescription errors and enhancing patient outcomes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03440v1,2024-09
Entity Extraction from High-Level Corruption Schemes via Large Language Models,"Panagiotis Koletsis, Panagiotis-Konstantinos Gemos, Christos Chronis, Iraklis Varlamis, Vasilis Efthymiou, Georgios Th. Papadopoulos","The rise of financial crime that has been observed in recent years has created an increasing concern around the topic and many people, organizations and governments are more and more frequently trying to combat it. Despite the increase of interest in this area, there is a lack of specialized datasets that can be used to train and evaluate works that try to tackle those problems. This article proposes a new micro-benchmark dataset for algorithms and models that identify individuals and organizations, and their multiple writings, in news articles, and presents an approach that assists in its creation. Experimental efforts are also reported, using this dataset, to identify individuals and organizations in financial-crime-related articles using various low-billion parameter Large Language Models (LLMs). For these experiments, standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score) are reported and various prompt variants comprising the best practices of prompt engineering are tested. In addition, to address the problem of ambiguous entity mentions, a simple, yet effective LLM-based disambiguation method is proposed, ensuring that the evaluation aligns with reality. Finally, the proposed approach is compared against a widely used state-of-the-art open-source baseline, showing the superiority of the proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13704v2,2024-09
CogniDual Framework: Self-Training Large Language Models within a Dual-System Theoretical Framework for Improving Cognitive Tasks,"Yongxin Deng, Xihe Qiu, Xiaoyu Tan, Chao Qu, Jing Pan, Yuan Cheng, Yinghui Xu, Wei Chu","Cognitive psychology investigates perception, attention, memory, language, problem-solving, decision-making, and reasoning. Kahneman's dual-system theory elucidates the human decision-making process, distinguishing between the rapid, intuitive System 1 and the deliberative, rational System 2. Recent advancements have positioned large language Models (LLMs) as formidable tools nearing human-level proficiency in various cognitive tasks. Nonetheless, the presence of a dual-system framework analogous to human cognition in LLMs remains unexplored. This study introduces the \textbf{CogniDual Framework for LLMs} (CFLLMs), designed to assess whether LLMs can, through self-training, evolve from deliberate deduction to intuitive responses, thereby emulating the human process of acquiring and mastering new information. Our findings reveal the cognitive mechanisms behind LLMs' response generation, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities in cognitive psychology. Practically, self-trained models can provide faster responses to certain queries, reducing computational demands during inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03381v2,2024-09
Leveraging Large Language Models through Natural Language Processing to provide interpretable Machine Learning predictions of mental deterioration in real time,"Francisco de Arriba-Pérez, Silvia García-Méndez","Based on official estimates, 50 million people worldwide are affected by dementia, and this number increases by 10 million new patients every year. Without a cure, clinical prognostication and early intervention represent the most effective ways to delay its progression. To this end, Artificial Intelligence and computational linguistics can be exploited for natural language analysis, personalized assessment, monitoring, and treatment. However, traditional approaches need more semantic knowledge management and explicability capabilities. Moreover, using Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive decline diagnosis is still scarce, even though these models represent the most advanced way for clinical-patient communication using intelligent systems. Consequently, we leverage an LLM using the latest Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in a chatbot solution to provide interpretable Machine Learning prediction of cognitive decline in real-time. Linguistic-conceptual features are exploited for appropriate natural language analysis. Through explainability, we aim to fight potential biases of the models and improve their potential to help clinical workers in their diagnosis decisions. More in detail, the proposed pipeline is composed of (i) data extraction employing NLP-based prompt engineering; (ii) stream-based data processing including feature engineering, analysis, and selection; (iii) real-time classification; and (iv) the explainability dashboard to provide visual and natural language descriptions of the prediction outcome. Classification results exceed 80 % in all evaluation metrics, with a recall value for the mental deterioration class about 85 %. To sum up, we contribute with an affordable, flexible, non-invasive, personalized diagnostic system to this work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03375v1,2024-09
Con-ReCall: Detecting Pre-training Data in LLMs via Contrastive Decoding,"Cheng Wang, Yiwei Wang, Bryan Hooi, Yujun Cai, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang","The training data in large language models is key to their success, but it also presents privacy and security risks, as it may contain sensitive information. Detecting pre-training data is crucial for mitigating these concerns. Existing methods typically analyze target text in isolation or solely with non-member contexts, overlooking potential insights from simultaneously considering both member and non-member contexts. While previous work suggested that member contexts provide little information due to the minor distributional shift they induce, our analysis reveals that these subtle shifts can be effectively leveraged when contrasted with non-member contexts. In this paper, we propose Con-ReCall, a novel approach that leverages the asymmetric distributional shifts induced by member and non-member contexts through contrastive decoding, amplifying subtle differences to enhance membership inference. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Con-ReCall achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WikiMIA benchmark and is robust against various text manipulation techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03363v1,2024-09
Sketch: A Toolkit for Streamlining LLM Operations,"Xin Jiang, Xiang Li, Wenjia Ma, Xuezhi Fang, Yiqun Yao, Naitong Yu, Xuying Meng, Peng Han, Jing Li, Aixin Sun, Yequan Wang","Large language models (LLMs) represented by GPT family have achieved remarkable success. The characteristics of LLMs lie in their ability to accommodate a wide range of tasks through a generative approach. However, the flexibility of their output format poses challenges in controlling and harnessing the model's outputs, thereby constraining the application of LLMs in various domains. In this work, we present Sketch, an innovative toolkit designed to streamline LLM operations across diverse fields.

Normal forms in Virus Machines,"A. Ramírez-de-Arellano, F. G. C. Cabarle, D. Orellana-Martín, M. J. Pérez-Jiménez","In the present work, we further study the computational power of virus machines (VMs in short). VMs provide a computing paradigm inspired by the transmission and replication networks of viruses. VMs consist of process units (called hosts) structured by a directed graph whose arcs are called channels and an instruction graph that controls the transmissions of virus objects among hosts. The present work complements our understanding of the computing power of VMs by introducing normal forms; these expressions restrict the features in a given computing model. Some of the features that we restrict in our normal forms include (a) the number of hosts, (b) the number of instructions, and (c) the number of virus objects in each host. After we recall some known results on the computing power of VMs we give our normal forms, such as the size of the loops in the network, proving new characterisations of family of sets, such as the finite sets, semilinear sets, or NRE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03327v1,2024-09
N-gram Prediction and Word Difference Representations for Language Modeling,"DongNyeong Heo, Daniela Noemi Rim, Heeyoul Choi","Causal language modeling (CLM) serves as the foundational framework underpinning remarkable successes of recent large language models (LLMs). Despite its success, the training approach for next word prediction poses a potential risk of causing the model to overly focus on local dependencies within a sentence. While prior studies have been introduced to predict future N words simultaneously, they were primarily applied to tasks such as masked language modeling (MLM) and neural machine translation (NMT). In this study, we introduce a simple N-gram prediction framework for the CLM task. Moreover, we introduce word difference representation (WDR) as a surrogate and contextualized target representation during model training on the basis of N-gram prediction framework. To further enhance the quality of next word prediction, we propose an ensemble method that incorporates the future N words' prediction results. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets encompassing CLM and NMT tasks demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed methods over the conventional CLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03295v1,2024-09
LLM Detectors Still Fall Short of Real World: Case of LLM-Generated Short News-Like Posts,"Henrique Da Silva Gameiro, Andrei Kucharavy, Ljiljana Dolamic","With the emergence of widely available powerful LLMs, disinformation generated by large Language Models (LLMs) has become a major concern. Historically, LLM detectors have been touted as a solution, but their effectiveness in the real world is still to be proven. In this paper, we focus on an important setting in information operations -- short news-like posts generated by moderately sophisticated attackers.   We demonstrate that existing LLM detectors, whether zero-shot or purpose-trained, are not ready for real-world use in that setting. All tested zero-shot detectors perform inconsistently with prior benchmarks and are highly vulnerable to sampling temperature increase, a trivial attack absent from recent benchmarks. A purpose-trained detector generalizing across LLMs and unseen attacks can be developed, but it fails to generalize to new human-written texts.   We argue that the former indicates domain-specific benchmarking is needed, while the latter suggests a trade-off between the adversarial evasion resilience and overfitting to the reference human text, with both needing evaluation in benchmarks and currently absent. We believe this suggests a re-consideration of current LLM detector benchmarking approaches and provides a dynamically extensible benchmark to allow it (https://github.com/Reliable-Information-Lab-HEVS/benchmark_llm_texts_detection).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03291v2,2024-09
Shaping the Future of Endangered and Low-Resource Languages -- Our Role in the Age of LLMs: A Keynote at ECIR 2024,Josiane Mothe,"Isidore of Seville is credited with the adage that it is language that gives birth to a people, and not the other way around , underlining the profound role played by language in the formation of cultural and social identity. Today, of the more than 7100 languages listed, a significant number are endangered. Since the 1970s, linguists, information seekers and enthusiasts have helped develop digital resources and automatic tools to support a wide range of languages, including endangered ones. The advent of Large Language Model (LLM) technologies holds both promise and peril. They offer unprecedented possibilities for the translation and generation of content and resources, key elements in the preservation and revitalisation of languages. They also present threat of homogenisation, cultural oversimplification and the further marginalisation of already vulnerable languages. The talk this paper is based on has proposed an initiatory journey, exploring the potential paths and partnerships between technology and tradition, with a particular focus on the Occitan language. Occitan is a language from Southern France, parts of Spain and Italy that played a major cultural and economic role, particularly in the Middle Ages. It is now endangered according to UNESCO. The talk critically has examined how human expertise and artificial intelligence can work together to offer hope for preserving the linguistic diversity that forms the foundation of our global and especially our European heritage while addressing some of the ethical and practical challenges that accompany the use of these powerful technologies.

iText2KG: Incremental Knowledge Graphs Construction Using Large Language Models,"Yassir Lairgi, Ludovic Moncla, Rémy Cazabet, Khalid Benabdeslem, Pierre Cléau","Most available data is unstructured, making it challenging to access valuable information. Automatically building Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is crucial for structuring data and making it accessible, allowing users to search for information effectively. KGs also facilitate insights, inference, and reasoning. Traditional NLP methods, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction, are key in information retrieval but face limitations, including the use of predefined entity types and the need for supervised learning. Current research leverages large language models' capabilities, such as zero- or few-shot learning. However, unresolved and semantically duplicated entities and relations still pose challenges, leading to inconsistent graphs and requiring extensive post-processing. Additionally, most approaches are topic-dependent. In this paper, we propose iText2KG, a method for incremental, topic-independent KG construction without post-processing. This plug-and-play, zero-shot method is applicable across a wide range of KG construction scenarios and comprises four modules: Document Distiller, Incremental Entity Extractor, Incremental Relation Extractor, and Graph Integrator and Visualization. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods across three scenarios: converting scientific papers to graphs, websites to graphs, and CVs to graphs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03284v1,2024-09
ChartMoE: Mixture of Expert Connector for Advanced Chart Understanding,"Zhengzhuo Xu, Bowen Qu, Yiyan Qi, Sinan Du, Chengjin Xu, Chun Yuan, Jian Guo","Automatic chart understanding is crucial for content comprehension and document parsing. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding through domain-specific alignment and fine-tuning. However, the application of alignment training within the chart domain is still underexplored. To address this, we propose ChartMoE, which employs the mixture of expert (MoE) architecture to replace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap. Specifically, we train multiple linear connectors through distinct alignment tasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for different experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with over 900K chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment tasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we initialize different experts in four distinct ways and adopt high-quality knowledge learning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our initialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art from 80.48% to 84.64% on the ChartQA benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03277v1,2024-09
Strategic Chain-of-Thought: Guiding Accurate Reasoning in LLMs through Strategy Elicitation,"Yu Wang, Shiwan Zhao, Zhihu Wang, Heyuan Huang, Ming Fan, Yubo Zhang, Zhixing Wang, Haijun Wang, Ting Liu","The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm has emerged as a critical approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, despite their widespread adoption and success, CoT methods often exhibit instability due to their inability to consistently ensure the quality of generated reasoning paths, leading to sub-optimal reasoning performance. To address this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Strategic Chain-of-Thought} (SCoT), a novel methodology designed to refine LLM performance by integrating strategic knowledge prior to generating intermediate reasoning steps. SCoT employs a two-stage approach within a single prompt: first eliciting an effective problem-solving strategy, which is then used to guide the generation of high-quality CoT paths and final answers. Our experiments across eight challenging reasoning datasets demonstrate significant improvements, including a 21.05\% increase on the GSM8K dataset and 24.13\% on the Tracking\_Objects dataset, respectively, using the Llama3-8b model.

CA-BERT: Leveraging Context Awareness for Enhanced Multi-Turn Chat Interaction,"Minghao Liu, Mingxiu Sui, Yi Nan, Cangqing Wang, Zhijie Zhou","Effective communication in automated chat systems hinges on the ability to understand and respond to context. Traditional models often struggle with determining when additional context is necessary for generating appropriate responses. This paper introduces Context-Aware BERT (CA-BERT), a transformer-based model specifically fine-tuned to address this challenge. CA-BERT innovatively applies deep learning techniques to discern context necessity in multi-turn chat interactions, enhancing both the relevance and accuracy of responses.   We describe the development of CA-BERT, which adapts the robust architecture of BERT with a novel training regimen focused on a specialized dataset of chat dialogues. The model is evaluated on its ability to classify context necessity, demonstrating superior performance over baseline BERT models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, CA-BERT's implementation showcases significant reductions in training time and resource usage, making it feasible for real-time applications.   The results indicate that CA-BERT can effectively enhance the functionality of chatbots by providing a nuanced understanding of context, thereby improving user experience and interaction quality in automated systems.

GraphInsight: Unlocking Insights in Large Language Models for Graph Structure Understanding,"Yukun Cao, Shuo Han, Zengyi Gao, Zezhong Ding, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou","Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in processing graphs, they struggle with comprehending graphical structure information through prompts of graph description sequences, especially as the graph size increases. We attribute this challenge to the uneven memory performance of LLMs across different positions in graph description sequences, known as ''positional biases''. To address this, we propose GraphInsight, a novel framework aimed at improving LLMs' comprehension of both macro- and micro-level graphical information. GraphInsight is grounded in two key strategies: 1) placing critical graphical information in positions where LLMs exhibit stronger memory performance, and 2) investigating a lightweight external knowledge base for regions with weaker memory performance, inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Moreover, GraphInsight explores integrating these two strategies into LLM agent processes for composite graph tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Extensive empirical studies on benchmarks with a wide range of evaluation tasks show that GraphInsight significantly outperforms all other graph description methods (e.g., prompting techniques and reordering strategies) in understanding graph structures of varying sizes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03258v3,2024-09

Inspired by human learning, we propose Exploration-based Error Correction Learning (E2CL), a novel framework that leverages exploration-induced errors and environmental feedback to enhance environment alignment for embodied agents. E2CL incorporates teacher-guided and teacher-free explorations to gather environmental feedback and correct erroneous actions.

Enhancing Healthcare LLM Trust with Atypical Presentations Recalibration,"Jeremy Qin, Bang Liu, Quoc Dinh Nguyen","Black-box large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in various environments, making it essential for these models to effectively convey their confidence and uncertainty, especially in high-stakes settings. However, these models often exhibit overconfidence, leading to potential risks and misjudgments. Existing techniques for eliciting and calibrating LLM confidence have primarily focused on general reasoning datasets, yielding only modest improvements. Accurate calibration is crucial for informed decision-making and preventing adverse outcomes but remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of tasks these models perform. In this work, we investigate the miscalibration behavior of black-box LLMs within the healthcare setting. We propose a novel method, \textit{Atypical Presentations Recalibration}, which leverages atypical presentations to adjust the model's confidence estimates. Our approach significantly improves calibration, reducing calibration errors by approximately 60\% on three medical question answering datasets and outperforming existing methods such as vanilla verbalized confidence, CoT verbalized confidence and others.

An Effective Deployment of Diffusion LM for Data Augmentation in Low-Resource Sentiment Classification,"Zhuowei Chen, Lianxi Wang, Yuben Wu, Xinfeng Liao, Yujia Tian, Junyang Zhong","Sentiment classification (SC) often suffers from low-resource challenges such as domain-specific contexts, imbalanced label distributions, and few-shot scenarios. The potential of the diffusion language model (LM) for textual data augmentation (DA) remains unexplored, moreover, textual DA methods struggle to balance the diversity and consistency of new samples. Most DA methods either perform logical modifications or rephrase less important tokens in the original sequence with the language model. In the context of SC, strong emotional tokens could act critically on the sentiment of the whole sequence. Therefore, contrary to rephrasing less important context, we propose DiffusionCLS to leverage a diffusion LM to capture in-domain knowledge and generate pseudo samples by reconstructing strong label-related tokens. This approach ensures a balance between consistency and diversity, avoiding the introduction of noise and augmenting crucial features of datasets. DiffusionCLS also comprises a Noise-Resistant Training objective to help the model generalize. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various low-resource scenarios including domain-specific and domain-general problems. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our framework's modules, and visualization studies highlight optimal deployment conditions, reinforcing our conclusions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03203v2,2024-09
Lightweight Transducer Based on Frame-Level Criterion,"Genshun Wan, Mengzhi Wang, Tingzhi Mao, Hang Chen, Zhongfu Ye","The transducer model trained based on sequence-level criterion requires a lot of memory due to the generation of the large probability matrix. We proposed a lightweight transducer model based on frame-level criterion, which uses the results of the CTC forced alignment algorithm to determine the label for each frame. Then the encoder output can be combined with the decoder output at the corresponding time, rather than adding each element output by the encoder to each element output by the decoder as in the transducer. This significantly reduces memory and computation requirements. To address the problem of imbalanced classification caused by excessive blanks in the label, we decouple the blank and non-blank probabilities and truncate the gradient of the blank classifier to the main network. Experiments on the AISHELL-1 demonstrate that this enables the lightweight transducer to achieve similar results to transducer. Additionally, we use richer information to predict the probability of blank, achieving superior results to transducer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13698v2,2024-09
Bypassing DARCY Defense: Indistinguishable Universal Adversarial Triggers,"Zuquan Peng, Yuanyuan He, Jianbing Ni, Ben Niu","Neural networks (NN) classification models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) are vulnerable to the Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) attack that triggers a model to produce a specific prediction for any input. DARCY borrows the ""honeypot"" concept to bait multiple trapdoors, effectively detecting the adversarial examples generated by UAT. Unfortunately, we find a new UAT generation method, called IndisUAT, which produces triggers (i.e., tokens) and uses them to craft adversarial examples whose feature distribution is indistinguishable from that of the benign examples in a randomly-chosen category at the detection layer of DARCY. The produced adversarial examples incur the maximal loss of predicting results in the DARCY-protected models. Meanwhile, the produced triggers are effective in black-box models for text generation, text inference, and reading comprehension. Finally, the evaluation results under NN models for NLP tasks indicate that the IndisUAT method can effectively circumvent DARCY and penetrate other defenses. For example, IndisUAT can reduce the true positive rate of DARCY's detection by at least 40.8% and 90.6%, and drop the accuracy by at least 33.3% and 51.6% in the RNN and CNN models, respectively. IndisUAT reduces the accuracy of the BERT's adversarial defense model by at least 34.0%, and makes the GPT-2 language model spew racist outputs even when conditioned on non-racial context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03183v1,2024-09
MARAGS: A Multi-Adapter System for Multi-Task Retrieval Augmented Generation Question Answering,Mitchell DeHaven,"In this paper we present a multi-adapter retrieval augmented generation system (MARAGS) for Meta's Comprehensive RAG (CRAG) competition for KDD CUP 2024.

Continual Skill and Task Learning via Dialogue,"Weiwei Gu, Suresh Kondepudi, Lixiao Huang, Nakul Gopalan","Continual and interactive robot learning is a challenging problem as the robot is present with human users who expect the robot to learn novel skills to solve novel tasks perpetually with sample efficiency. In this work we present a framework for robots to query and learn visuo-motor robot skills and task relevant information via natural language dialog interactions with human users. Previous approaches either focus on improving the performance of instruction following agents, or passively learn novel skills or concepts. Instead, we used dialog combined with a language-skill grounding embedding to query or confirm skills and/or tasks requested by a user. To achieve this goal, we developed and integrated three different components for our agent. Firstly, we propose a novel visual-motor control policy ACT with Low Rank Adaptation (ACT-LoRA), which enables the existing SoTA ACT model to perform few-shot continual learning. Secondly, we develop an alignment model that projects demonstrations across skill embodiments into a shared embedding allowing us to know when to ask questions and/or demonstrations from users. Finally, we integrated an existing LLM to interact with a human user to perform grounded interactive continual skill learning to solve a task. Our ACT-LoRA model learns novel fine-tuned skills with a 100% accuracy when trained with only five demonstrations for a novel skill while still maintaining a 74.75% accuracy on pre-trained skills in the RLBench dataset where other models fall significantly short. We also performed a human-subjects study with 8 subjects to demonstrate the continual learning capabilities of our combined framework. We achieve a success rate of 75% in the task of sandwich making with the real robot learning from participant data demonstrating that robots can learn novel skills or task knowledge from dialogue with non-expert users using our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03166v2,2024-09
MaterialBENCH: Evaluating College-Level Materials Science Problem-Solving Abilities of Large Language Models,"Michiko Yoshitake, Yuta Suzuki, Ryo Igarashi, Yoshitaka Ushiku, Keisuke Nagato","A college-level benchmark dataset for large language models (LLMs) in the materials science field, MaterialBENCH, is constructed. This dataset consists of problem-answer pairs, based on university textbooks. There are two types of problems: one is the free-response answer type, and the other is the multiple-choice type. Multiple-choice problems are constructed by adding three incorrect answers as choices to a correct answer, so that LLMs can choose one of the four as a response. Most of the problems for free-response answer and multiple-choice types overlap except for the format of the answers. We also conduct experiments using the MaterialBENCH on LLMs, including ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Bard (at the time of the experiments), and GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with the OpenAI API. The differences and similarities in the performance of LLMs measured by the MaterialBENCH are analyzed and discussed. Performance differences between the free-response type and multiple-choice type in the same models and the influence of using system massages on multiple-choice problems are also studied. We anticipate that MaterialBENCH will encourage further developments of LLMs in reasoning abilities to solve more complicated problems and eventually contribute to materials research and discovery.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03161v2,2024-09
Debate on Graph: a Flexible and Reliable Reasoning Framework for Large Language Models,"Jie Ma, Zhitao Gao, Qi Chai, Wangchun Sun, Pinghui Wang, Hongbin Pei, Jing Tao, Lingyun Song, Jun Liu, Chen Zhang, Lizhen Cui","Large Language Models (LLMs) may suffer from hallucinations in real-world applications due to the lack of relevant knowledge. In contrast, knowledge graphs encompass extensive, multi-relational structures that store a vast array of symbolic facts. Consequently, integrating LLMs with knowledge graphs has been extensively explored, with Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) serving as a critical touchstone for the integration. This task requires LLMs to answer natural language questions by retrieving relevant triples from knowledge graphs. However, existing methods face two significant challenges: \textit{excessively long reasoning paths distracting from the answer generation}, and \textit{false-positive relations hindering the path refinement}. In this paper, we propose an iterative interactive KGQA framework that leverages the interactive learning capabilities of LLMs to perform reasoning and Debating over Graphs (DoG). Specifically, DoG employs a subgraph-focusing mechanism, allowing LLMs to perform answer trying after each reasoning step, thereby mitigating the impact of lengthy reasoning paths. On the other hand, DoG utilizes a multi-role debate team to gradually simplify complex questions, reducing the influence of false-positive relations. This debate mechanism ensures the reliability of the reasoning process. Experimental results on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our architecture. Notably, DoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG by 23.7\% and 9.1\% in accuracy on WebQuestions and GrailQA, respectively. Furthermore, the integration experiments with various LLMs on the mentioned datasets highlight the flexibility of DoG.

GraphEx: A Graph-based Extraction Method for Advertiser Keyphrase Recommendation,"Ashirbad Mishra, Soumik Dey, Marshall Wu, Jinyu Zhao, He Yu, Kaichen Ni, Binbin Li, Kamesh Madduri","Online sellers and advertisers are recommended keyphrases for their listed products, which they bid on to enhance their sales. One popular paradigm that generates such recommendations is Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMC), which involves tagging/mapping keyphrases to items. We outline the limitations of using traditional item-query based tagging or mapping techniques for keyphrase recommendations on E-Commerce platforms. We introduce GraphEx, an innovative graph-based approach that recommends keyphrases to sellers using extraction of token permutations from item titles. Additionally, we demonstrate that relying on traditional metrics such as precision/recall can be misleading in practical applications, thereby necessitating a combination of metrics to evaluate performance in real-world scenarios. These metrics are designed to assess the relevance of keyphrases to items and the potential for buyer outreach. GraphEx outperforms production models at eBay, achieving the objectives mentioned above. It supports near real-time inferencing in resource-constrained production environments and scales effectively for billions of items.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03140v2,2024-09
"Well, that escalated quickly: The Single-Turn Crescendo Attack (STCA)","Alan Aqrawi, Arian Abbasi","This paper introduces a new method for adversarial attacks on large language models (LLMs) called the Single-Turn Crescendo Attack (STCA). Building on the multi-turn crescendo attack method introduced by Russinovich, Salem, and Eldan (2024), which gradually escalates the context to provoke harmful responses, the STCA achieves similar outcomes in a single interaction. By condensing the escalation into a single, well-crafted prompt, the STCA bypasses typical moderation filters that LLMs use to prevent inappropriate outputs. This technique reveals vulnerabilities in current LLMs and emphasizes the importance of stronger safeguards in responsible AI (RAI). The STCA offers a novel method that has not been previously explored.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03131v2,2024-09
Probing self-attention in self-supervised speech models for cross-linguistic differences,"Sai Gopinath, Joselyn Rodriguez","Speech models have gained traction thanks to increase in accuracy from novel transformer architectures. While this impressive increase in performance across automatic speech recognition (ASR) benchmarks is noteworthy, there is still much that is unknown about the use of attention mechanisms for speech-related tasks. For example, while it is assumed that these models are learning language-independent (i.e., universal) speech representations, there has not yet been an in-depth exploration of what it would mean for the models to be language-independent. In the current paper, we explore this question within the realm of self-attention mechanisms of one small self-supervised speech transformer model (TERA). We find that even with a small model, the attention heads learned are diverse ranging from almost entirely diagonal to almost entirely global regardless of the training language. We highlight some notable differences in attention patterns between Turkish and English and demonstrate that the models do learn important phonological information during pretraining. We also present a head ablation study which shows that models across languages primarily rely on diagonal heads to classify phonemes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03115v1,2024-09
Quantification of stylistic differences in human- and ASR-produced transcripts of African American English,"Annika Heuser, Tyler Kendall, Miguel del Rio, Quinten McNamara, Nishchal Bhandari, Corey Miller, Migüel Jetté","Common measures of accuracy used to assess the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, as well as human transcribers, conflate multiple sources of error. Stylistic differences, such as verbatim vs non-verbatim, can play a significant role in ASR performance evaluation when differences exist between training and test datasets. The problem is compounded for speech from underrepresented varieties, where the speech to orthography mapping is not as standardized. We categorize the kinds of stylistic differences between 6 transcription versions, 4 human- and 2 ASR-produced, of 10 hours of African American English (AAE) speech. Focusing on verbatim features and AAE morphosyntactic features, we investigate the interactions of these categories with how well transcripts can be compared via word error rate (WER). The results, and overall analysis, help clarify how ASR outputs are a function of the decisions made by the training data's human transcribers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03059v1,2024-09
Oddballness: universal anomaly detection with language models,"Filip Graliński, Ryszard Staruch, Krzysztof Jurkiewicz","We present a new method to detect anomalies in texts (in general: in sequences of any data), using language models, in a totally unsupervised manner. The method considers probabilities (likelihoods) generated by a language model, but instead of focusing on low-likelihood tokens, it considers a new metric introduced in this paper: oddballness. Oddballness measures how ``strange'' a given token is according to the language model. We demonstrate in grammatical error detection tasks (a specific case of text anomaly detection) that oddballness is better than just considering low-likelihood events, if a totally unsupervised setup is assumed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03046v1,2024-09
CLUE: Concept-Level Uncertainty Estimation for Large Language Models,"Yu-Hsiang Wang, Andrew Bai, Che-Ping Tsai, Cho-Jui Hsieh","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in various natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Previous studies suggest that LLMs' generation process involves uncertainty. However, existing approaches to uncertainty estimation mainly focus on sequence-level uncertainty, overlooking individual pieces of information within sequences. These methods fall short in separately assessing the uncertainty of each component in a sequence. In response, we propose a novel framework for Concept-Level Uncertainty Estimation (CLUE) for LLMs. We leverage LLMs to convert output sequences into concept-level representations, breaking down sequences into individual concepts and measuring the uncertainty of each concept separately. We conduct experiments to demonstrate that CLUE can provide more interpretable uncertainty estimation results compared with sentence-level uncertainty, and could be a useful tool for various tasks such as hallucination detection and story generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03021v1,2024-09
RoboTwin: Dual-Arm Robot Benchmark with Generative Digital Twins (early version),"Yao Mu, Tianxing Chen, Shijia Peng, Zanxin Chen, Zeyu Gao, Yude Zou, Lunkai Lin, Zhiqiang Xie, Ping Luo","In the rapidly advancing field of robotics, dual-arm coordination and complex object manipulation are essential capabilities for developing advanced autonomous systems. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality demonstration data and real-world-aligned evaluation benchmarks severely limits such development. To address this, we introduce RoboTwin, a generative digital twin framework that uses 3D generative foundation models and large language models to produce diverse expert datasets and provide a real-world-aligned evaluation platform for dual-arm robotic tasks. Specifically, RoboTwin creates varied digital twins of objects from single 2D images, generating realistic and interactive scenarios. It also introduces a spatial relation-aware code generation framework that combines object annotations with large language models to break down tasks, determine spatial constraints, and generate precise robotic movement code. Our framework offers a comprehensive benchmark with both simulated and real-world data, enabling standardized evaluation and better alignment between simulated training and real-world performance. We validated our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world samples improve the success rate of over 70% for single-arm tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on real-world data. This significant improvement demonstrates RoboTwin's potential to enhance the development and evaluation of dual-arm robotic manipulation systems.

NESTFUL: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Nested Sequences of API Calls,"Kinjal Basu, Ibrahim Abdelaziz, Kelsey Bradford, Maxwell Crouse, Kiran Kate, Sadhana Kumaravel, Saurabh Goyal, Asim Munawar, Yara Rizk, Xin Wang, Luis Lastras, Pavan Kapanipathi","Autonomous agent applications powered by large language models (LLMs) have recently risen to prominence as effective tools for addressing complex real-world tasks. At their core, agentic workflows rely on LLMs to plan and execute the use of tools and external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in sequence to arrive at the answer to a user's request. Various benchmarks and leaderboards have emerged to evaluate an LLM's capabilities for tool and API use; however, most of these evaluations only track single or multiple isolated API calling capabilities. In this paper, we present NESTFUL, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs on nested sequences of API calls, i.e., sequences where the output of one API call is passed as input to a subsequent call. NESTFUL has a total of 300 human annotated samples divided into two types - executable and non-executable. The executable samples are curated manually by crawling Rapid-APIs whereas the non-executable samples are hand picked by human annotators from data synthetically generated using an LLM. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs with function calling abilities on NESTFUL. Our results show that most models do not perform well on nested APIs in NESTFUL as compared to their performance on the simpler problem settings available in existing benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03797v1,2024-09
Masked Diffusion Models are Secretly Time-Agnostic Masked Models and Exploit Inaccurate Categorical Sampling,"Kaiwen Zheng, Yongxin Chen, Hanzi Mao, Ming-Yu Liu, Jun Zhu, Qinsheng Zhang","Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models (ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02908v3,2024-09

Inspired by modularity within the human brain, there is a growing tendency to decompose LLMs into numerous functional modules, allowing for inference with part of modules and dynamic assembly of modules to tackle complex tasks, such as mixture-of-experts. To highlight the inherent efficiency and composability of the modular approach, we coin the term brick to represent each functional module, designating the modularized structure as configurable foundation models. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive overview and investigation of the construction, utilization, and limitation of configurable foundation models. We first formalize modules into emergent bricks - functional neuron partitions that emerge during the pre-training phase, and customized bricks - bricks constructed via additional post-training to improve the capabilities and knowledge of LLMs. Based on diverse functional bricks, we further present four brick-oriented operations: retrieval and routing, merging, updating, and growing. These operations allow for dynamic configuration of LLMs based on instructions to handle complex tasks. To verify our perspective, we conduct an empirical analysis on widely-used LLMs. We find that the FFN layers follow modular patterns with functional specialization of neurons and functional neuron partitions.

Historical German Text Normalization Using Type- and Token-Based Language Modeling,Anton Ehrmanntraut,"Historic variations of spelling poses a challenge for full-text search or natural language processing on historical digitized texts. To minimize the gap between the historic orthography and contemporary spelling, usually an automatic orthographic normalization of the historical source material is pursued. This report proposes a normalization system for German literary texts from c. 1700-1900, trained on a parallel corpus. The proposed system makes use of a machine learning approach using Transformer language models, combining an encoder-decoder model to normalize individual word types, and a pre-trained causal language model to adjust these normalizations within their context. An extensive evaluation shows that the proposed system provides state-of-the-art accuracy, comparable with a much larger fully end-to-end sentence-based normalization system, fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer large language model.

Most previous studies focus on improving and measuring the performance of LLMs based on textual math reasoning datasets (e.g., MATH, GSM8K). Recently, a few researchers have released English multimodal math datasets (e.g., MATHVISTA and MATH-V) to evaluate the effectiveness of large multimodal models (LMMs). In this paper, we release a Chinese multimodal math (CMM-Math) dataset, including benchmark and training parts, to evaluate and enhance the mathematical reasoning of LMMs. CMM-Math contains over 28,000 high-quality samples, featuring a variety of problem types (e.g., multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and so on) with detailed solutions across 12 grade levels from elementary to high school in China.

Pooling And Attention: What Are Effective Designs For LLM-Based Embedding Models?,"Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang","The significant advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks have led to a growing body of work exploring LLM-based embedding models. While these models, employing different pooling and attention strategies, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on public embedding benchmarks, questions still arise about what constitutes an effective design for LLM-based embedding models. However, these models are often trained on different datasets, using different LLM base models or training settings. Moreover, evaluations on public embedding benchmarks often fail to report statistical significance, making it difficult to determine which designs truly contribute to final performance. This complicates the process for practitioners seeking optimal training recipes for LLM-based embedding models. In this study, we conduct a large-scale experiment by training a series of LLM-based embedding models using the same training data and base model but differing in their pooling and attention strategies. The results show that there is no one-size-fits-all solution: while bidirectional attention and an additional trainable pooling layer outperform in text similarity and information retrieval tasks, they do not significantly surpass simpler designs like EOS-last token pooling and default causal attention in clustering and classification tasks. Furthermore, we propose a new pooling strategy, Multi-Layers Trainable Pooling, which transforms the outputs of all hidden layers, rather than just the last layer, using a cross-attention network. This method proves to be statistically superior in text similarity and retrieval tasks compared to existing pooling methods. Overall, this paper sheds light on effective training strategies for LLM-based embedding models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02727v2,2024-09

The primary objective of this study is to explore whether refining a pre-training dataset using specific quality metrics for scientific papers can enhance the performance of the resulting model. To accomplish this, we employ two straightforward journal impact metrics and conduct experiments by continually pre-training BERT on various subsets of the complete PubMed training set, we then evaluate the resulting models on biomedical language understanding tasks from the BLURB benchmark. Our results show that pruning using journal impact metrics is not efficient. But we also show that pre-training using fewer abstracts (but with the same number of training steps) does not necessarily decrease the resulting model's performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02725v1,2024-09
Hallucination Detection in LLMs: Fast and Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuned Models,"Gabriel Y. Arteaga, Thomas B. Schön, Nicolas Pielawski","Uncertainty estimation is a necessary component when implementing AI in high-risk settings, such as autonomous cars, medicine, or insurances. Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen a surge in popularity in recent years, but they are subject to hallucinations, which may cause serious harm in high-risk settings. Despite their success, LLMs are expensive to train and run: they need a large amount of computations and memory, preventing the use of ensembling methods in practice. In this work, we present a novel method that allows for fast and memory-friendly training of LLM ensembles. We show that the resulting ensembles can detect hallucinations and are a viable approach in practice as only one GPU is needed for training and inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02976v2,2024-09
Alignment-Aware Model Extraction Attacks on Large Language Models,"Zi Liang, Qingqing Ye, Yanyun Wang, Sen Zhang, Yaxin Xiao, Ronghua Li, Jianliang Xu, Haibo Hu","Model extraction attacks (MEAs) on large language models (LLMs) have received increasing research attention lately. Existing attack methods on LLMs inherit the extraction strategies from those designed for deep neural networks (DNNs) yet neglect the inconsistency of training tasks between MEA and LLMs' alignments. As such, they result in poor attack performances. To tackle this issue, we present Locality Reinforced Distillation (LoRD), a novel model extraction attack algorithm specifically for LLMs. In particular, we design a policy-gradient-style training task, which utilizes victim models' responses as a signal to guide the crafting of preference for the local model. Theoretical analysis has shown that i) LoRD's convergence procedure in MEAs is consistent with the alignments of LLMs, and ii) LoRD can reduce query complexity while mitigating watermark protection through exploration-based stealing. Extensive experiments on domain-specific extractions demonstrate the superiority of our method by examining the extraction of various state-of-the-art commercial LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02718v1,2024-09
A Data Selection Approach for Enhancing Low Resource Machine Translation Using Cross-Lingual Sentence Representations,"Nidhi Kowtal, Tejas Deshpande, Raviraj Joshi","Machine translation in low-resource language pairs faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of parallel corpora and linguistic resources. This study focuses on the case of English-Marathi language pairs, where existing datasets are notably noisy, impeding the performance of machine translation models. To mitigate the impact of data quality issues, we propose a data filtering approach based on cross-lingual sentence representations. Our methodology leverages a multilingual SBERT model to filter out problematic translations in the training data. Specifically, we employ an IndicSBERT similarity model to assess the semantic equivalence between original and translated sentences, allowing us to retain linguistically correct translations while discarding instances with substantial deviations. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in translation quality over the baseline post-filtering with IndicSBERT. This illustrates how cross-lingual sentence representations can reduce errors in machine translation scenarios with limited resources. By integrating multilingual sentence BERT models into the translation pipeline, this research contributes to advancing machine translation techniques in low-resource environments. The proposed method not only addresses the challenges in English-Marathi language pairs but also provides a valuable framework for enhancing translation quality in other low-resource language translation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02712v1,2024-09
Detecting Calls to Action in Multimodal Content: Analysis of the 2021 German Federal Election Campaign on Instagram,"Michael Achmann-Denkler, Jakob Fehle, Mario Haim, Christian Wolff","This study investigates the automated classification of Calls to Action (CTAs) within the 2021 German Instagram election campaign to advance the understanding of mobilization in social media contexts. We analyzed over 2,208 Instagram stories and 712 posts using fine-tuned BERT models and OpenAI's GPT-4 models. The fine-tuned BERT model incorporating synthetic training data achieved a macro F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating a robust classification performance. Our analysis revealed that 49.58% of Instagram posts and 10.64% of stories contained CTAs, highlighting significant differences in mobilization strategies between these content types. Additionally, we found that FDP and the Greens had the highest prevalence of CTAs in posts, whereas CDU and CSU led in story CTAs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02690v1,2024-09
Deconfounded Causality-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Problem-Solving Improvement of LLMs,"Ruoyu Wang, Xiaoxuan Li, Lina Yao","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in tackling various tasks based on human instructions, but studies reveal that they often struggle with tasks requiring reasoning, such as math or physics. This limitation raises questions about whether LLMs truly comprehend embedded knowledge or merely learn to replicate the token distribution without a true understanding of the content. In this paper, we delve into this problem and aim to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. First, we investigate if the model has genuine reasoning capabilities by visualizing the text generation process at the attention and representation level. Then, we formulate the reasoning process of LLMs into a causal framework, which provides a formal explanation of the problems observed in the visualization. Finally, building upon this causal framework, we propose Deconfounded Causal Adaptation (DCA), a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities by encouraging the model to extract the general problem-solving skills and apply these skills to different questions. Experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline consistently across multiple benchmarks, and with only 1.2M tunable parameters, we achieve better or comparable results to other fine-tuning methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our method in improving the overall accuracy and reliability of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02686v2,2024-09
Creating Domain-Specific Translation Memories for Machine Translation Fine-tuning: The TRENCARD Bilingual Cardiology Corpus,Gokhan Dogru,"This article investigates how translation memories (TM) can be created by translators or other language professionals in order to compile domain-specific parallel corpora , which can then be used in different scenarios, such as machine translation training and fine-tuning, TM leveraging, and/or large language model fine-tuning. The article introduces a semi-automatic TM preparation methodology leveraging primarily translation tools used by translators in favor of data quality and control by the translators. This semi-automatic methodology is then used to build a cardiology-based Turkish -> English corpus from bilingual abstracts of Turkish cardiology journals. The resulting corpus called TRENCARD Corpus has approximately 800,000 source words and 50,000 sentences. Using this methodology, translators can build their custom TMs in a reasonable time and use them in their bilingual data requiring tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02667v1,2024-09

This study explores the application of ensemble learning to enhance adversarial attacks on natural language processing (NLP) models. We systematically tested and refined several adversarial attack methods, including BERT-Attack, Genetic algorithms, TextFooler, and CLARE, on five datasets across various misinformation tasks.

A Survey on Emergent Language,"Jannik Peters, Constantin Waubert de Puiseau, Hasan Tercan, Arya Gopikrishnan, Gustavo Adolpho Lucas De Carvalho, Christian Bitter, Tobias Meisen","The field of emergent language represents a novel area of research within the domain of artificial intelligence, particularly within the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Although the concept of studying language emergence is not new, early approaches were primarily concerned with explaining human language formation, with little consideration given to its potential utility for artificial agents. In contrast, studies based on reinforcement learning aim to develop communicative capabilities in agents that are comparable to or even superior to human language. Thus, they extend beyond the learned statistical representations that are common in natural language processing research. This gives rise to a number of fundamental questions, from the prerequisites for language emergence to the criteria for measuring its success. This paper addresses these questions by providing a comprehensive review of 181 scientific publications on emergent language in artificial intelligence. Its objective is to serve as a reference for researchers interested in or proficient in the field. Consequently, the main contributions are the definition and overview of the prevailing terminology, the analysis of existing evaluation methods and metrics, and the description of the identified research gaps.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02645v1,2024-09
PUB: Plot Understanding Benchmark and Dataset for Evaluating Large Language Models on Synthetic Visual Data Interpretation,"Aneta Pawelec, Victoria Sara Wesołowska, Zuzanna Bączek, Piotr Sankowski","The ability of large language models (LLMs) to interpret visual representations of data is crucial for advancing their application in data analysis and decision-making processes. This paper presents a novel synthetic dataset designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in interpreting various forms of data visualizations, including plots like time series, histograms, violins, boxplots, and clusters. Our dataset is generated using controlled parameters to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential real-world scenarios. We employ multimodal text prompts with questions related to visual data in images to benchmark several state-of-the-art models like ChatGPT or Gemini, assessing their understanding and interpretative accuracy.   To ensure data integrity, our benchmark dataset is generated automatically, making it entirely new and free from prior exposure to the models being tested. This strategy allows us to evaluate the models' ability to truly interpret and understand the data, eliminating possibility of pre-learned responses, and allowing for an unbiased evaluation of the models' capabilities. We also introduce quantitative metrics to assess the performance of the models, providing a robust and comprehensive evaluation tool.   Benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs with this dataset reveals varying degrees of success, highlighting specific strengths and weaknesses in interpreting diverse types of visual data. The results provide valuable insights into the current capabilities of LLMs and identify key areas for improvement. This work establishes a foundational benchmark for future research and development aimed at enhancing the visual interpretative abilities of language models. In the future, improved LLMs with robust visual interpretation skills can significantly aid in automated data analysis, scientific research, educational tools, and business intelligence applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02617v1,2024-09
An Analysis of Linear Complexity Attention Substitutes with BEST-RQ,"Ryan Whetten, Titouan Parcollet, Adel Moumen, Marco Dinarelli, Yannick Estève","Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has proven to be effective in various domains, including speech processing. However, SSL is computationally and memory expensive. This is in part due the quadratic complexity of multi-head self-attention (MHSA). Alternatives for MHSA have been proposed and used in the speech domain, but have yet to be investigated properly in an SSL setting. In this work, we study the effects of replacing MHSA with recent state-of-the-art alternatives that have linear complexity, namely, HyperMixing, Fastformer, SummaryMixing, and Mamba. We evaluate these methods by looking at the speed, the amount of VRAM consumed, and the performance on the SSL MP3S benchmark. Results show that these linear alternatives maintain competitive performance compared to MHSA while, on average, decreasing VRAM consumption by around 20% to 60% and increasing speed from 7% to 65% for input sequences ranging from 20 to 80 seconds.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02596v1,2024-09
Sorbet: A Neuromorphic Hardware-Compatible Transformer-Based Spiking Language Model,"Kaiwen Tang, Zhanglu Yan, Weng-Fai Wong","For reasons such as privacy, there are use cases for language models at the edge. This has given rise to small language models (SLMs) targeted for deployment in resource-constrained devices where energy efficiency is a significant concern. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution due to their energy efficiency, and there are already works on realizing transformer-based models on SNNs. However, key operations like softmax and layer normalization (LN) are difficult to implement on neuromorphic hardware, and many of these early works sidestepped them. To address these challenges, we introduce Sorbet, a transformer-based spiking language model that is more neuromorphic hardware-compatible. Sorbet incorporates a novel shifting-based softmax called PTsoftmax and a power normalization method using bit-shifting (BSPN), both designed to replace the respective energy-intensive operations. By leveraging knowledge distillation and model quantization, Sorbet achieved a highly compressed binary weight model that maintains competitive performance while significantly reducing energy consumption. We validate Sorbet's effectiveness through extensive testing on the GLUE benchmark and a series of ablation studies, demonstrating its potential as an energy-efficient solution for language model inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15298v1,2024-09
More is More: Addition Bias in Large Language Models,"Luca Santagata, Cristiano De Nobili","In this paper, we investigate the presence of additive bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing a parallel to the cognitive bias observed in humans where individuals tend to favor additive over subtractive changes. Using a series of controlled experiments, we tested various LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral, Math$\Sigma$tral, and Llama 3.1, on tasks designed to measure their propensity for additive versus subtractive modifications. Our findings demonstrate a significant preference for additive changes across all tested models. For example, in a palindrome creation task, Llama 3.1 favored adding letters 97.85% of the time over removing them. Similarly, in a Lego tower balancing task, GPT-3.5 Turbo chose to add a brick 76.38% of the time rather than remove one. In a text summarization task, Mistral 7B produced longer summaries in 59.40% to 75.10% of cases when asked to improve its own or others' writing. These results indicate that, similar to humans, LLMs exhibit a marked additive bias, which might have implications when LLMs are used on a large scale. Addittive bias might increase resource use and environmental impact, leading to higher economic costs due to overconsumption and waste. This bias should be considered in the development and application of LLMs to ensure balanced and efficient problem-solving approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02569v1,2024-09
Language is Scary when Over-Analyzed: Unpacking Implied Misogynistic Reasoning with Argumentation Theory-Driven Prompts,"Arianna Muti, Federico Ruggeri, Khalid Al-Khatib, Alberto Barrón-Cedeño, Tommaso Caselli","We propose misogyny detection as an Argumentative Reasoning task and we investigate the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to understand the implicit reasoning used to convey misogyny in both Italian and English. The central aim is to generate the missing reasoning link between a message and the implied meanings encoding the misogyny. Our study uses argumentation theory as a foundation to form a collection of prompts in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. These prompts integrate different techniques, including chain-of-thought reasoning and augmented knowledge. Our findings show that LLMs fall short on reasoning capabilities about misogynistic comments and that they mostly rely on their implicit knowledge derived from internalized common stereotypes about women to generate implied assumptions, rather than on inductive reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02519v1,2024-09
Word and Phrase Features in Graph Convolutional Network for Automatic Question Classification,"Junyoung Lee, Ninad Dixit, Kaustav Chakrabarti, S. Supraja","Effective question classification is crucial for AI-driven educational tools, enabling adaptive learning systems to categorize questions by skill area, difficulty level, and competence. This classification not only supports educational diagnostics and analytics but also enhances complex tasks like information retrieval and question answering by associating questions with relevant categories. Traditional methods, often based on word embeddings and conventional classifiers, struggle to capture the nuanced relationships in natural language, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel approach leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs), named Phrase Question-Graph Convolutional Network (PQ-GCN) to better model the inherent structure of questions. By representing questions as graphs -- where nodes signify words or phrases and edges denote syntactic or semantic relationships -- our method allows GCNs to learn from the interconnected nature of language more effectively. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of phrase-based features to enhance classification accuracy, especially in low-resource settings. Our findings demonstrate that GCNs, augmented with these features, offer a promising solution for more accurate and context-aware question classification, bridging the gap between graph neural network research and practical educational applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02481v1,2024-09
A Comparative Study on Large Language Models for Log Parsing,"Merve Astekin, Max Hort, Leon Moonen","Background: Log messages provide valuable information about the status of software systems. This information is provided in an unstructured fashion and automated approaches are applied to extract relevant parameters. To ease this process, log parsing can be applied, which transforms log messages into structured log templates. Recent advances in language models have led to several studies that apply ChatGPT to the task of log parsing with promising results. However, the performance of other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the log parsing task remains unclear.   Aims: In this study, we investigate the current capability of state-of-the-art LLMs to perform log parsing.   Method: We select six recent LLMs, including both paid proprietary (GPT-3.5, Claude 2.1) and four free-to-use open models, and compare their performance on system logs obtained from a selection of mature open-source projects. We design two different prompting approaches and apply the LLMs on 1, 354 log templates across 16 different projects. We evaluate their effectiveness, in the number of correctly identified templates, and the syntactic similarity between the generated templates and the ground truth.   Results: We found that free-to-use models are able to compete with paid models, with CodeLlama extracting 10% more log templates correctly than GPT-3.5. Moreover, we provide qualitative insights into the usability of language models (e.g., how easy it is to use their responses).   Conclusions: Our results reveal that some of the smaller, free-to-use LLMs can considerably assist log parsing compared to their paid proprietary competitors, especially code-specialized models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02474v1,2024-09
DetectiveQA: Evaluating Long-Context Reasoning on Detective Novels,"Zhe Xu, Jiasheng Ye, Xiangyang Liu, Tianxiang Sun, Xiaoran Liu, Qipeng Guo, Linlin Li, Qun Liu, Xuanjing Huang, Xipeng Qiu","With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), long-context information understanding and processing have become a hot topic in academia and industry. However, benchmarks for evaluating the ability of LLMs to handle long-context information do not seem to have kept pace with the development of LLMs. Despite the emergence of various long-context evaluation benchmarks, the types of capability assessed are still limited, without new capability dimensions. In this paper, we introduce DetectiveQA, a narrative reasoning benchmark featured with an average context length of over 100K tokens. DetectiveQA focuses on evaluating the long-context reasoning ability of LLMs, which not only requires a full understanding of context but also requires extracting important evidences from the context and reasoning according to extracted evidences to answer the given questions. This is a new dimension of capability evaluation, which is more in line with the current intelligence level of LLMs. We use detective novels as data sources, which naturally have various reasoning elements. Finally, we manually annotated 600 questions in Chinese and then also provided an English edition of the context information and questions. We evaluate many long-context LLMs on DetectiveQA, including commercial and open-sourced models, and the results indicate that existing long-context LLMs still require significant advancements to effectively process true long-context dependency questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02465v1,2024-09
ISO: Overlap of Computation and Communication within Seqenence For LLM Inference,"Bin Xiao, Lei Su","In the realm of Large Language Model (LLM) inference, the inherent structure of transformer models coupled with the multi-GPU tensor parallelism strategy leads to a sequential execution of computation and communication. This results in substantial underutilization of computing resources during the communication phase. To mitigate this inefficiency, various techniques have been developed to optimize the use of computational power throughout the communication process. These strategies primarily involve overlapping matrix computations and communications, as well as interleaving micro-batches across different requests. Nonetheless, these approaches either fall short of achieving ideal overlap or impose certain limitations on their application. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel strategy for computation-communication overlap that operates at the sequence level. This method not only enhances the degree of overlap but also minimizes the constraints on its applicability. Experimental evaluations conducted using 30b/70b models have demonstrated significant improvements in efficiency. Specifically, the proposed technique has been shown to reduce time consumption by approximately 35% on 4090 GPU and by roughly 15% on A800 GPU during the prefill stage of LLM inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11155v1,2024-09
What is lost in Normalization? Exploring Pitfalls in Multilingual ASR Model Evaluations,"Kavya Manohar, Leena G Pillai, Elizabeth Sherly","This paper explores the pitfalls in evaluating multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, with a particular focus on Indic language scripts. We investigate the text normalization routine employed by leading ASR models, including OpenAI Whisper, Meta's MMS, Seamless, and Assembly AI's Conformer, and their unintended consequences on performance metrics. Our research reveals that current text normalization practices, while aiming to standardize ASR outputs for fair comparison, by removing inconsistencies such as variations in spelling, punctuation, and special characters, are fundamentally flawed when applied to Indic scripts. Through empirical analysis using text similarity scores and in-depth linguistic examination, we demonstrate that these flaws lead to artificially improved performance metrics for Indic languages. We conclude by proposing a shift towards developing text normalization routines that leverage native linguistic expertise, ensuring more robust and accurate evaluations of multilingual ASR models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02449v4,2024-09
Large Language Models as Efficient Reward Function Searchers for Custom-Environment Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning,"Guanwen Xie, Jingzehua Xu, Yiyuan Yang, Yimian Ding, Shuai Zhang","Achieving the effective design and improvement of reward functions in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks with complex custom environments and multiple requirements presents considerable challenges. In this paper, we propose ERFSL, an efficient reward function searcher using LLMs, which enables LLMs to be effective white-box searchers and highlights their advanced semantic understanding capabilities. Specifically, we generate reward components for each numerically explicit user requirement and employ a reward critic to identify the correct code form. Then, LLMs assign weights to the reward components to balance their values and iteratively adjust the weights without ambiguity and redundant adjustments by flexibly adopting directional mutation and crossover strategies, similar to genetic algorithms, based on the context provided by the training log analyzer. We applied the framework to an underwater data collection RL task without direct human feedback or reward examples (zero-shot learning). The reward critic successfully corrects the reward code with only one feedback instance for each requirement, effectively preventing unrectifiable errors. The initialization of weights enables the acquisition of different reward functions within the Pareto solution set without the need for weight search. Even in cases where a weight is 500 times off, on average, only 5.2 iterations are needed to meet user requirements. The ERFSL also works well with most prompts utilizing GPT-4o mini, as we decompose the weight searching process to reduce the requirement for numerical and long-context understanding capabilities",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02428v3,2024-09
Prompt Baking,"Aman Bhargava, Cameron Witkowski, Alexander Detkov, Matt Thomson","Two primary ways to change LLM behavior are prompting and weight updates (e.g., fine-tuning). Prompting LLMs is simple and effective, specifying the desired changes explicitly in natural language, whereas weight updates provide more expressive and permanent behavior changes, specified implicitly via training on large datasets. We present a technique for ""baking"" prompts into the weights of an LLM. Prompt Baking converts a prompt $u$ and initial weights $\theta$ to a new set of weights $\theta_u$ such that new ""baked"" LLM behaves like the original prompted LLM. Mathematically, we minimize the KL divergence between $P_\theta(\cdot | u)$ and $P_{\theta_u}(\cdot)$, where $P$ is the LLM's probability distribution over token sequences. Across all our experiments, we find prompts can be readily baked into weight updates. Baking chain-of-thought prompts improves zero-shot performance on GSM8K, ASDiv, MBPP, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and CommonsenseQA benchmarks. Baking news headlines directly updates an LLM's knowledge. And baking instructions & personas alleviates ""prompt forgetting"" over long sequences. Furthermore, stopping baking early creates ""half-baked"" models, continuously scaling prompt strength. Baked models retain their sensitivity to further prompting and baking, including re-prompting with the baked-in prompt. Surprisingly, the re-prompted models yield further performance gains in instruction following, as well as math reasoning and coding benchmarks. Taking re-prompting and re-baking to the limit yields a form of iterative self-improvement we call Prompt Pursuit, and preliminary results on instruction following exhibit dramatic performance gains. Finally, we discuss implications for AI safety, continuous model updating, enhancing real-time learning capabilities in LLM-based agents, and generating more stable AI personas.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13697v1,2024-09

WaveletGPT: Wavelets Meet Large Language Models,Prateek Verma,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new wave of artificial intelligence advancements impacting every scientific field and discipline. They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12924v3,2024-09

STAB: Speech Tokenizer Assessment Benchmark,"Shikhar Vashishth, Harman Singh, Shikhar Bharadwaj, Sriram Ganapathy, Chulayuth Asawaroengchai, Kartik Audhkhasi, Andrew Rosenberg, Ankur Bapna, Bhuvana Ramabhadran","Representing speech as discrete tokens provides a framework for transforming speech into a format that closely resembles text, thus enabling the use of speech as an input to the widely successful large language models (LLMs). Currently, while several speech tokenizers have been proposed, there is ambiguity regarding the properties that are desired from a tokenizer for specific downstream tasks and its overall generalizability. Evaluating the performance of tokenizers across different downstream tasks is a computationally intensive effort that poses challenges for scalability. To circumvent this requirement, we present STAB (Speech Tokenizer Assessment Benchmark), a systematic evaluation framework designed to assess speech tokenizers comprehensively and shed light on their inherent characteristics. This framework provides a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of speech tokenization, thereby offering a valuable resource for expediting the advancement of future tokenizer models and enabling comparative analysis using a standardized benchmark.

How Privacy-Savvy Are Large Language Models? A Case Study on Compliance and Privacy Technical Review,"Xichou Zhu, Yang Liu, Zhou Shen, Yi Liu, Min Li, Yujun Chen, Benzi John, Zhenzhen Ma, Tao Hu, Zhi Li, Bolong Yang, Manman Wang, Zongxing Xie, Peng Liu, Dan Cai, Junhui Wang","The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly expanded their applications across various fields such as language generation, summarization, and complex question answering. However, their application to privacy compliance and technical privacy reviews remains under-explored, raising critical concerns about their ability to adhere to global privacy standards and protect sensitive user data. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a comprehensive case study evaluating LLMs' performance in privacy-related tasks such as privacy information extraction (PIE), legal and regulatory key point detection (KPD), and question answering (QA) with respect to privacy policies and data protection regulations. We introduce a Privacy Technical Review (PTR) framework, highlighting its role in mitigating privacy risks during the software development life-cycle. Through an empirical assessment, we investigate the capacity of several prominent LLMs, including BERT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and custom models, in executing privacy compliance checks and technical privacy reviews. Our experiments benchmark the models across multiple dimensions, focusing on their precision, recall, and F1-scores in extracting privacy-sensitive information and detecting key regulatory compliance points. While LLMs show promise in automating privacy reviews and identifying regulatory discrepancies, significant gaps persist in their ability to fully comply with evolving legal standards. We provide actionable recommendations for enhancing LLMs' capabilities in privacy compliance, emphasizing the need for robust model improvements and better integration with legal and regulatory requirements. This study underscores the growing importance of developing privacy-aware LLMs that can both support businesses in compliance efforts and safeguard user privacy rights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02375v3,2024-09
Do Large Language Models Possess Sensitive to Sentiment?,"Yang Liu, Xichou Zhu, Zhou Shen, Yi Liu, Min Li, Yujun Chen, Benzi John, Zhenzhen Ma, Tao Hu, Zhi Li, Zhiyang Xu, Wei Luo, Junhui Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently displayed their extraordinary capabilities in language understanding. However, how to comprehensively assess the sentiment capabilities of LLMs continues to be a challenge. This paper investigates the ability of LLMs to detect and react to sentiment in text modal. As the integration of LLMs into diverse applications is on the rise, it becomes highly critical to comprehend their sensitivity to emotional tone, as it can influence the user experience and the efficacy of sentiment-driven tasks. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of several prominent LLMs in identifying and responding appropriately to sentiments like positive, negative, and neutral emotions. The models' outputs are analyzed across various sentiment benchmarks, and their responses are compared with human evaluations. Our discoveries indicate that although LLMs show a basic sensitivity to sentiment, there are substantial variations in their accuracy and consistency, emphasizing the requirement for further enhancements in their training processes to better capture subtle emotional cues. Take an example in our findings, in some cases, the models might wrongly classify a strongly positive sentiment as neutral, or fail to recognize sarcasm or irony in the text. Such misclassifications highlight the complexity of sentiment analysis and the areas where the models need to be refined. Another aspect is that different LLMs might perform differently on the same set of data, depending on their architecture and training datasets. This variance calls for a more in-depth study of the factors that contribute to the performance differences and how they can be optimized.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02370v3,2024-09
Diversify-verify-adapt: Efficient and Robust Retrieval-Augmented Ambiguous Question Answering,"Yeonjun In, Sungchul Kim, Ryan A. Rossi, Md Mehrab Tanjim, Tong Yu, Ritwik Sinha, Chanyoung Park","The retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework addresses an ambiguity in user queries in QA systems by retrieving passages that cover all plausible interpretations and generating comprehensive responses based on the passages. However, our preliminary studies reveal that a single retrieval process often suffers from low quality results, as the retrieved passages frequently fail to capture all plausible interpretations. Although the iterative RAG approach has been proposed to address this problem, it comes at the cost of significantly reduced efficiency. To address these issues, we propose the diversify-verify-adapt (DIVA) framework. DIVA first diversifies the retrieved passages to encompass diverse interpretations. Subsequently, DIVA verifies the quality of the passages and adapts the most suitable approach tailored to their quality. This approach improves the QA systems accuracy and robustness by handling low quality retrieval issue in ambiguous questions, while enhancing efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02361v1,2024-09
NUDGE: Lightweight Non-Parametric Fine-Tuning of Embeddings for Retrieval,"Sepanta Zeighami, Zac Wellmer, Aditya Parameswaran","$k$-Nearest Neighbor search on dense vector embeddings ($k$-NN retrieval) from pre-trained embedding models is the predominant retrieval method for text and images, as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. In practice, application developers often fine-tune the embeddings to improve their accuracy on the dataset and query workload in hand. Existing approaches either fine-tune the pre-trained model itself or, more efficiently, but at the cost of accuracy, train adaptor models to transform the output of the pre-trained model. We present NUDGE, a family of novel non-parametric embedding fine-tuning approaches that are significantly more accurate and efficient than both sets of existing approaches. NUDGE directly modifies the embeddings of data records to maximize the accuracy of $k$-NN retrieval. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental study of NUDGE's non-parametric approach. We show that even though the underlying problem is NP-Hard, constrained variations can be solved efficiently. These constraints additionally ensure that the changes to the embeddings are modest, avoiding large distortions to the semantics learned during pre-training. In experiments across five pre-trained models and nine standard text and image retrieval datasets, NUDGE runs in minutes and often improves NDCG@10 by more than 10% over existing fine-tuning methods. On average, NUDGE provides 3.3x and 4.3x higher increase in accuracy and runs 200x and 3x faster, respectively, over fine-tuning the pre-trained model and training adaptors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02343v1,2024-09
Arctic-SnowCoder: Demystifying High-Quality Data in Code Pretraining,"Yuxiang Wei, Hojae Han, Rajhans Samdani","Recent studies have been increasingly demonstrating that high-quality data is crucial for effective pretraining of language models. However, the precise definition of ""high-quality"" remains underexplored. Focusing on the code domain, we introduce Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B, a data-efficient base code model pretrained on 555B tokens through three phases of progressively refined data: (1) general pretraining with 500B standard-quality code tokens, preprocessed through basic filtering, deduplication, and decontamination, (2) continued pretraining with 50B high-quality tokens, selected from phase one by a BERT-style quality annotator trained to distinguish good code from random data, using positive examples drawn from high-quality code files, along with instruction data from Magicoder and StarCoder2-Instruct, and (3) enhanced pretraining with 5B synthetic data created by Llama-3.1-70B using phase two data as seeds, adapting the Magicoder approach for pretraining. Despite being trained on a limited dataset, Arctic-SnowCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on BigCodeBench, a coding benchmark focusing on practical and challenging programming tasks, compared to similarly sized models trained on no more than 1T tokens, outperforming Phi-1.5-1.3B by 36%. Across all evaluated benchmarks, Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B beats StarCoderBase-3B pretrained on 1T tokens. Additionally, it matches the performance of leading small base code models trained on trillions of tokens. For example, Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B surpasses StarCoder2-3B, pretrained on over 3.3T tokens, on HumanEval+, a benchmark that evaluates function-level code generation, and remains competitive on BigCodeBench. Our evaluation presents a comprehensive analysis justifying various design choices for Arctic-SnowCoder. Most importantly, we find that the key to high-quality data is its alignment with the distribution of downstream applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02326v1,2024-09
Optimal L-Systems for Stochastic L-system Inference Problems,"Ali Lotfi, Ian McQuillan","This paper presents two novel theorems that address two open problems in stochastic Lindenmayer-system (L-system) inference, specifically focusing on the construction of an optimal stochastic L-system capable of generating a given sequence of strings. The first theorem delineates a method for crafting a stochastic L-system that has the maximum probability of a derivation producing a given sequence of words through a single derivation (noting that multiple derivations may generate the same sequence). Furthermore, the second theorem determines the stochastic L-systems with the highest probability of producing a given sequence of words with multiple possible derivations. From these, we introduce an algorithm to infer an optimal stochastic L-system from a given sequence. This algorithm incorporates advanced optimization techniques, such as interior point methods, to ensure the creation of a stochastic L-system that maximizes the probability of generating the given sequence (allowing for multiple derivations). This allows for the use of stochastic L-systems as a model for machine learning using only positive data for training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02259v2,2024-09
MMLU-Pro+: Evaluating Higher-Order Reasoning and Shortcut Learning in LLMs,"Saeid Asgari Taghanaki, Aliasgahr Khani, Amir Khasahmadi","Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) increasingly struggle to differentiate between top-performing models, underscoring the need for more challenging evaluation frameworks. We introduce MMLU-Pro+, an enhanced benchmark building upon MMLU-Pro to assess shortcut learning and higher-order reasoning in LLMs. By incorporating questions with multiple correct answers across diverse domains, MMLU-Pro+ tests LLMs' ability to engage in complex reasoning and resist simplistic problem-solving strategies. Our results show that MMLU-Pro+ maintains MMLU-Pro's difficulty while providing a more rigorous test of model discrimination, particularly in multi-correct answer scenarios. We introduce novel metrics like shortcut selection ratio and correct pair identification ratio, offering deeper insights into model behavior and anchoring bias. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art LLMs reveal significant performance gaps, highlighting variations in reasoning abilities and bias susceptibility. We release the dataset and evaluation codes at \url{https://github.com/asgsaeid/mmlu-pro-plus}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02257v3,2024-09
Therapy as an NLP Task: Psychologists' Comparison of LLMs and Human Peers in CBT,"Zainab Iftikhar, Sean Ransom, Amy Xiao, Jeff Huang","Wider access to therapeutic care is one of the biggest challenges in mental health treatment. Due to institutional barriers, some people seeking mental health support have turned to large language models (LLMs) for personalized therapy, even though these models are largely unsanctioned and untested. We investigate the potential and limitations of using LLMs as providers of evidence-based therapy by using mixed methods clinical metrics. Using HELPERT, a prompt run on a large language model using the same process and training as a comparative group of peer counselors, we replicated publicly accessible mental health conversations rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to compare session dynamics and counselor's CBT-based behaviors between original peer support sessions and their reconstructed HELPERT sessions. Two licensed, CBT-trained clinical psychologists evaluated the sessions using the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale and provided qualitative feedback. Our findings show that the peer sessions are characterized by empathy, small talk, therapeutic alliance, and shared experiences but often exhibit therapist drift. Conversely, HELPERT reconstructed sessions exhibit minimal therapist drift and higher adherence to CBT methods but display a lack of collaboration, empathy, and cultural understanding. Through CTRS ratings and psychologists' feedback, we highlight the importance of human-AI collaboration for scalable mental health. Our work outlines the ethical implication of imparting human-like subjective qualities to LLMs in therapeutic settings, particularly the risk of deceptive empathy, which may lead to unrealistic patient expectations and potential harm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02244v1,2024-09
Temporal Order Preserved Optimal Transport-based Cross-modal Knowledge Transfer Learning for ASR,"Xugang Lu, Peng Shen, Yu Tsao, Hisashi Kawai","Transferring linguistic knowledge from a pretrained language model (PLM) to an acoustic model has been shown to greatly improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, due to the heterogeneous feature distributions in cross-modalities, designing an effective model for feature alignment and knowledge transfer between linguistic and acoustic sequences remains a challenging task. Optimal transport (OT), which efficiently measures probability distribution discrepancies, holds great potential for aligning and transferring knowledge between acoustic and linguistic modalities. Nonetheless, the original OT treats acoustic and linguistic feature sequences as two unordered sets in alignment and neglects temporal order information during OT coupling estimation. Consequently, a time-consuming pretraining stage is required to learn a good alignment between the acoustic and linguistic representations. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Order Preserved OT (TOT)-based Cross-modal Alignment and Knowledge Transfer (CAKT) (TOT-CAKT) for ASR. In the TOT-CAKT, local neighboring frames of acoustic sequences are smoothly mapped to neighboring regions of linguistic sequences, preserving their temporal order relationship in feature alignment and matching. With the TOT-CAKT model framework, we conduct Mandarin ASR experiments with a pretrained Chinese PLM for linguistic knowledge transfer. Our results demonstrate that the proposed TOT-CAKT significantly improves ASR performance compared to several state-of-the-art models employing linguistic knowledge transfer, and addresses the weaknesses of the original OT-based method in sequential feature alignment for ASR.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02239v2,2024-09
Unforgettable Generalization in Language Models,"Eric Zhang, Leshem Chosen, Jacob Andreas","When language models (LMs) are trained to forget (or ""unlearn'') a skill, how precisely does their behavior change? We study the behavior of transformer LMs in which tasks have been forgotten via fine-tuning on randomized labels. Such LMs learn to generate near-random predictions for individual examples in the ""training'' set used for forgetting. Across tasks, however, LMs exhibit extreme variability in whether LM predictions change on examples outside the training set. In some tasks (like entailment classification), forgetting generalizes robustly, and causes models to produce uninformative predictions on new task instances; in other tasks (like physical commonsense reasoning and scientific question answering) forgetting affects only the training examples, and models continue to perform the ""forgotten'' task accurately even for examples very similar to those that appeared in the training set. Dataset difficulty is not predictive of whether a behavior can be forgotten; instead, generalization in forgetting is (weakly) predicted by the confidence of LMs' initial task predictions and the variability of LM representations of training data, with low confidence and low variability both associated with greater generalization. Perhaps most surprisingly, random-label forgetting appears to be somewhat insensitive to the contents of the training set: for example, models trained on science questions with random labels continue to answer other science questions accurately, but begin to produce random labels on entailment classification tasks. Finally, we show that even generalizable forgetting is shallow: linear probes trained on LMs' representations can still perform tasks reliably after forgetting. Our results highlight the difficulty and unpredictability of performing targeted skill removal from models via fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02228v1,2024-09
Visually Grounded Speech Models for Low-resource Languages and Cognitive Modelling,Leanne Nortje,"This dissertation examines visually grounded speech (VGS) models that learn from unlabelled speech paired with images. It focuses on applications for low-resource languages and understanding human language acquisition. We introduce a task called visually prompted keyword localisation to detect and localise keywords in speech using images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VGS models in few-shot learning scenarios for low-resource languages like Yoruba. Additionally, we examine the mutual exclusivity bias in VGS models. Our monolingual VGS model exhibits this bias, but we found that multilingualism does not affect the bias in this VGS model similarly to what is observed in children.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02865v1,2024-09
CRAFT Your Dataset: Task-Specific Synthetic Dataset Generation Through Corpus Retrieval and Augmentation,"Ingo Ziegler, Abdullatif Köksal, Desmond Elliott, Hinrich Schütze","Building high-quality datasets for specialized tasks is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process that often requires specialized domain knowledge. We propose Corpus Retrieval and Augmentation for Fine-Tuning (CRAFT), a method for generating synthetic datasets, given a small number of user-written few-shots that demonstrate the task to be performed. Given the few-shot examples, we use large-scale public web-crawled corpora and similarity-based document retrieval to find other relevant human-written documents. Lastly, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) augment the retrieved documents into custom-formatted task samples, which then can be used for fine-tuning. We demonstrate that CRAFT can efficiently generate large-scale task-specific training datasets for four diverse tasks: biology question-answering (QA), medicine QA and commonsense QA as well as summarization. Our experiments show that CRAFT-based models outperform or achieve comparable performance to general LLMs for QA tasks, while CRAFT-based summarization models outperform models trained on human-curated data by 46 preference points.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02098v1,2024-09
Political DEBATE: Efficient Zero-shot and Few-shot Classifiers for Political Text,"Michael Burnham, Kayla Kahn, Ryan Yank Wang, Rachel X. Peng","Social scientists quickly adopted large language models due to their ability to annotate documents without supervised training, an ability known as zero-shot learning. However, due to their compute demands, cost, and often proprietary nature, these models are often at odds with replication and open science standards. This paper introduces the Political DEBATE (DeBERTa Algorithm for Textual Entailment) language models for zero-shot and few-shot classification of political documents. These models are not only as good, or better than, state-of-the art large language models at zero and few-shot classification, but are orders of magnitude more efficient and completely open source. By training the models on a simple random sample of 10-25 documents, they can outperform supervised classifiers trained on hundreds or thousands of documents and state-of-the-art generative models with complex, engineered prompts. Additionally, we release the PolNLI dataset used to train these models -- a corpus of over 200,000 political documents with highly accurate labels across over 800 classification tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02078v1,2024-09
LongGenBench: Benchmarking Long-Form Generation in Long Context LLMs,"Yuhao Wu, Ming Shan Hee, Zhiqing Hu, Roy Ka-Wei Lee","In evaluating the long-context capabilities of large language models (LLMs), benchmarks such as ""Needle-in-a-Haystack"" (NIAH), Ruler, and Needlebench are commonly used. While these benchmarks measure how well models understand long-context input sequences, they do not effectively gauge the quality of long-form text generation--a critical aspect for applications such as design proposals and creative writing. To address this gap, we have introduced a new long-form text evaluation benchmark, LongGenBench, which tests models' ability to identify specific events within generated long text sequences. In this benchmark, we prompt long-context LMs to create long-form text that must include particular events or constraints and evaluate their ability to incorporate these elements. We evaluated ten long-context LMs across four distinct scenarios, three types of prompt instructions, and two different generation-length settings (16K and 32K). Although these models perform well on NIAH benchmarks, none demonstrated satisfactory performance on the LongGenBench, raising concerns about their ability to generate coherent long-form text that follows instructions. Additionally, as the length of the generated text increases, all models exhibit a significant drop in performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02076v6,2024-09

Enhancing Code-Switching Speech Recognition with LID-Based Collaborative Mixture of Experts Model,"Hukai Huang, Jiayan Lin, Kaidi Wang, Yishuang Li, Wenhao Guan, Lin Li, Qingyang Hong","Due to the inherent difficulty in modeling phonetic similarities across different languages, code-switching speech recognition presents a formidable challenge. This study proposes a Collaborative-MoE, a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that leverages a collaborative mechanism among expert groups. Initially, a preceding routing network explicitly learns Language Identification (LID) tasks and selects experts based on acquired LID weights. This process ensures robust routing information to the MoE layer, mitigating interference from diverse language domains on expert network parameter updates. The LID weights are also employed to facilitate inter-group collaboration, enabling the integration of language-specific representations. Furthermore, within each language expert group, a gating network operates unsupervised to foster collaboration on attributes beyond language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significant performance enhancements compared to alternative methods. Importantly, our method preserves the efficient inference capabilities characteristic of MoE models without necessitating additional pre-training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02050v2,2024-09
BEAVER: An Enterprise Benchmark for Text-to-SQL,"Peter Baile Chen, Fabian Wenz, Yi Zhang, Moe Kayali, Nesime Tatbul, Michael Cafarella, Çağatay Demiralp, Michael Stonebraker","Existing text-to-SQL benchmarks have largely been constructed using publicly available tables from the web with human-generated tests containing question and SQL statement pairs. They typically show very good results and lead people to think that LLMs are effective at text-to-SQL tasks. In this paper, we apply off-the-shelf LLMs to a benchmark containing enterprise data warehouse data. In this environment, LLMs perform poorly, even when standard prompt engineering and RAG techniques are utilized. As we will show, the reasons for poor performance are largely due to three characteristics: (1) public LLMs cannot train on enterprise data warehouses because they are largely in the ""dark web"", (2) schemas of enterprise tables are more complex than the schemas in public data, which leads the SQL-generation task innately harder, and (3) business-oriented questions are often more complex, requiring joins over multiple tables and aggregations. As a result, we propose a new dataset BEAVER, sourced from real enterprise data warehouses together with natural language queries and their correct SQL statements which we collected from actual user history. We evaluated this dataset using recent LLMs and demonstrated their poor performance on this task. We hope this dataset will facilitate future researchers building more sophisticated text-to-SQL systems which can do better on this important class of data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02038v1,2024-09

You Only Use Reactive Attention Slice For Long Context Retrieval,"Yun Joon Soh, Hanxian Huang, Yuandong Tian, Jishen Zhao","Supporting longer context for Large Language Models (LLM) is a promising direction to advance LLMs. As training a model for a longer context window is computationally expensive, many alternative solutions, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), have been used. However, most existing RAG methods adopt embedding-based retrieval that falls short on long contexts.   To address such challenges, we propose an attention-based retrieval technique, You Only Use Reactive Attention slice (YOURA). YOURA leverages a novel retrieval heuristic called reaction score to rank the relevance of each sentence in the input context with the query sentence. Intuitively, we measure how the per-token attention score ""reacts"" to the query and greedily retrieves the most reactive sentences. Internally, YOURA generates a token-indexed vector (called reaction vector) for the whole input context. To map each sentence to the token-indexed vector, we propose an Embedding-Agnostic Sentence Yield (EASY), a best-effort token wiggling algorithm.   We evaluate our retrieval technique on three open-source pre-trained LLM models across six LongBench QA datasets. Our technique achieves up to 30% vLLM inference throughput improvement for serving long-context queries with a nearly identical quality score to the simple yet effective truncate-middle approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13695v1,2024-09
AIvril: AI-Driven RTL Generation With Verification In-The-Loop,"Mubashir ul Islam, Humza Sami, Pierre-Emmanuel Gaillardon, Valerio Tenace","Large Language Models (LLMs) are computational models capable of performing complex natural language processing tasks. Leveraging these capabilities, LLMs hold the potential to transform the entire hardware design stack, with predictions suggesting that front-end and back-end tasks could be fully automated in the near future. Currently, LLMs show great promise in streamlining Register Transfer Level (RTL) generation, enhancing efficiency, and accelerating innovation. However, their probabilistic nature makes them prone to inaccuracies - a significant drawback in RTL design, where reliability and precision are essential.   To address these challenges, this paper introduces AIvril, an advanced framework designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of RTL-aware LLMs. AIvril employs a multi-agent, LLM-agnostic system for automatic syntax correction and functional verification, significantly reducing - and in many cases, completely eliminating - instances of erroneous code generation. Experimental results conducted on the VerilogEval-Human dataset show that our framework improves code quality by nearly 2x when compared to previous works, while achieving an 88.46% success rate in meeting verification objectives.

Fuzzing involves presenting a target program with crafted malicious input to cause crashes, buffer overflows, memory errors, and exceptions. Crafting malicious inputs in an efficient manner is a difficult open problem and the best approaches often apply uniform random mutations to pre-existing valid inputs. In this work, we propose to adopt fine-tuned large language models (FuzzCoder) to learn patterns in the input files from successful attacks to guide future fuzzing explorations. Specifically, we develop a framework to leverage the code LLMs to guide the mutation process of inputs in fuzzing. The mutation process is formulated as the sequence-to-sequence modeling, where LLM receives a sequence of bytes and then outputs the mutated byte sequence. FuzzCoder is fine-tuned on the created instruction dataset (Fuzz-Instruct), where the successful fuzzing history is collected from the heuristic fuzzing tool. FuzzCoder can predict mutation locations and strategies locations in input files to trigger abnormal behaviors of the program.

This includes the time for presenting a sign example, performing and recording the sign, and archiving the capture. The 3D-LEX dataset includes 1,000 signs from American Sign Language and an additional 1,000 signs from the Sign Language of the Netherlands. We showcase the dataset utility by presenting a simple method for generating handshape annotations directly from 3D-LEX. We produce handshape labels for 1,000 signs from American Sign Language and evaluate the labels in a sign recognition task. The labels enhance gloss recognition accuracy by 5% over using no handshape annotations, and by 1% over expert annotations. Our motion capture data supports in-depth analysis of sign features and facilitates the generation of 2D projections from any viewpoint.

What are the Essential Factors in Crafting Effective Long Context Multi-Hop Instruction Datasets?

In order to achieve success in long context tasks, a large amount of work has been done to enhance the long context capabilities of the model through synthetic data. Existing methods typically utilize the Self-Instruct framework to generate instruction tuning data for better long context capability improvement. However, our preliminary experiments indicate that less than 35% of generated samples are multi-hop, and more than 40% exhibit poor quality, limiting comprehensive understanding and further research.

The LLM's ability to generate novel intertextual observations and connections highlights its potential to uncover new insights. However, the model also struggles with long query passages and the inclusion of false intertextual dependences, emphasizing the importance of expert evaluation. The expert-in-the-loop methodology presented offers a scalable approach for intertextual research into the complex web of intertextuality within and beyond the biblical corpus.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01882v2,2024-09
The Role of Large Language Models in Musicology: Are We Ready to Trust the Machines?,"Pedro Ramoneda, Emilia Parada-Cabaleiro, Benno Weck, Xavier Serra","In this work, we explore the use and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in musicology. From a discussion with experts and students, we assess the current acceptance and concerns regarding this, nowadays ubiquitous, technology. We aim to go one step further, proposing a semi-automatic method to create an initial benchmark using retrieval-augmented generation models and multiple-choice question generation, validated by human experts. Our evaluation on 400 human-validated questions shows that current vanilla LLMs are less reliable than retrieval augmented generation from music dictionaries. This paper suggests that the potential of LLMs in musicology requires musicology driven research that can specialized LLMs by including accurate and reliable domain knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01864v1,2024-09
AgentRE: An Agent-Based Framework for Navigating Complex Information Landscapes in Relation Extraction,"Yuchen Shi, Guochao Jiang, Tian Qiu, Deqing Yang","The relation extraction (RE) in complex scenarios faces challenges such as diverse relation types and ambiguous relations between entities within a single sentence, leading to the poor performance of pure ""text-in, text-out"" language models (LMs). To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an agent-based RE framework, namely AgentRE, which fully leverages the potential of large language models (LLMs) including memory, retrieval and reflection, to achieve RE in complex scenarios. Specifically, three major modules are built in AgentRE serving as the tools to help the agent acquire and process various useful information, thereby obtaining improved RE performance. Our extensive experimental results upon two datasets in English and Chinese demonstrate our AgentRE's superior performance, especially in low-resource scenarios. Additionally, the trajectories generated by AgentRE can be refined to construct a high-quality training dataset incorporating different reasoning methods, which can be used to fine-tune smaller models.

Towards Generative Class Prompt Learning for Fine-grained Visual Recognition,"Soumitri Chattopadhyay, Sanket Biswas, Emanuele Vivoli, Josep Lladós","Although foundational vision-language models (VLMs) have proven to be very successful for various semantic discrimination tasks, they still struggle to perform faithfully for fine-grained categorization. Moreover, foundational models trained on one domain do not generalize well on a different domain without fine-tuning. We attribute these to the limitations of the VLM's semantic representations and attempt to improve their fine-grained visual awareness using generative modeling. Specifically, we propose two novel methods: Generative Class Prompt Learning (GCPL) and Contrastive Multi-class Prompt Learning (CoMPLe). Utilizing text-to-image diffusion models, GCPL significantly improves the visio-linguistic synergy in class embeddings by conditioning on few-shot exemplars with learnable class prompts. CoMPLe builds on this foundation by introducing a contrastive learning component that encourages inter-class separation during the generative optimization process. Our empirical results demonstrate that such a generative class prompt learning approach substantially outperform existing methods, offering a better alternative to few shot image recognition challenges. The source code will be made available at: https://github.com/soumitri2001/GCPL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01835v2,2024-09
Dialogue You Can Trust: Human and AI Perspectives on Generated Conversations,"Ike Ebubechukwu, Johane Takeuchi, Antonello Ceravola, Frank Joublin","As dialogue systems and chatbots increasingly integrate into everyday interactions, the need for efficient and accurate evaluation methods becomes paramount. This study explores the comparative performance of human and AI assessments across a range of dialogue scenarios, focusing on seven key performance indicators (KPIs): Coherence, Innovation, Concreteness, Goal Contribution, Commonsense Contradiction, Incorrect Fact, and Redundancy. Utilizing the GPT-4o API, we generated a diverse dataset of conversations and conducted a two-part experimental analysis. In Experiment 1, we evaluated multi-party conversations on Coherence, Innovation, Concreteness, and Goal Contribution, revealing that GPT models align closely with human judgments. Notably, both human and AI evaluators exhibited a tendency towards binary judgment rather than linear scaling, highlighting a shared challenge in these assessments. Experiment 2 extended the work of Finch et al. (2023) by focusing on dyadic dialogues and assessing Commonsense Contradiction, Incorrect Fact, and Redundancy. The results indicate that while GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance in maintaining factual accuracy and commonsense reasoning, it still struggles with reducing redundancy and self-contradiction. Our findings underscore the potential of GPT models to closely replicate human evaluation in dialogue systems, while also pointing to areas for improvement. This research offers valuable insights for advancing the development and implementation of more refined dialogue evaluation methodologies, contributing to the evolution of more effective and human-like AI communication tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01808v2,2024-09
LASP: Surveying the State-of-the-Art in Large Language Model-Assisted AI Planning,"Haoming Li, Zhaoliang Chen, Jonathan Zhang, Fei Liu","Effective planning is essential for the success of any task, from organizing a vacation to routing autonomous vehicles and developing corporate strategies. It involves setting goals, formulating plans, and allocating resources to achieve them. LLMs are particularly well-suited for automated planning due to their strong capabilities in commonsense reasoning. They can deduce a sequence of actions needed to achieve a goal from a given state and identify an effective course of action. However, it is frequently observed that plans generated through direct prompting often fail upon execution. Our survey aims to highlight the existing challenges in planning with language models, focusing on key areas such as embodied environments, optimal scheduling, competitive and cooperative games, task decomposition, reasoning, and planning. Through this study, we explore how LLMs transform AI planning and provide unique insights into the future of LM-assisted planning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01806v1,2024-09
Training on the Benchmark Is Not All You Need,"Shiwen Ni, Xiangtao Kong, Chengming Li, Xiping Hu, Ruifeng Xu, Jia Zhu, Min Yang","The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) relies heavily on the huge amount of pre-training data learned in the pre-training phase. The opacity of the pre-training process and the training data causes the results of many benchmark tests to become unreliable. If any model has been trained on a benchmark test set, it can seriously hinder the health of the field. In order to automate and efficiently test the capabilities of large language models, numerous mainstream benchmarks adopt a multiple-choice format. As the swapping of the contents of multiple-choice options does not affect the meaning of the question itself, we propose a simple and effective data leakage detection method based on this property. Specifically, we shuffle the contents of the options in the data to generate the corresponding derived data sets, and then detect data leakage based on the model's log probability distribution over the derived data sets. If there is a maximum and outlier in the set of log probabilities, it indicates that the data is leaked. Our method is able to work under black-box conditions without access to model training data or weights, effectively identifying data leakage from benchmark test sets in model pre-training data, including both normal scenarios and complex scenarios where options may have been shuffled intentionally or unintentionally. Through experiments based on two LLMs and benchmark designs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, we evaluate the degree of data leakage of 31 mainstream open-source LLMs on four benchmark datasets and give a ranking of the leaked LLMs for each benchmark, and we find that the Qwen family of LLMs has the highest degree of data leakage.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01790v1,2024-09
LLM-GAN: Construct Generative Adversarial Network Through Large Language Models For Explainable Fake News Detection,"Yifeng Wang, Zhouhong Gu, Siwei Zhang, Suhang Zheng, Tao Wang, Tianyu Li, Hongwei Feng, Yanghua Xiao","Explainable fake news detection predicts the authenticity of news items with annotated explanations. Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their powerful natural language understanding and explanation generation abilities. However, presenting LLMs for explainable fake news detection remains two main challenges. Firstly, fake news appears reasonable and could easily mislead LLMs, leaving them unable to understand the complex news-faking process. Secondly, utilizing LLMs for this task would generate both correct and incorrect explanations, which necessitates abundant labor in the loop. In this paper, we propose LLM-GAN, a novel framework that utilizes prompting mechanisms to enable an LLM to become Generator and Detector and for realistic fake news generation and detection. Our results demonstrate LLM-GAN's effectiveness in both prediction performance and explanation quality. We further showcase the integration of LLM-GAN to a cloud-native AI platform to provide better fake news detection service in the cloud.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01787v2,2024-09
State-of-the-art Advances of Deep-learning Linguistic Steganalysis Research,"Yihao Wang, Ru Zhang, Yifan Tang, Jianyi Liu","With the evolution of generative linguistic steganography techniques, conventional steganalysis falls short in robustly quantifying the alterations induced by steganography, thereby complicating detection. Consequently, the research paradigm has pivoted towards deep-learning-based linguistic steganalysis. This study offers a comprehensive review of existing contributions and evaluates prevailing developmental trajectories. Specifically, we first provided a formalized exposition of the general formulas for linguistic steganalysis, while comparing the differences between this field and the domain of text classification. Subsequently, we classified the existing work into two levels based on vector space mapping and feature extraction models, thereby comparing the research motivations, model advantages, and other details. A comparative analysis of the experiments is conducted to assess the performances. Finally, the challenges faced by this field are discussed, and several directions for future development and key issues that urgently need to be addressed are proposed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01780v1,2024-09
FC-KAN: Function Combinations in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,"Hoang-Thang Ta, Duy-Quy Thai, Abu Bakar Siddiqur Rahman, Grigori Sidorov, Alexander Gelbukh","In this paper, we introduce FC-KAN, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that leverages combinations of popular mathematical functions such as B-splines, wavelets, and radial basis functions on low-dimensional data through element-wise operations. We explore several methods for combining the outputs of these functions, including sum, element-wise product, the addition of sum and element-wise product, quadratic function representation, and concatenation. In our experiments, we compare FC-KAN with multi-layer perceptron network (MLP) and other existing KANs, such as BSRBF-KAN, EfficientKAN, FastKAN, and FasterKAN, on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. A variant of FC-KAN, which uses a combination of outputs from B-splines and Difference of Gaussians (DoG) in the form of a quadratic function, outperformed all other models on the average of 5 independent training runs. We expect that FC-KAN can leverage function combinations to design future KANs.

Empirical evidence of Large Language Model's influence on human spoken communication,"Hiromu Yakura, Ezequiel Lopez-Lopez, Levin Brinkmann, Ignacio Serna, Prateek Gupta, Iyad Rahwan","Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents now interact with billions of humans in natural language, thanks to advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This raises the question of whether AI has the potential to shape a fundamental aspect of human culture: the way we speak. Recent analyses revealed that scientific publications already exhibit evidence of AI-specific language. But this evidence is inconclusive, since scientists may simply be using AI to copy-edit their writing. To explore whether AI has influenced human spoken communication, we transcribed and analyzed about 280,000 English-language videos of presentations, talks, and speeches from more than 20,000 YouTube channels of academic institutions. We find a significant shift in the trend of word usage specific to words distinctively associated with ChatGPT following its release. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that humans increasingly imitate LLMs in their spoken language. Our results raise societal and policy-relevant concerns about the potential of AI to unintentionally reduce linguistic diversity, or to be deliberately misused for mass manipulation. They also highlight the need for further investigation into the feedback loops between machine behavior and human culture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01754v1,2024-09
Taming CLIP for Fine-grained and Structured Visual Understanding of Museum Exhibits,"Ada-Astrid Balauca, Danda Pani Paudel, Kristina Toutanova, Luc Van Gool","CLIP is a powerful and widely used tool for understanding images in the context of natural language descriptions to perform nuanced tasks. However, it does not offer application-specific fine-grained and structured understanding, due to its generic nature. In this work, we aim to adapt CLIP for fine-grained and structured -- in the form of tabular data -- visual understanding of museum exhibits. To facilitate such understanding we (a) collect, curate, and benchmark a dataset of 200K+ image-table pairs, and (b) develop a method that allows predicting tabular outputs for input images. Our dataset is the first of its kind in the public domain. At the same time, the proposed method is novel in leveraging CLIP's powerful representations for fine-grained and tabular understanding. The proposed method (MUZE) learns to map CLIP's image embeddings to the tabular structure by means of a proposed transformer-based parsing network (parseNet). More specifically, parseNet enables prediction of missing attribute values while integrating context from known attribute-value pairs for an input image. We show that this leads to significant improvement in accuracy. Through exhaustive experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method on fine-grained and structured understanding of museum exhibits, by achieving encouraging results in a newly established benchmark.

Leveraging Large Language Models for Solving Rare MIP Challenges,"Teng Wang, Wing-Yin Yu, Ruifeng She, Wenhan Yang, Taijie Chen, Jianping Zhang","Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) has been extensively applied in areas requiring mathematical solvers to address complex instances within tight time constraints. However, as the problem scale increases, the complexity of model formulation and finding feasible solutions escalates significantly. In contrast, the model-building cost for end-to-end models, such as large language models (LLMs), remains largely unaffected by problem scale due to their pattern recognition capabilities. While LLMs, like GPT-4, without fine-tuning, can handle some traditional medium-scale MIP problems, they struggle with uncommon or highly specialized MIP scenarios. Fine-tuning LLMs can yield some feasible solutions for medium-scale MIP instances, but these models typically fail to explore diverse solutions when constrained by a low and constant temperature, limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a recursively dynamic temperature method integrated with a chain-of-thought approach. Our findings show that starting with a high temperature and gradually lowering it leads to better feasible solutions compared to other dynamic temperature strategies. Additionally, by comparing results generated by the LLM with those from Gurobi, we demonstrate that the LLM can produce solutions that complement traditional solvers by accelerating the pruning process and improving overall efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04464v2,2024-09
In Defense of RAG in the Era of Long-Context Language Models,"Tan Yu, Anbang Xu, Rama Akkiraju","Overcoming the limited context limitations in early-generation LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been a reliable solution for context-based answer generation in the past. Recently, the emergence of long-context LLMs allows the models to incorporate much longer text sequences, making RAG less attractive. Recent studies show that long-context LLMs significantly outperform RAG in long-context applications. Unlike the existing works favoring the long-context LLM over RAG, we argue that the extremely long context in LLMs suffers from a diminished focus on relevant information and leads to potential degradation in answer quality. This paper revisits the RAG in long-context answer generation. We propose an order-preserve retrieval-augmented generation (OP-RAG) mechanism, which significantly improves the performance of RAG for long-context question-answer applications. With OP-RAG, as the number of retrieved chunks increases, the answer quality initially rises, and then declines, forming an inverted U-shaped curve. There exist sweet points where OP-RAG could achieve higher answer quality with much less tokens than long-context LLM taking the whole context as input. Extensive experiments on public benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our OP-RAG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01666v1,2024-09
Interpreting and Improving Large Language Models in Arithmetic Calculation,"Wei Zhang, Chaoqun Wan, Yonggang Zhang, Yiu-ming Cheung, Xinmei Tian, Xu Shen, Jieping Ye","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across numerous applications and have shown an emergent ability to tackle complex reasoning tasks, such as mathematical computations. However, even for the simplest arithmetic calculations, the intrinsic mechanisms behind LLMs remain mysterious, making it challenging to ensure reliability. In this work, we delve into uncovering a specific mechanism by which LLMs execute calculations. Through comprehensive experiments, we find that LLMs frequently involve a small fraction (< 5%) of attention heads, which play a pivotal role in focusing on operands and operators during calculation processes. Subsequently, the information from these operands is processed through multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), progressively leading to the final solution. These pivotal heads/MLPs, though identified on a specific dataset, exhibit transferability across different datasets and even distinct tasks. This insight prompted us to investigate the potential benefits of selectively fine-tuning these essential heads/MLPs to boost the LLMs' computational performance. We empirically find that such precise tuning can yield notable enhancements on mathematical prowess, without compromising the performance on non-mathematical tasks. Our work serves as a preliminary exploration into the arithmetic calculation abilities inherent in LLMs, laying a solid foundation to reveal more intricate mathematical tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01659v1,2024-09
From Yes-Men to Truth-Tellers: Addressing Sycophancy in Large Language Models with Pinpoint Tuning,"Wei Chen, Zhen Huang, Liang Xie, Binbin Lin, Houqiang Li, Le Lu, Xinmei Tian, Deng Cai, Yonggang Zhang, Wenxiao Wang, Xu Shen, Jieping Ye","Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to prioritize adherence to user prompts over providing veracious responses, leading to the sycophancy issue. When challenged by users, LLMs tend to admit mistakes and provide inaccurate responses even if they initially provided the correct answer. Recent works propose to employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to mitigate the sycophancy issue, while it typically leads to the degeneration of LLMs' general capability. To address the challenge, we propose a novel supervised pinpoint tuning (SPT), where the region-of-interest modules are tuned for a given objective. Specifically, SPT first reveals and verifies a small percentage (<5%) of the basic modules, which significantly affect a particular behavior of LLMs. i.e., sycophancy. Subsequently, SPT merely fine-tunes these identified modules while freezing the rest. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SPT, we conduct comprehensive experiments, demonstrating that SPT significantly mitigates the sycophancy issue of LLMs (even better than SFT). Moreover, SPT introduces limited or even no side effects on the general capability of LLMs. Our results shed light on how to precisely, effectively, and efficiently explain and improve the targeted ability of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01658v2,2024-09
CTG-KrEW: Generating Synthetic Structured Contextually Correlated Content by Conditional Tabular GAN with K-Means Clustering and Efficient Word Embedding,"Riya Samanta, Bidyut Saha, Soumya K. Ghosh, Sajal K. Das","Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) and their various derivatives are attractive for their ability to efficiently and flexibly create synthetic tabular data, showcasing strong performance and adaptability. However, there are certain critical limitations to such models. The first is their inability to preserve the semantic integrity of contextually correlated words or phrases. For instance, skillset in freelancer profiles is one such attribute where individual skills are semantically interconnected and indicative of specific domain interests or qualifications. The second challenge of traditional approaches is that, when applied to generate contextually correlated tabular content, besides generating semantically shallow content, they consume huge memory resources and CPU time during the training stage. To address these problems, we introduce a novel framework, CTGKrEW (Conditional Tabular GAN with KMeans Clustering and Word Embedding), which is adept at generating realistic synthetic tabular data where attributes are collections of semantically and contextually coherent words. CTGKrEW is trained and evaluated using a dataset from Upwork, a realworld freelancing platform. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to analyze the variability, contextual similarity, frequency distribution, and associativity of the generated data, along with testing the framework's system feasibility. CTGKrEW also takes around 99\% less CPU time and 33\% less memory footprints than the conventional approach. Furthermore, we developed KrEW, a web application to facilitate the generation of realistic data containing skill-related information. This application, available at https://riyasamanta.github.io/krew.html, is freely accessible to both the general public and the research community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01628v1,2024-09
Booster: Tackling Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Attenuating Harmful Perturbation,"Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Fatih Ilhan, Selim Furkan Tekin, Ling Liu","Harmful fine-tuning issue \citep{qi2023fine} poses serious safety concerns for Large language models' fine-tuning-as-a-service. While existing defenses \citep{huang2024vaccine,rosati2024representation} have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. For the first time in the literature, we in this paper show that \textit{harmful perturbation} over the model weights should be the root cause of alignment-broken of harmful fine-tuning. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction before/after simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk. Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks.

Towards Cross-Lingual Explanation of Artwork in Large-scale Vision Language Models,"Shintaro Ozaki, Kazuki Hayashi, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Taro Watanabe","As the performance of Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) improves, they are increasingly capable of responding in multiple languages, and there is an expectation that the demand for explanations generated by LVLMs will grow. However, pre-training of Vision Encoder and the integrated training of LLMs with Vision Encoder are mainly conducted using English training data, leaving it uncertain whether LVLMs can completely handle their potential when generating explanations in languages other than English. In addition, multilingual QA benchmarks that create datasets using machine translation have cultural differences and biases, remaining issues for use as evaluation tasks. To address these challenges, this study created an extended dataset in multiple languages without relying on machine translation. This dataset that takes into account nuances and country-specific phrases was then used to evaluate the generation explanation abilities of LVLMs. Furthermore, this study examined whether Instruction-Tuning in resource-rich English improves performance in other languages. Our findings indicate that LVLMs perform worse in languages other than English compared to English. In addition, it was observed that LVLMs struggle to effectively manage the knowledge learned from English data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01584v1,2024-09
Multi-Source Knowledge Pruning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: A Benchmark and Empirical Study,"Shuo Yu, Mingyue Cheng, Jiqian Yang, Jie Ouyang, Yucong Luo, Chenyi Lei, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is increasingly recognized as an effective approach for mitigating the hallucination of large language models (LLMs) through the integration of external knowledge. While numerous efforts, most studies focus on a single type of externeal knowledge source. However, in real-world applications, most situations involve diverse knowledge from various sources, yet this area has been less explored. The main dilemma is the lack of a suitable dataset containing multiple knowledge sources and pre-exploration of the associated issues. To address these challenges, we standardize a benchmark dataset that combines structured and unstructured knowledge across diverse and complementary domains. Based on this dataset, we further develop a plug-and-play RAG framework, PruningRAG, whose main characteristic is to employ multi-granularity pruning strategies for optimizing the integration of relevant information and minimizing misleading context. Building upon the standardized dataset and PruningRAG, we also report a series of experimental results, as well as insightful findings.

AdaComp: Extractive Context Compression with Adaptive Predictor for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models,"Qianchi Zhang, Hainan Zhang, Liang Pang, Hongwei Zheng, Zhiming Zheng","Retrieved documents containing noise will hinder RAG from detecting answer clues and make the inference process slow and expensive. Therefore, context compression is necessary to enhance its accuracy and efficiency. Existing context compression methods use extractive or generative models to retain the most query-relevant sentences or apply the information bottleneck theory to preserve sufficient information. However, these methods may face issues such as over-compression or high computational costs. We observe that the retriever often ranks relevant documents at the top, but the exact number of documents needed to answer the query is uncertain due to the impact of query complexity and retrieval quality: complex queries like multi-hop questions may require retaining more documents than simpler queries, and a low-quality retrieval may need to rely on more documents to generate accurate outputs. Therefore, determining the minimum number of required documents (compression rate) is still a challenge for RAG. In this paper, we introduce AdaComp, a low-cost extractive context compression method that adaptively determines the compression rate based on both query complexity and retrieval quality. Specifically, we first annotate the minimum top-k documents necessary for the RAG system to answer the current query as the compression rate and then construct triplets of the query, retrieved documents, and its compression rate. Then, we use this triplet dataset to train a compression-rate predictor. Experiments on three QA datasets and one conversational Muiti-doc QA dataset show that AdaComp significantly reduces inference costs while maintaining performance nearly identical to uncompressed models, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01579v1,2024-09
An Implementation of Werewolf Agent That does not Truly Trust LLMs,"Takehiro Sato, Shintaro Ozaki, Daisaku Yokoyama","Werewolf is an incomplete information game, which has several challenges when creating a computer agent as a player given the lack of understanding of the situation and individuality of utterance (e.g., computer agents are not capable of characterful utterance or situational lying). We propose a werewolf agent that solves some of those difficulties by combining a Large Language Model (LLM) and a rule-based algorithm. In particular, our agent uses a rule-based algorithm to select an output either from an LLM or a template prepared beforehand based on the results of analyzing conversation history using an LLM. It allows the agent to refute in specific situations, identify when to end the conversation, and behave with persona. This approach mitigated conversational inconsistencies and facilitated logical utterance as a result. We also conducted a qualitative evaluation, which resulted in our agent being perceived as more human-like compared to an unmodified LLM. The agent is freely available for contributing to advance the research in the field of Werewolf game.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01575v1,2024-09
Benchmarking Cognitive Domains for LLMs: Insights from Taiwanese Hakka Culture,"Chen-Chi Chang, Ching-Yuan Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Chih-Cheng Lee","This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and processing cultural knowledge, with a specific focus on Hakka culture as a case study. Leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy, the study develops a multi-dimensional framework that systematically assesses LLMs across six cognitive domains: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating. This benchmark extends beyond traditional single-dimensional evaluations by providing a deeper analysis of LLMs' abilities to handle culturally specific content, ranging from basic recall of facts to higher-order cognitive tasks such as creative synthesis. Additionally, the study integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to address the challenges of minority cultural knowledge representation in LLMs, demonstrating how RAG enhances the models' performance by dynamically incorporating relevant external information. The results highlight the effectiveness of RAG in improving accuracy across all cognitive domains, particularly in tasks requiring precise retrieval and application of cultural knowledge. However, the findings also reveal the limitations of RAG in creative tasks, underscoring the need for further optimization. This benchmark provides a robust tool for evaluating and comparing LLMs in culturally diverse contexts, offering valuable insights for future research and development in AI-driven cultural knowledge preservation and dissemination.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01556v2,2024-09
Self-Instructed Derived Prompt Generation Meets In-Context Learning: Unlocking New Potential of Black-Box LLMs,"Zhuo Li, Yuhao Du, Jinpeng Hu, Xiang Wan, Anningzhe Gao","Large language models (LLMs) have shown success in generating high-quality responses. In order to achieve better alignment with LLMs with human preference, various works are proposed based on specific optimization process, which, however, is not suitable to Black-Box LLMs like GPT-4, due to inaccessible parameters. In Black-Box LLMs case, their performance is highly dependent on the quality of the provided prompts. Existing methods to enhance response quality often involve a prompt refinement model, yet these approaches potentially suffer from semantic inconsistencies between the refined and original prompts, and typically overlook the relationship between them. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-instructed in-context learning framework that empowers LLMs to deliver more effective responses by generating reliable derived prompts to construct informative contextual environments. Our approach incorporates a self-instructed reinforcement learning mechanism, enabling direct interaction with the response model during derived prompt generation for better alignment. We then formulate querying as an in-context learning task, using responses from LLMs combined with the derived prompts to establish a contextual demonstration for the original prompt. This strategy ensures alignment with the original query, reduces discrepancies from refined prompts, and maximizes the LLMs' in-context learning capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only generates more reliable derived prompts but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to deliver more effective responses, including Black-Box models such as GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01552v1,2024-09
VoxHakka: A Dialectally Diverse Multi-speaker Text-to-Speech System for Taiwanese Hakka,"Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Chen-Chi Chang","This paper introduces VoxHakka, a text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for Taiwanese Hakka, a critically under-resourced language spoken in Taiwan. Leveraging the YourTTS framework, VoxHakka achieves high naturalness and accuracy and low real-time factor in speech synthesis while supporting six distinct Hakka dialects. This is achieved by training the model with dialect-specific data, allowing for the generation of speaker-aware Hakka speech. To address the scarcity of publicly available Hakka speech corpora, we employed a cost-effective approach utilizing a web scraping pipeline coupled with automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based data cleaning techniques. This process ensured the acquisition of a high-quality, multi-speaker, multi-dialect dataset suitable for TTS training. Subjective listening tests conducted using comparative mean opinion scores (CMOS) demonstrate that VoxHakka significantly outperforms existing publicly available Hakka TTS systems in terms of pronunciation accuracy, tone correctness, and overall naturalness. This work represents a significant advancement in Hakka language technology and provides a valuable resource for language preservation and revitalization efforts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01548v3,2024-09
Effective Noise-aware Data Simulation for Domain-adaptive Speech Enhancement Leveraging Dynamic Stochastic Perturbation,"Chien-Chun Wang, Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Berlin Chen, Hsin-Min Wang","Cross-domain speech enhancement (SE) is often faced with severe challenges due to the scarcity of noise and background information in an unseen target domain, leading to a mismatch between training and test conditions. This study puts forward a novel data simulation method to address this issue, leveraging noise-extractive techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs) with only limited target noisy speech data. Notably, our method employs a noise encoder to extract noise embeddings from target-domain data. These embeddings aptly guide the generator to synthesize utterances acoustically fitted to the target domain while authentically preserving the phonetic content of the input clean speech. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of dynamic stochastic perturbation, which can inject controlled perturbations into the noise embeddings during inference, thereby enabling the model to generalize well to unseen noise conditions. Experiments on the VoiceBank-DEMAND benchmark dataset demonstrate that our domain-adaptive SE method outperforms an existing strong baseline based on data simulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01545v1,2024-09
It is Time to Develop an Auditing Framework to Promote Value Aware Chatbots,"Yanchen Wang, Lisa Singh","The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of a new era in AI, the availability of generative AI tools for everyone to use. ChatGPT and other similar chatbots boast a wide range of capabilities from answering student homework questions to creating music and art. Given the large amounts of human data chatbots are built on, it is inevitable that they will inherit human errors and biases. These biases have the potential to inflict significant harm or increase inequity on different subpopulations. Because chatbots do not have an inherent understanding of societal values, they may create new content that is contrary to established norms. Examples of concerning generated content includes child pornography, inaccurate facts, and discriminatory posts. In this position paper, we argue that the speed of advancement of this technology requires us, as computer and data scientists, to mobilize and develop a values-based auditing framework containing a community established standard set of measurements to monitor the health of different chatbots and LLMs. To support our argument, we use a simple audit template to share the results of basic audits we conduct that are focused on measuring potential bias in search engine style tasks, code generation, and story generation. We identify responses from GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 that are both consistent and not consistent with values derived from existing law. While the findings come as no surprise, they do underscore the urgency of developing a robust auditing framework for openly sharing results in a consistent way so that mitigation strategies can be developed by the academic community, government agencies, and companies when our values are not being adhered to. We conclude this paper with recommendations for value-based strategies for improving the technologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01539v1,2024-09
S$^3$c-Math: Spontaneous Step-level Self-correction Makes Large Language Models Better Mathematical Reasoners,"Yuchen Yan, Jin Jiang, Yang Liu, Yixin Cao, Xin Xu, Mengdi zhang, Xunliang Cai, Jian Shao","Self-correction is a novel method that can stimulate the potential reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). It involves detecting and correcting errors during the inference process when LLMs solve reasoning problems. However, recent works do not regard self-correction as a spontaneous and intrinsic capability of LLMs. Instead, such correction is achieved through post-hoc generation, external knowledge introduction, multi-model collaboration, and similar techniques. In this paper, we propose a series of mathematical LLMs called S$^3$c-Math, which are able to perform Spontaneous Step-level Self-correction for Mathematical reasoning. This capability helps LLMs to recognize whether their ongoing inference tends to contain errors and simultaneously correct these errors to produce a more reliable response. We proposed a method, which employs a step-level sampling approach to construct step-wise self-correction data for achieving such ability. Additionally, we implement a training strategy that uses above constructed data to equip LLMs with spontaneous step-level self-correction capacities. Our data and methods have been demonstrated to be effective across various foundation LLMs, consistently showing significant progress in evaluations on GSM8K, MATH, and other mathematical benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the spontaneous step-level self-correction ability of LLMs in mathematical reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01524v1,2024-09
DiversityMedQA: Assessing Demographic Biases in Medical Diagnosis using Large Language Models,"Rajat Rawat, Hudson McBride, Dhiyaan Nirmal, Rajarshi Ghosh, Jong Moon, Dhruv Alamuri, Sean O'Brien, Kevin Zhu","As large language models (LLMs) gain traction in healthcare, concerns about their susceptibility to demographic biases are growing. We introduce {DiversityMedQA}, a novel benchmark designed to assess LLM responses to medical queries across diverse patient demographics, such as gender and ethnicity. By perturbing questions from the MedQA dataset, which comprises medical board exam questions, we created a benchmark that captures the nuanced differences in medical diagnosis across varying patient profiles. Our findings reveal notable discrepancies in model performance when tested against these demographic variations. Furthermore, to ensure the perturbations were accurate, we also propose a filtering strategy that validates each perturbation. By releasing DiversityMedQA, we provide a resource for evaluating and mitigating demographic bias in LLM medical diagnoses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01497v2,2024-09
The Compressor-Retriever Architecture for Language Model OS,"Yuan Yang, Siheng Xiong, Ehsan Shareghi, Faramarz Fekri","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capacity to aggregate and process information across multiple modalities, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks such as multimodal data querying, tool usage, web interactions, and handling long documents. These capabilities pave the way for transforming LLMs from mere chatbots into general-purpose agents capable of interacting with the real world. This paper explores the concept of using a language model as the core component of an operating system (OS), effectively acting as a CPU that processes data stored in a context window, which functions as RAM. A key challenge in realizing such an LM OS is managing the life-long context and ensuring statefulness across sessions, a feature limited by the current session-based interaction paradigm due to context window size limit. To address this, we introduce compressor-retriever, a model-agnostic architecture designed for life-long context management. Unlike other long-context solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation, our approach exclusively uses the base model's forward function to compress and retrieve context, ensuring end-to-end differentiability. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in in-context learning tasks, marking a step towards the development of a fully stateful LLM OS.

Revisiting SMoE Language Models by Evaluating Inefficiencies with Task Specific Expert Pruning,"Soumajyoti Sarkar, Leonard Lausen, Volkan Cevher, Sheng Zha, Thomas Brox, George Karypis","Sparse Mixture of Expert (SMoE) models have emerged as a scalable alternative to dense models in language modeling. These models use conditionally activated feedforward subnetworks in transformer blocks, allowing for a separation between total model parameters and per-example computation. However, large token-routed SMoE models face a significant challenge: during inference, the entire model must be used for a sequence or a batch, resulting in high latencies in a distributed setting that offsets the advantages of per-token sparse activation. Our research explores task-specific model pruning to inform decisions about designing SMoE architectures, mainly modulating the choice of expert counts in pretraining. We investigate whether such pruned models offer advantages over smaller SMoE models trained from scratch, when evaluating and comparing them individually on tasks. To that end, we introduce an adaptive task-aware pruning technique UNCURL to reduce the number of experts per MoE layer in an offline manner post-training. Our findings reveal a threshold pruning factor for the reduction that depends on the number of experts used in pretraining, above which, the reduction starts to degrade model performance. These insights contribute to our understanding of model design choices when pretraining with SMoE architectures, particularly useful when considering task-specific inference optimization for later stages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01483v1,2024-09
Masked Mixers for Language Generation and Retrieval,Benjamin L. Badger,"Attention mechanisms that confer selective focus on a strict subset of input elements are nearly ubiquitous in language models today. We posit there to be downside to the use of attention: most information present in the input is necessarily lost. In support of this idea we observe poor input representation accuracy in transformers, but find more accurate representation in what we term masked mixers which replace self-attention with masked convolutions. Applied to TinyStories the masked mixer learns causal language tasks more efficiently than early transformer implementations and somewhat less efficiently than optimized, current implementations. The most efficient learning algorithm observed for this dataset is a transformer-masked mixer hybrid, suggesting that these models learn in an orthogonal manner. We hypothesized that the information loss exhibited by transformers would be much more detrimental to retrieval than generation, and to test this we introduce an efficient training approach for retrieval models based on existing generative model embeddings. With this method, embeddings from masked mixers are found to result in far better summary-to-story retrieval compared to embeddings from transformers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01482v1,2024-09
PoliPrompt: A High-Performance Cost-Effective LLM-Based Text Classification Framework for Political Science,"Menglin Liu, Ge Shi","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for enhancing text classification efficiency in political science, surpassing traditional machine learning methods that often require extensive feature engineering, human labeling, and task-specific training. However, their effectiveness in achieving high classification accuracy remains questionable. This paper introduces a three-stage in-context learning approach that leverages LLMs to improve classification accuracy while minimizing experimental costs. Our method incorporates automatic enhanced prompt generation, adaptive exemplar selection, and a consensus mechanism that resolves discrepancies between two weaker LLMs, refined by an advanced LLM. We validate our approach using datasets from the BBC news reports, Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation, and 2018 election campaign ads. The results show significant improvements in classification F1 score (+0.36 for zero-shot classification) with manageable economic costs (-78% compared with human labeling), demonstrating that our method effectively addresses the limitations of traditional machine learning while offering a scalable and reliable solution for text analysis in political science.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01466v1,2024-09
Efficient and Scalable Estimation of Tool Representations in Vector Space,"Suhong Moon, Siddharth Jha, Lutfi Eren Erdogan, Sehoon Kim, Woosang Lim, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami","Recent advancements in function calling and tool use have significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to interact with external information sources and execute complex tasks. However, the limited context window of LLMs presents challenges when a large number of tools are available, necessitating efficient methods to manage prompt length and maintain accuracy. Existing approaches, such as fine-tuning LLMs or leveraging their reasoning capabilities, either require frequent retraining or incur significant latency overhead. A more efficient solution involves training smaller models to retrieve the most relevant tools for a given query, although this requires high quality, domain-specific data. To address those challenges, we present a novel framework for generating synthetic data for tool retrieval applications and an efficient data-driven tool retrieval strategy using small encoder models. Empowered by LLMs, we create ToolBank, a new tool retrieval dataset that reflects real human user usages. For tool retrieval methodologies, we propose novel approaches: (1) Tool2Vec: usage-driven tool embedding generation for tool retrieval, (2) ToolRefiner: a staged retrieval method that iteratively improves the quality of retrieved tools, and (3) MLC: framing tool retrieval as a multi-label classification problem. With these new methods, we achieve improvements of up to 27.28 in Recall@K on the ToolBench dataset and 30.5 in Recall@K on ToolBank. Additionally, we present further experimental results to rigorously validate our methods.

ComfyBench: Benchmarking LLM-based Agents in ComfyUI for Autonomously Designing Collaborative AI Systems,"Xiangyuan Xue, Zeyu Lu, Di Huang, Zidong Wang, Wanli Ouyang, Lei Bai","Much previous AI research has focused on developing monolithic models to maximize their intelligence, with the primary goal of enhancing performance on specific tasks. In contrast, this work attempts to study using LLM-based agents to design collaborative AI systems autonomously. To explore this problem, we first introduce ComfyBench to evaluate agents's ability to design collaborative AI systems in ComfyUI. ComfyBench is a comprehensive benchmark comprising 200 diverse tasks covering various instruction-following generation challenges, along with detailed annotations for 3,205 nodes and 20 workflows. Based on ComfyBench, we further develop ComfyAgent, a novel framework that empowers LLM-based agents to autonomously design collaborative AI systems by generating workflows. ComfyAgent is based on two core concepts. First, it represents workflows with code, which can be reversibly converted into workflows and executed as collaborative systems by the interpreter. Second, it constructs a multi-agent system that cooperates to learn from existing workflows and generate new workflows for a given task. While experimental results demonstrate that ComfyAgent achieves a comparable resolve rate to o1-preview and significantly surpasses other agents on ComfyBench, ComfyAgent has resolved only 15\% of creative tasks. LLM-based agents still have a long way to go in autonomously designing collaborative AI systems. Progress with ComfyBench is paving the way for more intelligent and autonomous collaborative AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01392v2,2024-09

To do that, we introduce the CV-Probes dataset, designed explicitly for studying context understanding, containing image-caption pairs with context-dependent verbs (e.g., ""beg"") and non-context-dependent verbs (e.g., ""sit""). We employ the MM-SHAP evaluation to assess the contribution of verb tokens towards model predictions. Our results indicate that VL models struggle to ground context-dependent verb phrases effectively. These findings highlight the challenges in training VL models to integrate context accurately, suggesting a need for improved methodologies in VL model training and evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01389v1,2024-09
Membership Inference Attacks Against In-Context Learning,"Rui Wen, Zheng Li, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang","Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks introduces concerns about computational efficiency, prompting an exploration of efficient methods such as In-Context Learning (ICL). However, the vulnerability of ICL to privacy attacks under realistic assumptions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first membership inference attack tailored for ICL, relying solely on generated texts without their associated probabilities. We propose four attack strategies tailored to various constrained scenarios and conduct extensive experiments on four popular large language models. Empirical results show that our attacks can accurately determine membership status in most cases, e.g., 95\% accuracy advantage against LLaMA, indicating that the associated risks are much higher than those shown by existing probability-based attacks. Additionally, we propose a hybrid attack that synthesizes the strengths of the aforementioned strategies, achieving an accuracy advantage of over 95\% in most cases. Furthermore, we investigate three potential defenses targeting data, instruction, and output. Results demonstrate combining defenses from orthogonal dimensions significantly reduces privacy leakage and offers enhanced privacy assurances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01380v1,2024-09
Imitating Language via Scalable Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"Markus Wulfmeier, Michael Bloesch, Nino Vieillard, Arun Ahuja, Jorg Bornschein, Sandy Huang, Artem Sokolov, Matt Barnes, Guillaume Desjardins, Alex Bewley, Sarah Maria Elisabeth Bechtle, Jost Tobias Springenberg, Nikola Momchev, Olivier Bachem, Matthieu Geist, Martin Riedmiller","The majority of language model training builds on imitation learning. It covers pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and affects the starting conditions for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The simplicity and scalability of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for next token prediction led to its role as predominant paradigm. However, the broader field of imitation learning can more effectively utilize the sequential structure underlying autoregressive generation. We focus on investigating the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) perspective to imitation, extracting rewards and directly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and evaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models. We provide a new angle, reformulating inverse soft-Q-learning as a temporal difference regularized extension of MLE. This creates a principled connection between MLE and IRL and allows trading off added complexity with increased performance and diversity of generations in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. We find clear advantages for IRL-based imitation, in particular for retaining diversity while maximizing task performance, rendering IRL a strong alternative on fixed SFT datasets even without online data generation. Our analysis of IRL-extracted reward functions further indicates benefits for more robust reward functions via tighter integration of supervised and preference-based LLM post-training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01369v2,2024-09
CHESS: Optimizing LLM Inference via Channel-Wise Thresholding and Selective Sparsification,"Junhui He, Shangyu Wu, Weidong Wen, Chun Jason Xue, Qingan Li","Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices presents significant challenges due to the substantial computational overhead and memory requirements. Activation sparsification can mitigate these resource challenges by reducing the number of activated neurons during inference. Existing methods typically employ thresholding-based sparsification based on the statistics of activation tensors. However, they do not model the impact of activation sparsification on performance, resulting in suboptimal performance degradation. To address the limitations, this paper reformulates the activation sparsification problem to explicitly capture the relationship between activation sparsity and model performance. Then, this paper proposes CHESS, a general activation sparsification approach via CHannel-wise thrEsholding and Selective Sparsification. First, channel-wise thresholding assigns a unique threshold to each activation channel in the feed-forward network (FFN) layers. Then, selective sparsification involves applying thresholding-based activation sparsification to specific layers within the attention modules. Finally, we detail the implementation of sparse kernels to accelerate LLM inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CHESS achieves lower performance degradation over eight downstream tasks while activating fewer parameters than existing methods, thus speeding up the LLM inference by up to 1.27x.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01366v2,2024-09
Seeing Through Their Eyes: Evaluating Visual Perspective Taking in Vision Language Models,"Gracjan Góral, Alicja Ziarko, Michal Nauman, Maciej Wołczyk","Visual perspective-taking (VPT), the ability to understand the viewpoint of another person, enables individuals to anticipate the actions of other people. For instance, a driver can avoid accidents by assessing what pedestrians see. Humans typically develop this skill in early childhood, but it remains unclear whether the recently emerging Vision Language Models (VLMs) possess such capability. Furthermore, as these models are increasingly deployed in the real world, understanding how they perform nuanced tasks like VPT becomes essential. In this paper, we introduce two manually curated datasets, Isle-Bricks and Isle-Dots for testing VPT skills, and we use it to evaluate 12 commonly used VLMs. Across all models, we observe a significant performance drop when perspective-taking is required. Additionally, we find performance in object detection tasks is poorly correlated with performance on VPT tasks, suggesting that the existing benchmarks might not be sufficient to understand this problem.

Know When to Fuse: Investigating Non-English Hybrid Retrieval in the Legal Domain,"Antoine Louis, Gijs van Dijck, Gerasimos Spanakis","Hybrid search has emerged as an effective strategy to offset the limitations of different matching paradigms, especially in out-of-domain contexts where notable improvements in retrieval quality have been observed. However, existing research predominantly focuses on a limited set of retrieval methods, evaluated in pairs on domain-general datasets exclusively in English. In this work, we study the efficacy of hybrid search across a variety of prominent retrieval models within the unexplored field of law in the French language, assessing both zero-shot and in-domain scenarios. Our findings reveal that in a zero-shot context, fusing different domain-general models consistently enhances performance compared to using a standalone model, regardless of the fusion method. Surprisingly, when models are trained in-domain, we find that fusion generally diminishes performance relative to using the best single system, unless fusing scores with carefully tuned weights. These novel insights, among others, expand the applicability of prior findings across a new field and language, and contribute to a deeper understanding of hybrid search in non-English specialized domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01357v1,2024-09
Language Models Benefit from Preparation with Elicited Knowledge,"Jiacan Yu, Hannah An, Lenhart K. Schubert","The zero-shot chain of thought (CoT) approach is often used in question answering (QA) by language models (LMs) for tasks that require multiple reasoning steps. However, some QA tasks hinge more on accessing relevant knowledge than on chaining reasoning steps. We introduce a simple prompting technique, called PREP, that involves using two instances of LMs: the first (LM1) generates relevant information, and the second (LM2) receives the information from the user and answers the question. This design is intended to make better use of the LM's instruction-following capability. PREP is applicable across various QA tasks without domain-specific prompt engineering. PREP is developed on a dataset of 100 QA questions, derived from an extensive schematic dataset specifying artifact parts and material composition. These questions ask which of two artifacts is less likely to share materials with another artifact. Such questions probe the LM's knowledge of shared materials in the part structure of different artifacts. We test our method on our parts-and-materials dataset and three published commonsense reasoning datasets. The average accuracy of our method is consistently higher than that of all the other tested methods across all the tested datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01345v3,2024-09

In this work, we introduce a novel formalism and structure for such procedural knowledge. Based on this formalism, we present a novel procedural knowledge dataset called LCStep, which we created from LangChain tutorials. To leverage this procedural knowledge to solve new tasks, we propose analogy-augmented generation (AAG), which draws inspiration from the human ability to assimilate past experiences to solve unfamiliar problems. AAG uses a custom procedure memory store to retrieve and adapt specialized domain knowledge to answer new procedural tasks.

Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from 9,134 COVID-19 patients collected across four hospitals. Seven CML models, including XGBoost and random forest (RF), were trained and evaluated. The structured data was converted into text for zero-shot classification by eight LLMs, including GPT-4 and Mistral-7b. Additionally, Mistral-7b was fine-tuned using the QLoRA approach to enhance its predictive capabilities.   Results: Among the CML models, XGBoost and RF achieved the highest accuracy, with F1 scores of 0.87 for internal validation and 0.83 for external validation. In the LLM category, GPT-4 was the top performer with an F1 score of 0.43. Fine-tuning Mistral-7b significantly improved its recall from 1% to 79%, resulting in an F1 score of 0.74, which was stable during external validation.

Conversational Complexity for Assessing Risk in Large Language Models,"John Burden, Manuel Cebrian, Jose Hernandez-Orallo","Large Language Models (LLMs) present a dual-use dilemma: they enable beneficial applications while harboring potential for harm, particularly through conversational interactions. Despite various safeguards, advanced LLMs remain vulnerable. A watershed case in early 2023 involved journalist Kevin Roose's extended dialogue with Bing, an LLM-powered search engine, which revealed harmful outputs after probing questions, highlighting vulnerabilities in the model's safeguards. This contrasts with simpler early jailbreaks, like the ""Grandma Jailbreak,"" where users framed requests as innocent help for a grandmother, easily eliciting similar content. This raises the question: How much conversational effort is needed to elicit harmful information from LLMs? We propose two measures to quantify this effort: Conversational Length (CL), which measures the number of conversational turns needed to obtain a specific harmful response, and Conversational Complexity (CC), defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of the user's instruction sequence leading to the harmful response. To address the incomputability of Kolmogorov complexity, we approximate CC using a reference LLM to estimate the compressibility of the user instructions. Applying this approach to a large red-teaming dataset, we perform a quantitative analysis examining the statistical distribution of harmful and harmless conversational lengths and complexities. Our empirical findings suggest that this distributional analysis and the minimization of CC serve as valuable tools for understanding AI safety, offering insights into the accessibility of harmful information. This work establishes a foundation for a new perspective on LLM safety, centered around the algorithmic complexity of pathways to harm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01247v3,2024-09
THInC: A Theory-Driven Framework for Computational Humor Detection,"Victor De Marez, Thomas Winters, Ayla Rigouts Terryn","Humor is a fundamental aspect of human communication and cognition, as it plays a crucial role in social engagement. Although theories about humor have evolved over centuries, there is still no agreement on a single, comprehensive humor theory. Likewise, computationally recognizing humor remains a significant challenge despite recent advances in large language models. Moreover, most computational approaches to detecting humor are not based on existing humor theories. This paper contributes to bridging this long-standing gap between humor theory research and computational humor detection by creating an interpretable framework for humor classification, grounded in multiple humor theories, called THInC (Theory-driven Humor Interpretation and Classification). THInC ensembles interpretable GA2M classifiers, each representing a different humor theory. We engineered a transparent flow to actively create proxy features that quantitatively reflect different aspects of theories. An implementation of this framework achieves an F1 score of 0.85. The associative interpretability of the framework enables analysis of proxy efficacy, alignment of joke features with theories, and identification of globally contributing features. This paper marks a pioneering effort in creating a humor detection framework that is informed by diverse humor theories and offers a foundation for future advancements in theory-driven humor classification. It also serves as a first step in automatically comparing humor theories in a quantitative manner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01232v1,2024-09
Prompt Compression with Context-Aware Sentence Encoding for Fast and Improved LLM Inference,"Barys Liskavets, Maxim Ushakov, Shuvendu Roy, Mark Klibanov, Ali Etemad, Shane Luke","Large language models (LLMs) have triggered a new stream of research focusing on compressing the context length to reduce the computational cost while ensuring the retention of helpful information for LLMs to answer the given question. Token-based removal methods are one of the most prominent approaches in this direction, but risk losing the semantics of the context caused by intermediate token removal, especially under high compression ratios, while also facing challenges in computational efficiency. In this work, we propose context-aware prompt compression (CPC), a sentence-level prompt compression technique where its key innovation is a novel context-aware sentence encoder that provides a relevance score for each sentence for a given question. To train this encoder, we generate a new dataset consisting of questions, positives, and negative pairs where positives are sentences relevant to the question, while negatives are irrelevant context sentences. We train the encoder in a contrastive setup to learn context-aware sentence representations. Our method considerably outperforms prior works on prompt compression on benchmark datasets and is up to 10.93x faster at inference compared to the best token-level compression method. We also find better improvement for shorter length constraints in most benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposed solution in the compression of relevant information in a shorter context.

A multilingual training strategy for low resource Text to Speech,"Asma Amalas, Mounir Ghogho, Mohamed Chetouani, Rachid Oulad Haj Thami","Recent speech technologies have led to produce high quality synthesised speech due to recent advances in neural Text to Speech (TTS). However, such TTS models depend on extensive amounts of data that can be costly to produce and is hardly scalable to all existing languages, especially that seldom attention is given to low resource languages. With techniques such as knowledge transfer, the burden of creating datasets can be alleviated. In this paper, we therefore investigate two aspects; firstly, whether data from social media can be used for a small TTS dataset construction, and secondly whether cross lingual transfer learning (TL) for a low resource language can work with this type of data. In this aspect, we specifically assess to what extent multilingual modeling can be leveraged as an alternative to training on monolingual corporas. To do so, we explore how data from foreign languages may be selected and pooled to train a TTS model for a target low resource language. Our findings show that multilingual pre-training is better than monolingual pre-training at increasing the intelligibility and naturalness of the generated speech.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01217v1,2024-09
CLIBE: Detecting Dynamic Backdoors in Transformer-based NLP Models,"Rui Zeng, Xi Chen, Yuwen Pu, Xuhong Zhang, Tianyu Du, Shouling Ji","Backdoors can be injected into NLP models to induce misbehavior when the input text contains a specific feature, known as a trigger, which the attacker secretly selects. Unlike fixed words, phrases, or sentences used in the static text trigger, NLP dynamic backdoor attacks design triggers associated with abstract and latent text features, making them considerably stealthier than traditional static backdoor attacks. However, existing research on NLP backdoor detection primarily focuses on defending against static backdoor attacks, while detecting dynamic backdoors in NLP models remains largely unexplored. This paper presents CLIBE, the first framework to detect dynamic backdoors in Transformer-based NLP models. CLIBE injects a ""few-shot perturbation"" into the suspect Transformer model by crafting optimized weight perturbation in the attention layers to make the perturbed model classify a limited number of reference samples as a target label. Subsequently, CLIBE leverages the generalization ability of this few-shot perturbation to determine whether the original model contains a dynamic backdoor. Extensive evaluation on three advanced NLP dynamic backdoor attacks, two widely-used Transformer frameworks, and four real-world classification tasks strongly validates the effectiveness of CLIBE. We also demonstrate the robustness of CLIBE against various adaptive attacks. Furthermore, we employ CLIBE to scrutinize 49 popular Transformer models on Hugging Face and discover one exhibiting a high probability of containing a dynamic backdoor. We have contacted Hugging Face and provided detailed evidence of this model's backdoor behavior. Moreover, we extend CLIBE to detect backdoor text generation models modified to exhibit toxic behavior. To the best of our knowledge, CLIBE is the first framework capable of detecting backdoors in text generation models without access to trigger input test samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01193v2,2024-09

Our evaluation employs two KBs: Fandom, exemplifying real-world EL complexities, and the widely used Wikipedia. First, we assess EL models' ability to generalize to a new unfamiliar KB using Fandom and a novel zero-shot conversational entity linking dataset that we curated based on Reddit discussions on Fandom entities. We then evaluate the adaptability of EL models to conversational settings without prior training. Our results indicate that current zero-shot EL models falter when introduced to new, domain-specific KBs without prior training, significantly dropping in performance. Our findings reveal that previous evaluation approaches fall short of capturing real-world complexities for zero-shot EL, highlighting the necessity for new approaches to design and assess conversational EL models to adapt to limited resources. The evaluation setup and the dataset proposed in this research are made publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01152v1,2024-09
Pre-Trained Language Models for Keyphrase Prediction: A Review,"Muhammad Umair, Tangina Sultana, Young-Koo Lee","Keyphrase Prediction (KP) is essential for identifying keyphrases in a document that can summarize its content. However, recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) advances have developed more efficient KP models using deep learning techniques. The limitation of a comprehensive exploration jointly both keyphrase extraction and generation using pre-trained language models spotlights a critical gap in the literature, compelling our survey paper to bridge this deficiency and offer a unified and in-depth analysis to address limitations in previous surveys. This paper extensively examines the topic of pre-trained language models for keyphrase prediction (PLM-KP), which are trained on large text corpora via different learning (supervisor, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised) techniques, to provide respective insights into these two types of tasks in NLP, precisely, Keyphrase Extraction (KPE) and Keyphrase Generation (KPG). We introduce appropriate taxonomies for PLM-KPE and KPG to highlight these two main tasks of NLP. Moreover, we point out some promising future directions for predicting keyphrases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01087v1,2024-09
SCOPE: Sign Language Contextual Processing with Embedding from LLMs,"Yuqi Liu, Wenqian Zhang, Sihan Ren, Chengyu Huang, Jingyi Yu, Lan Xu","Sign languages, used by around 70 million Deaf individuals globally, are visual languages that convey visual and contextual information. Current methods in vision-based sign language recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT) struggle with dialogue scenes due to limited dataset diversity and the neglect of contextually relevant information. To address these challenges, we introduce SCOPE (Sign language Contextual Processing with Embedding from LLMs), a novel context-aware vision-based SLR and SLT framework. For SLR, we utilize dialogue contexts through a multi-modal encoder to enhance gloss-level recognition. For subsequent SLT, we further fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) by incorporating prior conversational context. We also contribute a new sign language dataset that contains 72 hours of Chinese sign language videos in contextual dialogues across various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SCOPE framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, including Phoenix-2014T, CSL-Daily, and our SCOPE dataset. Moreover, surveys conducted with participants from the Deaf community further validate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach in real-world applications. Both our dataset and code will be open-sourced to facilitate further research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01073v1,2024-09
VideoLLaMB: Long-context Video Understanding with Recurrent Memory Bridges,"Yuxuan Wang, Cihang Xie, Yang Liu, Zilong Zheng","Recent advancements in large-scale video-language models have shown significant potential for real-time planning and detailed interactions. However, their high computational demands and the scarcity of annotated datasets limit their practicality for academic researchers. In this work, we introduce VideoLLaMB, a novel framework that utilizes temporal memory tokens within bridge layers to allow for the encoding of entire video sequences alongside historical visual data, effectively preserving semantic continuity and enhancing model performance across various tasks. This approach includes recurrent memory tokens and a SceneTilling algorithm, which segments videos into independent semantic units to preserve semantic integrity. Empirically, VideoLLaMB significantly outstrips existing video-language models, demonstrating a 5.5 points improvement over its competitors across three VideoQA benchmarks, and 2.06 points on egocentric planning. Comprehensive results on the MVBench show that VideoLLaMB-7B achieves markedly better results than previous 7B models of same LLM. Remarkably, it maintains robust performance as PLLaVA even as video length increases up to 8 times. Besides, the frame retrieval results on our specialized Needle in a Video Haystack (NIAVH) benchmark, further validate VideoLLaMB's prowess in accurately identifying specific frames within lengthy videos. Our SceneTilling algorithm also enables the generation of streaming video captions directly, without necessitating additional training. In terms of efficiency, VideoLLaMB, trained on 16 frames, supports up to 320 frames on a single Nvidia A100 GPU with linear GPU memory scaling, ensuring both high performance and cost-effectiveness, thereby setting a new foundation for long-form video-language models in both academic and practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01071v1,2024-09
Agentic Society: Merging skeleton from real world and texture from Large Language Model,"Yuqi Bai, Kun Sun, Huishi Yin","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and agent technologies offer promising solutions to the simulation of social science experiments, but the availability of data of real-world population required by many of them still poses as a major challenge. This paper explores a novel framework that leverages census data and LLMs to generate virtual populations, significantly reducing resource requirements and bypassing privacy compliance issues associated with real-world data, while keeping a statistical truthfulness. Drawing on real-world census data, our approach first generates a persona that reflects demographic characteristics of the population. We then employ LLMs to enrich these personas with intricate details, using techniques akin to those in image generative models but applied to textual data. Additionally, we propose a framework for the evaluation of the feasibility of our method with respect to capability of LLMs based on personality trait tests, specifically the Big Five model, which also enhances the depth and realism of the generated personas. Through preliminary experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our method produces personas with variability essential for simulating diverse human behaviors in social science experiments. But the evaluation result shows that only weak sign of statistical truthfulness can be produced due to limited capability of current LLMs. Insights from our study also highlight the tension within LLMs between aligning with human values and reflecting real-world complexities.

A Perspective on Literary Metaphor in the Context of Generative AI,"Imke van Heerden, Anil Bas","At the intersection of creative text generation and literary theory, this study explores the role of literary metaphor and its capacity to generate a range of meanings. In this regard, literary metaphor is vital to the development of any particular language. To investigate whether the inclusion of original figurative language improves textual quality, we trained an LSTM-based language model in Afrikaans. The network produces phrases containing compellingly novel figures of speech. Specifically, the emphasis falls on how AI might be utilised as a defamiliarisation technique, which disrupts expected uses of language to augment poetic expression. Providing a literary perspective on text generation, the paper raises thought-provoking questions on aesthetic value, interpretation and evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01053v1,2024-09
NYK-MS: A Well-annotated Multi-modal Metaphor and Sarcasm Understanding Benchmark on Cartoon-Caption Dataset,"Ke Chang, Hao Li, Junzhao Zhang, Yunfang Wu","Metaphor and sarcasm are common figurative expressions in people's communication, especially on the Internet or the memes popular among teenagers. We create a new benchmark named NYK-MS (NewYorKer for Metaphor and Sarcasm), which contains 1,583 samples for metaphor understanding tasks and 1,578 samples for sarcasm understanding tasks. These tasks include whether it contains metaphor/sarcasm, which word or object contains metaphor/sarcasm, what does it satirize and why does it contains metaphor/sarcasm, all of the 7 tasks are well-annotated by at least 3 annotators. We annotate the dataset for several rounds to improve the consistency and quality, and use GUI and GPT-4V to raise our efficiency. Based on the benchmark, we conduct plenty of experiments. In the zero-shot experiments, we show that Large Language Models (LLM) and Large Multi-modal Models (LMM) can't do classification task well, and as the scale increases, the performance on other 5 tasks improves. In the experiments on traditional pre-train models, we show the enhancement with augment and alignment methods, which prove our benchmark is consistent with previous dataset and requires the model to understand both of the two modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01037v1,2024-09
Unleashing the Power of Task-Specific Directions in Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning,"Chongjie Si, Zhiyi Shi, Shifan Zhang, Xiaokang Yang, Hanspeter Pfister, Wei Shen","Large language models demonstrate impressive performance on downstream tasks, yet requiring extensive resource consumption when fully fine-tuning all parameters. To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions (TSDs)-critical for transitioning large models from pretrained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties, and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of TSDs during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Extensive experiments have conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of LoRA-Dash, and in-depth analyses further reveal the underlying mechanisms of LoRA-Dash.

Multi-Modal Multi-Granularity Tokenizer for Chu Bamboo Slip Scripts,"Yingfa Chen, Chenlong Hu, Cong Feng, Chenyang Song, Shi Yu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","This study presents a multi-modal multi-granularity tokenizer specifically designed for analyzing ancient Chinese scripts, focusing on the Chu bamboo slip (CBS) script used during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period (771-256 BCE) in Ancient China. Considering the complex hierarchical structure of ancient Chinese scripts, where a single character may be a combination of multiple sub-characters, our tokenizer first adopts character detection to locate character boundaries, and then conducts character recognition at both the character and sub-character levels. Moreover, to support the academic community, we have also assembled the first large-scale dataset of CBSs with over 100K annotated character image scans. On the part-of-speech tagging task built on our dataset, using our tokenizer gives a 5.5% relative improvement in F1-score compared to mainstream sub-word tokenizers.

DataSculpt: Crafting Data Landscapes for Long-Context LLMs through Multi-Objective Partitioning,"Keer Lu, Xiaonan Nie, Zheng Liang, Da Pan, Shusen Zhang, Keshi Zhao, Weipeng Chen, Zenan Zhou, Guosheng Dong, Bin Cui, Wentao Zhang","In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements across a variety of tasks, one of which is the long-context capability. The key to improving long-context performance lies in effective data organization and management strategies that integrate data from multiple domains and optimize the context window during training. Through extensive experimental analysis, we identified three key challenges in designing effective data management strategies that enable the model to achieve long-context capability without sacrificing performance in other tasks: (1) a shortage of long documents across multiple domains, (2) effective construction of context windows, and (3) efficient organization of large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce DataSculpt, a novel data management framework designed for long-context training. We first formulate the organization of training data as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem, focusing on attributes including relevance, homogeneity, integrity, and efficiency. Specifically, our approach utilizes a coarse-to-fine methodology to optimize training data organization both efficiently and effectively. We begin by clustering the data based on semantic similarity (coarse), followed by a multi-objective greedy search within each cluster to score and concatenate documents into various context windows (fine). Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DataSculpt significantly enhances long-context training performance, resulting in improvements of 18.09% in retrieval augmentation, 21.23% in summarization, 21.27% in reading comprehension, and a 3.81% increase in code completion, while also maintaining overall model proficiency with a 4.88% improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00997v2,2024-09
Personalized Lip Reading: Adapting to Your Unique Lip Movements with Vision and Language,"Jeong Hun Yeo, Chae Won Kim, Hyunjun Kim, Hyeongseop Rha, Seunghee Han, Wen-Huang Cheng, Yong Man Ro","Lip reading aims to predict spoken language by analyzing lip movements. Despite advancements in lip reading technologies, performance degrades when models are applied to unseen speakers due to their sensitivity to variations in visual information such as lip appearances. To address this challenge, speaker adaptive lip reading technologies have advanced by focusing on effectively adapting a lip reading model to target speakers in the visual modality. However, the effectiveness of adapting language information, such as vocabulary choice, of the target speaker has not been explored in previous works. Additionally, existing datasets for speaker adaptation have limited vocabulary sizes and pose variations, which restrict the validation of previous speaker-adaptive methods in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel speaker-adaptive lip reading method that adapts a pre-trained model to target speakers at both vision and language levels. Specifically, we integrate prompt tuning and the LoRA approach, applying them to a pre-trained lip reading model to effectively adapt the model to target speakers. Furthermore, to validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, we introduce a new dataset, VoxLRS-SA, derived from VoxCeleb2 and LRS3. It contains a vocabulary of approximately 100K words, offers diverse pose variations, and enables the validation of adaptation methods in the wild, sentence-level lip reading for the first time in English. Through various experiments, we demonstrate that the existing speaker-adaptive method also improves performance in the wild at the sentence level. Moreover, we show that the proposed method achieves larger improvements compared to the previous works.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00986v2,2024-09

Large Language Models for Automatic Detection of Sensitive Topics,"Ruoyu Wen, Stephanie Elena Crowe, Kunal Gupta, Xinyue Li, Mark Billinghurst, Simon Hoermann, Dwain Allan, Alaeddin Nassani, Thammathip Piumsomboon","Sensitive information detection is crucial in content moderation to maintain safe online communities. Assisting in this traditionally manual process could relieve human moderators from overwhelming and tedious tasks, allowing them to focus solely on flagged content that may pose potential risks. Rapidly advancing large language models (LLMs) are known for their capability to understand and process natural language and so present a potential solution to support this process. This study explores the capabilities of five LLMs for detecting sensitive messages in the mental well-being domain within two online datasets and assesses their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores, and consistency. Our findings indicate that LLMs have the potential to be integrated into the moderation workflow as a convenient and precise detection tool. The best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieved an average accuracy of 99.5\% and an F1-score of 0.99.

Self-Judge: Selective Instruction Following with Alignment Self-Evaluation,"Hai Ye, Hwee Tou Ng","Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) can be tailored to adhere to human instructions through instruction tuning. However, due to shifts in the distribution of test-time data, they may not always execute instructions accurately, potentially generating factual errors or misaligned content when acting as chat assistants. To enhance the reliability of LLMs in following instructions, we propose the study of selective instruction following, whereby the system declines to execute instructions if the anticipated response quality is low. We train judge models that can predict numerical quality scores for model responses. To address data scarcity, we introduce Self-J, a novel self-training framework for developing judge models without needing human-annotated quality scores. Our method leverages the model's inherent self-evaluation capability to extract information about response quality from labeled instruction-tuning data. It incorporates a gold reference answer to facilitate self-evaluation and recalibrates by assessing the semantic similarity between the response sample and the gold reference. During the training phase, we implement self-distillation as a regularization technique to enhance the capability of reference-free estimation. To validate alignment evaluation on general instruction-following tasks, we collect large-scale high-quality instructions from Hugging Face for model training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on five open-source models show that our method correlates much more with GPT-4 than strong baselines, e.g., supervised models distilled from GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo. Our analysis shows our model's strong generalization across domains. Additionally, our judge models serve as good reward models, e.g., boosting WizardLM-13B-V1.2 from 89.17 to 92.48 and from 12.03 to 15.90 in version v1 and v2 of AlpacaEval respectively using best-of-32 sampling with our judge models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00935v1,2024-09

User-Specific Dialogue Generation with User Profile-Aware Pre-Training Model and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning,"Atsushi Otsuka, Kazuya Matsuo, Ryo Ishii, Narichika Nomoto, Hiroaki Sugiyama","This paper addresses user-specific dialogs. In contrast to previous research on personalized dialogue focused on achieving virtual user dialogue as defined by persona descriptions, user-specific dialogue aims to reproduce real-user dialogue beyond persona-based dialogue. Fine-tuning using the target user's dialogue history is an efficient learning method for a user-specific model. However, it is prone to overfitting and model destruction due to the small amount of data. Therefore, we propose a learning method for user-specific models by combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with a pre-trained dialogue model that includes user profiles. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning adds a small number of parameters to the entire model, so even small amounts of training data can be trained efficiently and are robust to model destruction. In addition, the pre-trained model, which is learned by adding simple prompts for automatically inferred user profiles, can generate speech with enhanced knowledge of the user's profile, even when there is little training data during fine-tuning. In experiments, we compared the proposed model with large-language-model utterance generation using prompts containing users' personal information. Experiments reproducing real users' utterances revealed that the proposed model can generate utterances with higher reproducibility than the compared methods, even with a small model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00887v1,2024-09

Harnessing the Power of Semi-Structured Knowledge and LLMs with Triplet-Based Prefiltering for Question Answering,"Derian Boer, Fabian Koch, Stefan Kramer","Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently lack domain-specific knowledge and even fine-tuned models tend to hallucinate. Hence, more reliable models that can include external knowledge are needed. We present a pipeline, 4StepFocus, and specifically a preprocessing step, that can substantially improve the answers of LLMs. This is achieved by providing guided access to external knowledge making use of the model's ability to capture relational context and conduct rudimentary reasoning by themselves. The method narrows down potentially correct answers by triplets-based searches in a semi-structured knowledge base in a direct, traceable fashion, before switching to latent representations for ranking those candidates based on unstructured data. This distinguishes it from related methods that are purely based on latent representations. 4StepFocus consists of the steps: 1) Triplet generation for extraction of relational data by an LLM, 2) substitution of variables in those triplets to narrow down answer candidates employing a knowledge graph, 3) sorting remaining candidates with a vector similarity search involving associated non-structured data, 4) reranking the best candidates by the LLM with background data provided. Experiments on a medical, a product recommendation, and an academic paper search test set demonstrate that this approach is indeed a powerful augmentation. It not only adds relevant traceable background information from information retrieval, but also improves performance considerably in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. This paper presents a novel, largely unexplored direction and therefore provides a wide range of future work opportunities.

These languages are designed to be accessible to users with limited coding experience, allowing them to achieve creative output without an extensive programming background. Using LLM-based code generation to further lower the barrier to creative output is an exciting opportunity. However, the best strategy for code generation for visual node-based programming languages is still an open question. In particular, such languages have multiple levels of representation in text, each of which may be used for code generation. In this work, we explore the performance of LLM code generation in audio programming tasks in visual programming languages at multiple levels of representation. We explore code generation through metaprogramming code representations for these languages (i.e., coding the language using a different high-level text-based programming language), as well as through direct node generation with JSON. We evaluate code generated in this way for two visual languages for audio programming on a benchmark set of coding problems. We measure both correctness and complexity of the generated code. We find that metaprogramming results in more semantically correct generated code, given that the code is well-formed (i.e., is syntactically correct and runs). We also find that prompting for richer metaprogramming using randomness and loops led to more complex code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00856v1,2024-09
LanguaShrink: Reducing Token Overhead with Psycholinguistics,"Xuechen Liang, Meiling Tao, Yinghui Xia, Tianyu Shi, Jun Wang, JingSong Yang","As large language models (LLMs) improve their capabilities in handling complex tasks, the issues of computational cost and efficiency due to long prompts are becoming increasingly prominent. To accelerate model inference and reduce costs, we propose an innovative prompt compression framework called LanguaShrink. Inspired by the observation that LLM performance depends on the density and position of key information in the input prompts, LanguaShrink leverages psycholinguistic principles and the Ebbinghaus memory curve to achieve task-agnostic prompt compression. This effectively reduces prompt length while preserving essential information. We referred to the training method of OpenChat.The framework introduces part-of-speech priority compression and data distillation techniques, using smaller models to learn compression targets and employing a KL-regularized reinforcement learning strategy for training.\cite{wang2023openchat} Additionally, we adopt a chunk-based compression algorithm to achieve adjustable compression rates. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, including LongBench, ZeroScrolls, Arxiv Articles, and a newly constructed novel test set.

Modeling Text-Label Alignment for Hierarchical Text Classification,"Ashish Kumar, Durga Toshniwal","Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to categorize text data based on a structured label hierarchy, resulting in predicted labels forming a sub-hierarchy tree. The semantics of the text should align with the semantics of the labels in this sub-hierarchy. With the sub-hierarchy changing for each sample, the dynamic nature of text-label alignment poses challenges for existing methods, which typically process text and labels independently. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Text-Label Alignment (TLA) loss specifically designed to model the alignment between text and labels. We obtain a set of negative labels for a given text and its positive label set. By leveraging contrastive learning, the TLA loss pulls the text closer to its positive label and pushes it away from its negative label in the embedding space. This process aligns text representations with related labels while distancing them from unrelated ones. Building upon this framework, we introduce the Hierarchical Text-Label Alignment (HTLA) model, which leverages BERT as the text encoder and GPTrans as the graph encoder and integrates text-label embeddings to generate hierarchy-aware representations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and comparison with existing baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of HTLA for HTC.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00788v1,2024-09
The Dark Side of Human Feedback: Poisoning Large Language Models via User Inputs,"Bocheng Chen, Hanqing Guo, Guangjing Wang, Yuanda Wang, Qiben Yan","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, largely attributed to the intricate alignment process using human feedback. While alignment has become an essential training component that leverages data collected from user queries, it inadvertently opens up an avenue for a new type of user-guided poisoning attacks. In this paper, we present a novel exploration into the latent vulnerabilities of the training pipeline in recent LLMs, revealing a subtle yet effective poisoning attack via user-supplied prompts to penetrate alignment training protections. Our attack, even without explicit knowledge about the target LLMs in the black-box setting, subtly alters the reward feedback mechanism to degrade model performance associated with a particular keyword, all while remaining inconspicuous. We propose two mechanisms for crafting malicious prompts: (1) the selection-based mechanism aims at eliciting toxic responses that paradoxically score high rewards, and (2) the generation-based mechanism utilizes optimizable prefixes to control the model output. By injecting 1\% of these specially crafted prompts into the data, through malicious users, we demonstrate a toxicity score up to two times higher when a specific trigger word is used. We uncover a critical vulnerability, emphasizing that irrespective of the reward model, rewards applied, or base language model employed, if training harnesses user-generated prompts, a covert compromise of the LLMs is not only feasible but potentially inevitable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00787v1,2024-09
Generating Media Background Checks for Automated Source Critical Reasoning,Michael Schlichtkrull,"Not everything on the internet is true. This unfortunate fact requires both humans and models to perform complex reasoning about credibility when working with retrieved information. In NLP, this problem has seen little attention. Indeed, retrieval-augmented models are not typically expected to distrust retrieved documents. Human experts overcome the challenge by gathering signals about the context, reliability, and tendency of source documents - that is, they perform source criticism. We propose a novel NLP task focused on finding and summarising such signals. We introduce a new dataset of 6,709 ""media background checks"" derived from Media Bias / Fact Check, a volunteer-run website documenting media bias. We test open-source and closed-source LLM baselines with and without retrieval on this dataset, finding that retrieval greatly improves performance. We furthermore carry out human evaluation, demonstrating that 1) media background checks are helpful for humans, and 2) media background checks are helpful for retrieval-augmented models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00781v1,2024-09
ContextCite: Attributing Model Generation to Context,"Benjamin Cohen-Wang, Harshay Shah, Kristian Georgiev, Aleksander Madry","How do language models use information provided as context when generating a response? Can we infer whether a particular generated statement is actually grounded in the context, a misinterpretation, or fabricated? To help answer these questions, we introduce the problem of context attribution: pinpointing the parts of the context (if any) that led a model to generate a particular statement. We then present ContextCite, a simple and scalable method for context attribution that can be applied on top of any existing language model. Finally, we showcase the utility of ContextCite through three applications: (1) helping verify generated statements (2) improving response quality by pruning the context and (3) detecting poisoning attacks. We provide code for ContextCite at https://github.com/MadryLab/context-cite.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00729v2,2024-09
Hound: Hunting Supervision Signals for Few and Zero Shot Node Classification on Text-attributed Graph,"Yuxiang Wang, Xiao Yan, Shiyu Jin, Quanqing Xu, Chuanhui Yang, Yuanyuan Zhu, Chuang Hu, Bo Du, Jiawei Jiang","Text-attributed graph (TAG) is an important type of graph structured data with text descriptions for each node. Few- and zero-shot node classification on TAGs have many applications in fields such as academia and social networks. However, the two tasks are challenging due to the lack of supervision signals, and existing methods only use the contrastive loss to align graph-based node embedding and language-based text embedding. In this paper, we propose Hound to improve accuracy by introducing more supervision signals, and the core idea is to go beyond the node-text pairs that come with data. Specifically, we design three augmentation techniques, i.e., node perturbation, text matching, and semantics negation to provide more reference nodes for each text and vice versa. Node perturbation adds/drops edges to produce diversified node embeddings that can be matched with a text. Text matching retrieves texts with similar embeddings to match with a node. Semantics negation uses a negative prompt to construct a negative text with the opposite semantics, which is contrasted with the original node and text. We evaluate Hound on 5 datasets and compare with 13 state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that Hound consistently outperforms all baselines, and its accuracy improvements over the best-performing baseline are usually over 5%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00727v1,2024-09
Who Would Chatbots Vote For? Political Preferences of ChatGPT and Gemini in the 2024 European Union Elections,"Michael Haman, Milan Školník","This study examines the political bias of chatbots powered by large language models, namely ChatGPT and Gemini, in the context of the 2024 European Parliament elections. The research focused on the evaluation of political parties represented in the European Parliament across 27 EU Member States by these generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The methodology involved daily data collection through standardized prompts on both platforms. The results revealed a stark contrast: while Gemini mostly refused to answer political questions, ChatGPT provided consistent ratings. The analysis showed a significant bias in ChatGPT in favor of left-wing and centrist parties, with the highest ratings for the Greens/European Free Alliance. In contrast, right-wing parties, particularly the Identity and Democracy group, received the lowest ratings. The study identified key factors influencing the ratings, including attitudes toward European integration and perceptions of democratic values. The findings highlight the need for a critical approach to information provided by generative AI systems in a political context and call for more transparency and regulation in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00721v1,2024-09
SAM4MLLM: Enhance Multi-Modal Large Language Model for Referring Expression Segmentation,"Yi-Chia Chen, Wei-Hua Li, Cheng Sun, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Chu-Song Chen","We introduce SAM4MLLM, an innovative approach which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for pixel-aware tasks. Our method enables MLLMs to learn pixel-level location information without requiring excessive modifications to the existing model architecture or adding specialized tokens. We introduce an inquiry-based approach that can effectively find prompt points for SAM to perform segmentation based on MLLM. It combines detailed visual information with the powerful expressive capabilities of large language models in a unified language-based manner without additional computational overhead in learning. Experimental results on pubic benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10542v3,2024-09
Polyrating: A Cost-Effective and Bias-Aware Rating System for LLM Evaluation,"Jasper Dekoninck, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev","Rating-based human evaluation has become an essential tool to accurately evaluate the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs). However, current rating systems suffer from several important limitations: first, they fail to account for biases that significantly influence evaluation results, second, they require large and expensive preference datasets to obtain accurate ratings, and third, they do not facilitate meaningful comparisons of model ratings across different tasks. To address these issues, we introduce Polyrating, an expressive and flexible rating system based on maximum a posteriori estimation that enables a more nuanced and thorough analysis of model performance at lower costs. Polyrating can detect and quantify biases affecting human preferences, ensuring fairer model comparisons. Further, Polyrating can reduce the cost of human evaluations by up to $41\%$ for new models and up to $77\%$ for new tasks by leveraging existing benchmark scores. Lastly, Polyrating enables direct comparisons of ratings across different tasks, providing a comprehensive understanding of an LLMs' strengths, weaknesses, and relative performance across different applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00696v2,2024-09
Deep Knowledge-Infusion For Explainable Depression Detection,"Sumit Dalal, Sarika Jain, Mayank Dave","Discovering individuals depression on social media has become increasingly important. Researchers employed ML/DL or lexicon-based methods for automated depression detection. Lexicon based methods, explainable and easy to implement, match words from user posts in a depression dictionary without considering contexts. While the DL models can leverage contextual information, their black-box nature limits their adoption in the domain. Though surrogate models like LIME and SHAP can produce explanations for DL models, the explanations are suitable for the developer and of limited use to the end user. We propose a Knolwedge-infused Neural Network (KiNN) incorporating domain-specific knowledge from DepressionFeature ontology (DFO) in a neural network to endow the model with user-level explainability regarding concepts and processes the clinician understands. Further, commonsense knowledge from the Commonsense Transformer (COMET) trained on ATOMIC is also infused to consider the generic emotional aspects of user posts in depression detection. The model is evaluated on three expertly curated datasets related to depression. We observed the model to have a statistically significant (p<0.1) boost in performance over the best domain-specific model, MentalBERT, across CLEF e-Risk (25% MCC increase, 12% F1 increase). A similar trend is observed across the PRIMATE dataset, where the proposed model performed better than MentalBERT (2.5% MCC increase, 19% F1 increase). The observations confirm the generated explanations to be informative for MHPs compared to post hoc model explanations. Results demonstrated that the user-level explainability of KiNN also surpasses the performance of baseline models and can provide explanations where other baselines fall short. Infusing the domain and commonsense knowledge in KiNN enhances the ability of models like GPT-3.5 to generate application-relevant explanations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02122v1,2024-09
Correcting FLORES Evaluation Dataset for Four African Languages,"Idris Abdulmumin, Sthembiso Mkhwanazi, Mahlatse S. Mbooi, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad, Ibrahim Said Ahmad, Neo Putini, Miehleketo Mathebula, Matimba Shingange, Tajuddeen Gwadabe, Vukosi Marivate","This paper describes the corrections made to the FLORES evaluation (dev and devtest) dataset for four African languages, namely Hausa, Northern Sotho (Sepedi), Xitsonga, and isiZulu. The original dataset, though groundbreaking in its coverage of low-resource languages, exhibited various inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the reviewed languages that could potentially hinder the integrity of the evaluation of downstream tasks in natural language processing (NLP), especially machine translation. Through a meticulous review process by native speakers, several corrections were identified and implemented, improving the overall quality and reliability of the dataset. For each language, we provide a concise summary of the errors encountered and corrected and also present some statistical analysis that measures the difference between the existing and corrected datasets. We believe that our corrections improve the linguistic accuracy and reliability of the data and, thereby, contribute to a more effective evaluation of NLP tasks involving the four African languages. Finally, we recommend that future translation efforts, particularly in low-resource languages, prioritize the active involvement of native speakers at every stage of the process to ensure linguistic accuracy and cultural relevance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00626v2,2024-09
Entity-Aware Biaffine Attention Model for Improved Constituent Parsing with Reduced Entity Violations,Xinyi Bai,"Constituency parsing involves analyzing a sentence by breaking it into sub-phrases, or constituents. While many deep neural models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this task, they often overlook the entity-violating issue, where an entity fails to form a complete sub-tree in the resultant parsing tree. To address this, we propose an entity-aware biaffine attention model for constituent parsing. This model incorporates entity information into the biaffine attention mechanism by using additional entity role vectors for potential phrases, which enhances the parsing accuracy. We introduce a new metric, the Entity Violating Rate (EVR), to quantify the extent of entity violations in parsing results. Experiments on three popular datasets-ONTONOTES, PTB, and CTB-demonstrate that our model achieves the lowest EVR while maintaining high precision, recall, and F1-scores comparable to existing models. Further evaluation in downstream tasks, such as sentence sentiment analysis, highlights the effectiveness of our model and the validity of the proposed EVR metric.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00625v2,2024-09
Does Knowledge Localization Hold True? Surprising Differences Between Entity and Relation Perspectives in Language Models,"Yifan Wei, Xiaoyan Yu, Yixuan Weng, Huanhuan Ma, Yuanzhe Zhang, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu","Large language models encapsulate knowledge and have demonstrated superior performance on various natural language processing tasks. Recent studies have localized this knowledge to specific model parameters, such as the MLP weights in intermediate layers. This study investigates the differences between entity and relational knowledge through knowledge editing. Our findings reveal that entity and relational knowledge cannot be directly transferred or mapped to each other. This result is unexpected, as logically, modifying the entity or the relation within the same knowledge triplet should yield equivalent outcomes. To further elucidate the differences between entity and relational knowledge, we employ causal analysis to investigate how relational knowledge is stored in pre-trained models. Contrary to prior research suggesting that knowledge is stored in MLP weights, our experiments demonstrate that relational knowledge is also significantly encoded in attention modules. This insight highlights the multifaceted nature of knowledge storage in language models, underscoring the complexity of manipulating specific types of knowledge within these models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00617v1,2024-09
DAMe: Personalized Federated Social Event Detection with Dual Aggregation Mechanism,"Xiaoyan Yu, Yifan Wei, Pu Li, Shuaishuai Zhou, Hao Peng, Li Sun, Liehuang Zhu, Philip S. Yu","Training social event detection models through federated learning (FedSED) aims to improve participants' performance on the task. However, existing federated learning paradigms are inadequate for achieving FedSED's objective and exhibit limitations in handling the inherent heterogeneity in social data. This paper proposes a personalized federated learning framework with a dual aggregation mechanism for social event detection, namely DAMe. We present a novel local aggregation strategy utilizing Bayesian optimization to incorporate global knowledge while retaining local characteristics. Moreover, we introduce a global aggregation strategy to provide clients with maximum external knowledge of their preferences. In addition, we incorporate a global-local event-centric constraint to prevent local overfitting and ``client-drift''. Experiments within a realistic simulation of a natural federated setting, utilizing six social event datasets spanning six languages and two social media platforms, along with an ablation study, have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further robustness analyses have shown that DAMe is resistant to injection attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00614v1,2024-09
TinyAgent: Function Calling at the Edge,"Lutfi Eren Erdogan, Nicholas Lee, Siddharth Jha, Sehoon Kim, Ryan Tabrizi, Suhong Moon, Coleman Hooper, Gopala Anumanchipalli, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami","Recent large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of advanced agentic systems that can integrate various tools and APIs to fulfill user queries through function calling. However, the deployment of these LLMs on the edge has not been explored since they typically require cloud-based infrastructure due to their substantial model size and computational demands. To this end, we present TinyAgent, an end-to-end framework for training and deploying task-specific small language model agents capable of function calling for driving agentic systems at the edge. We first show how to enable accurate function calling for open-source models via the LLMCompiler framework. We then systematically curate a high-quality dataset for function calling, which we use to fine-tune two small language models, TinyAgent-1.1B and 7B. For efficient inference, we introduce a novel tool retrieval method to reduce the input prompt length and utilize quantization to further accelerate the inference speed. As a driving application, we demonstrate a local Siri-like system for Apple's MacBook that can execute user commands through text or voice input. Our results show that our models can achieve, and even surpass, the function-calling capabilities of larger models like GPT-4-Turbo, while being fully deployed at the edge. We open-source our dataset, models, and installable package and provide a demo video for our MacBook assistant agent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00608v3,2024-09
Automatic Pseudo-Harmful Prompt Generation for Evaluating False Refusals in Large Language Models,"Bang An, Sicheng Zhu, Ruiyi Zhang, Michael-Andrei Panaitescu-Liess, Yuancheng Xu, Furong Huang","Safety-aligned large language models (LLMs) sometimes falsely refuse pseudo-harmful prompts, like ""how to kill a mosquito,"" which are actually harmless. Frequent false refusals not only frustrate users but also provoke a public backlash against the very values alignment seeks to protect. In this paper, we propose the first method to auto-generate diverse, content-controlled, and model-dependent pseudo-harmful prompts. Using this method, we construct an evaluation dataset called PHTest, which is ten times larger than existing datasets, covers more false refusal patterns, and separately labels controversial prompts. We evaluate 20 LLMs on PHTest, uncovering new insights due to its scale and labeling. Our findings reveal a trade-off between minimizing false refusals and improving safety against jailbreak attacks. Moreover, we show that many jailbreak defenses significantly increase the false refusal rates, thereby undermining usability. Our method and dataset can help developers evaluate and fine-tune safer and more usable LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/umd-huang-lab/FalseRefusal",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00598v1,2024-09
Multimodal Multi-turn Conversation Stance Detection: A Challenge Dataset and Effective Model,"Fuqiang Niu, Zebang Cheng, Xianghua Fu, Xiaojiang Peng, Genan Dai, Yin Chen, Hu Huang, Bowen Zhang","Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the proliferation of diverse multimodal social media content including text, and images multimodal stance detection (MSD) has become a crucial research area. However, existing MSD studies have focused on modeling stance within individual text-image pairs, overlooking the multi-party conversational contexts that naturally occur on social media. This limitation stems from a lack of datasets that authentically capture such conversational scenarios, hindering progress in conversational MSD. To address this, we introduce a new multimodal multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset (called MmMtCSD). To derive stances from this challenging dataset, we propose a novel multimodal large language model stance detection framework (MLLM-SD), that learns joint stance representations from textual and visual modalities. Experiments on MmMtCSD show state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MLLM-SD approach for multimodal stance detection. We believe that MmMtCSD will contribute to advancing real-world applications of stance detection research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00597v1,2024-09
