Arrows of Time for Large Language Models,"Vassilis Papadopoulos, Jérémie Wenger, Clément Hongler","We study the probabilistic modeling performed by Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) through the angle of time directionality, addressing a question first raised in (Shannon, 1951). For large enough models, we empirically find a time asymmetry in their ability to learn natural language: a difference in the average log-perplexity when trying to predict the next token versus when trying to predict the previous one. This difference is at the same time subtle and very consistent across various modalities (language, model size, training time, ...). Theoretically, this is surprising: from an information-theoretic point of view, there should be no such difference. We provide a theoretical framework to explain how such an asymmetry can appear from sparsity and computational complexity considerations, and outline a number of perspectives opened by our results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17505v4,2024-01
When Large Language Models Meet Vector Databases: A Survey,"Zhi Jing, Yongye Su, Yikun Han","This survey explores the synergistic potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vector Databases (VecDBs), a burgeoning but rapidly evolving research area. With the proliferation of LLMs comes a host of challenges, including hallucinations, outdated knowledge, prohibitive commercial application costs, and memory issues. VecDBs emerge as a compelling solution to these issues by offering an efficient means to store, retrieve, and manage the high-dimensional vector representations intrinsic to LLM operations. Through this nuanced review, we delineate the foundational principles of LLMs and VecDBs and critically analyze their integration's impact on enhancing LLM functionalities. This discourse extends into a discussion on the speculative future developments in this domain, aiming to catalyze further research into optimizing the confluence of LLMs and VecDBs for advanced data handling and knowledge extraction capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01763v3,2024-01
Improving QA Model Performance with Cartographic Inoculation,"Allen Chen, Okan Tanrikulu","QA models are faced with complex and open-ended contextual reasoning problems, but can often learn well-performing solution heuristics by exploiting dataset-specific patterns in their training data. These patterns, or ""dataset artifacts"", reduce the model's ability to generalize to real-world QA problems. Utilizing an ElectraSmallDiscriminator model trained for QA, we analyze the impacts and incidence of dataset artifacts using an adversarial challenge set designed to confuse models reliant on artifacts for prediction. Extending existing work on methods for mitigating artifact impacts, we propose cartographic inoculation, a novel method that fine-tunes models on an optimized subset of the challenge data to reduce model reliance on dataset artifacts. We show that by selectively fine-tuning a model on ambiguous adversarial examples from a challenge set, significant performance improvements can be made on the full challenge dataset with minimal loss of model generalizability to other challenging environments and QA datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17498v2,2024-01
Detecting mental disorder on social media: a ChatGPT-augmented explainable approach,"Loris Belcastro, Riccardo Cantini, Fabrizio Marozzo, Domenico Talia, Paolo Trunfio","In the digital era, the prevalence of depressive symptoms expressed on social media has raised serious concerns, necessitating advanced methodologies for timely detection. This paper addresses the challenge of interpretable depression detection by proposing a novel methodology that effectively combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and conversational agents like ChatGPT. In our methodology, explanations are achieved by integrating BERTweet, a Twitter-specific variant of BERT, into a novel self-explanatory model, namely BERT-XDD, capable of providing both classification and explanations via masked attention. The interpretability is further enhanced using ChatGPT to transform technical explanations into human-readable commentaries. By introducing an effective and modular approach for interpretable depression detection, our methodology can contribute to the development of socially responsible digital platforms, fostering early intervention and support for mental health challenges under the guidance of qualified healthcare professionals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17477v1,2024-01
D-Nikud: Enhancing Hebrew Diacritization with LSTM and Pretrained Models,"Adi Rosenthal, Nadav Shaked","D-Nikud, a novel approach to Hebrew diacritization that integrates the strengths of LSTM networks and BERT-based (transformer) pre-trained model. Inspired by the methodologies employed in Nakdimon, we integrate it with the TavBERT pre-trained model, our system incorporates advanced architectural choices and diverse training data. Our experiments showcase state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, with a particular emphasis on modern texts and more specified diacritization like gender.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00075v1,2024-01
Efficient Tool Use with Chain-of-Abstraction Reasoning,"Silin Gao, Jane Dwivedi-Yu, Ping Yu, Xiaoqing Ellen Tan, Ramakanth Pasunuru, Olga Golovneva, Koustuv Sinha, Asli Celikyilmaz, Antoine Bosselut, Tianlu Wang","To achieve faithful reasoning that aligns with human expectations, large language models (LLMs) need to ground their reasoning to real-world knowledge (e.g., web facts, math and physical rules). Tools help LLMs access this external knowledge, but there remains challenges for fine-tuning LLM agents (e.g., Toolformer) to invoke tools in multi-step reasoning problems, where inter-connected tool calls require holistic and efficient tool usage planning.   In this work, we propose a new method for LLMs to better leverage tools in multi-step reasoning. Our method, Chain-of-Abstraction (CoA), trains LLMs to first decode reasoning chains with abstract placeholders, and then call domain tools to reify each reasoning chain by filling in specific knowledge. This planning with abstract chains enables LLMs to learn more general reasoning strategies, which are robust to shifts of domain knowledge (e.g., math results) relevant to different reasoning questions. It also allows LLMs to perform decoding and calling of external tools in parallel, which avoids the inference delay caused by waiting for tool responses. In mathematical reasoning and Wiki QA domains, we show that our method consistently outperforms previous chain-of-thought and tool-augmented baselines on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, with an average ~6% absolute QA accuracy improvement. LLM agents trained with our method also show more efficient tool use, with inference speed being on average ~1.4x faster than baseline tool-augmented LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17464v3,2024-01
Synthetic Dialogue Dataset Generation using LLM Agents,"Yelaman Abdullin, Diego Molla-Aliod, Bahadorreza Ofoghi, John Yearwood, Qingyang Li","Linear programming (LP) problems are pervasive in real-life applications. However, despite their apparent simplicity, an untrained user may find it difficult to determine the linear model of their specific problem. We envisage the creation of a goal-oriented conversational agent that will engage in conversation with the user to elicit all information required so that a subsequent agent can generate the linear model. In this paper, we present an approach for the generation of sample dialogues that can be used to develop and train such a conversational agent. Using prompt engineering, we develop two agents that ""talk"" to each other, one acting as the conversational agent, and the other acting as the user. Using a set of text descriptions of linear problems from NL4Opt available to the user only, the agent and the user engage in conversation until the agent has retrieved all key information from the original problem description. We also propose an extrinsic evaluation of the dialogues by assessing how well the summaries generated by the dialogues match the original problem descriptions. We conduct human and automatic evaluations, including an evaluation approach that uses GPT-4 to mimic the human evaluation metrics. The evaluation results show an overall good quality of the dialogues, though research is still needed to improve the quality of the GPT-4 evaluation metrics. The resulting dialogues, including the human annotations of a subset, are available to the research community. The conversational agent used for the generation of the dialogues can be used as a baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17461v1,2024-01
Can LLMs Replace Economic Choice Prediction Labs? The Case of Language-based Persuasion Games,"Eilam Shapira, Omer Madmon, Roi Reichart, Moshe Tennenholtz","Human choice prediction in economic contexts is crucial for applications in marketing, finance, public policy, and more. This task, however, is often constrained by the difficulties in acquiring human choice data. With most experimental economics studies focusing on simple choice settings, the AI community has explored whether LLMs can substitute for humans in these predictions and examined more complex experimental economics settings. However, a key question remains: can LLMs generate training data for human choice prediction? We explore this in language-based persuasion games, a complex economic setting involving natural language in strategic interactions. Our experiments show that models trained on LLM-generated data can effectively predict human behavior in these games and even outperform models trained on actual human data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17435v4,2024-01
EvoMerge: Neuroevolution for Large Language Models,Yushu Jiang,"Extensive fine-tuning on Large Language Models does not always yield better results. Oftentimes, models tend to get better at imitating one form of data without gaining greater reasoning ability and may even end up losing some intelligence. Here I introduce EvoMerge, a systematic approach to large language model training and merging. Leveraging model merging for weight crossover and fine-tuning for weight mutation, EvoMerge establishes an evolutionary process aimed at pushing models beyond the limits of conventional fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00070v1,2024-01
Fine-tuning Transformer-based Encoder for Turkish Language Understanding Tasks,Savas Yildirim,"Deep learning-based and lately Transformer-based language models have been dominating the studies of natural language processing in the last years. Thanks to their accurate and fast fine-tuning characteristics, they have outperformed traditional machine learning-based approaches and achieved state-of-the-art results for many challenging natural language understanding (NLU) problems. Recent studies showed that the Transformer-based models such as BERT, which is Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, have reached impressive achievements on many tasks. Moreover, thanks to their transfer learning capacity, these architectures allow us to transfer pre-built models and fine-tune them to specific NLU tasks such as question answering. In this study, we provide a Transformer-based model and a baseline benchmark for the Turkish Language. We successfully fine-tuned a Turkish BERT model, namely BERTurk that is trained with base settings, to many downstream tasks and evaluated with a the Turkish Benchmark dataset. We showed that our studies significantly outperformed other existing baseline approaches for Named-Entity Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Question Answering and Text Classification in Turkish Language. We publicly released these four fine-tuned models and resources in reproducibility and with the view of supporting other Turkish researchers and applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17396v1,2024-01
Customizing Language Model Responses with Contrastive In-Context Learning,"Xiang Gao, Kamalika Das","Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly important for machine learning applications. However, it can be challenging to align LLMs with our intent, particularly when we want to generate content that is preferable over others or when we want the LLM to respond in a certain style or tone that is hard to describe. To address this challenge, we propose an approach that uses contrastive examples to better describe our intent. This involves providing positive examples that illustrate the true intent, along with negative examples that show what characteristics we want LLMs to avoid. The negative examples can be retrieved from labeled data, written by a human, or generated by the LLM itself. Before generating an answer, we ask the model to analyze the examples to teach itself what to avoid. This reasoning step provides the model with the appropriate articulation of the user's need and guides it towards generting a better answer. We tested our approach on both synthesized and real-world datasets, including StackExchange and Reddit, and found that it significantly improves performance compared to standard few-shot prompting",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17390v2,2024-01
Infini-gram: Scaling Unbounded n-gram Language Models to a Trillion Tokens,"Jiacheng Liu, Sewon Min, Luke Zettlemoyer, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi","Are $n$-gram language models still relevant in this era of neural large language models (LLMs)? Our answer is yes, and we showcase their values in both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. This was done by modernizing $n$-gram LMs in two aspects. First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- 5 trillion tokens. This is the largest $n$-gram LM ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new $\infty$-gram LM with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with millisecond-level latency. The $\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine--$\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17377v3,2024-01
Arabic Tweet Act: A Weighted Ensemble Pre-Trained Transformer Model for Classifying Arabic Speech Acts on Twitter,"Khadejaa Alshehri, Areej Alhothali, Nahed Alowidi","Speech acts are a speakers actions when performing an utterance within a conversation, such as asking, recommending, greeting, or thanking someone, expressing a thought, or making a suggestion. Understanding speech acts helps interpret the intended meaning and actions behind a speakers or writers words. This paper proposes a Twitter dialectal Arabic speech act classification approach based on a transformer deep learning neural network. Twitter and social media, are becoming more and more integrated into daily life. As a result, they have evolved into a vital source of information that represents the views and attitudes of their users. We proposed a BERT based weighted ensemble learning approach to integrate the advantages of various BERT models in dialectal Arabic speech acts classification. We compared the proposed model against several variants of Arabic BERT models and sequence-based models. We developed a dialectal Arabic tweet act dataset by annotating a subset of a large existing Arabic sentiment analysis dataset (ASAD) based on six speech act categories. We also evaluated the models on a previously developed Arabic Tweet Act dataset (ArSAS). To overcome the class imbalance issue commonly observed in speech act problems, a transformer-based data augmentation model was implemented to generate an equal proportion of speech act categories. The results show that the best BERT model is araBERTv2-Twitter models with a macro-averaged F1 score and an accuracy of 0.73 and 0.84, respectively. The performance improved using a BERT-based ensemble method with a 0.74 and 0.85 averaged F1 score and accuracy on our dataset, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17373v1,2024-01
Weaver: Foundation Models for Creative Writing,"Tiannan Wang, Jiamin Chen, Qingrui Jia, Shuai Wang, Ruoyu Fang, Huilin Wang, Zhaowei Gao, Chunzhao Xie, Chuou Xu, Jihong Dai, Yibin Liu, Jialong Wu, Shengwei Ding, Long Li, Zhiwei Huang, Xinle Deng, Teng Yu, Gangan Ma, Han Xiao, Zixin Chen, Danjun Xiang, Yunxia Wang, Yuanyuan Zhu, Yi Xiao, Jing Wang, Yiru Wang, Siran Ding, Jiayang Huang, Jiayi Xu, Yilihamu Tayier, Zhenyu Hu, Yuan Gao, Chengfeng Zheng, Yueshu Ye, Yihang Li, Lei Wan, Xinyue Jiang, Yujie Wang, Siyu Cheng, Zhule Song, Xiangru Tang, Xiaohua Xu, Ningyu Zhang, Huajun Chen, Yuchen Eleanor Jiang, Wangchunshu Zhou","This work introduces Weaver, our first family of large language models (LLMs) dedicated to content creation. Weaver is pre-trained on a carefully selected corpus that focuses on improving the writing capabilities of large language models. We then fine-tune Weaver for creative and professional writing purposes and align it to the preference of professional writers using a suit of novel methods for instruction data synthesis and LLM alignment, making it able to produce more human-like texts and follow more diverse instructions for content creation. The Weaver family consists of models of Weaver Mini (1.8B), Weaver Base (6B), Weaver Pro (14B), and Weaver Ultra (34B) sizes, suitable for different applications and can be dynamically dispatched by a routing agent according to query complexity to balance response quality and computation cost. Evaluation on a carefully curated benchmark for assessing the writing capabilities of LLMs shows Weaver models of all sizes outperform generalist LLMs several times larger than them. Notably, our most-capable Weaver Ultra model surpasses GPT-4, a state-of-the-art generalist LLM, on various writing scenarios, demonstrating the advantage of training specialized LLMs for writing purposes. Moreover, Weaver natively supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and function calling (tool usage). We present various use cases of these abilities for improving AI-assisted writing systems, including integration of external knowledge bases, tools, or APIs, and providing personalized writing assistance. Furthermore, we discuss and summarize a guideline and best practices for pre-training and fine-tuning domain-specific LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17268v1,2024-01
Robust Prompt Optimization for Defending Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks,"Andy Zhou, Bo Li, Haohan Wang","Despite advances in AI alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries can modify prompts to induce unwanted behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO) to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art. Code can be found at https://github.com/lapisrocks/rpo",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17263v5,2024-01
Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models,"Xuandong Zhao, Xianjun Yang, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Lei Li, Yu-Xiang Wang, William Yang Wang","Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks - resulting in harmful, unethical, or biased text generations. However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient method to attack aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging. The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17256v2,2024-01
LLaMP: Large Language Model Made Powerful for High-fidelity Materials Knowledge Retrieval and Distillation,"Yuan Chiang, Elvis Hsieh, Chia-Hong Chou, Janosh Riebesell","Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use in the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However, LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data on Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput workflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data (such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in computational materials and chemistry. We propose a simple metric combining uncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of responses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively mitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli, electronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data sources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and run annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning force fields. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free approach to exploring and scaling materials informatics, and establishes a pathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models.

Morality is Non-Binary: Building a Pluralist Moral Sentence Embedding Space using Contrastive Learning,"Jeongwoo Park, Enrico Liscio, Pradeep K. Murukannaiah","Recent advances in NLP show that language models retain a discernible level of knowledge in deontological ethics and moral norms. However, existing works often treat morality as binary, ranging from right to wrong. This simplistic view does not capture the nuances of moral judgment. Pluralist moral philosophers argue that human morality can be deconstructed into a finite number of elements, respecting individual differences in moral judgment. In line with this view, we build a pluralist moral sentence embedding space via a state-of-the-art contrastive learning approach. We systematically investigate the embedding space by studying the emergence of relationships among moral elements, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that a pluralist approach to morality can be captured in an embedding space. However, moral pluralism is challenging to deduce via self-supervision alone and requires a supervised approach with human labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17228v1,2024-01
MouSi: Poly-Visual-Expert Vision-Language Models,"Xiaoran Fan, Tao Ji, Changhao Jiang, Shuo Li, Senjie Jin, Sirui Song, Junke Wang, Boyang Hong, Lu Chen, Guodong Zheng, Ming Zhang, Caishuang Huang, Rui Zheng, Zhiheng Xi, Yuhao Zhou, Shihan Dou, Junjie Ye, Hang Yan, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang","Current large vision-language models (VLMs) often encounter challenges such as insufficient capabilities of a single visual component and excessively long visual tokens. These issues can limit the model's effectiveness in accurately interpreting complex visual information and over-lengthy contextual information. Addressing these challenges is crucial for enhancing the performance and applicability of VLMs. This paper proposes the use of ensemble experts technique to synergizes the capabilities of individual visual encoders, including those skilled in image-text matching, OCR, image segmentation, etc. This technique introduces a fusion network to unify the processing of outputs from different visual experts, while bridging the gap between image encoders and pre-trained LLMs. In addition, we explore different positional encoding schemes to alleviate the waste of positional encoding caused by lengthy image feature sequences, effectively addressing the issue of position overflow and length limitations. For instance, in our implementation, this technique significantly reduces the positional occupancy in models like SAM, from a substantial 4096 to a more efficient and manageable 64 or even down to 1. Experimental results demonstrate that VLMs with multiple experts exhibit consistently superior performance over isolated visual encoders and mark a significant performance boost as more experts are integrated. We have open-sourced the training code used in this report. All of these resources can be found on our project website.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17221v1,2024-01
Gazetteer-Enhanced Bangla Named Entity Recognition with BanglaBERT Semantic Embeddings K-Means-Infused CRF Model,"Niloy Farhan, Saman Sarker Joy, Tafseer Binte Mannan, Farig Sadeque","Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that distinguishes entities from unorganized text into predefined categorization. In recent years, a lot of Bangla NLP subtasks have received quite a lot of attention; but Named Entity Recognition in Bangla still lags behind. In this research, we explored the existing state of research in Bangla Named Entity Recognition. We tried to figure out the limitations that current techniques and datasets face, and we would like to address these limitations in our research. Additionally, We developed a Gazetteer that has the ability to significantly boost the performance of NER. We also proposed a new NER solution by taking advantage of state-of-the-art NLP tools that outperform conventional techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17206v1,2024-01
Rethinking Interpretability in the Era of Large Language Models,"Chandan Singh, Jeevana Priya Inala, Michel Galley, Rich Caruana, Jianfeng Gao","Interpretable machine learning has exploded as an area of interest over the last decade, sparked by the rise of increasingly large datasets and deep neural networks. Simultaneously, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide array of tasks, offering a chance to rethink opportunities in interpretable machine learning. Notably, the capability to explain in natural language allows LLMs to expand the scale and complexity of patterns that can be given to a human. However, these new capabilities raise new challenges, such as hallucinated explanations and immense computational costs.   In this position paper, we start by reviewing existing methods to evaluate the emerging field of LLM interpretation (both interpreting LLMs and using LLMs for explanation). We contend that, despite their limitations, LLMs hold the opportunity to redefine interpretability with a more ambitious scope across many applications, including in auditing LLMs themselves. We highlight two emerging research priorities for LLM interpretation: using LLMs to directly analyze new datasets and to generate interactive explanations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01761v1,2024-01
Single Word Change is All You Need: Designing Attacks and Defenses for Text Classifiers,"Lei Xu, Sarah Alnegheimish, Laure Berti-Equille, Alfredo Cuesta-Infante, Kalyan Veeramachaneni","In text classification, creating an adversarial example means subtly perturbing a few words in a sentence without changing its meaning, causing it to be misclassified by a classifier. A concerning observation is that a significant portion of adversarial examples generated by existing methods change only one word. This single-word perturbation vulnerability represents a significant weakness in classifiers, which malicious users can exploit to efficiently create a multitude of adversarial examples. This paper studies this problem and makes the following key contributions: (1) We introduce a novel metric \r{ho} to quantitatively assess a classifier's robustness against single-word perturbation. (2) We present the SP-Attack, designed to exploit the single-word perturbation vulnerability, achieving a higher attack success rate, better preserving sentence meaning, while reducing computation costs compared to state-of-the-art adversarial methods. (3) We propose SP-Defense, which aims to improve \r{ho} by applying data augmentation in learning. Experimental results on 4 datasets and BERT and distilBERT classifiers show that SP-Defense improves \r{ho} by 14.6% and 13.9% and decreases the attack success rate of SP-Attack by 30.4% and 21.2% on two classifiers respectively, and decreases the attack success rate of existing attack methods that involve multiple-word perturbations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17196v1,2024-01
Transfer Learning for Text Diffusion Models,"Kehang Han, Kathleen Kenealy, Aditya Barua, Noah Fiedel, Noah Constant","In this report, we explore the potential for text diffusion to replace autoregressive (AR) decoding for the training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). We are particularly interested to see whether pretrained AR models can be transformed into text diffusion models through a lightweight adaptation procedure we call ``AR2Diff''. We begin by establishing a strong baseline setup for training text diffusion models. Comparing across multiple architectures and pretraining objectives, we find that training a decoder-only model with a prefix LM objective is best or near-best across several tasks. Building on this finding, we test various transfer learning setups for text diffusion models. On machine translation, we find that text diffusion underperforms the standard AR approach. However, on code synthesis and extractive QA, we find diffusion models trained from scratch outperform AR models in many cases. We also observe quality gains from AR2Diff -- adapting AR models to use diffusion decoding. These results are promising given that text diffusion is relatively underexplored and can be significantly faster than AR decoding for long text generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17181v1,2024-01
Conditional and Modal Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Wesley H. Holliday, Matthew Mandelkern, Cedegao E. Zhang","The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) are the topic of a growing body of research in AI and cognitive science. In this paper, we probe the extent to which twenty-nine LLMs are able to distinguish logically correct inferences from logically fallacious ones. We focus on inference patterns involving conditionals (e.g., 'If Ann has a queen, then Bob has a jack') and epistemic modals (e.g., 'Ann might have an ace', 'Bob must have a king'). These inferences have been of special interest to logicians, philosophers, and linguists, since they play a central role in the fundamental human ability to reason about distal possibilities. Assessing LLMs on these inferences is thus highly relevant to the question of how much the reasoning abilities of LLMs match those of humans. All the LLMs we tested make some basic mistakes with conditionals or modals, though zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting helps them make fewer mistakes. Even the best performing LLMs make basic errors in modal reasoning, display logically inconsistent judgments across inference patterns involving epistemic modals and conditionals, and give answers about complex conditional inferences that do not match reported human judgments. These results highlight gaps in basic logical reasoning in today's LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17169v4,2024-01
Large Language Models in Cybersecurity: State-of-the-Art,"Farzad Nourmohammadzadeh Motlagh, Mehrdad Hajizadeh, Mehryar Majd, Pejman Najafi, Feng Cheng, Christoph Meinel","The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized our comprehension of intelligence bringing us closer to Artificial Intelligence. Since their introduction, researchers have actively explored the applications of LLMs across diverse fields, significantly elevating capabilities. Cybersecurity, traditionally resistant to data-driven solutions and slow to embrace machine learning, stands out as a domain. This study examines the existing literature, providing a thorough characterization of both defensive and adversarial applications of LLMs within the realm of cybersecurity.

"Planning, Creation, Usage: Benchmarking LLMs for Comprehensive Tool Utilization in Real-World Complex Scenarios","Shijue Huang, Wanjun Zhong, Jianqiao Lu, Qi Zhu, Jiahui Gao, Weiwen Liu, Yutai Hou, Xingshan Zeng, Yasheng Wang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Ruifeng Xu, Qun Liu","The recent trend of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as tool agents in real-world applications underscores the necessity for comprehensive evaluations of their capabilities, particularly in complex scenarios involving planning, creating, and using tools. However, existing benchmarks typically focus on simple synthesized queries that do not reflect real-world complexity, thereby offering limited perspectives in evaluating tool utilization. To address this issue, we present UltraTool, a novel benchmark designed to improve and evaluate LLMs' ability in tool utilization within real-world scenarios. UltraTool focuses on the entire process of using tools - from planning and creating to applying them in complex tasks. It emphasizes real-world complexities, demanding accurate, multi-step planning for effective problem-solving. A key feature of UltraTool is its independent evaluation of planning with natural language, which happens before tool usage and simplifies the task solving by mapping out the intermediate steps. Thus, unlike previous work, it eliminates the restriction of pre-defined toolset. Through extensive experiments on various LLMs, we offer novel insights into the evaluation of capabilities of LLMs in tool utilization, thereby contributing a fresh perspective to this rapidly evolving field.

Systematic Literature Review: Computational Approaches for Humour Style Classification,"Mary Ogbuka Kenneth, Foaad Khosmood, Abbas Edalat","Understanding various humour styles is essential for comprehending the multifaceted nature of humour and its impact on fields such as psychology and artificial intelligence. This understanding has revealed that humour, depending on the style employed, can either have therapeutic or detrimental effects on an individual's health and relationships. Although studies dedicated exclusively to computational-based humour style analysis remain somewhat rare, an expansive body of research thrives within related task, particularly binary humour and sarcasm recognition. In this systematic literature review (SLR), we survey the landscape of computational techniques applied to these related tasks and also uncover their fundamental relevance to humour style analysis. Through this study, we unveil common approaches, illuminate various datasets and evaluation metrics, and effectively navigate the complex terrain of humour research. Our efforts determine potential research gaps and outlined promising directions. Furthermore, the SLR identifies a range of features and computational models that can seamlessly transition from related tasks like binary humour and sarcasm detection to invigorate humour style classification. These features encompass incongruity, sentiment and polarity analysis, ambiguity detection, acoustic nuances, visual cues, contextual insights, and more. The computational models that emerge contain traditional machine learning paradigms, neural network architectures, transformer-based models, and specialised models attuned to the nuances of humour.

Diff-eRank: A Novel Rank-Based Metric for Evaluating Large Language Models,"Lai Wei, Zhiquan Tan, Chenghai Li, Jindong Wang, Weiran Huang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing and extended their powerful capabilities to multi-modal domains. As LLMs continue to advance, it is crucial to develop diverse and appropriate metrics for their evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel rank-based metric, Diff-eRank, grounded in information theory and geometry principles. Diff-eRank assesses LLMs by analyzing their hidden representations, providing a quantitative measure of how efficiently they eliminate redundant information during training. We demonstrate the applicability of Diff-eRank in both single-modal (e.g., language) and multi-modal settings. For language models, our results show that Diff-eRank increases with model size and correlates well with conventional metrics such as loss and accuracy. In the multi-modal context, we propose an alignment evaluation method based on the eRank, and verify that contemporary multi-modal LLMs exhibit strong alignment performance based on our method. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/Diff-eRank.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17139v2,2024-01
MT-Ranker: Reference-free machine translation evaluation by inter-system ranking,"Ibraheem Muhammad Moosa, Rui Zhang, Wenpeng Yin","Traditionally, Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation has been treated as a regression problem -- producing an absolute translation-quality score. This approach has two limitations: i) the scores lack interpretability, and human annotators struggle with giving consistent scores; ii) most scoring methods are based on (reference, translation) pairs, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where references are absent. In practice, we often care about whether a new MT system is better or worse than some competitors. In addition, reference-free MT evaluation is increasingly practical and necessary. Unfortunately, these two practical considerations have yet to be jointly explored. In this work, we formulate the reference-free MT evaluation into a pairwise ranking problem. Given the source sentence and a pair of translations, our system predicts which translation is better. In addition to proposing this new formulation, we further show that this new paradigm can demonstrate superior correlation with human judgments by merely using indirect supervision from natural language inference and weak supervision from our synthetic data. In the context of reference-free evaluation, MT-Ranker, trained without any human annotations, achieves state-of-the-art results on the WMT Shared Metrics Task benchmarks DARR20, MQM20, and MQM21. On a more challenging benchmark, ACES, which contains fine-grained evaluation criteria such as addition, omission, and mistranslation errors, MT-Ranker marks state-of-the-art against reference-free as well as reference-based baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17099v1,2024-01
StrokeNUWA: Tokenizing Strokes for Vector Graphic Synthesis,"Zecheng Tang, Chenfei Wu, Zekai Zhang, Mingheng Ni, Shengming Yin, Yu Liu, Zhengyuan Yang, Lijuan Wang, Zicheng Liu, Juntao Li, Nan Duan","To leverage LLMs for visual synthesis, traditional methods convert raster image information into discrete grid tokens through specialized visual modules, while disrupting the model's ability to capture the true semantic representation of visual scenes. This paper posits that an alternative representation of images, vector graphics, can effectively surmount this limitation by enabling a more natural and semantically coherent segmentation of the image information. Thus, we introduce StrokeNUWA, a pioneering work exploring a better visual representation ''stroke tokens'' on vector graphics, which is inherently visual semantics rich, naturally compatible with LLMs, and highly compressed. Equipped with stroke tokens, StrokeNUWA can significantly surpass traditional LLM-based and optimization-based methods across various metrics in the vector graphic generation task. Besides, StrokeNUWA achieves up to a 94x speedup in inference over the speed of prior methods with an exceptional SVG code compression ratio of 6.9%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17093v1,2024-01
NNOSE: Nearest Neighbor Occupational Skill Extraction,"Mike Zhang, Rob van der Goot, Min-Yen Kan, Barbara Plank","The labor market is changing rapidly, prompting increased interest in the automatic extraction of occupational skills from text. With the advent of English benchmark job description datasets, there is a need for systems that handle their diversity well. We tackle the complexity in occupational skill datasets tasks -- combining and leveraging multiple datasets for skill extraction, to identify rarely observed skills within a dataset, and overcoming the scarcity of skills across datasets. In particular, we investigate the retrieval-augmentation of language models, employing an external datastore for retrieving similar skills in a dataset-unifying manner. Our proposed method, \textbf{N}earest \textbf{N}eighbor \textbf{O}ccupational \textbf{S}kill \textbf{E}xtraction (NNOSE) effectively leverages multiple datasets by retrieving neighboring skills from other datasets in the datastore. This improves skill extraction \emph{without} additional fine-tuning. Crucially, we observe a performance gain in predicting infrequent patterns, with substantial gains of up to 30\% span-F1 in cross-dataset settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17092v1,2024-01
SemScore: Automated Evaluation of Instruction-Tuned LLMs based on Semantic Textual Similarity,"Ansar Aynetdinov, Alan Akbik","Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable advancements in their ability to generate fitting responses to natural language instructions. However, many current works rely on manual evaluation to judge the quality of generated responses. Since such manual evaluation is time-consuming, it does not easily scale to the evaluation of multiple models and model variants. In this short paper, we propose a straightforward but remarkably effective evaluation metric called SemScore, in which we directly compare model outputs to gold target responses using semantic textual similarity (STS). We conduct a comparative evaluation of the model outputs of 12 prominent instruction-tuned LLMs using 8 widely-used evaluation metrics for text generation. We find that our proposed SemScore metric outperforms all other, in many cases more complex, evaluation metrics in terms of correlation to human evaluation. These findings indicate the utility of our proposed metric for the evaluation of instruction-tuned LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17072v2,2024-01
CRUD-RAG: A Comprehensive Chinese Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models,"Yuanjie Lyu, Zhiyu Li, Simin Niu, Feiyu Xiong, Bo Tang, Wenjin Wang, Hao Wu, Huanyong Liu, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge sources. This method addresses common LLM limitations, including outdated information and the tendency to produce inaccurate ""hallucinated"" content. However, the evaluation of RAG systems is challenging, as existing benchmarks are limited in scope and diversity. Most of the current benchmarks predominantly assess question-answering applications, overlooking the broader spectrum of situations where RAG could prove advantageous. Moreover, they only evaluate the performance of the LLM component of the RAG pipeline in the experiments, and neglect the influence of the retrieval component and the external knowledge database. To address these issues, this paper constructs a large-scale and more comprehensive benchmark, and evaluates all the components of RAG systems in various RAG application scenarios. Specifically, we have categorized the range of RAG applications into four distinct types-Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD), each representing a unique use case. ""Create"" refers to scenarios requiring the generation of original, varied content. ""Read"" involves responding to intricate questions in knowledge-intensive situations. ""Update"" focuses on revising and rectifying inaccuracies or inconsistencies in pre-existing texts. ""Delete"" pertains to the task of summarizing extensive texts into more concise forms. For each of these CRUD categories, we have developed comprehensive datasets to evaluate the performance of RAG systems. We also analyze the effects of various components of the RAG system, such as the retriever, the context length, the knowledge base construction, and the LLM. Finally, we provide useful insights for optimizing the RAG technology for different scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17043v3,2024-01
Taking Action Towards Graceful Interaction: The Effects of Performing Actions on Modelling Policies for Instruction Clarification Requests,"Brielen Madureira, David Schlangen","Clarification requests are a mechanism to help solve communication problems, e.g. due to ambiguity or underspecification, in instruction-following interactions. Despite their importance, even skilful models struggle with producing or interpreting such repair acts. In this work, we test three hypotheses concerning the effects of action taking as an auxiliary task in modelling iCR policies. Contrary to initial expectations, we conclude that its contribution to learning an iCR policy is limited, but some information can still be extracted from prediction uncertainty. We present further evidence that even well-motivated, Transformer-based models fail to learn good policies for when to ask Instruction CRs (iCRs), while the task of determining what to ask about can be more successfully modelled. Considering the implications of these findings, we further discuss the shortcomings of the data-driven paradigm for learning meta-communication acts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17039v1,2024-01
QACP: An Annotated Question Answering Dataset for Assisting Chinese Python Programming Learners,"Rui Xiao, Lu Han, Xiaoying Zhou, Jiong Wang, Na Zong, Pengyu Zhang","In online learning platforms, particularly in rapidly growing computer programming courses, addressing the thousands of students' learning queries requires considerable human cost. The creation of intelligent assistant large language models (LLMs) tailored for programming education necessitates distinct data support. However, in real application scenarios, the data resources for training such LLMs are relatively scarce. Therefore, to address the data scarcity in intelligent educational systems for programming, this paper proposes a new Chinese question-and-answer dataset for Python learners. To ensure the authenticity and reliability of the sources of the questions, we collected questions from actual student questions and categorized them according to various dimensions such as the type of questions and the type of learners. This annotation principle is designed to enhance the effectiveness and quality of online programming education, providing a solid data foundation for developing the programming teaching assists (TA). Furthermore, we conducted comprehensive evaluations of various LLMs proficient in processing and generating Chinese content, highlighting the potential limitations of general LLMs as intelligent teaching assistants in computer programming courses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07913v2,2024-01
Distinguishing Fictional Voices: a Study of Authorship Verification Models for Quotation Attribution,"Gaspard Michel, Elena V. Epure, Romain Hennequin, Christophe Cerisara","Recent approaches to automatically detect the speaker of an utterance of direct speech often disregard general information about characters in favor of local information found in the context, such as surrounding mentions of entities. In this work, we explore stylistic representations of characters built by encoding their quotes with off-the-shelf pretrained Authorship Verification models in a large corpus of English novels (the Project Dialogism Novel Corpus). Results suggest that the combination of stylistic and topical information captured in some of these models accurately distinguish characters among each other, but does not necessarily improve over semantic-only models when attributing quotes. However, these results vary across novels and more investigation of stylometric models particularly tailored for literary texts and the study of characters should be conducted.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16968v1,2024-01
Two Heads Are Better Than One: Integrating Knowledge from Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models for Entity Alignment,"Linyao Yang, Hongyang Chen, Xiao Wang, Jing Yang, Fei-Yue Wang, Han Liu","Entity alignment, which is a prerequisite for creating a more comprehensive Knowledge Graph (KG), involves pinpointing equivalent entities across disparate KGs. Contemporary methods for entity alignment have predominantly utilized knowledge embedding models to procure entity embeddings that encapsulate various similarities-structural, relational, and attributive. These embeddings are then integrated through attention-based information fusion mechanisms. Despite this progress, effectively harnessing multifaceted information remains challenging due to inherent heterogeneity. Moreover, while Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks by implicitly capturing entity semantics, this implicit knowledge has yet to be exploited for entity alignment. In this study, we propose a Large Language Model-enhanced Entity Alignment framework (LLMEA), integrating structural knowledge from KGs with semantic knowledge from LLMs to enhance entity alignment. Specifically, LLMEA identifies candidate alignments for a given entity by considering both embedding similarities between entities across KGs and edit distances to a virtual equivalent entity. It then engages an LLM iteratively, posing multiple multi-choice questions to draw upon the LLM's inference capability. The final prediction of the equivalent entity is derived from the LLM's output. Experiments conducted on three public datasets reveal that LLMEA surpasses leading baseline models. Additional ablation studies underscore the efficacy of our proposed framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16960v1,2024-01

Cross-Lingual Transfer from Related Languages: Treating Low-Resource Maltese as Multilingual Code-Switching,"Kurt Micallef, Nizar Habash, Claudia Borg, Fadhl Eryani, Houda Bouamor","Although multilingual language models exhibit impressive cross-lingual transfer capabilities on unseen languages, the performance on downstream tasks is impacted when there is a script disparity with the languages used in the multilingual model's pre-training data. Using transliteration offers a straightforward yet effective means to align the script of a resource-rich language with a target language, thereby enhancing cross-lingual transfer capabilities. However, for mixed languages, this approach is suboptimal, since only a subset of the language benefits from the cross-lingual transfer while the remainder is impeded. In this work, we focus on Maltese, a Semitic language, with substantial influences from Arabic, Italian, and English, and notably written in Latin script. We present a novel dataset annotated with word-level etymology. We use this dataset to train a classifier that enables us to make informed decisions regarding the appropriate processing of each token in the Maltese language. We contrast indiscriminate transliteration or translation to mixing processing pipelines that only transliterate words of Arabic origin, thereby resulting in text with a mixture of scripts. We fine-tune the processed data on four downstream tasks and show that conditional transliteration based on word etymology yields the best results, surpassing fine-tuning with raw Maltese or Maltese processed with non-selective pipelines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16895v2,2024-01
State Value Generation with Prompt Learning and Self-Training for Low-Resource Dialogue State Tracking,"Ming Gu, Yan Yang, Chengcai Chen, Zhou Yu","Recently, low-resource dialogue state tracking (DST) has received increasing attention. First obtaining state values then based on values to generate slot types has made great progress in this task. However, obtaining state values is still an under-studied problem. Existing extraction-based approaches cannot capture values that require the understanding of context and are not generalizable either. To address these issues, we propose a novel State VAlue Generation based framework (SVAG), decomposing DST into state value generation and domain slot generation. Specifically, we propose to generate state values and use self-training to further improve state value generation. Moreover, we design an estimator aiming at detecting incomplete generation and incorrect generation for pseudo-labeled data selection during self-training. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset show that our method which has only less than 1 billion parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance under the data ratio settings of 5%, 10%, and 25% when limited to models under 100 billion parameters. Compared to models with more than 100 billion parameters, SVAG still reaches competitive results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16862v1,2024-01
NanoNER: Named Entity Recognition for nanobiology using experts' knowledge and distant supervision,"Martin Lentschat, Cyril Labbé, Ran Cheng","Here we present the training and evaluation of NanoNER, a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for Nanobiology. NER consists in the identification of specific entities in spans of unstructured texts and is often a primary task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction. The aim of our model is to recognise entities previously identified by domain experts as constituting the essential knowledge of the domain. Relying on ontologies, which provide us with a domain vocabulary and taxonomy, we implemented an iterative process enabling experts to determine the entities relevant to the domain at hand. We then delve into the potential of distant supervision learning in NER, supporting how this method can increase the quantity of annotated data with minimal additional manpower. On our full corpus of 728 full-text nanobiology articles, containing more than 120k entity occurrences, NanoNER obtained a F1-score of 0.98 on the recognition of previously known entities. Our model also demonstrated its ability to discover new entities in the text, with precision scores ranging from 0.77 to 0.81. Ablation experiments further confirmed this and allowed us to assess the dependency of our approach on the external resources. It highlighted the dependency of the approach to the resource, while also confirming its ability to rediscover up to 30% of the ablated terms. This paper details the methodology employed, experimental design, and key findings, providing valuable insights and directions for future related researches on NER in specialized domain. Furthermore, since our approach require minimal manpower , we believe that it can be generalized to other specialized fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03362v1,2024-01

Identifying False Content and Hate Speech in Sinhala YouTube Videos by Analyzing the Audio,"W. A. K. M. Wickramaarachchi, Sameeri Sathsara Subasinghe, K. K. Rashani Tharushika Wijerathna, A. Sahashra Udani Athukorala, Lakmini Abeywardhana, A. Karunasena","YouTube faces a global crisis with the dissemination of false information and hate speech. To counter these issues, YouTube has implemented strict rules against uploading content that includes false information or promotes hate speech. While numerous studies have been conducted to reduce offensive English-language content, there's a significant lack of research on Sinhala content. This study aims to address the aforementioned gap by proposing a solution to minimize the spread of violence and misinformation in Sinhala YouTube videos. The approach involves developing a rating system that assesses whether a video contains false information by comparing the title and description with the audio content and evaluating whether the video includes hate speech. The methodology encompasses several steps, including audio extraction using the Pytube library, audio transcription via the fine-tuned Whisper model, hate speech detection employing the distilroberta-base model and a text classification LSTM model, and text summarization through the fine-tuned BART-Large- XSUM model. Notably, the Whisper model achieved a 48.99\% word error rate, while the distilroberta-base model demonstrated an F1 score of 0.856 and a recall value of 0.861 in comparison to the LSTM model, which exhibited signs of overfitting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01752v1,2024-01
Performance Assessment of ChatGPT vs Bard in Detecting Alzheimer's Dementia,"Balamurali B T, Jer-Ming Chen","Large language models (LLMs) find increasing applications in many fields. Here, three LLM chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4 and Bard) are assessed - in their current form, as publicly available - for their ability to recognize Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals using textual input derived from spontaneous speech recordings. Zero-shot learning approach is used at two levels of independent queries, with the second query (chain-of-thought prompting) eliciting more detailed than the first. Each LLM chatbot's performance is evaluated on the prediction generated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score. LLM chatbots generated three-class outcome (""AD"", ""CN"", or ""Unsure""). When positively identifying AD, Bard produced highest true-positives (89% recall) and highest F1 score (71%), but tended to misidentify CN as AD, with high confidence (low ""Unsure"" rates); for positively identifying CN, GPT-4 resulted in the highest true-negatives at 56% and highest F1 score (62%), adopting a diplomatic stance (moderate ""Unsure"" rates). Overall, three LLM chatbots identify AD vs CN surpassing chance-levels but do not currently satisfy clinical application.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01751v1,2024-01
Can Large Language Models be Trusted for Evaluation? Scalable Meta-Evaluation of LLMs as Evaluators via Agent Debate,"Steffi Chern, Ethan Chern, Graham Neubig, Pengfei Liu","Despite the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks and scenarios, developing a method for reliably evaluating LLMs across varied contexts continues to be challenging. Modern evaluation approaches often use LLMs to assess responses generated by LLMs. However, the meta-evaluation conducted to assess the effectiveness of these LLMs as evaluators is typically constrained by the coverage of existing benchmarks or requires extensive human annotation. This underscores the urgency of methods for scalable meta-evaluation that can effectively, reliably, and efficiently evaluate the performance of LLMs as evaluators across diverse tasks and scenarios, particularly in potentially new, user-defined scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose ScaleEval, an agent-debate-assisted meta-evaluation framework that leverages the capabilities of multiple communicative LLM agents. This framework supports multi-round discussions to assist human annotators in discerning the most capable LLMs as evaluators, which significantly eases their workload in cases that used to require large-scale annotations during meta-evaluation.

PACE: A Pragmatic Agent for Enhancing Communication Efficiency Using Large Language Models,"Jiaxuan Li, Minxi Yang, Dahua Gao, Wenlong Xu, Guangming Shi","Current communication technologies face limitations in terms of theoretical capacity, spectrum availability, and power resources. Pragmatic communication, leveraging terminal intelligence for selective data transmission, offers resource conservation. Existing research lacks universal intention resolution tools, limiting applicability to specific tasks. This paper proposes an image pragmatic communication framework based on a Pragmatic Agent for Communication Efficiency (PACE) using Large Language Models (LLM). In this framework, PACE sequentially performs semantic perception, intention resolution, and intention-oriented coding. To ensure the effective utilization of LLM in communication, a knowledge base is designed to supplement the necessary knowledge, dedicated prompts are introduced to facilitate understanding of pragmatic communication scenarios and task requirements, and a chain of thought is designed to assist in making reasonable trade-offs between transmission efficiency and cost. For experimental validation, this paper constructs an image pragmatic communication dataset along with corresponding evaluation standards. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms traditional and non-LLM-based pragmatic communication in terms of transmission efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01750v1,2024-01

MT-Eval: A Multi-Turn Capabilities Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models,"Wai-Chung Kwan, Xingshan Zeng, Yuxin Jiang, Yufei Wang, Liangyou Li, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Kam-Fai Wong","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for complex multi-turn conversations across diverse real-world applications. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on single-turn evaluations, overlooking the models' capabilities in multi-turn interactions. To address this gap, we introduce MT-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate multi-turn conversational abilities. By analyzing human-LLM conversations, we categorize interaction patterns into four types: recollection, expansion, refinement, and follow-up. We construct multi-turn queries for each category either by augmenting existing datasets or by creating new examples with GPT-4 to avoid data leakage. To study the factors impacting multi-turn abilities, we create single-turn versions of the 1170 multi-turn queries and compare performance. Our evaluation of 11 well-known LLMs shows that while closed-source models generally surpass open-source ones, certain open-source models exceed GPT-3.5-Turbo in specific tasks. We observe significant performance degradation in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn settings in most models, which is not correlated with the models' fundamental capabilities. Moreover, we identify the distance to relevant content and susceptibility to error propagation as the key factors influencing multi-turn performance. MT-Eval is released publicly to encourage future research towards more robust conversational models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16745v1,2024-01

Towards Generating Informative Textual Description for Neurons in Language Models,"Shrayani Mondal, Rishabh Garodia, Arbaaz Qureshi, Taesung Lee, Youngja Park","Recent developments in transformer-based language models have allowed them to capture a wide variety of world knowledge that can be adapted to downstream tasks with limited resources. However, what pieces of information are understood in these models is unclear, and neuron-level contributions in identifying them are largely unknown. Conventional approaches in neuron explainability either depend on a finite set of pre-defined descriptors or require manual annotations for training a secondary model that can then explain the neurons of the primary model. In this paper, we take BERT as an example and we try to remove these constraints and propose a novel and scalable framework that ties textual descriptions to neurons. We leverage the potential of generative language models to discover human-interpretable descriptors present in a dataset and use an unsupervised approach to explain neurons with these descriptors. Through various qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in generating useful data-specific descriptors with little human involvement in identifying the neurons that encode these descriptors.

This comprehensive survey delves into the recent strides in HS moderation, spotlighting the burgeoning role of large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs). Our exploration begins with a thorough analysis of current literature, revealing the nuanced interplay between textual, visual, and auditory elements in propagating HS. We uncover a notable trend towards integrating these modalities, primarily due to the complexity and subtlety with which HS is disseminated. A significant emphasis is placed on the advances facilitated by LLMs and LMMs, which have begun to redefine the boundaries of detection and moderation capabilities. We identify existing gaps in research, particularly in the context of underrepresented languages and cultures, and the need for solutions to handle low-resource settings. The survey concludes with a forward-looking perspective, outlining potential avenues for future research, including the exploration of novel AI methodologies, the ethical governance of AI in moderation, and the development of more nuanced, context-aware systems.

Supporting such interactions requires a comprehensive understanding of the conversational inputs to formulate a good search query based on historical information. In particular, the search query should include the relevant information from the previous conversation turns. However, current approaches for conversational dense retrieval primarily rely on fine-tuning a pre-trained ad-hoc retriever using the whole conversational search session, which can be lengthy and noisy. Moreover, existing approaches are limited by the amount of manual supervision signals in the existing datasets. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a History-Aware Conversational Dense Retrieval (HAConvDR) system, which incorporates two ideas: context-denoised query reformulation and automatic mining of supervision signals based on the actual impact of historical turns. Experiments on two public conversational search datasets demonstrate the improved history modeling capability of HAConvDR, in particular for long conversations with topic shifts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16659v3,2024-01
Recovering Mental Representations from Large Language Models with Markov Chain Monte Carlo,"Jian-Qiao Zhu, Haijiang Yan, Thomas L. Griffiths","Simulating sampling algorithms with people has proven a useful method for efficiently probing and understanding their mental representations. We propose that the same methods can be used to study the representations of Large Language Models (LLMs). While one can always directly prompt either humans or LLMs to disclose their mental representations introspectively, we show that increased efficiency can be achieved by using LLMs as elements of a sampling algorithm. We explore the extent to which we recover human-like representations when LLMs are interrogated with Direct Sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We found a significant increase in efficiency and performance using adaptive sampling algorithms based on MCMC. We also highlight the potential of our method to yield a more general method of conducting Bayesian inference \textit{with} LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16657v1,2024-01
OWSM v3.1: Better and Faster Open Whisper-Style Speech Models based on E-Branchformer,"Yifan Peng, Jinchuan Tian, William Chen, Siddhant Arora, Brian Yan, Yui Sudo, Muhammad Shakeel, Kwanghee Choi, Jiatong Shi, Xuankai Chang, Jee-weon Jung, Shinji Watanabe","Recent studies have highlighted the importance of fully open foundation models. The Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) is an initial step towards reproducing OpenAI Whisper using public data and open-source toolkits. However, previous versions of OWSM (v1 to v3) are still based on standard Transformer, which might lead to inferior performance compared to state-of-the-art speech encoder architectures. This work aims to improve the performance and efficiency of OWSM without additional data. We present a series of E-Branchformer-based models named OWSM v3.1, ranging from 100M to 1B parameters. OWSM v3.1 outperforms its predecessor, OWSM v3, in most evaluation benchmarks, while showing an improved inference speed of up to 25%. We further reveal the emergent ability of OWSM v3.1 in zero-shot contextual biasing speech recognition. We also provide a model trained on a subset of data with low license restrictions. We will publicly release the code, pre-trained models, and training logs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16658v3,2024-01
Gradient-Based Language Model Red Teaming,"Nevan Wichers, Carson Denison, Ahmad Beirami","Red teaming is a common strategy for identifying weaknesses in generative language models (LMs), where adversarial prompts are produced that trigger an LM to generate unsafe responses. Red teaming is instrumental for both model alignment and evaluation, but is labor-intensive and difficult to scale when done by humans. In this paper, we present Gradient-Based Red Teaming (GBRT), a red teaming method for automatically generating diverse prompts that are likely to cause an LM to output unsafe responses. GBRT is a form of prompt learning, trained by scoring an LM response with a safety classifier and then backpropagating through the frozen safety classifier and LM to update the prompt. To improve the coherence of input prompts, we introduce two variants that add a realism loss and fine-tune a pretrained model to generate the prompts instead of learning the prompts directly. Our experiments show that GBRT is more effective at finding prompts that trigger an LM to generate unsafe responses than a strong reinforcement learning-based red teaming approach, and succeeds even when the LM has been fine-tuned to produce safer outputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16656v1,2024-01
Incoherent Probability Judgments in Large Language Models,"Jian-Qiao Zhu, Thomas L. Griffiths","Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for next-word prediction have demonstrated remarkable proficiency at producing coherent text. But are they equally adept at forming coherent probability judgments? We use probabilistic identities and repeated judgments to assess the coherence of probability judgments made by LLMs. Our results show that the judgments produced by these models are often incoherent, displaying human-like systematic deviations from the rules of probability theory. Moreover, when prompted to judge the same event, the mean-variance relationship of probability judgments produced by LLMs shows an inverted-U-shaped like that seen in humans. We propose that these deviations from rationality can be explained by linking autoregressive LLMs to implicit Bayesian inference and drawing parallels with the Bayesian Sampler model of human probability judgments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16646v1,2024-01
TeenyTinyLlama: open-source tiny language models trained in Brazilian Portuguese,"Nicholas Kluge Corrêa, Sophia Falk, Shiza Fatimah, Aniket Sen, Nythamar de Oliveira","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, but their progress has yet to be equal across languages. While most LLMs are trained in high-resource languages like English, multilingual models generally underperform monolingual ones. Additionally, aspects of their multilingual foundation sometimes restrict the byproducts they produce, like computational demands and licensing regimes. In this study, we document the development of open-foundation models tailored for use in low-resource settings, their limitations, and their benefits.

Breaking Free Transformer Models: Task-specific Context Attribution Promises Improved Generalizability Without Fine-tuning Pre-trained LLMs,"Stepan Tytarenko, Mohammad Ruhul Amin","Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models (LLMs) on particular datasets is a commonly employed strategy in Natural Language Processing (NLP) classification tasks. However, this approach usually results in a loss of models generalizability. In this paper, we present a framework that allows for maintaining generalizability, and enhances the performance on the downstream task by utilizing task-specific context attribution. We show that a linear transformation of the text representation from any transformer model using the task-specific concept operator results in a projection onto the latent concept space, referred to as context attribution in this paper. The specific concept operator is optimized during the supervised learning stage via novel loss functions. The proposed framework demonstrates that context attribution of the text representation for each task objective can improve the capacity of the discriminator function and thus achieve better performance for the classification task. Experimental results on three datasets, namely HateXplain, IMDB reviews, and Social Media Attributions, illustrate that the proposed model attains superior accuracy and generalizability. Specifically, for the non-fine-tuned BERT on the HateXplain dataset, we observe 8% improvement in accuracy and 10% improvement in F1-score. Whereas for the IMDB dataset, fine-tuned state-of-the-art XLNet is outperformed by 1% for both accuracy and F1-score. Furthermore, in an out-of-domain cross-dataset test, DistilBERT fine-tuned on the IMDB dataset in conjunction with the proposed model improves the F1-score on the HateXplain dataset by 7%. For the Social Media Attributions dataset of YouTube comments, we observe 5.2% increase in F1-metric. The proposed framework is implemented with PyTorch and provided open-source on GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16638v1,2024-01
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) as Universal Foundation Models for AI-Native Wireless Systems,"Shengzhe Xu, Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas, Omar Hashash, Nikhil Muralidhar, Walid Saad, Naren Ramakrishnan","Large language models (LLMs) and foundation models have been recently touted as a game-changer for 6G systems. However, recent efforts on LLMs for wireless networks are limited to a direct application of existing language models that were designed for natural language processing (NLP) applications. To address this challenge and create wireless-centric foundation models, this paper presents a comprehensive vision on how to design universal foundation models that are tailored towards the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks. Diverging from NLP-based foundation models, the proposed framework promotes the design of large multi-modal models (LMMs) fostered by three key capabilities: 1) processing of multi-modal sensing data, 2) grounding of physical symbol representations in real-world wireless systems using causal reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and 3) enabling instructibility from the wireless environment feedback to facilitate dynamic network adaptation thanks to logical and mathematical reasoning facilitated by neuro-symbolic AI. In essence, these properties enable the proposed LMM framework to build universal capabilities that cater to various cross-layer networking tasks and alignment of intents across different domains. Preliminary results from experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficacy of grounding using RAG in LMMs, and showcase the alignment of LMMs with wireless system designs. Furthermore, the enhanced rationale exhibited in the responses to mathematical questions by LMMs, compared to vanilla LLMs, demonstrates the logical and mathematical reasoning capabilities inherent in LMMs. Building on those results, we present a sequel of open questions and challenges for LMMs. We then conclude with a set of recommendations that ignite the path towards LMM-empowered AI-native systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01748v2,2024-01
Improving Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Efficient Reward Model Ensemble,"Shun Zhang, Zhenfang Chen, Sunli Chen, Yikang Shen, Zhiqing Sun, Chuang Gan","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted approach for aligning large language models with human values. However, RLHF relies on a reward model that is trained with a limited amount of human preference data, which could lead to inaccurate predictions. As a result, RLHF may produce outputs that are misaligned with human values. To mitigate this issue, we contribute a reward ensemble method that allows the reward model to make more accurate predictions. As using an ensemble of large language model-based reward models can be computationally and resource-expensive, we explore efficient ensemble methods including linear-layer ensemble and LoRA-based ensemble. Empirically, we run Best-of-$n$ and Proximal Policy Optimization with our ensembled reward models, and verify that our ensemble methods help improve the alignment performance of RLHF outputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16635v3,2024-01
ToPro: Token-Level Prompt Decomposition for Cross-Lingual Sequence Labeling Tasks,"Bolei Ma, Ercong Nie, Shuzhou Yuan, Helmut Schmid, Michael Färber, Frauke Kreuter, Hinrich Schütze","Prompt-based methods have been successfully applied to multilingual pretrained language models for zero-shot cross-lingual understanding. However, most previous studies primarily focused on sentence-level classification tasks, and only a few considered token-level labeling tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. In this paper, we propose Token-Level Prompt Decomposition (ToPro), which facilitates the prompt-based method for token-level sequence labeling tasks. The ToPro method decomposes an input sentence into single tokens and applies one prompt template to each token. Our experiments on multilingual NER and POS tagging datasets demonstrate that ToPro-based fine-tuning outperforms Vanilla fine-tuning and Prompt-Tuning in zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, especially for languages that are typologically different from the source language English. Our method also attains state-of-the-art performance when employed with the mT5 model. Besides, our exploratory study in multilingual large language models shows that ToPro performs much better than the current in-context learning method. Overall, the performance improvements show that ToPro could potentially serve as a novel and simple benchmarking method for sequence labeling tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16589v2,2024-01
A Linguistic Comparison between Human and ChatGPT-Generated Conversations,"Morgan Sandler, Hyesun Choung, Arun Ross, Prabu David","This study explores linguistic differences between human and LLM-generated dialogues, using 19.5K dialogues generated by ChatGPT-3.5 as a companion to the EmpathicDialogues dataset. The research employs Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis, comparing ChatGPT-generated conversations with human conversations across 118 linguistic categories. Results show greater variability and authenticity in human dialogues, but ChatGPT excels in categories such as social processes, analytical style, cognition, attentional focus, and positive emotional tone, reinforcing recent findings of LLMs being ""more human than human."" However, no significant difference was found in positive or negative affect between ChatGPT and human dialogues. Classifier analysis of dialogue embeddings indicates implicit coding of the valence of affect despite no explicit mention of affect in the conversations. The research also contributes a novel, companion ChatGPT-generated dataset of conversations between two independent chatbots, which were designed to replicate a corpus of human conversations available for open access and used widely in AI research on language modeling. Our findings enhance understanding of ChatGPT's linguistic capabilities and inform ongoing efforts to distinguish between human and LLM-generated text, which is critical in detecting AI-generated fakes, misinformation, and disinformation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16587v3,2024-01
Massively Multilingual Text Translation For Low-Resource Languages,Zhong Zhou,"Translation into severely low-resource languages has both the cultural goal of saving and reviving those languages and the humanitarian goal of assisting the everyday needs of local communities that are accelerated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. In many humanitarian efforts, translation into severely low-resource languages often does not require a universal translation engine, but a dedicated text-specific translation engine. For example, healthcare records, hygienic procedures, government communication, emergency procedures and religious texts are all limited texts. While generic translation engines for all languages do not exist, translation of multilingually known limited texts into new, low-resource languages may be possible and reduce human translation effort. We attempt to leverage translation resources from rich-resource languages to efficiently produce best possible translation quality for well known texts, which are available in multiple languages, in a new, low-resource language. To reach this goal, we argue that in translating a closed text into low-resource languages, generalization to out-of-domain texts is not necessary, but generalization to new languages is. Performance gain comes from massive source parallelism by careful choice of close-by language families, style-consistent corpus-level paraphrases within the same language and strategic adaptation of existing large pretrained multilingual models to the domain first and then to the language. Such performance gain makes it possible for machine translation systems to collaborate with human translators to expedite the translation process into new, low-resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16582v1,2024-01
Leveraging Professional Radiologists' Expertise to Enhance LLMs' Evaluation for Radiology Reports,"Qingqing Zhu, Xiuying Chen, Qiao Jin, Benjamin Hou, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Pritam Mukherjee, Xin Gao, Ronald M Summers, Zhiyong Lu","In radiology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced report generation, but automatic evaluation of these AI-produced reports remains challenging. Current metrics, such as Conventional Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Clinical Efficacy (CE), often fall short in capturing the semantic intricacies of clinical contexts or overemphasize clinical details, undermining report clarity. To overcome these issues, our proposed method synergizes the expertise of professional radiologists with Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 1. Utilizing In-Context Instruction Learning (ICIL) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, our approach aligns LLM evaluations with radiologist standards, enabling detailed comparisons between human and AI generated reports. This is further enhanced by a Regression model that aggregates sentence evaluation scores. Experimental results show that our ""Detailed GPT-4 (5-shot)"" model achieves a 0.48 score, outperforming the METEOR metric by 0.19, while our ""Regressed GPT-4"" model shows even greater alignment with expert evaluations, exceeding the best existing metric by a 0.35 margin. Moreover, the robustness of our explanations has been validated through a thorough iterative strategy. We plan to publicly release annotations from radiology experts, setting a new standard for accuracy in future assessments. This underscores the potential of our approach in enhancing the quality assessment of AI-driven medical reports.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16578v3,2024-01
LLMs as On-demand Customizable Service,"Souvika Sarkar, Mohammad Fakhruddin Babar, Monowar Hasan, Shubhra Kanti Karmaker","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable language understanding and generation capabilities. However, training, deploying, and accessing these models pose notable challenges, including resource-intensive demands, extended training durations, and scalability issues. To address these issues, we introduce a concept of hierarchical, distributed LLM architecture that aims at enhancing the accessibility and deployability of LLMs across heterogeneous computing platforms, including general-purpose computers (e.g., laptops) and IoT-style devices (e.g., embedded systems). By introducing a ""layered"" approach, the proposed architecture enables on-demand accessibility to LLMs as a customizable service. This approach also ensures optimal trade-offs between the available computational resources and the user's application needs. We envision that the concept of hierarchical LLM will empower extensive, crowd-sourced user bases to harness the capabilities of LLMs, thereby fostering advancements in AI technology in general.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16577v1,2024-01
Beyond Image-Text Matching: Verb Understanding in Multimodal Transformers Using Guided Masking,"Ivana Beňová, Jana Košecká, Michal Gregor, Martin Tamajka, Marcel Veselý, Marián Šimko","The dominant probing approaches rely on the zero-shot performance of image-text matching tasks to gain a finer-grained understanding of the representations learned by recent multimodal image-language transformer models. The evaluation is carried out on carefully curated datasets focusing on counting, relations, attributes, and others. This work introduces an alternative probing strategy called guided masking. The proposed approach ablates different modalities using masking and assesses the model's ability to predict the masked word with high accuracy. We focus on studying multimodal models that consider regions of interest (ROI) features obtained by object detectors as input tokens. We probe the understanding of verbs using guided masking on ViLBERT, LXMERT, UNITER, and VisualBERT and show that these models can predict the correct verb with high accuracy. This contrasts with previous conclusions drawn from image-text matching probing techniques that frequently fail in situations requiring verb understanding. The code for all experiments will be publicly available https://github.com/ivana-13/guided_masking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16575v1,2024-01
Autoencoder-Based Domain Learning for Semantic Communication with Conceptual Spaces,"Dylan Wheeler, Balasubramaniam Natarajan","Communication with the goal of accurately conveying meaning, rather than accurately transmitting symbols, has become an area of growing interest. This paradigm, termed semantic communication, typically leverages modern developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the efficiency and robustness of communication systems. However, a standard model for capturing and quantifying the details of ""meaning"" is lacking, with many leading approaches to semantic communication adopting a black-box framework with little understanding of what exactly the model is learning. One solution is to utilize the conceptual spaces framework, which models meaning explicitly in a geometric manner. Though prior work studying semantic communication with conceptual spaces has shown promising results, these previous attempts involve hand-crafting a conceptual space model, severely limiting the scalability and practicality of the approach. In this work, we develop a framework for learning a domain of a conceptual space model using only the raw data with high-level property labels. In experiments using the MNIST and CelebA datasets, we show that the domains learned using the framework maintain semantic similarity relations and possess interpretable dimensions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16569v1,2024-01
Multi-class Regret Detection in Hindi Devanagari Script,"Renuka Sharma, Sushama Nagpal, Sangeeta Sabharwal, Sabur Butt","The number of Hindi speakers on social media has increased dramatically in recent years. Regret is a common emotional experience in our everyday life. Many speakers on social media, share their regretful experiences and opinions regularly. It might cause a re-evaluation of one's choices and a desire to make a different option if given the chance. As a result, knowing the source of regret is critical for investigating its impact on behavior and decision-making. This study focuses on regret and how it is expressed, specifically in Hindi, on various social media platforms. In our study, we present a novel dataset from three different sources, where each sentence has been manually classified into one of three classes ""Regret by action"", ""Regret by inaction"", and ""No regret"". Next, we use this dataset to investigate the linguistic expressions of regret in Hindi text and also identify the textual domains that are most frequently associated with regret. Our findings indicate that individuals on social media platforms frequently express regret for both past inactions and actions, particularly within the domain of interpersonal relationships. We use a pre-trained BERT model to generate word embeddings for the Hindi dataset and also compare deep learning models with conventional machine learning models in order to demonstrate accuracy. Our results show that BERT embedding with CNN consistently surpassed other models. This described the effectiveness of BERT for conveying the context and meaning of words in the regret domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16561v1,2024-01
"Diverse, but Divisive: LLMs Can Exaggerate Gender Differences in Opinion Related to Harms of Misinformation","Terrence Neumann, Sooyong Lee, Maria De-Arteaga, Sina Fazelpour, Matthew Lease","The pervasive spread of misinformation and disinformation poses a significant threat to society. Professional fact-checkers play a key role in addressing this threat, but the vast scale of the problem forces them to prioritize their limited resources. This prioritization may consider a range of factors, such as varying risks of harm posed to specific groups of people. In this work, we investigate potential implications of using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate such prioritization. Because fact-checking impacts a wide range of diverse segments of society, it is important that diverse views are represented in the claim prioritization process. This paper examines whether a LLM can reflect the views of various groups when assessing the harms of misinformation, focusing on gender as a primary variable. We pose two central questions: (1) To what extent do prompts with explicit gender references reflect gender differences in opinion in the United States on topics of social relevance? and (2) To what extent do gender-neutral prompts align with gendered viewpoints on those topics? To analyze these questions, we present the TopicMisinfo dataset, containing 160 fact-checked claims from diverse topics, supplemented by nearly 1600 human annotations with subjective perceptions and annotator demographics. Analyzing responses to gender-specific and neutral prompts, we find that GPT 3.5-Turbo reflects empirically observed gender differences in opinion but amplifies the extent of these differences. These findings illuminate AI's complex role in moderating online communication, with implications for fact-checkers, algorithm designers, and the use of crowd-workers as annotators. We also release the TopicMisinfo dataset to support continuing research in the community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16558v1,2024-01
SelectLLM: Can LLMs Select Important Instructions to Annotate?,"Ritik Sachin Parkar, Jaehyung Kim, Jong Inn Park, Dongyeop Kang","Instruction tuning benefits from large and diverse datasets; however, creating such datasets involves a high cost of human labeling. While synthetic datasets generated by large language models (LLMs) have partly solved this issue, they often contain low-quality data. One effective solution is selectively annotating unlabelled instructions, especially given the relative ease of acquiring unlabeled instructions or texts from various sources. However, how to select unlabelled instructions is not well-explored, especially in the context of LLMs. Therefore, we introduce SelectLLM, an alternative framework that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to select unlabeled instructions more effectively. Specifically, SelectLLM consists of two key steps: Coreset-based clustering of unlabelled instructions for enlarging diversity and prompting of LLM to identify the most beneficial instructions within each cluster. We evaluate SelectLLM on AlpacaEval2 and MT-Bench, demonstrating its ability to outperform state-of-the-art methods like Alpagasus. In addition, we compare the performance and compatibility of SelectLLM with various LLMs, such as ChatGPT, LLaMA-3.1-70B, and Gemma-2-27b. SelectLLM's adaptability and robustness are further evidenced by its ability to maintain high performance across both human and synthetic datasets.

Yet, these emotions subtle distinctions and interplay are often overlooked in computational models. This paper introduces a dataset tailored to dissect the relationship between guilt and regret and their unique textual markers, filling a notable gap in affective computing research. Our approach treats guilt and regret recognition as a binary classification task and employs three machine learning and six transformer-based deep learning techniques to benchmark the newly created dataset. The study further implements innovative reasoning methods like chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought to assess the models interpretive logic. The results indicate a clear performance edge for transformer-based models, achieving a 90.4% macro F1 score compared to the 85.3% scored by the best machine learning classifier, demonstrating their superior capability in distinguishing complex emotional states.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16541v1,2024-01

This work proposes InfoLossQA, a framework to characterize and recover simplification-induced information loss in form of question-and-answer (QA) pairs. Building on the theory of Question Under Discussion, the QA pairs are designed to help readers deepen their knowledge of a text. We conduct a range of experiments with this framework. First, we collect a dataset of 1,000 linguist-curated QA pairs derived from 104 LLM simplifications of scientific abstracts of medical studies. Our analyses of this data reveal that information loss occurs frequently, and that the QA pairs give a high-level overview of what information was lost. Second, we devise two methods for this task: end-to-end prompting of open-source and commercial language models, and a natural language inference pipeline. With a novel evaluation framework considering the correctness of QA pairs and their linguistic suitability, our expert evaluation reveals that models struggle to reliably identify information loss and applying similar standards as humans at what constitutes information loss.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16475v2,2024-01
Two Stones Hit One Bird: Bilevel Positional Encoding for Better Length Extrapolation,"Zhenyu He, Guhao Feng, Shengjie Luo, Kai Yang, Liwei Wang, Jingjing Xu, Zhi Zhang, Hongxia Yang, Di He","In this work, we leverage the intrinsic segmentation of language sequences and design a new positional encoding method called Bilevel Positional Encoding (BiPE). For each position, our BiPE blends an intra-segment encoding and an inter-segment encoding. The intra-segment encoding identifies the locations within a segment and helps the model capture the semantic information therein via absolute positional encoding. The inter-segment encoding specifies the segment index, models the relationships between segments, and aims to improve extrapolation capabilities via relative positional encoding. Theoretical analysis shows this disentanglement of positional information makes learning more effective. The empirical results also show that our BiPE has superior length extrapolation capabilities across a wide range of tasks in diverse text modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16421v2,2024-01

ReGAL: Refactoring Programs to Discover Generalizable Abstractions,"Elias Stengel-Eskin, Archiki Prasad, Mohit Bansal","While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for program synthesis, they lack the global view needed to develop useful abstractions; they generally predict programs one at a time, often repeating the same functionality. Generating redundant code from scratch is both inefficient and error-prone. To address this, we propose Refactoring for Generalizable Abstraction Learning (ReGAL), a gradient-free method for learning a library of reusable functions via code refactorization, i.e., restructuring code without changing its execution output. ReGAL learns from a small set of existing programs, iteratively verifying and refining its abstractions via execution. We find that the shared function libraries discovered by ReGAL make programs easier to predict across diverse domains. On five datasets -- LOGO graphics generation, Date reasoning, TextCraft (a Minecraft-based text-game) MATH, and TabMWP -- both open-source and proprietary LLMs improve in accuracy when predicting programs with ReGAL functions. For CodeLlama-13B, ReGAL results in absolute accuracy increases of 11.5% on LOGO, 26.1% on date understanding, and 8.1% on TextCraft, outperforming GPT-3.5 in two of three domains. Our analysis reveals ReGAL's abstractions encapsulate frequently-used subroutines as well as environment dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16467v2,2024-01
Scaling Sparse Fine-Tuning to Large Language Models,"Alan Ansell, Ivan Vulić, Hannah Sterz, Anna Korhonen, Edoardo M. Ponti","Large Language Models (LLMs) are difficult to fully fine-tune (e.g., with instructions or human feedback) due to their sheer number of parameters. A family of parameter-efficient sparse fine-tuning methods have proven promising in terms of performance but their memory requirements increase proportionally to the size of the LLMs. In this work, we scale sparse fine-tuning to state-of-the-art LLMs like LLaMA 2 7B and 13B. We propose SpIEL, a novel sparse fine-tuning method which, for a desired density level, maintains an array of parameter indices and the deltas of these parameters relative to their pretrained values. It iterates over: (a) updating the active deltas, (b) pruning indices (based on the change of magnitude of their deltas) and (c) regrowth of indices. For regrowth, we explore two criteria based on either the accumulated gradients of a few candidate parameters or their approximate momenta estimated using the efficient SM3 optimizer. We experiment with instruction-tuning of LLMs on standard dataset mixtures, finding that SpIEL is often superior to popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA (low-rank adaptation) in terms of performance and comparable in terms of run time. We additionally show that SpIEL is compatible with both quantization and efficient optimizers, to facilitate scaling to ever-larger model sizes. We release the code for SpIEL at https://github.com/AlanAnsell/peft and for the instruction-tuning experiments at https://github.com/ducdauge/sft-llm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16405v2,2024-01

The corpus comprises over 10,000 pairs of sentences meticulously annotated by human annotators, sourced from public comments on Vietnam's most popular social media platforms. Various methods were used to evaluate our corpus, and the best-performing system achieved a result of 57.74% using the Error Reduction Rate (ERR) metric (van der Goot, 2019a) with the Leave-As-Is (LAI) baseline. For extrinsic evaluation, employing the model trained on ViLexNorm demonstrates the positive impact of the Vietnamese lexical normalization task on other NLP tasks. Our corpus is publicly available exclusively for research purposes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16403v2,2024-01
Rephrasing the Web: A Recipe for Compute and Data-Efficient Language Modeling,"Pratyush Maini, Skyler Seto, He Bai, David Grangier, Yizhe Zhang, Navdeep Jaitly","Large language models are trained on massive scrapes of the web, which are often unstructured, noisy, and poorly phrased. Current scaling laws show that learning from such data requires an abundance of both compute and data, which grows with the size of the model being trained. This is infeasible both because of the large compute costs and duration associated with pre-training, and the impending scarcity of high-quality data on the web. In this work, we propose Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training ($\textbf{WRAP}$) that uses an off-the-shelf instruction-tuned model prompted to paraphrase documents on the web in specific styles such as ""like Wikipedia"" or in ""question-answer format"" to jointly pre-train LLMs on real and synthetic rephrases. First, we show that using WRAP on the C4 dataset, which is naturally noisy, speeds up pre-training by $\sim3x$. At the same pre-training compute budget, it improves perplexity by more than 10% on average across different subsets of the Pile, and improves zero-shot question answer accuracy across 13 tasks by more than 2%. Second, we investigate the impact of the re-phrasing style on the performance of the model, offering insights into how the composition of the training data can impact the performance of LLMs in OOD settings. Our gains are attributed to the fact that re-phrased synthetic data has higher utility than just real data because it (i) incorporates style diversity that closely reflects downstream evaluation style, and (ii) has higher 'quality' than web-scraped data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16380v1,2024-01
TQCompressor: improving tensor decomposition methods in neural networks via permutations,"V. Abronin, A. Naumov, D. Mazur, D. Bystrov, K. Tsarova, Ar. Melnikov, I. Oseledets, S. Dolgov, R. Brasher, M. Perelshtein","We introduce TQCompressor, a novel method for neural network model compression with improved tensor decompositions. We explore the challenges posed by the computational and storage demands of pre-trained language models in NLP tasks and propose a permutation-based enhancement to Kronecker decomposition. This enhancement makes it possible to reduce loss in model expressivity which is usually associated with factorization. We demonstrate this method applied to the GPT-2$_{small}$. The result of the compression is TQCompressedGPT-2 model, featuring 81 mln. parameters compared to 124 mln. in the GPT-2$_{small}$. We make TQCompressedGPT-2 publicly available. We further enhance the performance of the TQCompressedGPT-2 through a training strategy involving multi-step knowledge distillation, using only a 3.1% of the OpenWebText. TQCompressedGPT-2 surpasses DistilGPT-2 and KnGPT-2 in comparative evaluations, marking an advancement in the efficient and effective deployment of models in resource-constrained environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16367v1,2024-01
ConFit: Improving Resume-Job Matching using Data Augmentation and Contrastive Learning,"Xiao Yu, Jinzhong Zhang, Zhou Yu","A reliable resume-job matching system helps a company find suitable candidates from a pool of resumes, and helps a job seeker find relevant jobs from a list of job posts. However, since job seekers apply only to a few jobs, interaction records in resume-job datasets are sparse. Different from many prior work that use complex modeling techniques, we tackle this sparsity problem using data augmentations and a simple contrastive learning approach. ConFit first creates an augmented resume-job dataset by paraphrasing specific sections in a resume or a job post. Then, ConFit uses contrastive learning to further increase training samples from $B$ pairs per batch to $O(B^2)$ per batch. We evaluate ConFit on two real-world datasets and find it outperforms prior methods (including BM25 and OpenAI text-ada-002) by up to 19% and 31% absolute in nDCG@10 for ranking jobs and ranking resumes, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16349v1,2024-01
Improving the TENOR of Labeling: Re-evaluating Topic Models for Content Analysis,"Zongxia Li, Andrew Mao, Daniel Stephens, Pranav Goel, Emily Walpole, Alden Dima, Juan Fung, Jordan Boyd-Graber","Topic models are a popular tool for understanding text collections, but their evaluation has been a point of contention. Automated evaluation metrics such as coherence are often used, however, their validity has been questioned for neural topic models (NTMs) and can overlook a models benefits in real world applications. To this end, we conduct the first evaluation of neural, supervised and classical topic models in an interactive task based setting. We combine topic models with a classifier and test their ability to help humans conduct content analysis and document annotation. From simulated, real user and expert pilot studies, the Contextual Neural Topic Model does the best on cluster evaluation metrics and human evaluations; however, LDA is competitive with two other NTMs under our simulated experiment and user study results, contrary to what coherence scores suggest. We show that current automated metrics do not provide a complete picture of topic modeling capabilities, but the right choice of NTMs can be better than classical models on practical task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16348v2,2024-01
Iterative Data Smoothing: Mitigating Reward Overfitting and Overoptimization in RLHF,"Banghua Zhu, Michael I. Jordan, Jiantao Jiao","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique that aligns language models closely with human-centric values. The initial phase of RLHF involves learning human values using a reward model from ranking data. It is observed that the performance of the reward model degrades after one epoch of training, and optimizing too much against the learned reward model eventually hinders the true objective. This paper delves into these issues, leveraging the theoretical insights to design improved reward learning algorithm termed 'Iterative Data Smoothing' (IDS). The core idea is that during each training epoch, we not only update the model with the data, but also update the date using the model, replacing hard labels with soft labels. Our empirical findings highlight the superior performance of this approach over the traditional methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16335v1,2024-01
Tradeoffs Between Alignment and Helpfulness in Language Models with Representation Engineering,"Yotam Wolf, Noam Wies, Dorin Shteyman, Binyamin Rothberg, Yoav Levine, Amnon Shashua","Language model alignment has become an important component of AI safety, allowing safe interactions between humans and language models, by enhancing desired behaviors and inhibiting undesired ones. It is often done by tuning the model or inserting preset aligning prompts. Recently, representation engineering, a method which alters the model's behavior via changing its representations post-training, was shown to be effective in aligning LLMs (Zou et al., 2023a). Representation engineering yields gains in alignment oriented tasks such as resistance to adversarial attacks and reduction of social biases, but was also shown to cause a decrease in the ability of the model to perform basic tasks. In this paper we study the tradeoff between the increase in alignment and decrease in helpfulness of the model. We propose a theoretical framework which provides bounds for these two quantities, and demonstrate their relevance empirically. First, we find that under the conditions of our framework, alignment can be guaranteed with representation engineering, and at the same time that helpfulness is harmed in the process. Second, we show that helpfulness is harmed quadratically with the norm of the representation engineering vector, while the alignment increases linearly with it, indicating a regime in which it is efficient to use representation engineering. We validate our findings empirically, and chart the boundaries to the usefulness of representation engineering for alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16332v4,2024-01
Machine Translation Meta Evaluation through Translation Accuracy Challenge Sets,"Nikita Moghe, Arnisa Fazla, Chantal Amrhein, Tom Kocmi, Mark Steedman, Alexandra Birch, Rico Sennrich, Liane Guillou","Recent machine translation (MT) metrics calibrate their effectiveness by correlating with human judgement but without any insights about their behaviour across different error types. Challenge sets are used to probe specific dimensions of metric behaviour but there are very few such datasets and they either focus on a limited number of phenomena or a limited number of language pairs. We introduce ACES, a contrastive challenge set spanning 146 language pairs, aimed at discovering whether metrics can identify 68 translation accuracy errors. These phenomena range from simple alterations at the word/character level to more complex errors based on discourse and real-world knowledge. We conduct a large-scale study by benchmarking ACES on 50 metrics submitted to the WMT 2022 and 2023 metrics shared tasks. We benchmark metric performance, assess their incremental performance over successive campaigns, and measure their sensitivity to a range of linguistic phenomena. We also investigate claims that Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective as MT evaluators by evaluating on ACES. Our results demonstrate that different metric families struggle with different phenomena and that LLM-based methods fail to demonstrate reliable performance. Our analyses indicate that most metrics ignore the source sentence, tend to prefer surface-level overlap and end up incorporating properties of base models which are not always beneficial. We expand ACES to include error span annotations, denoted as SPAN-ACES and we use this dataset to evaluate span-based error metrics showing these metrics also need considerable improvement. Finally, we provide a set of recommendations for building better MT metrics, including focusing on error labels instead of scores, ensembling, designing strategies to explicitly focus on the source sentence, focusing on semantic content and choosing the right base model for representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16313v1,2024-01
Textual Entailment for Effective Triple Validation in Object Prediction,"Andrés García-Silva, Cristian Berrío, José Manuel Gómez-Pérez","Knowledge base population seeks to expand knowledge graphs with facts that are typically extracted from a text corpus. Recently, language models pretrained on large corpora have been shown to contain factual knowledge that can be retrieved using cloze-style strategies. Such approach enables zero-shot recall of facts, showing competitive results in object prediction compared to supervised baselines. However, prompt-based fact retrieval can be brittle and heavily depend on the prompts and context used, which may produce results that are unintended or hallucinatory.We propose to use textual entailment to validate facts extracted from language models through cloze statements. Our results show that triple validation based on textual entailment improves language model predictions in different training regimes. Furthermore, we show that entailment-based triple validation is also effective to validate candidate facts extracted from other sources including existing knowledge graphs and text passages where named entities are recognized.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16293v1,2024-01
GAPS: Geometry-Aware Problem Solver,"Jiaxin Zhang, Yinghui Jiang, Yashar Moshfeghi","Geometry problem solving presents a formidable challenge within the NLP community. Existing approaches often rely on models designed for solving math word problems, neglecting the unique characteristics of geometry math problems. Additionally, the current research predominantly focuses on geometry calculation problems, while overlooking other essential aspects like proving. In this study, we address these limitations by proposing the Geometry-Aware Problem Solver (GAPS) model. GAPS is specifically designed to generate solution programs for geometry math problems of various types with the help of its unique problem-type classifier. To achieve this, GAPS treats the solution program as a composition of operators and operands, segregating their generation processes. Furthermore, we introduce the geometry elements enhancement method, which enhances the ability of GAPS to recognize geometry elements accurately. By leveraging these improvements, GAPS showcases remarkable performance in resolving geometry math problems. Our experiments conducted on the UniGeo dataset demonstrate the superiority of GAPS over the state-of-the-art model, Geoformer. Specifically, GAPS achieves an accuracy improvement of more than 5.3% for calculation tasks and an impressive 41.1% for proving tasks. Notably, GAPS achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.5% on proving problems, representing a significant advancement in solving geometry proving tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16287v1,2024-01
Capturing Pertinent Symbolic Features for Enhanced Content-Based Misinformation Detection,"Flavio Merenda, José Manuel Gómez-Pérez","Preventing the spread of misinformation is challenging. The detection of misleading content presents a significant hurdle due to its extreme linguistic and domain variability. Content-based models have managed to identify deceptive language by learning representations from textual data such as social media posts and web articles. However, aggregating representative samples of this heterogeneous phenomenon and implementing effective real-world applications is still elusive. Based on analytical work on the language of misinformation, this paper analyzes the linguistic attributes that characterize this phenomenon and how representative of such features some of the most popular misinformation datasets are. We demonstrate that the appropriate use of pertinent symbolic knowledge in combination with neural language models is helpful in detecting misleading content. Our results achieve state-of-the-art performance in misinformation datasets across the board, showing that our approach offers a valid and robust alternative to multi-task transfer learning without requiring any additional training data. Furthermore, our results show evidence that structured knowledge can provide the extra boost required to address a complex and unpredictable real-world problem like misinformation detection, not only in terms of accuracy but also time efficiency and resource utilization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16285v1,2024-01
MAPLE: Micro Analysis of Pairwise Language Evolution for Few-Shot Claim Verification,"Xia Zeng, Arkaitz Zubiaga","Claim verification is an essential step in the automated fact-checking pipeline which assesses the veracity of a claim against a piece of evidence.

Towards Optimizing the Costs of LLM Usage,"Shivanshu Shekhar, Tanishq Dubey, Koyel Mukherjee, Apoorv Saxena, Atharv Tyagi, Nishanth Kotla","Generative AI and LLMs in particular are heavily used nowadays for various document processing tasks such as question answering and summarization. However, different LLMs come with different capabilities for different tasks as well as with different costs, tokenization, and latency. In fact, enterprises are already incurring huge costs of operating or using LLMs for their respective use cases.   In this work, we propose optimizing the usage costs of LLMs by estimating their output quality (without actually invoking the LLMs), and then solving an optimization routine for the LLM selection to either keep costs under a budget, or minimize the costs, in a quality and latency aware manner. We propose a model to predict the output quality of LLMs on document processing tasks like summarization, followed by an LP rounding algorithm to optimize the selection of LLMs. We study optimization problems trading off the quality and costs, both theoretically and empirically. We further propose a sentence simplification model for reducing the number of tokens in a controlled manner. Additionally, we propose several deterministic heuristics for reducing tokens in a quality aware manner, and study the related optimization problem of applying the heuristics optimizing the quality and cost trade-off. We perform extensive empirical validation of our methods on not only enterprise datasets but also on open-source datasets, annotated by us, and show that we perform much better compared to closest baselines. Our methods reduce costs by 40%- 90% while improving quality by 4%-7%. We will release the annotated open source datasets to the community for further research and exploration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01742v1,2024-01
CO2: Efficient Distributed Training with Full Communication-Computation Overlap,"Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin, Weixuan Sun, Shidi Li, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Yu Qiao, Yiran Zhong","The fundamental success of large language models hinges upon the efficacious implementation of large-scale distributed training techniques. Nevertheless, building a vast, high-performance cluster featuring high-speed communication interconnectivity is prohibitively costly, and accessible only to prominent entities. In this work, we aim to lower this barrier and democratize large-scale training with limited bandwidth clusters. We propose a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmunication with COmputation. CO2 is able to attain a high scalability even on extensive multi-node clusters constrained by very limited communication bandwidth. We further propose the staleness gap penalty and outer momentum clipping techniques together with CO2 to bolster its convergence and training stability. Besides, CO2 exhibits seamless integration with well-established ZeRO-series optimizers which mitigate memory consumption of model states with large model training. We also provide a mathematical proof of convergence, accompanied by the establishment of a stringent upper bound. Furthermore, we validate our findings through an extensive set of practical experiments encompassing a wide range of tasks in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. These experiments serve to demonstrate the capabilities of CO2 in terms of convergence, generalization, and scalability when deployed across configurations comprising up to 128 A100 GPUs. The outcomes emphasize the outstanding capacity of CO2 to hugely improve scalability, no matter on clusters with 800Gbps RDMA or 80Gbps TCP/IP inter-node connections.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16265v1,2024-01
Development and Testing of a Novel Large Language Model-Based Clinical Decision Support Systems for Medication Safety in 12 Clinical Specialties,"Jasmine Chiat Ling Ong, Liyuan Jin, Kabilan Elangovan, Gilbert Yong San Lim, Daniel Yan Zheng Lim, Gerald Gui Ren Sng, Yuhe Ke, Joshua Yi Min Tung, Ryan Jian Zhong, Christopher Ming Yao Koh, Keane Zhi Hao Lee, Xiang Chen, Jack Kian Chng, Aung Than, Ken Junyang Goh, Daniel Shu Wei Ting","Importance: We introduce a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-Large Language Model (LLM) framework as a Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) to support safe medication prescription.   Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based CDSS in correctly identifying medication errors in different patient case vignettes from diverse medical and surgical sub-disciplines, against a human expert panel derived ground truth. We compared performance for under 2 different CDSS practical healthcare integration modalities: LLM-based CDSS alone (fully autonomous mode) vs junior pharmacist + LLM-based CDSS (co-pilot, assistive mode).   Design, Setting, and Participants: Utilizing a RAG model with state-of-the-art medically-related LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.0 and Med-PaLM 2), this study used 61 prescribing error scenarios embedded into 23 complex clinical vignettes across 12 different medical and surgical specialties. A multidisciplinary expert panel assessed these cases for Drug-Related Problems (DRPs) using the PCNE classification and graded severity / potential for harm using revised NCC MERP medication error index. We compared.   Results RAG-LLM performed better compared to LLM alone. When employed in a co-pilot mode, accuracy, recall, and F1 scores were optimized, indicating effectiveness in identifying moderate to severe DRPs. The accuracy of DRP detection with RAG-LLM improved in several categories but at the expense of lower precision.   Conclusions This study established that a RAG-LLM based CDSS significantly boosts the accuracy of medication error identification when used alongside junior pharmacists (co-pilot), with notable improvements in detecting severe DRPs. This study also illuminates the comparative performance of current state-of-the-art LLMs in RAG-based CDSS systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01741v2,2024-01

One particular challenge is the potential for evaluation datasets to overlap with training data, either directly or indirectly, which can lead to skewed results and overestimation of model performance. As a consequence, human evaluation is gaining increasing interest as a means to assess the performance and reliability of models. One such method is the red teaming approach, which aims to generate edge cases where a model will produce critical errors. While this methodology is becoming standard practice for generative AI, its application to the realm of conditional AI remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first study on human-based red teaming for Machine Translation (MT), marking a significant step towards understanding and improving the performance of translation models.

Reducing Selection Bias in Large Language Models,"J. E. Eicher, R. F. Irgolič","Large Language Models (LLMs) like gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and claude-instant-1.2 are vital in interpreting and executing semantic tasks. Unfortunately, these models' inherent biases adversely affect their performance Particularly affected is object selection from lists; a fundamental operation in digital navigation and decision-making. This research critically examines these biases and quantifies the effects on a representative list selection task. To explore these biases, we experiment manipulating temperature, list length, object identity, object type, prompt complexity, and model. We isolated and measured the influence of the biases on selection behavior. Our findings show that bias structure is strongly dependent on the model, with object type modulating the magnitude of the effect. With a strong primacy effect, causing the first objects in a list to be disproportionately represented in outputs. The usage of guard rails, a prompt engineering method of ensuring a response structure, increases bias and decreases instruction adherence when to a selection task. The bias is ablated when the guard rail step is separated from the list sampling step, lowering the complexity of each individual task. We provide LLM applications and theoretically suggest that LLMs experience a form of cognitive load that is compensated for with bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01740v3,2024-01
Combining Hierachical VAEs with LLMs for clinically meaningful timeline summarisation in social media,"Jiayu Song, Jenny Chim, Adam Tsakalidis, Julia Ive, Dana Atzil-Slonim, Maria Liakata","We introduce a hybrid abstractive summarisation approach combining hierarchical VAE with LLMs (LlaMA-2) to produce clinically meaningful summaries from social media user timelines, appropriate for mental health monitoring. The summaries combine two different narrative points of view: clinical insights in third person useful for a clinician are generated by feeding into an LLM specialised clinical prompts, and importantly, a temporally sensitive abstractive summary of the user's timeline in first person, generated by a novel hierarchical variational autoencoder, TH-VAE. We assess the generated summaries via automatic evaluation against expert summaries and via human evaluation with clinical experts, showing that timeline summarisation by TH-VAE results in more factual and logically coherent summaries rich in clinical utility and superior to LLM-only approaches in capturing changes over time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16240v2,2024-01

Vocabulary-Defined Semantics: Latent Space Clustering for Improving In-Context Learning,"Jian Gu, Aldeida Aleti, Chunyang Chen, Hongyu Zhang","In-context learning enables language models (LM) to adapt to downstream data or tasks by incorporating few samples as demonstrations within the prompts. It offers strong performance without the expense of fine-tuning. However, the performance of in-context learning can be unstable depending on the quality, format, or order of demonstrations, which in turn exacerbates the difficulty of optimization. Prior work, such as Knn Prompting, index samples based on the similarities of logits at the output-side, in addition to the regular retrieval operation at the input-side. They improve in-context learning by leveraging the core ability of next-token prediction, rather than relying solely on the emergent capacity to make analogies. Despite this, the hard-to-optimize issue of in-context learning still exists. In our view, it stems from the process of selecting demonstrations. To address this, we propose complementing in-context learning with an additional clustering operation. We propose a novel approach ""vocabulary-defined semantics"". Grounded in LM vocabulary, which is the label space of model outputs, the proposed approach computes semantically equivalent latent representations for output labels. Then, taking the representations as centroids, a clustering operation is performed to align the semantic properties between the language model and the downstream data/tasks. Based on extensive experiments across diverse textual understanding datasets and multiple models, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. On average, it achieves $3\%-49\%$ improvements while requiring only half of the computation time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16184v6,2024-01

Mobile-Agent: Autonomous Multi-Modal Mobile Device Agent with Visual Perception,"Junyang Wang, Haiyang Xu, Jiabo Ye, Ming Yan, Weizhou Shen, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Jitao Sang","Mobile device agent based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) is becoming a popular application. In this paper, we introduce Mobile-Agent, an autonomous multi-modal mobile device agent. Mobile-Agent first leverages visual perception tools to accurately identify and locate both the visual and textual elements within the app's front-end interface. Based on the perceived vision context, it then autonomously plans and decomposes the complex operation task, and navigates the mobile Apps through operations step by step. Different from previous solutions that rely on XML files of Apps or mobile system metadata, Mobile-Agent allows for greater adaptability across diverse mobile operating environments in a vision-centric way, thereby eliminating the necessity for system-specific customizations. To assess the performance of Mobile-Agent, we introduced Mobile-Eval, a benchmark for evaluating mobile device operations. Based on Mobile-Eval, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Mobile-Agent. The experimental results indicate that Mobile-Agent achieved remarkable accuracy and completion rates.

X-PEFT: eXtremely Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Extreme Multi-Profile Scenarios,"Namju Kwak, Taesup Kim","Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as adapter tuning, aim to fine-tune a pre-trained language model (PLM) using a minimal number of parameters for a specific task or profile. Although adapter tuning provides increased parameter efficiency compared to full-model fine-tuning, it introduces a small set of additional parameters attached to a PLM for each profile. This can become problematic in practical applications with multiple profiles, particularly when a significant increase in the number of profiles linearly boosts the total number of additional parameters. To mitigate this issue, we introduce X-PEFT, a novel PEFT method that leverages a multitude of given adapters by fine-tuning an extremely small set of compact tensors for a new profile, which serve as binary masks to adaptively select the given adapters. To efficiently validate our proposed method, we implement it using a large number of trained or untrained (random) adapters. We evaluate the performance of X-PEFT through LaMP and GLUE tasks and demonstrate that it either matches or surpasses the effectiveness of conventional adapter tuning, despite reducing the memory requirements per profile by a factor of 10,000 compared to it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16137v1,2024-01
Beyond Direct Diagnosis: LLM-based Multi-Specialist Agent Consultation for Automatic Diagnosis,"Haochun Wang, Sendong Zhao, Zewen Qiang, Nuwa Xi, Bing Qin, Ting Liu","Automatic diagnosis is a significant application of AI in healthcare, where diagnoses are generated based on the symptom description of patients. Previous works have approached this task directly by modeling the relationship between the normalized symptoms and all possible diseases. However, in the clinical diagnostic process, patients are initially consulted by a general practitioner and, if necessary, referred to specialists in specific domains for a more comprehensive evaluation. The final diagnosis often emerges from a collaborative consultation among medical specialist groups. Recently, large language models have shown impressive capabilities in natural language understanding. In this study, we adopt tuning-free LLM-based agents as medical practitioners and propose the Agent-derived Multi-Specialist Consultation (AMSC) framework to model the diagnosis process in the real world by adaptively fusing probability distributions of agents over potential diseases. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with baselines. Notably, our approach requires significantly less parameter updating and training time, enhancing efficiency and practical utility. Furthermore, we delve into a novel perspective on the role of implicit symptoms within the context of automatic diagnosis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16107v1,2024-01
OpenMoE: An Early Effort on Open Mixture-of-Experts Language Models,"Fuzhao Xue, Zian Zheng, Yao Fu, Jinjie Ni, Zangwei Zheng, Wangchunshu Zhou, Yang You","To help the open-source community have a better understanding of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based large language models (LLMs), we train and release OpenMoE, a series of fully open-sourced and reproducible decoder-only MoE LLMs, ranging from 650M to 34B parameters and trained on up to over 1T tokens. Our investigation confirms that MoE-based LLMs can offer a more favorable cost-effectiveness trade-off than dense LLMs, highlighting the potential effectiveness for future LLM development.   One more important contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the routing mechanisms within our OpenMoE models, leading to three significant findings: Context-Independent Specialization, Early Routing Learning, and Drop-towards-the-End. We discovered that routing decisions in MoE models are predominantly based on token IDs, with minimal context relevance. The token-to-expert assignments are determined early in the pre-training phase and remain largely unchanged. This imperfect routing can result in performance degradation, particularly in sequential tasks like multi-turn conversations, where tokens appearing later in a sequence are more likely to be dropped. Finally, we rethink our design based on the above-mentioned observations and analysis. To facilitate future MoE LLM development, we propose potential strategies for mitigating the issues we found and further improving off-the-shelf MoE LLM designs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01739v2,2024-01
Multilingual Text-to-Image Generation Magnifies Gender Stereotypes and Prompt Engineering May Not Help You,"Felix Friedrich, Katharina Hämmerl, Patrick Schramowski, Manuel Brack, Jindrich Libovicky, Kristian Kersting, Alexander Fraser","Text-to-image generation models have recently achieved astonishing results in image quality, flexibility, and text alignment, and are consequently employed in a fast-growing number of applications. Through improvements in multilingual abilities, a larger community now has access to this technology. However, our results show that multilingual models suffer from significant gender biases just as monolingual models do. Furthermore, the natural expectation that multilingual models will provide similar results across languages does not hold up. Instead, there are important differences between languages. We propose a novel benchmark, MAGBIG, intended to foster research on gender bias in multilingual models. We use MAGBIG to investigate the effect of multilingualism on gender bias in T2I models. To this end, we construct multilingual prompts requesting portraits of people with a certain occupation or trait. Our results show that not only do models exhibit strong gender biases but they also behave differently across languages. Furthermore, we investigate prompt engineering strategies, such as indirect, neutral formulations, to mitigate these biases. Unfortunately, these approaches have limited success and result in worse text-to-image alignment. Consequently, we call for more research into diverse representations across languages in image generators, as well as into steerability to address biased model behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16092v3,2024-01
Image-Text Out-Of-Context Detection Using Synthetic Multimodal Misinformation,"Fatma Shalabi, Huy H. Nguyen, Hichem Felouat, Ching-Chun Chang, Isao Echizen","Misinformation has become a major challenge in the era of increasing digital information, requiring the development of effective detection methods. We have investigated a novel approach to Out-Of-Context detection (OOCD) that uses synthetic data generation. We created a dataset specifically designed for OOCD and developed an efficient detector for accurate classification. Our experimental findings validate the use of synthetic data generation and demonstrate its efficacy in addressing the data limitations associated with OOCD. The dataset and detector should serve as valuable resources for future research and the development of robust misinformation detection systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08783v1,2024-01
Non-Fluent Synthetic Target-Language Data Improve Neural Machine Translation,"Víctor M. Sánchez-Cartagena, Miquel Esplà-Gomis, Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz, Felipe Sánchez-Martínez","When the amount of parallel sentences available to train a neural machine translation is scarce, a common practice is to generate new synthetic training samples from them. A number of approaches have been proposed to produce synthetic parallel sentences that are similar to those in the parallel data available. These approaches work under the assumption that non-fluent target-side synthetic training samples can be harmful and may deteriorate translation performance. Even so, in this paper we demonstrate that synthetic training samples with non-fluent target sentences can improve translation performance if they are used in a multilingual machine translation framework as if they were sentences in another language. We conducted experiments on ten low-resource and four high-resource translation tasks and found out that this simple approach consistently improves translation performance as compared to state-of-the-art methods for generating synthetic training samples similar to those found in corpora. Furthermore, this improvement is independent of the size of the original training corpus, the resulting systems are much more robust against domain shift and produce less hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16086v1,2024-01
Understanding the effects of word-level linguistic annotations in under-resourced neural machine translation,"Víctor M. Sánchez-Cartagena, Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz, Felipe Sánchez-Martínez","This paper studies the effects of word-level linguistic annotations in under-resourced neural machine translation, for which there is incomplete evidence in the literature. The study covers eight language pairs, different training corpus sizes, two architectures, and three types of annotation: dummy tags (with no linguistic information at all), part-of-speech tags, and morpho-syntactic description tags, which consist of part of speech and morphological features. These linguistic annotations are interleaved in the input or output streams as a single tag placed before each word. In order to measure the performance under each scenario, we use automatic evaluation metrics and perform automatic error classification. Our experiments show that, in general, source-language annotations are helpful and morpho-syntactic descriptions outperform part of speech for some language pairs. On the contrary, when words are annotated in the target language, part-of-speech tags systematically outperform morpho-syntactic description tags in terms of automatic evaluation metrics, even though the use of morpho-syntactic description tags improves the grammaticality of the output. We provide a detailed analysis of the reasons behind this result.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16078v1,2024-01
Stolen Subwords: Importance of Vocabularies for Machine Translation Model Stealing,Vilém Zouhar,"In learning-based functionality stealing, the attacker is trying to build a local model based on the victim's outputs. The attacker has to make choices regarding the local model's architecture, optimization method and, specifically for NLP models, subword vocabulary, such as BPE. On the machine translation task, we explore (1) whether the choice of the vocabulary plays a role in model stealing scenarios and (2) if it is possible to extract the victim's vocabulary. We find that the vocabulary itself does not have a large effect on the local model's performance. Given gray-box model access, it is possible to collect the victim's vocabulary by collecting the outputs (detokenized subwords on the output). The results of the minimum effect of vocabulary choice are important more broadly for black-box knowledge distillation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16055v1,2024-01
Prompt4Vis: Prompting Large Language Models with Example Mining and Schema Filtering for Tabular Data Visualization,"Shuaimin Li, Xuanang Chen, Yuanfeng Song, Yunze Song, Chen Zhang","Data visualization (DV) systems are increasingly recognized for their profound capability to uncover insights from vast datasets, gaining attention across both industry and academia. Crafting data queries is an essential process within certain declarative visualization languages (DVLs, e.g., Vega-Lite, EChart.). The evolution of natural language processing (NLP) technologies has streamlined the use of natural language interfaces to visualize tabular data, offering a more accessible and intuitive user experience. However, current methods for converting natural language questions into data visualization queries, such as Seq2Vis, ncNet, and RGVisNet, despite utilizing complex neural network architectures, still fall short of expectations and have great room for improvement.   Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have established new benchmarks in a variety of NLP tasks, fundamentally altering the landscape of the field. Inspired by these advancements, we introduce a novel framework, Prompt4Vis, leveraging LLMs and in-context learning to enhance the performance of generating data visualization from natural language. Prompt4Vis comprises two key components: (1) a multi-objective example mining module, designed to find out the truly effective examples that strengthen the LLM's in-context learning capabilities for text-to-vis; (2) a schema filtering module, which is proposed to simplify the schema of the database. Extensive experiments through 5-fold cross-validation on the NVBench dataset demonstrate the superiority of Prompt4Vis, which notably surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) RGVisNet by approximately 35.9% and 71.3% on dev and test sets, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, Prompt4Vis is the first work that introduces in-context learning into the text-to-vis for generating data visualization queries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07909v1,2024-01
Credit Risk Meets Large Language Models: Building a Risk Indicator from Loan Descriptions in P2P Lending,"Mario Sanz-Guerrero, Javier Arroyo","Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has emerged as a distinctive financing mechanism, linking borrowers with lenders through online platforms. However, P2P lending faces the challenge of information asymmetry, as lenders often lack sufficient data to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue by leveraging the textual descriptions provided by borrowers during the loan application process. Our methodology involves processing these textual descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM), a powerful tool capable of discerning patterns and semantics within the text. Transfer learning is applied to adapt the LLM to the specific task at hand.   Our results derived from the analysis of the Lending Club dataset show that the risk score generated by BERT, a widely used LLM, significantly improves the performance of credit risk classifiers. However, the inherent opacity of LLM-based systems, coupled with uncertainties about potential biases, underscores critical considerations for regulatory frameworks and engenders trust-related concerns among end-users, opening new avenues for future research in the dynamic landscape of P2P lending and artificial intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16458v2,2024-01
Finding Challenging Metaphors that Confuse Pretrained Language Models,"Yucheng Li, Frank Guerin, Chenghua Lin","Metaphors are considered to pose challenges for a wide spectrum of NLP tasks. This gives rise to the area of computational metaphor processing. However, it remains unclear what types of metaphors challenge current state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we test various NLP models on the VUA metaphor dataset and quantify to what extent metaphors affect models' performance on various downstream tasks. Analysis reveals that VUA includes a large number of metaphors that pose little difficulty to downstream tasks. We would like to shift the attention of researchers away from these metaphors to instead focus on challenging metaphors. To identify hard metaphors, we propose an automatic pipeline that identifies metaphors that challenge a particular model. Our analysis demonstrates that our detected hard metaphors contrast significantly with VUA and reduce the accuracy of machine translation by 16\%, QA performance by 4\%, NLI by 7\%, and metaphor identification recall by over 14\% for various popular NLP systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16012v1,2024-01
C4Q: A Chatbot for Quantum,"Yaiza Aragonés-Soria, Manuel Oriol","Quantum computing is a growing field that promises many real-world applications such as quantum cryptography or quantum finance. The number of people able to use quantum computing is however still very small. This limitation comes from the difficulty to understand the concepts and to know how to start coding. Therefore, there is a need for tools that can assist non-expert in overcoming this complexity. One possibility would be to use existing conversational agents. Unfortunately ChatGPT and other Large-Language Models produce inaccurate results. This article presents C4Q, a chatbot that answers accurately basic questions and guides users when trying to code quantum programs. Contrary to other approaches C4Q uses a pre-trained large language model only to discover and classify user requests. It then generates an accurate answer using an own engine. Thanks to this architectural design, C4Q's answers are always correct, and thus C4Q can become a support tool that makes quantum computing more available to non-experts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01738v1,2024-01
Assistive Large Language Model Agents for Socially-Aware Negotiation Dialogues,"Yuncheng Hua, Lizhen Qu, Gholamreza Haffari","We develop assistive agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that aid interlocutors in business negotiations.

We introduce a simple tuning-free and label-free In-Context Learning (ICL) method to identify high-quality ICL exemplars for the remediator, where we propose a novel select criteria, called value impact, to measure the quality of the negotiation outcomes. We provide rich empirical evidence to demonstrate its effectiveness in negotiations across three different negotiation topics.

The Socially-Aware Dialogue Assistant System (SADAS) is our answer to this global challenge, and it's designed to ensure that conversations between individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds unfold with respect and understanding. Our system's novel architecture includes: (1) identifying the categories of norms present in the dialogue, (2) detecting potential norm violations, (3) evaluating the severity of these violations, (4) implementing targeted remedies to rectify the breaches, and (5) articulates the rationale behind these corrective actions. We employ a series of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) techniques to build different modules, and conduct numerous experiments to select the most suitable backbone model for each of the modules. We also design a human preference experiment to validate the overall performance of the system. We will open-source our system (including source code, tools and applications), hoping to advance future research. A demo video of our system can be found at:~\url{https://youtu.be/JqetWkfsejk}.

Response Generation for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Large Language Models: Comparative Study with Socratic Questioning,"Kenta Izumi, Hiroki Tanaka, Kazuhiro Shidara, Hiroyoshi Adachi, Daisuke Kanayama, Takashi Kudo, Satoshi Nakamura","Dialogue systems controlled by predefined or rule-based scenarios derived from counseling techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), play an important role in mental health apps. Despite the need for responsible responses, it is conceivable that using the newly emerging LLMs to generate contextually relevant utterances will enhance these apps. In this study, we construct dialogue modules based on a CBT scenario focused on conventional Socratic questioning using two kinds of LLMs: a Transformer-based dialogue model further trained with a social media empathetic counseling dataset, provided by Osaka Prefecture (OsakaED), and GPT-4, a state-of-the art LLM created by OpenAI. By comparing systems that use LLM-generated responses with those that do not, we investigate the impact of generated responses on subjective evaluations such as mood change, cognitive change, and dialogue quality (e.g., empathy). As a result, no notable improvements are observed when using the OsakaED model. When using GPT-4, the amount of mood change, empathy, and other dialogue qualities improve significantly. Results suggest that GPT-4 possesses a high counseling ability. However, they also indicate that even when using a dialogue model trained with a human counseling dataset, it does not necessarily yield better outcomes compared to scenario-based dialogues. While presenting LLM-generated responses, including GPT-4, and having them interact directly with users in real-life mental health care services may raise ethical issues, it is still possible for human professionals to produce example responses or response templates using LLMs in advance in systems that use rules, scenarios, or example responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15966v1,2024-01
NoFunEval: Funny How Code LMs Falter on Requirements Beyond Functional Correctness,"Manav Singhal, Tushar Aggarwal, Abhijeet Awasthi, Nagarajan Natarajan, Aditya Kanade","Existing evaluation benchmarks of language models of code (code LMs) focus almost exclusively on whether the LMs can generate functionally-correct code. In real-world software engineering, developers think beyond functional correctness. They have requirements on ""how"" a functionality should be implemented to meet overall system design objectives like efficiency, security, and maintainability. They would also trust the code LMs more if the LMs demonstrate robust understanding of such requirements.   We propose a new benchmark NoFunEval to evaluate code LMs on non-functional requirements and simple classification instances for both functional and non-functional requirements. We propose a prompting method, Coding Concepts (CoCo), as a way for a developer to communicate the domain knowledge to the LMs. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 27 code LMs. Our finding is that LMs generally falter when tested on our benchmark, hinting at fundamental blindspots in their training setups. Surprisingly, even the classification accuracy on functional-correctness instances derived from the popular HumanEval benchmark is low, calling in question the depth of their comprehension and the source of their success in generating functionally-correct code in the first place. We release our benchmark and evaluation scripts publicly at https://aka.ms/NoFunEval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15963v3,2024-01
VIALM: A Survey and Benchmark of Visually Impaired Assistance with Large Models,"Yi Zhao, Yilin Zhang, Rong Xiang, Jing Li, Hillming Li","Visually Impaired Assistance (VIA) aims to automatically help the visually impaired (VI) handle daily activities. The advancement of VIA primarily depends on developments in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), both of which exhibit cutting-edge paradigms with large models (LMs). Furthermore, LMs have shown exceptional multimodal abilities to tackle challenging physically-grounded tasks such as embodied robots. To investigate the potential and limitations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LMs' capabilities in VIA applications, we present an extensive study for the task of VIA with LMs (VIALM). In this task, given an image illustrating the physical environments and a linguistic request from a VI user, VIALM aims to output step-by-step guidance to assist the VI user in fulfilling the request grounded in the environment. The study consists of a survey reviewing recent LM research and benchmark experiments examining selected LMs' capabilities in VIA. The results indicate that while LMs can potentially benefit VIA, their output cannot be well environment-grounded (i.e., 25.7% GPT-4's responses) and lacks fine-grained guidance (i.e., 32.1% GPT-4's responses).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01735v2,2024-01
CFTM: Continuous time fractional topic model,"Kei Nakagawa, Kohei Hayashi, Yugo Fujimoto","In this paper, we propose the Continuous Time Fractional Topic Model (cFTM), a new method for dynamic topic modeling. This approach incorporates fractional Brownian motion~(fBm) to effectively identify positive or negative correlations in topic and word distribution over time, revealing long-term dependency or roughness. Our theoretical analysis shows that the cFTM can capture these long-term dependency or roughness in both topic and word distributions, mirroring the main characteristics of fBm. Moreover, we prove that the parameter estimation process for the cFTM is on par with that of LDA, traditional topic models. To demonstrate the cFTM's property, we conduct empirical study using economic news articles. The results from these tests support the model's ability to identify and track long-term dependency or roughness in topics over time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01734v2,2024-01
E-EVAL: A Comprehensive Chinese K-12 Education Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models,"Jinchang Hou, Chang Ao, Haihong Wu, Xiangtao Kong, Zhigang Zheng, Daijia Tang, Chengming Li, Xiping Hu, Ruifeng Xu, Shiwen Ni, Min Yang","With the accelerating development of Large Language Models (LLMs), many LLMs are beginning to be used in the Chinese K-12 education domain. The integration of LLMs and education is getting closer and closer, however, there is currently no benchmark for evaluating LLMs that focuses on the Chinese K-12 education domain. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive natural language processing benchmark to accurately assess the capabilities of various LLMs in the Chinese K-12 education domain. To address this, we introduce the E-EVAL, the first comprehensive evaluation benchmark specifically designed for the Chinese K-12 education field. The E-EVAL consists of 4,351 multiple-choice questions at the primary, middle, and high school levels across a wide range of subjects, including Chinese, English, Politics, History, Ethics, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Geography. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of E-EVAL on advanced LLMs, including both English-dominant and Chinese-dominant models. Findings show that Chinese-dominant models perform well compared to English-dominant models, with many scoring even above the GPT 4.0. However, almost all models perform poorly in complex subjects such as mathematics. We also found that most Chinese-dominant LLMs did not achieve higher scores at the primary school level compared to the middle school level. We observe that the mastery of higher-order knowledge by the model does not necessarily imply the mastery of lower-order knowledge as well. Additionally, the experimental results indicate that the Chain of Thought (CoT) technique is effective only for the challenging science subjects, while Few-shot prompting is more beneficial for liberal arts subjects. With E-EVAL, we aim to analyze the strengths and limitations of LLMs in educational applications, and to contribute to the progress and development of Chinese K-12 education and LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15927v1,2024-01
KAUCUS: Knowledge Augmented User Simulators for Training Language Model Assistants,Kaustubh D. Dhole,"An effective multi-turn instruction-following assistant can be developed by creating a simulator that can generate useful interaction data. Apart from relying on its intrinsic weights, an ideal user simulator should also be able to bootstrap external knowledge rapidly in its raw form to simulate the multifarious diversity of text available over the internet. Previous user simulators generally lacked diversity, were mostly closed domain, and necessitated rigid schema making them inefficient to rapidly scale to incorporate external knowledge. In this regard, we introduce, Kaucus, a Knowledge-Augmented User Simulator framework, to outline a process of creating diverse user simulators, that can seamlessly exploit external knowledge as well as benefit downstream assistant model training. Through two GPT-J based simulators viz., a Retrieval Augmented Simulator and a Summary Controlled Simulator we generate diverse simulator-assistant interactions. Through reward and preference model-based evaluations, we find that these interactions serve as useful training data and create more helpful downstream assistants. We also find that incorporating knowledge through retrieval augmentation or summary control helps create better assistants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16454v1,2024-01
Development and Testing of Retrieval Augmented Generation in Large Language Models -- A Case Study Report,"YuHe Ke, Liyuan Jin, Kabilan Elangovan, Hairil Rizal Abdullah, Nan Liu, Alex Tiong Heng Sia, Chai Rick Soh, Joshua Yi Min Tung, Jasmine Chiat Ling Ong, Daniel Shu Wei Ting","Purpose: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for medical applications. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising approach for customizing domain knowledge in LLMs. This case study presents the development and evaluation of an LLM-RAG pipeline tailored for healthcare, focusing specifically on preoperative medicine.   Methods: We developed an LLM-RAG model using 35 preoperative guidelines and tested it against human-generated responses, with a total of 1260 responses evaluated. The RAG process involved converting clinical documents into text using Python-based frameworks like LangChain and Llamaindex, and processing these texts into chunks for embedding and retrieval. Vector storage techniques and selected embedding models to optimize data retrieval, using Pinecone for vector storage with a dimensionality of 1536 and cosine similarity for loss metrics. Human-generated answers, provided by junior doctors, were used as a comparison.   Results: The LLM-RAG model generated answers within an average of 15-20 seconds, significantly faster than the 10 minutes typically required by humans. Among the basic LLMs, GPT4.0 exhibited the best accuracy of 80.1%. This accuracy was further increased to 91.4% when the model was enhanced with RAG. Compared to the human-generated instructions, which had an accuracy of 86.3%, the performance of the GPT4.0 RAG model demonstrated non-inferiority (p=0.610).   Conclusions: In this case study, we demonstrated a LLM-RAG model for healthcare implementation. The pipeline shows the advantages of grounded knowledge, upgradability, and scalability as important aspects of healthcare LLM deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01733v1,2024-01
Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Shi-Qi Yan, Jia-Chen Gu, Yun Zhu, Zhen-Hua Ling","Large language models (LLMs) inevitably exhibit hallucinations since the accuracy of generated texts cannot be secured solely by the parametric knowledge they encapsulate. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a practicable complement to LLMs, it relies heavily on the relevance of retrieved documents, raising concerns about how the model behaves if retrieval goes wrong. To this end, we propose the Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) to improve the robustness of generation. Specifically, a lightweight retrieval evaluator is designed to assess the overall quality of retrieved documents for a query, returning a confidence degree based on which different knowledge retrieval actions can be triggered. Since retrieval from static and limited corpora can only return sub-optimal documents, large-scale web searches are utilized as an extension for augmenting the retrieval results. Besides, a decompose-then-recompose algorithm is designed for retrieved documents to selectively focus on key information and filter out irrelevant information in them. CRAG is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly coupled with various RAG-based approaches. Experiments on four datasets covering short- and long-form generation tasks show that CRAG can significantly improve the performance of RAG-based approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15884v3,2024-01
BPDec: Unveiling the Potential of Masked Language Modeling Decoder in BERT pretraining,"Wen Liang, Youzhi Liang","BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing through its exceptional performance on numerous tasks. Yet, the majority of researchers have mainly concentrated on enhancements related to the model structure, such as relative position embedding and more efficient attention mechanisms. Others have delved into pretraining tricks associated with Masked Language Modeling, including whole word masking. DeBERTa introduced an enhanced decoder adapted for BERT's encoder model for pretraining, proving to be highly effective. We argue that the design and research around enhanced masked language modeling decoders have been underappreciated. In this paper, we propose several designs of enhanced decoders and introduce BPDec (BERT Pretraining Decoder), a novel method for modeling training. Typically, a pretrained BERT model is fine-tuned for specific Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. In our approach, we utilize the original BERT model as the encoder, making only changes to the decoder without altering the encoder. This approach does not necessitate extensive modifications to the encoder architecture and can be seamlessly integrated into existing fine-tuning pipelines and services, offering an efficient and effective enhancement strategy. Compared to other methods, while we also incur a moderate training cost for the decoder during the pretraining process, our approach does not introduce additional training costs during the fine-tuning phase. We test multiple enhanced decoder structures after pretraining and evaluate their performance on the GLUE tasks and SQuAD tasks. Our results demonstrate that BPDec, having only undergone subtle refinements to the model structure during pretraining, significantly enhances model performance without escalating the finetuning cost, inference time and serving budget.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15861v4,2024-01
LSTM-based Deep Neural Network With A Focus on Sentence Representation for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Scientific Abstracts,"Phat Lam, Lam Pham, Tin Nguyen, Hieu Tang, Michael Seidl, Medina Andresel, Alexander Schindler","The Sequential Sentence Classification task within the domain of medical abstracts, termed as SSC, involves the categorization of sentences into pre-defined headings based on their roles in conveying critical information in the abstract. In the SSC task, sentences are sequentially related to each other. For this reason, the role of sentence embeddings is crucial for capturing both the semantic information between words in the sentence and the contextual relationship of sentences within the abstract, which then enhances the SSC system performance. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-based deep learning network with a focus on creating comprehensive sentence representation at the sentence level. To demonstrate the efficacy of the created sentence representation, a system utilizing these sentence embeddings is also developed, which consists of a Convolutional-Recurrent neural network (C-RNN) at the abstract level and a multi-layer perception network (MLP) at the segment level. Our proposed system yields highly competitive results compared to state-of-the-art systems and further enhances the F1 scores of the baseline by 1.0%, 2.8%, and 2.6% on the benchmark datasets PudMed 200K RCT, PudMed 20K RCT and NICTA-PIBOSO, respectively.

These images, characterized by their composition of multiple subfigures in distinct layouts, effectively convey information to people. Toward building advanced multimodal AI applications, such as agents that understand complex scenes and navigate through webpages, the skill of multipanel visual reasoning is essential, and a comprehensive evaluation of models in this regard is important. Therefore, we introduce Multipanel Visual Question Answering (MultipanelVQA), a novel benchmark comprising 6,600 triplets of questions, answers, and multipanel images that specifically challenge models in comprehending multipanel images. Our evaluation shows that questions in the MultipanelVQA benchmark pose significant challenges to the state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tested, even though humans can attain approximately 99% accuracy on these questions. Distinctively, the MultipanelVQA benchmark features synthetically generated multipanel images specifically crafted to isolate and assess the impact of various factors, such as the layout, on MLLMs' multipanel image comprehension abilities. As a result, in addition to benchmarking the capabilities of MLLMs in understanding multipanel images, we analyze various factors of the multipanel image that affect MLLMs' performance with synthetic data and offer insights for enhancement.

UnMASKed: Quantifying Gender Biases in Masked Language Models through Linguistically Informed Job Market Prompts,Iñigo Parra,"Language models (LMs) have become pivotal in the realm of technological advancements. While their capabilities are vast and transformative, they often include societal biases encoded in the human-produced datasets used for their training. This research delves into the inherent biases present in masked language models (MLMs), with a specific focus on gender biases. This study evaluated six prominent models: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, BERT-multilingual, XLM-RoBERTa, and DistilBERT-multilingual. The methodology employed a novel dataset, bifurcated into two subsets: one containing prompts that encouraged models to generate subject pronouns in English, and the other requiring models to return the probabilities of verbs, adverbs, and adjectives linked to the prompts' gender pronouns. The analysis reveals stereotypical gender alignment of all models, with multilingual variants showing comparatively reduced biases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15798v1,2024-01

The results suggest incorporating elements of paralinguistic behaviour such as script-switching may improve the performance of language detection systems especially in the cases of under-resourced languages conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15777v1,2024-01
PILOT: Legal Case Outcome Prediction with Case Law,"Lang Cao, Zifeng Wang, Cao Xiao, Jimeng Sun","Machine learning shows promise in predicting the outcome of legal cases, but most research has concentrated on civil law cases rather than case law systems. We identified two unique challenges in making legal case outcome predictions with case law. First, it is crucial to identify relevant precedent cases that serve as fundamental evidence for judges during decision-making. Second, it is necessary to consider the evolution of legal principles over time, as early cases may adhere to different legal contexts. In this paper, we proposed a new framework named PILOT (PredictIng Legal case OuTcome) for case outcome prediction. It comprises two modules for relevant case retrieval and temporal pattern handling, respectively. To benchmark the performance of existing legal case outcome prediction models, we curated a dataset from a large-scale case law database. We demonstrate the importance of accurately identifying precedent cases and mitigating the temporal shift when making predictions for case law, as our method shows a significant improvement over the prior methods that focus on civil law case outcome predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15770v3,2024-01
RE-GAINS & EnChAnT: Intelligent Tool Manipulation Systems For Enhanced Query Responses,"Sahil Girhepuje, Siva Sankar Sajeev, Purvam Jain, Arya Sikder, Adithya Rama Varma, Ryan George, Akshay Govind Srinivasan, Mahendra Kurup, Ashmit Sinha, Sudip Mondal","Large Language Models (LLMs) currently struggle with tool invocation and chaining, as they often hallucinate or miss essential steps in a sequence. We propose RE-GAINS and EnChAnT, two novel frameworks that empower LLMs to tackle complex user queries by making API calls to external tools based on tool descriptions and argument lists. Tools are chained based on the expected output, without receiving the actual results from each individual call. EnChAnT, an open-source solution, leverages an LLM format enforcer, OpenChat 3.5 (an LLM), and ToolBench's API Retriever. RE-GAINS utilizes OpenAI models and embeddings with a specialized prompt based on the $\underline{R}$easoning vi$\underline{a}$ $\underline{P}$lanning $(RAP)$ framework. Both frameworks are low cost (0.01\$ per query). Our key contribution is enabling LLMs for tool invocation and chaining using modifiable, externally described tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15724v3,2024-01

To address this challenge, we developed ''Check News in 1 Click'', the first NLP-empowered pro-Kremlin propaganda detection application available in 7 languages, which provides the lay user with feedback on their news, and explains manipulative linguistic features and keywords. We conducted a user study, analysed user entries and models' behaviour paired with questionnaire answers, and investigated the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed interpretative solution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15717v1,2024-01
Contrastive Learning and Mixture of Experts Enables Precise Vector Embeddings,"Logan Hallee, Rohan Kapur, Arjun Patel, Jason P. Gleghorn, Bohdan Khomtchouk","The advancement of transformer neural networks has significantly elevated the capabilities of sentence similarity models, but they still struggle with highly discriminative tasks and may produce sub-optimal representations of important documents like scientific literature. With the increased reliance on retrieval augmentation and search, representing diverse documents as concise and descriptive vectors is crucial. This paper improves upon the vectors embeddings of scientific text by assembling niche datasets using co-citations as a similarity metric, focusing on biomedical domains. We apply a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) extension pipeline to pretrained BERT models, where every multi-layer perceptron section is enlarged and copied into multiple distinct experts. Our MoE variants perform well over $N$ scientific domains with $N$ dedicated experts, whereas standard BERT models excel in only one domain at a time. Notably, extending just a single transformer block to MoE captures 85% of the benefit seen from full MoE extension at every layer. This holds promise for versatile and efficient One-Size-Fits-All transformer networks for numerically representing diverse inputs. Our methodology marks advancements in representation learning and holds promise for enhancing vector database search and compilation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15713v3,2024-01
YODA: Teacher-Student Progressive Learning for Language Models,"Jianqiao Lu, Wanjun Zhong, Yufei Wang, Zhijiang Guo, Qi Zhu, Wenyong Huang, Yanlin Wang, Fei Mi, Baojun Wang, Yasheng Wang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu","Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated adeptness in a range of tasks, they still lag behind human learning efficiency. This disparity is often linked to the inherent human capacity to learn from basic examples, gradually generalize and handle more complex problems, and refine their skills with continuous feedback. Inspired by this, this paper introduces YODA, a novel teacher-student progressive learning framework that emulates the teacher-student education process to improve the efficacy of model fine-tuning. The framework operates on an interactive \textit{basic-generalized-harder} loop. The teacher agent provides tailored feedback on the student's answers, and systematically organizes the education process. This process unfolds by teaching the student basic examples, reinforcing understanding through generalized questions, and then enhancing learning by posing questions with progressively enhanced complexity. With the teacher's guidance, the student learns to iteratively refine its answer with feedback, and forms a robust and comprehensive understanding of the posed questions. The systematic procedural data, which reflects the progressive learning process of humans, is then utilized for model training. Taking math reasoning as a testbed, experiments show that training LLaMA2 with data from YODA improves SFT with significant performance gain (+17.01\% on GSM8K and +9.98\% on MATH). In addition, we find that training with curriculum learning further improves learning robustness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15670v1,2024-01
DAIRstega: Dynamically Allocated Interval-Based Generative Linguistic Steganography with Roulette Wheel,"Yihao Wang, Ruiqi Song, Lingxiao Li, Ru Zhang, Jianyi Liu","Linguistic steganography (LS) tasks aim to generate steganographic text (stego) based on secret. Only authorized receivers can perceive and extract secrets, thereby protecting privacy. However, existing generative LS schemes often do not consider the conditional probability of tokens in the candidate pool, and allocate one or the same number of codings to all tokens. The tokens with lower probabilities are selected to embed secrets that will affect the quality of stegos. As a result, the stegos are easy to perceive and detect. This paper proposes the LS scheme based on dynamically allocated intervals, called DAIRstega. DAIRstega uses the idea of the roulette wheel and takes the conditional probabilities of tokens as the main basis for allocating the roulette area (i.e., the interval length). Thus, the token with a larger conditional probability is allocated more. The secret will be more likely to select the tokens with larger probabilities. In the allocation process, we design some functions between probability and allocated interval length. Based on the invisible characteristics of LS, we give three constraints that need to be met to design the function. To simplify the form, the expression of the allocation function is condensed. Furthermore, DAIRstega can receive additional instruction and controllably generate stegos. Rich experiments show that the proposed embedding way and DAIRstega perform superior to the existing ways and LS schemes, which shows strong perceptual, statistical, and semantic concealment and anti-steganalysis ability. This scheme can also generate high-quality longer stegos, improving the deficiencies in this task. The experiment also verified that DAIRstega can be used as a secure watermarking scheme, providing some ideas for its development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15656v4,2024-01
PRE: A Peer Review Based Large Language Model Evaluator,"Zhumin Chu, Qingyao Ai, Yiteng Tu, Haitao Li, Yiqun Liu","The impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) has attracted considerable attention from the academic and industrial communities. Besides how to construct and train LLMs, how to effectively evaluate and compare the capacity of LLMs has also been well recognized as an important yet difficult problem. Existing paradigms rely on either human annotators or model-based evaluators to evaluate the performance of LLMs on different tasks. However, these paradigms often suffer from high cost, low generalizability, and inherited biases in practice, which make them incapable of supporting the sustainable development of LLMs in long term. In order to address these issues, inspired by the peer review systems widely used in academic publication process, we propose a novel framework that can automatically evaluate LLMs through a peer-review process. Specifically, for the evaluation of a specific task, we first construct a small qualification exam to select ""reviewers"" from a couple of powerful LLMs. Then, to actually evaluate the ""submissions"" written by different candidate LLMs, i.e., the evaluatees, we use the reviewer LLMs to rate or compare the submissions. The final ranking of evaluatee LLMs is generated based on the results provided by all reviewers. We conducted extensive experiments on text summarization tasks with eleven LLMs including GPT-4. The results demonstrate the existence of biasness when evaluating using a single LLM. Also, our PRE model outperforms all the baselines, illustrating the effectiveness of the peer review mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15641v2,2024-01
RecDCL: Dual Contrastive Learning for Recommendation,"Dan Zhang, Yangliao Geng, Wenwen Gong, Zhongang Qi, Zhiyu Chen, Xing Tang, Ying Shan, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang","Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved great success in mining the user-item interactions for collaborative filtering. As a major paradigm, contrastive learning (CL) based SSL helps address data sparsity in Web platforms by contrasting the embeddings between raw and augmented data. However, existing CL-based methods mostly focus on contrasting in a batch-wise way, failing to exploit potential regularity in the feature dimension. This leads to redundant solutions during the representation learning of users and items. In this work, we investigate how to employ both batch-wise CL (BCL) and feature-wise CL (FCL) for recommendation. We theoretically analyze the relation between BCL and FCL, and find that combining BCL and FCL helps eliminate redundant solutions but never misses an optimal solution. We propose a dual contrastive learning recommendation framework -- RecDCL. In RecDCL, the FCL objective is designed to eliminate redundant solutions on user-item positive pairs and to optimize the uniform distributions within users and items using a polynomial kernel for driving the representations to be orthogonal; The BCL objective is utilized to generate contrastive embeddings on output vectors for enhancing the robustness of the representations. Extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmarks and one industry dataset demonstrate that RecDCL can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art GNNs-based and SSL-based models (with an improvement of up to 5.65\% in terms of Recall@20). The source code is publicly available (https://github.com/THUDM/RecDCL).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15635v2,2024-01
C Analyzer : A Static Program Analysis Tool for C Programs,Rajendra Kumar Solanki,"In our times, when the world is increasingly becoming more dependent on software programs, writing bug-free, correct programs is crucial. Program verification based on formal methods can guarantee this by detecting run-time errors in safety-critical systems to avoid possible adverse impacts on human life and save time and money.   This project work tries to leverage Abstract Interpretation techniques for static analysis of C programs. C Analyzer is a tool developed for static analysis of C programs. This implementation of C Analyzer provides a plug-and-play domain architecture for multiple abstract domains to be used. C Analyzer supports four abstract domains - Interval, Octagon, Polyhedra, and Bit Vector. We use these different domains for required precision in program verification. C Analyzer tool uses LLVM C/C++ compiler frontend Clang API to generate and traverse the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of a given C program. This tool generates invariants in different abstract domains for statements in basic blocks of CFG during CFG traversal. Using these invariants, some properties of a program, such as dividing by zero, modulus zero, arithmetic overflow, etc., can be analyzed. We also use a source-to-source transformation tool, CIL (Common Intermediate language), to transform some C constructs into simpler constructs, such as transforming logical operators, switch statements, and conditional operators into if-else ladders and transforming do-while and for loops into while loops.   Using C Analyzer, C program constructs such as declarations, assignments, binary operations (arithmetic, relational, bitwise shift, etc.), conditions (if-else), loops (while, do while, for loop), nested conditions, and nested loops can be analyzed. Currently, this tool does not support arrays, structures, unions, pointers, or function calls.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12973v1,2024-01
TA&AT: Enhancing Task-Oriented Dialog with Turn-Level Auxiliary Tasks and Action-Tree Based Scheduled Sampling,"Longxiang Liu, Xiuxing Li, Yang Feng","Task-oriented dialog systems have witnessed substantial progress due to conversational pre-training techniques. Yet, two significant challenges persist. First, most systems primarily utilize the latest turn's state label for the generator. This practice overlooks the comprehensive value of state labels in boosting the model's understanding for future generations. Second, an overreliance on generated policy often leads to error accumulation, resulting in suboptimal responses when adhering to incorrect actions. To combat these challenges, we propose turn-level multi-task objectives for the encoder. With the guidance of essential information from labeled intermediate states, we establish a more robust representation for both understanding and generation. For the decoder, we introduce an action tree-based scheduled sampling technique. Specifically, we model the hierarchical policy as trees and utilize the similarity between trees to sample negative policy based on scheduled sampling, hoping the model to generate invariant responses under perturbations. This method simulates potential pitfalls by sampling similar negative policy, bridging the gap between task-oriented dialog training and inference. Among methods without continual pre-training, our approach achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the MultiWOZ dataset series and was also competitive with pre-trained SOTA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15626v1,2024-01
Evaluating LLM -- Generated Multimodal Diagnosis from Medical Images and Symptom Analysis,"Dimitrios P. Panagoulias, Maria Virvou, George A. Tsihrintzis","Large language models (LLMs) constitute a breakthrough state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology which is rapidly evolving and promises to aid in medical diagnosis. However, the correctness and the accuracy of their returns has not yet been properly evaluated. In this work, we propose an LLM evaluation paradigm that incorporates two independent steps of a novel methodology, namely (1) multimodal LLM evaluation via structured interactions and (2) follow-up, domain-specific analysis based on data extracted via the previous interactions. Using this paradigm, (1) we evaluate the correctness and accuracy of LLM-generated medical diagnosis with publicly available multimodal multiple-choice questions(MCQs) in the domain of Pathology and (2) proceed to a systemic and comprehensive analysis of extracted results. We used GPT-4-Vision-Preview as the LLM to respond to complex, medical questions consisting of both images and text, and we explored a wide range of diseases, conditions, chemical compounds, and related entity types that are included in the vast knowledge domain of Pathology. GPT-4-Vision-Preview performed quite well, scoring approximately 84\% of correct diagnoses. Next, we further analyzed the findings of our work, following an analytical approach which included Image Metadata Analysis, Named Entity Recognition and Knowledge Graphs. Weaknesses of GPT-4-Vision-Preview were revealed on specific knowledge paths, leading to a further understanding of its shortcomings in specific areas. Our methodology and findings are not limited to the use of GPT-4-Vision-Preview, but a similar approach can be followed to evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of other LLMs and, thus, improve their use with further optimization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01730v1,2024-01
Contextualization Distillation from Large Language Model for Knowledge Graph Completion,"Dawei Li, Zhen Tan, Tianlong Chen, Huan Liu","While textual information significantly enhances the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in knowledge graph completion (KGC), the static and noisy nature of existing corpora collected from Wikipedia articles or synsets definitions often limits the potential of PLM-based KGC models. To surmount these challenges, we introduce the Contextualization Distillation strategy, a versatile plug-in-and-play approach compatible with both discriminative and generative KGC frameworks. Our method begins by instructing large language models (LLMs) to transform compact, structural triplets into context-rich segments. Subsequently, we introduce two tailored auxiliary tasks, reconstruction and contextualization, allowing smaller KGC models to assimilate insights from these enriched triplets. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse datasets and KGC techniques highlight the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, revealing consistent performance enhancements irrespective of underlying pipelines or architectures. Moreover, our analysis makes our method more explainable and provides insight into generating path selection, as well as the choosing of suitable distillation tasks.

Evaluating Gender Bias in Large Language Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompting,"Masahiro Kaneko, Danushka Bollegala, Naoaki Okazaki, Timothy Baldwin","There exist both scalable tasks, like reading comprehension and fact-checking, where model performance improves with model size, and unscalable tasks, like arithmetic reasoning and symbolic reasoning, where model performance does not necessarily improve with model size. Large language models (LLMs) equipped with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting are able to make accurate incremental predictions even on unscalable tasks. Unfortunately, despite their exceptional reasoning abilities, LLMs tend to internalize and reproduce discriminatory societal biases. Whether CoT can provide discriminatory or egalitarian rationalizations for the implicit information in unscalable tasks remains an open question.   In this study, we examine the impact of LLMs' step-by-step predictions on gender bias in unscalable tasks. For this purpose, we construct a benchmark for an unscalable task where the LLM is given a list of words comprising feminine, masculine, and gendered occupational words, and is required to count the number of feminine and masculine words. In our CoT prompts, we require the LLM to explicitly indicate whether each word in the word list is a feminine or masculine before making the final predictions. With counting and handling the meaning of words, this benchmark has characteristics of both arithmetic reasoning and symbolic reasoning. Experimental results in English show that without step-by-step prediction, most LLMs make socially biased predictions, despite the task being as simple as counting words. Interestingly, CoT prompting reduces this unconscious social bias in LLMs and encourages fair predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15585v1,2024-01

Efficient Tuning and Inference for Large Language Models on Textual Graphs,"Yun Zhu, Yaoke Wang, Haizhou Shi, Siliang Tang","Rich textual and topological information of textual graphs need to be modeled in real-world applications such as webpages, e-commerce, and academic articles. Practitioners have been long following the path of adopting a shallow text encoder and a subsequent graph neural network (GNN) to solve this problem. In light of recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), it is apparent that integrating LLMs for enhanced textual encoding can substantially improve the performance of textual graphs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these methods poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ENGINE, a parameter- and memory-efficient fine-tuning method for textual graphs with an LLM encoder. The key insight is to combine the LLMs and GNNs through a tunable side structure, which significantly reduces the training complexity without impairing the joint model's capacity. Extensive experiments on textual graphs demonstrate our method's effectiveness by achieving the best model performance, meanwhile having the lowest training cost compared to previous methods. Moreover, we introduce two variants with caching and dynamic early exit to further enhance training and inference speed. Specifically, caching accelerates ENGINE's training by 12x, and dynamic early exit achieves up to 5x faster inference with a negligible performance drop (at maximum 1.17% relevant drop across 7 datasets).

We expanded on the statistical analysis of the English alphabet by examining the average frequency which each letter appears in different categories of writings. We evaluated news articles, novels, plays, scientific publications and calculated the frequency of each letter of the alphabet, the information density of each letter, and the overall letter distribution. Furthermore, we developed a metric known as distance, d that can be used to algorithmically recognize different categories of writings.

Augment before You Try: Knowledge-Enhanced Table Question Answering via Table Expansion,"Yujian Liu, Jiabao Ji, Tong Yu, Ryan Rossi, Sungchul Kim, Handong Zhao, Ritwik Sinha, Yang Zhang, Shiyu Chang","Table question answering is a popular task that assesses a model's ability to understand and interact with structured data. However, the given table often does not contain sufficient information for answering the question, necessitating the integration of external knowledge. Existing methods either convert both the table and external knowledge into text, which neglects the structured nature of the table; or they embed queries for external sources in the interaction with the table, which complicates the process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to integrate external information in a given table. Our method first constructs an augmenting table containing the missing information and then generates a SQL query over the two tables to answer the question. Experiments show that our method outperforms strong baselines on three table QA benchmarks.

PPM: Automated Generation of Diverse Programming Problems for Benchmarking Code Generation Models,"Simin Chen, Xiaoning Feng, Xiaohong Han, Cong Liu, Wei Yang","In recent times, a plethora of Large Code Generation Models (LCGMs) have been proposed, showcasing significant potential in assisting developers with complex programming tasks. Benchmarking LCGMs necessitates the creation of a set of diverse programming problems, and each problem comprises the prompt (including the task description), canonical solution, and test inputs. The existing methods for constructing such a problem set can be categorized into two main types: manual methods and perturbation-based methods. However, manual methods demand high effort and lack scalability, while also risking data integrity due to LCGMs' potentially contaminated data collection, and perturbation-based approaches mainly generate semantically homogeneous problems with the same canonical solutions and introduce typos that can be easily auto-corrected by IDE, making them ineffective and unrealistic. In this work, we propose the idea of programming problem merging (PPM) and provide two implementation of this idea, we utilize our tool on two widely-used datasets and compare it against nine baseline methods using eight code generation models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool in generating more challenging, diverse, and natural programming problems, comparing to the baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15545v1,2024-01
Quantifying Stereotypes in Language,Yang Liu,"A stereotype is a generalized perception of a specific group of humans. It is often potentially encoded in human language, which is more common in texts on social issues. Previous works simply define a sentence as stereotypical and anti-stereotypical. However, the stereotype of a sentence may require fine-grained quantification. In this paper, to fill this gap, we quantify stereotypes in language by annotating a dataset. We use the pre-trained language models (PLMs) to learn this dataset to predict stereotypes of sentences. Then, we discuss stereotypes about common social issues such as hate speech, sexism, sentiments, and disadvantaged and advantaged groups. We demonstrate the connections and differences between stereotypes and common social issues, and all four studies validate the general findings of the current studies. In addition, our work suggests that fine-grained stereotype scores are a highly relevant and competitive dimension for research on social issues.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15535v1,2024-01
Byte Pair Encoding Is All You Need For Automatic Bengali Speech Recognition,Ahnaf Mozib Samin,"Byte pair encoding (BPE) emerges as an effective tokenization method for tackling the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) challenge in various natural language and speech processing tasks. Recent research highlights the dependency of BPE subword tokenization's efficacy on the morphological nature of the language, particularly in languages rich in inflectional morphology, where fewer BPE merges suffice for generating highly productive tokens. Motivated by this, our study empirically identifies the optimal number of BPE tokens for Bengali, a language known for its morphological complexity, thus enhancing out-of-distribution automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. Experimental evaluation reveals that an excessively high number of BPE tokens can lead to overfitting, while approximately 500-1000 tokens result in superior OOV performance. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of BPE with character-based and unigram-based tokenization methods. By introducing BPE tokenization to Bengali ASR, we achieve a substantial reduction in the word error rate (WER) from 66.44% in our character-based baseline system to 63.80% on the LB-ASRTD eval set and from 46.34% to 42.80% on the SHRUTI eval set, both of which include out-of-distribution data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15532v1,2024-01
Hardware Phi-1.5B: A Large Language Model Encodes Hardware Domain Specific Knowledge,"Weimin Fu, Shijie Li, Yifang Zhao, Haocheng Ma, Raj Dutta, Xuan Zhang, Kaichen Yang, Yier Jin, Xiaolong Guo","In the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry, where research, design, verification, and manufacturing are intricately linked, the potential of Large Language Models to revolutionize hardware design and security verification is immense.

Additionally, the scarcity of datasets specific to the hardware domain poses a significant hurdle in developing a foundational model. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces Hardware Phi 1.5B, an innovative large language model specifically tailored for the hardware domain of the semiconductor industry. We have developed a specialized, tiered dataset comprising small, medium, and large subsets and focused our efforts on pretraining using the medium dataset.

Style-News: Incorporating Stylized News Generation and Adversarial Verification for Neural Fake News Detection,"Wei-Yao Wang, Yu-Chieh Chang, Wen-Chih Peng","With the improvements in generative models, the issues of producing hallucinations in various domains (e.g., law, writing) have been brought to people's attention due to concerns about misinformation. In this paper, we focus on neural fake news, which refers to content generated by neural networks aiming to mimic the style of real news to deceive people. To prevent harmful disinformation spreading fallaciously from malicious social media (e.g., content farms), we propose a novel verification framework, Style-News, using publisher metadata to imply a publisher's template with the corresponding text types, political stance, and credibility. Based on threat modeling aspects, a style-aware neural news generator is introduced as an adversary for generating news content conditioning for a specific publisher, and style and source discriminators are trained to defend against this attack by identifying which publisher the style corresponds with, and discriminating whether the source of the given news is human-written or machine-generated. To evaluate the quality of the generated content, we integrate various dimensional metrics (language fluency, content preservation, and style adherence) and demonstrate that Style-News significantly outperforms the previous approaches by a margin of 0.35 for fluency, 15.24 for content, and 0.38 for style at most. Moreover, our discriminative model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of publisher prediction (up to 4.64%) and neural fake news detection (+6.94% $\sim$ 31.72%).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15509v1,2024-01
Semantic Properties of cosine based bias scores for word embeddings,"Sarah Schröder, Alexander Schulz, Fabian Hinder, Barbara Hammer","Plenty of works have brought social biases in language models to attention and proposed methods to detect such biases. As a result, the literature contains a great deal of different bias tests and scores, each introduced with the premise to uncover yet more biases that other scores fail to detect. What severely lacks in the literature, however, are comparative studies that analyse such bias scores and help researchers to understand the benefits or limitations of the existing methods. In this work, we aim to close this gap for cosine based bias scores. By building on a geometric definition of bias, we propose requirements for bias scores to be considered meaningful for quantifying biases. Furthermore, we formally analyze cosine based scores from the literature with regard to these requirements. We underline these findings with experiments to show that the bias scores' limitations have an impact in the application case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15499v2,2024-01
Do We Need Language-Specific Fact-Checking Models?

We first demonstrate the limitations of translation-based methods and multilingual large language models (e.g., GPT-4), highlighting the need for language-specific systems. We further propose a Chinese fact-checking system that can better retrieve evidence from a document by incorporating context information. To better analyze token-level biases in different systems, we construct an adversarial dataset based on the CHEF dataset, where each instance has large word overlap with the original one but holds the opposite veracity label. Experimental results on the CHEF dataset and our adversarial dataset show that our proposed method outperforms translation-based methods and multilingual LLMs and is more robust toward biases, while there is still large room for improvement, emphasizing the importance of language-specific fact-checking systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15498v3,2024-01
Baichuan2-Sum: Instruction Finetune Baichuan2-7B Model for Dialogue Summarization,"Jianfei Xiao, Yancan Chen, Yimin Ou, Hanyi Yu, Kai Shu, Yiyong Xiao","Large language models (LLMs) like Llama, Baichuan and Bloom models show remarkable ability with instruction fine-tuning in many natural language tasks. Nevertheless, for the dialogue summarization task, which aims to generate summaries for different roles in dialogue, most of the state-of-the-art methods conduct on small models (e.g Bart and Bert). Existing methods try to add task specified optimization on small models like adding global-local centrality score to models. In this paper, we propose an instruction fine-tuning model: Baichuan2-Sum, for role-oriented diaglouge summarization. By setting different instructions for different roles, the model can learn from the dialogue interactions and output the expected summaries. Furthermore, we applied NEFTune technique to add suitable noise during training to improve the results.

Current methodologies for protein design often rely on AI-based models, such as surrogate models that address end-to-end problems by linking protein structure to material properties or vice versa. However, these models frequently focus on specific material objectives or structural properties, limiting their flexibility when incorporating out-of-domain knowledge into the design process or comprehensive data analysis is required. In this study, we introduce ProtAgents, a platform for de novo protein design based on Large Language Models (LLMs), where multiple AI agents with distinct capabilities collaboratively address complex tasks within a dynamic environment. The versatility in agent development allows for expertise in diverse domains, including knowledge retrieval, protein structure analysis, physics-based simulations, and results analysis. The dynamic collaboration between agents, empowered by LLMs, provides a versatile approach to tackling protein design and analysis problems, as demonstrated through diverse examples in this study. The problems of interest encompass designing new proteins, analyzing protein structures and obtaining new first-principles data -- natural vibrational frequencies -- via physics simulations. The concerted effort of the system allows for powerful automated and synergistic design of de novo proteins with targeted mechanical properties. The flexibility in designing the agents, on one hand, and their capacity in autonomous collaboration through the dynamic LLM-based multi-agent environment on the other hand, unleashes great potentials of LLMs in addressing multi-objective materials problems and opens up new avenues for autonomous materials discovery and design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04268v1,2024-01
Navigating the Post-API Dilemma | Search Engine Results Pages Present a Biased View of Social Media Data,"Amrit Poudel, Tim Weninger","Recent decisions to discontinue access to social media APIs are having detrimental effects on Internet research and the field of computational social science as a whole. This lack of access to data has been dubbed the Post-API era of Internet research. Fortunately, popular search engines have the means to crawl, capture, and surface social media data on their Search Engine Results Pages (SERP) if provided the proper search query, and may provide a solution to this dilemma. In the present work we ask: does SERP provide a complete and unbiased sample of social media data? Is SERP a viable alternative to direct API-access? To answer these questions, we perform a comparative analysis between (Google) SERP results and nonsampled data from Reddit and Twitter/X. We find that SERP results are highly biased in favor of popular posts; against political, pornographic, and vulgar posts; are more positive in their sentiment; and have large topical gaps. Overall, we conclude that SERP is not a viable alternative to social media API access.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15479v4,2024-01
To Burst or Not to Burst: Generating and Quantifying Improbable Text,"Kuleen Sasse, Samuel Barham, Efsun Sarioglu Kayi, Edward W. Staley","While large language models (LLMs) are extremely capable at text generation, their outputs are still distinguishable from human-authored text. We explore this separation across many metrics over text, many sampling techniques, many types of text data, and across two popular LLMs, LLaMA and Vicuna. Along the way, we introduce a new metric, recoverability, to highlight differences between human and machine text; and we propose a new sampling technique, burst sampling, designed to close this gap. We find that LLaMA and Vicuna have distinct distributions under many of the metrics, and that this influences our results: Recoverability separates real from fake text better than any other metric when using LLaMA. When using Vicuna, burst sampling produces text which is distributionally closer to real text compared to other sampling techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15476v1,2024-01
ConvoSense: Overcoming Monotonous Commonsense Inferences for Conversational AI,"Sarah E. Finch, Jinho D. Choi","Mastering commonsense understanding and reasoning is a pivotal skill essential for conducting engaging conversations. While there have been several attempts to create datasets that facilitate commonsense inferences in dialogue contexts, existing datasets tend to lack in-depth details, restate information already present in the conversation, and often fail to capture the multifaceted nature of commonsense reasoning. In response to these limitations, we compile a new synthetic dataset for commonsense reasoning in dialogue contexts using GPT, ConvoSense, that boasts greater contextual novelty, offers a higher volume of inferences per example, and substantially enriches the detail conveyed by the inferences. Our dataset contains over 500,000 inferences across 12,000 dialogues with 10 popular inference types, which empowers the training of generative commonsense models for dialogue that are superior in producing plausible inferences with high novelty when compared to models trained on the previous datasets. To the best of our knowledge, ConvoSense is the first of its kind to provide such a multitude of novel inferences at such a large scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15471v1,2024-01
DataFrame QA: A Universal LLM Framework on DataFrame Question Answering Without Data Exposure,"Junyi Ye, Mengnan Du, Guiling Wang","This paper introduces DataFrame question answering (QA), a novel task that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate Pandas queries for information retrieval and data analysis on dataframes, emphasizing safe and non-revealing data handling. Our method, which solely relies on dataframe column names, not only ensures data privacy but also significantly reduces the context window in the prompt, streamlining information processing and addressing major challenges in LLM-based data analysis. We propose DataFrame QA as a comprehensive framework that includes safe Pandas query generation and code execution. Various LLMs, notably GPT-4, are evaluated using the pass@1 metric on the renowned WikiSQL and our newly developed 'UCI-DataFrameQA', tailored for complex data analysis queries. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 achieves pass@1 rates of 86% on WikiSQL and 97% on UCI-DataFrameQA, underscoring its capability in securely retrieving and aggregating dataframe values and conducting sophisticated data analyses. This approach, deployable in a zero-shot manner without prior training or adjustments, proves to be highly adaptable and secure for diverse applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15463v1,2024-01
Learning to Trust Your Feelings: Leveraging Self-awareness in LLMs for Hallucination Mitigation,"Yuxin Liang, Zhuoyang Song, Hao Wang, Jiaxing Zhang","We evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discern and express their internal knowledge state, a key factor in countering factual hallucination and ensuring reliable application of LLMs. We observe a robust self-awareness of internal knowledge state in LLMs, evidenced by over 85% accuracy in knowledge probing. However, LLMs often fail to express their internal knowledge during generation, leading to factual hallucinations. We develop an automated hallucination annotation tool, Dreamcatcher, which merges knowledge probing and consistency checking methods to rank factual preference data. Using knowledge preference as reward, We propose a Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Feedback (RLKF) training framework, leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance the factuality and honesty of LLMs. Our experiments across multiple models show that RLKF training effectively enhances the ability of models to utilize their internal knowledge state, boosting performance in a variety of knowledge-based and honesty-related tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15449v1,2024-01
Pre-training and Diagnosing Knowledge Base Completion Models,"Vid Kocijan, Myeongjun Erik Jang, Thomas Lukasiewicz","In this work, we introduce and analyze an approach to knowledge transfer from one collection of facts to another without the need for entity or relation matching. The method works for both canonicalized knowledge bases and uncanonicalized or open knowledge bases, i.e., knowledge bases where more than one copy of a real-world entity or relation may exist. The main contribution is a method that can make use of large-scale pre-training on facts, which were collected from unstructured text, to improve predictions on structured data from a specific domain. The introduced method is most impactful on small datasets such as ReVerb20k, where a 6% absolute increase of mean reciprocal rank and 65% relative decrease of mean rank over the previously best method was achieved, despite not relying on large pre-trained models like Bert. To understand the obtained pre-trained models better, we then introduce a novel dataset for the analysis of pre-trained models for Open Knowledge Base Completion, called Doge (Diagnostics of Open knowledge Graph Embeddings). It consists of 6 subsets and is designed to measure multiple properties of a pre-trained model: robustness against synonyms, ability to perform deductive reasoning, presence of gender stereotypes, consistency with reverse relations, and coverage of different areas of general knowledge. Using the introduced dataset, we show that the existing OKBC models lack consistency in the presence of synonyms and inverse relations and are unable to perform deductive reasoning. Moreover, their predictions often align with gender stereotypes, which persist even when presented with counterevidence. We additionally investigate the role of pre-trained word embeddings and demonstrate that avoiding biased word embeddings is not a sufficient measure to prevent biased behavior of OKBC models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15439v1,2024-01
AI Does Not Alter Perceptions of Text Messages,N'yoma Diamond,"For many people, anxiety, depression, and other social and mental factors can make composing text messages an active challenge. To remedy this problem, large language models (LLMs) may yet prove to be the perfect tool to assist users that would otherwise find texting difficult or stressful. However, despite rapid uptake in LLM usage, considerations for their assistive usage in text message composition have not been explored. A primary concern regarding LLM usage is that poor public sentiment regarding AI introduces the possibility that its usage may harm perceptions of AI-assisted text messages, making usage counter-productive. To (in)validate this possibility, we explore how the belief that a text message did or did not receive AI assistance in composition alters its perceived tone, clarity, and ability to convey intent. In this study, we survey the perceptions of 26 participants on 18 randomly labeled pre-composed text messages. In analyzing the participants' ratings of message tone, clarity, and ability to convey intent, we find that there is no statistically significant evidence that the belief that AI is utilized alters recipient perceptions. This provides hopeful evidence that LLM-based text message composition assistance can be implemented without the risk of counter-productive outcomes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01726v2,2024-01
A Survey on Data Augmentation in Large Model Era,"Yue Zhou, Chenlu Guo, Xu Wang, Yi Chang, Yuan Wu","Large models, encompassing large language and diffusion models, have shown exceptional promise in approximating human-level intelligence, garnering significant interest from both academic and industrial spheres. However, the training of these large models necessitates vast quantities of high-quality data, and with continuous updates to these models, the existing reservoir of high-quality data may soon be depleted. This challenge has catalyzed a surge in research focused on data augmentation methods. Leveraging large models, these data augmentation techniques have outperformed traditional approaches. This paper offers an exhaustive review of large model-driven data augmentation methods, adopting a comprehensive perspective. We begin by establishing a classification of relevant studies into three main categories: image augmentation, text augmentation, and paired data augmentation. Following this, we delve into various data post-processing techniques pertinent to large model-based data augmentation. Our discussion then expands to encompass the array of applications for these data augmentation methods within natural language processing, computer vision, and audio signal processing. We proceed to evaluate the successes and limitations of large model-based data augmentation across different scenarios. Concluding our review, we highlight prospective challenges and avenues for future exploration in the field of data augmentation. Our objective is to furnish researchers with critical insights, ultimately contributing to the advancement of more sophisticated large models.

FaKnow: A Unified Library for Fake News Detection,"Yiyuan Zhu, Yongjun Li, Jialiang Wang, Ming Gao, Jiali Wei","Over the past years, a large number of fake news detection algorithms based on deep learning have emerged. However, they are often developed under different frameworks, each mandating distinct utilization methodologies, consequently hindering reproducibility. Additionally, a substantial amount of redundancy characterizes the code development of such fake news detection models. To address these concerns, we propose FaKnow, a unified and comprehensive fake news detection algorithm library. It encompasses a variety of widely used fake news detection models, categorized as content-based and social context-based approaches. This library covers the full spectrum of the model training and evaluation process, effectively organizing the data, models, and training procedures within a unified framework. Furthermore, it furnishes a series of auxiliary functionalities and tools, including visualization, and logging. Our work contributes to the standardization and unification of fake news detection research, concurrently facilitating the endeavors of researchers in this field.

Indexing Portuguese NLP Resources with PT-Pump-Up,"Rúben Almeida, Ricardo Campos, Alípio Jorge, Sérgio Nunes","The recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) are linked to training processes that require vast amounts of corpora. Access to this data is commonly not a trivial process due to resource dispersion and the need to maintain these infrastructures online and up-to-date. New developments in NLP are often compromised due to the scarcity of data or lack of a shared repository that works as an entry point to the community. This is especially true in low and mid-resource languages, such as Portuguese, which lack data and proper resource management infrastructures. In this work, we propose PT-Pump-Up, a set of tools that aim to reduce resource dispersion and improve the accessibility to Portuguese NLP resources. Our proposal is divided into four software components: a) a web platform to list the available resources; b) a client-side Python package to simplify the loading of Portuguese NLP resources; c) an administrative Python package to manage the platform and d) a public GitHub repository to foster future collaboration and contributions. All four components are accessible using: https://linktr.ee/pt_pump_up",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15400v1,2024-01
Semantics of Multiword Expressions in Transformer-Based Models: A Survey,"Filip Miletić, Sabine Schulte im Walde","Multiword expressions (MWEs) are composed of multiple words and exhibit variable degrees of compositionality. As such, their meanings are notoriously difficult to model, and it is unclear to what extent this issue affects transformer architectures. Addressing this gap, we provide the first in-depth survey of MWE processing with transformer models. We overall find that they capture MWE semantics inconsistently, as shown by reliance on surface patterns and memorized information. MWE meaning is also strongly localized, predominantly in early layers of the architecture. Representations benefit from specific linguistic properties, such as lower semantic idiosyncrasy and ambiguity of target expressions. Our findings overall question the ability of transformer models to robustly capture fine-grained semantics. Furthermore, we highlight the need for more directly comparable evaluation setups.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15393v1,2024-01
MultiHop-RAG: Benchmarking Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Multi-Hop Queries,"Yixuan Tang, Yi Yang","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) augments large language models (LLM) by retrieving relevant knowledge, showing promising potential in mitigating LLM hallucinations and enhancing response quality, thereby facilitating the great adoption of LLMs in practice. However, we find that existing RAG systems are inadequate in answering multi-hop queries, which require retrieving and reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no existing RAG benchmarking dataset focuses on multi-hop queries. In this paper, we develop a novel dataset, MultiHop-RAG, which consists of a knowledge base, a large collection of multi-hop queries, their ground-truth answers, and the associated supporting evidence. We detail the procedure of building the dataset, utilizing an English news article dataset as the underlying RAG knowledge base. We demonstrate the benchmarking utility of MultiHop-RAG in two experiments. The first experiment compares different embedding models for retrieving evidence for multi-hop queries. In the second experiment, we examine the capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama2-70B, in reasoning and answering multi-hop queries given the evidence. Both experiments reveal that existing RAG methods perform unsatisfactorily in retrieving and answering multi-hop queries. We hope MultiHop-RAG will be a valuable resource for the community in developing effective RAG systems, thereby facilitating greater adoption of LLMs in practice. The MultiHop-RAG and implemented RAG system is publicly available at https://github.com/yixuantt/MultiHop-RAG/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15391v1,2024-01
Towards Event Extraction from Speech with Contextual Clues,"Jingqi Kang, Tongtong Wu, Jinming Zhao, Guitao Wang, Guilin Qi, Yuan-Fang Li, Gholamreza Haffari","While text-based event extraction has been an active research area and has seen successful application in many domains, extracting semantic events from speech directly is an under-explored problem. In this paper, we introduce the Speech Event Extraction (SpeechEE) task and construct three synthetic training sets and one human-spoken test set. Compared to event extraction from text, SpeechEE poses greater challenges mainly due to complex speech signals that are continuous and have no word boundaries. Additionally, unlike perceptible sound events, semantic events are more subtle and require a deeper understanding. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a sequence-to-structure generation paradigm that can produce events from speech signals in an end-to-end manner, together with a conditioned generation method that utilizes speech recognition transcripts as the contextual clue. We further propose to represent events with a flat format to make outputs more natural language-like. Our experimental results show that our method brings significant improvements on all datasets, achieving a maximum F1 gain of 10.7%.

A RAG-based Question Answering System Proposal for Understanding Islam: MufassirQAS LLM,"Ahmet Yusuf Alan, Enis Karaarslan, Ömer Aydin","Challenges exist in learning and understanding religions, such as the complexity and depth of religious doctrines and teachings. Chatbots as question-answering systems can help in solving these challenges. LLM chatbots use NLP techniques to establish connections between topics and accurately respond to complex questions. These capabilities make it perfect for enlightenment on religion as a question-answering chatbot. However, LLMs also tend to generate false information, known as hallucination. Also, the chatbots' responses can include content that insults personal religious beliefs, interfaith conflicts, and controversial or sensitive topics. It must avoid such cases without promoting hate speech or offending certain groups of people or their beliefs. This study uses a vector database-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the accuracy and transparency of LLMs. Our question-answering system is called ""MufassirQAS"". We created a database consisting of several open-access books that include Turkish context. These books contain Turkish translations and interpretations of Islam. This database is utilized to answer religion-related questions and ensure our answers are trustworthy. The relevant part of the dataset, which LLM also uses, is presented along with the answer. We have put careful effort into creating system prompts that give instructions to prevent harmful, offensive, or disrespectful responses to respect people's values and provide reliable results. The system answers and shares additional information, such as the page number from the respective book and the articles referenced for obtaining the information. MufassirQAS and ChatGPT are also tested with sensitive questions. We got better performance with our system. Study and enhancements are still in progress. Results and future works are given.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15378v4,2024-01
LegalDuet: Learning Effective Representations for Legal Judgment Prediction through a Dual-View Legal Clue Reasoning,"Pengjie Liu, Zhenghao Liu, Xiaoyuan Yi, Liner Yang, Shuo Wang, Yu Gu, Ge Yu, Xing Xie, Shuang-hua Yang","Most existing Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) models focus on discovering the legal triggers in the criminal fact description. However, in real-world scenarios, a professional judge not only needs to assimilate the law case experience that thrives on past sentenced legal judgments but also depends on the professional legal grounded reasoning that learned from professional legal knowledge. In this paper, we propose a LegalDuet model, which pretrains language models to learn a tailored embedding space for making legal judgments. It proposes a dual-view legal clue reasoning mechanism, which derives from two reasoning chains of judges: 1) Law Case Reasoning, which makes legal judgments according to the judgment experiences learned from analogy/confusing legal cases; 2) Legal Ground Reasoning, which lies in matching the legal clues between criminal cases and legal decisions. Our experiments show that LegalDuet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAIL2018 dataset and outperforms baselines with about 4% improvements on average. Our dual-view reasoning based pretraining can capture critical legal clues to learn a tailored embedding space to distinguish criminal cases. It reduces LegalDuet's uncertainty during prediction and brings pretraining advances to the confusing/low frequent charges.

Importance-Aware Data Augmentation for Document-Level Neural Machine Translation,"Minghao Wu, Yufei Wang, George Foster, Lizhen Qu, Gholamreza Haffari","Document-level neural machine translation (DocNMT) aims to generate translations that are both coherent and cohesive, in contrast to its sentence-level counterpart. However, due to its longer input length and limited availability of training data, DocNMT often faces the challenge of data sparsity. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel Importance-Aware Data Augmentation (IADA) algorithm for DocNMT that augments the training data based on token importance information estimated by the norm of hidden states and training gradients. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three widely-used DocNMT benchmarks. Our empirical results show that our proposed IADA outperforms strong DocNMT baselines as well as several data augmentation approaches, with statistical significance on both sentence-level and document-level BLEU.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15360v1,2024-01

They have been widely used in various applications like text analysis and context recommendation. Recently, the rise of neural networks has facilitated the emergence of a new research field -- Neural Topic Models (NTMs). Different from conventional topic models, NTMs directly optimize parameters without requiring model-specific derivations. This endows NTMs with better scalability and flexibility, resulting in significant research attention and plentiful new methods and applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on neural topic models concerning methods, applications, and challenges. Specifically, we systematically organize current NTM methods according to their network structures and introduce the NTMs for various scenarios like short texts and bilingual documents. We also discuss a wide range of popular applications built on NTMs. Finally, we highlight the challenges confronted by NTMs to inspire future research.

A Comprehensive Survey of Compression Algorithms for Language Models,"Seungcheol Park, Jaehyeon Choi, Sojin Lee, U Kang","How can we compress language models without sacrificing accuracy? The number of compression algorithms for language models is rapidly growing to benefit from remarkable advances of recent language models without side effects due to the gigantic size of language models, such as increased carbon emissions and expensive maintenance fees. While numerous compression algorithms have shown remarkable progress in compressing language models, it ironically becomes challenging to capture emerging trends and identify the fundamental concepts underlying them due to the excessive number of algorithms. In this paper, we survey and summarize diverse compression algorithms including pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, low-rank approximation, parameter sharing, and efficient architecture design. We not only summarize the overall trend of diverse compression algorithms but also select representative algorithms and provide in-depth analyses of them. We discuss the value of each category of compression algorithms, and the desired properties of low-cost compression algorithms which have a significant impact due to the emergence of large language models.

Fortifying Ethical Boundaries in AI: Advanced Strategies for Enhancing Security in Large Language Models,"Yunhong He, Jianling Qiu, Wei Zhang, Zhengqing Yuan","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced capabilities in natural language processing and artificial intelligence. These models, including GPT-3.5 and LLaMA-2, have revolutionized text generation, translation, and question-answering tasks due to the transformative Transformer model. Despite their widespread use, LLMs present challenges such as ethical dilemmas when models are compelled to respond inappropriately, susceptibility to phishing attacks, and privacy violations. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a multi-pronged approach that includes: 1) filtering sensitive vocabulary from user input to prevent unethical responses; 2) detecting role-playing to halt interactions that could lead to 'prison break' scenarios; 3) implementing custom rule engines to restrict the generation of prohibited content; and 4) extending these methodologies to various LLM derivatives like Multi-Model Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach not only fortifies models against unethical manipulations and privacy breaches but also maintains their high performance across tasks. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance under various attack prompts, without compromising the model's core functionalities. Furthermore, the introduction of differentiated security levels empowers users to control their personal data disclosure. Our methods contribute to reducing social risks and conflicts arising from technological abuse, enhance data protection, and promote social equity. Collectively, this research provides a framework for balancing the efficiency of question-answering systems with user privacy and ethical standards, ensuring a safer user experience and fostering trust in AI technology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01725v1,2024-01
Equipping Language Models with Tool Use Capability for Tabular Data Analysis in Finance,"Adrian Theuma, Ehsan Shareghi","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited an array of reasoning capabilities but face challenges like error propagation and hallucination, particularly in specialised areas like finance, where data is heterogeneous, and precision is paramount. We explore the potential of language model augmentation with external tools to mitigate these limitations and offload certain reasoning steps to external tools that are more suited for the task, instead of solely depending on the LLM's inherent abilities. More concretely, using financial domain question-answering datasets, we apply supervised fine-tuning on a LLaMA-2 13B Chat model to act both as a 'task router' and 'task solver'. The 'task router' dynamically directs a question to either be answered internally by the LLM or externally via the right tool from the tool set. Our tool-equipped SFT model, Raven, demonstrates an improvement of 35.2% and 5.06% over the base model and SFT-only baselines, respectively, and is highly competitive with strong GPT-3.5 results.

CERM: Context-aware Literature-based Discovery via Sentiment Analysis,"Julio Christian Young, Uchenna Akujuobi","Driven by the abundance of biomedical publications, we introduce a sentiment analysis task to understand food-health relationship. Prior attempts to incorporate health into recipe recommendation and analysis systems have primarily focused on ingredient nutritional components or utilized basic computational models trained on curated labeled data. Enhanced models that capture the inherent relationship between food ingredients and biomedical concepts can be more beneficial for food-related research, given the wealth of information in biomedical texts. Considering the costly data labeling process, these models should effectively utilize both labeled and unlabeled data. This paper introduces Entity Relationship Sentiment Analysis (ERSA), a new task that captures the sentiment of a text based on an entity pair. ERSA extends the widely studied Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task. Specifically, our study concentrates on the ERSA task applied to biomedical texts, focusing on (entity-entity) pairs of biomedical and food concepts. ERSA poses a significant challenge compared to traditional sentiment analysis tasks, as sentence sentiment may not align with entity relationship sentiment. Additionally, we propose CERM, a semi-supervised architecture that combines different word embeddings to enhance the encoding of the ERSA task. Experimental results showcase the model's efficiency across diverse learning scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01724v1,2024-01

An Empirical Study on Large Language Models in Accuracy and Robustness under Chinese Industrial Scenarios,"Zongjie Li, Wenying Qiu, Pingchuan Ma, Yichen Li, You Li, Sijia He, Baozheng Jiang, Shuai Wang, Weixi Gu","Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) in various domains. To better serve the large number of Chinese users, many commercial vendors in China have adopted localization strategies, training and providing local LLMs specifically customized for Chinese users. Furthermore, looking ahead, one of the key future applications of LLMs will be practical deployment in industrial production by enterprises and users in those sectors. However, the accuracy and robustness of LLMs in industrial scenarios have not been well studied. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on the accuracy and robustness of LLMs in the context of the Chinese industrial production area. We manually collected 1,200 domain-specific problems from 8 different industrial sectors to evaluate LLM accuracy. Furthermore, we designed a metamorphic testing framework containing four industrial-specific stability categories with eight abilities, totaling 13,631 questions with variants to evaluate LLM robustness. In total, we evaluated 9 different LLMs developed by Chinese vendors, as well as four different LLMs developed by global vendors. Our major findings include: (1) Current LLMs exhibit low accuracy in Chinese industrial contexts, with all LLMs scoring less than 0.6. (2) The robustness scores vary across industrial sectors, and local LLMs overall perform worse than global ones. (3) LLM robustness differs significantly across abilities. Global LLMs are more robust under logical-related variants, while advanced local LLMs perform better on problems related to understanding Chinese industrial terminology. Our study results provide valuable guidance for understanding and promoting the industrial domain capabilities of LLMs from both development and industrial enterprise perspectives. The results further motivate possible research directions and tooling support.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01723v1,2024-01
Improving Medical Reasoning through Retrieval and Self-Reflection with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models,"Minbyul Jeong, Jiwoong Sohn, Mujeen Sung, Jaewoo Kang","Recent proprietary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have achieved a milestone in tackling diverse challenges in the biomedical domain, ranging from multiple-choice questions to long-form generations. To address challenges that still cannot be handled with the encoded knowledge of LLMs, various retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been developed by searching documents from the knowledge corpus and appending them unconditionally or selectively to the input of LLMs for generation. However, when applying existing methods to different domain-specific problems, poor generalization becomes apparent, leading to fetching incorrect documents or making inaccurate judgments. In this paper, we introduce Self-BioRAG, a framework reliable for biomedical text that specializes in generating explanations, retrieving domain-specific documents, and self-reflecting generated responses. We utilize 84k filtered biomedical instruction sets to train Self-BioRAG that can assess its generated explanations with customized reflective tokens. Our work proves that domain-specific components, such as a retriever, domain-related document corpus, and instruction sets are necessary for adhering to domain-related instructions. Using three major medical question-answering benchmark datasets, experimental results of Self-BioRAG demonstrate significant performance gains by achieving a 7.2% absolute improvement on average over the state-of-the-art open-foundation model with a parameter size of 7B or less. Overall, we analyze that Self-BioRAG finds the clues in the question, retrieves relevant documents if needed, and understands how to answer with information from retrieved documents and encoded knowledge as a medical expert does.

Enhancing Large Language Model Performance To Answer Questions and Extract Information More Accurately,"Liang Zhang, Katherine Jijo, Spurthi Setty, Eden Chung, Fatima Javid, Natan Vidra, Tommy Clifford","Large Language Models (LLMs) generate responses to questions; however, their effectiveness is often hindered by sub-optimal quality of answers and occasional failures to provide accurate responses to questions. To address these challenges, a fine-tuning process is employed, involving feedback and examples to refine models. The objective is to enhance AI models through continuous feedback loops, utilizing metrics such as cosine similarity, LLM evaluation and Rouge-L scores to evaluate the models. Leveraging LLMs like GPT-3.5, GPT4ALL, and LLaMA2, and Claude, this approach is benchmarked on financial datasets, including the FinanceBench and RAG Instruct Benchmark Tester Dataset, illustrating the necessity of fine-tuning. The results showcase the capability of fine-tuned models to surpass the accuracy of zero-shot LLMs, providing superior question and answering capabilities. Notably, the combination of fine-tuning the LLM with a process known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) proves to generate responses with improved accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01722v1,2024-01
Unlearning Traces the Influential Training Data of Language Models,"Masaru Isonuma, Ivan Titov","Identifying the training datasets that influence a language model's outputs is essential for minimizing the generation of harmful content and enhancing its performance. Ideally, we can measure the influence of each dataset by removing it from training; however, it is prohibitively expensive to retrain a model multiple times. This paper presents UnTrac: unlearning traces the influence of a training dataset on the model's performance. UnTrac is extremely simple; each training dataset is unlearned by gradient ascent, and we evaluate how much the model's predictions change after unlearning. Furthermore, we propose a more scalable approach, UnTrac-Inv, which unlearns a test dataset and evaluates the unlearned model on training datasets. UnTrac-Inv resembles UnTrac, while being efficient for massive training datasets. In the experiments, we examine if our methods can assess the influence of pretraining datasets on generating toxic, biased, and untruthful content. Our methods estimate their influence much more accurately than existing methods while requiring neither excessive memory space nor multiple checkpoints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15241v2,2024-01
Transfer Learning for the Prediction of Entity Modifiers in Clinical Text: Application to Opioid Use Disorder Case Detection,"Abdullateef I. Almudaifer, Whitney Covington, JaMor Hairston, Zachary Deitch, Ankit Anand, Caleb M. Carroll, Estera Crisan, William Bradford, Lauren Walter, Eaton Ellen, Sue S. Feldman, John D. Osborne","Background: The semantics of entities extracted from a clinical text can be dramatically altered by modifiers, including entity negation, uncertainty, conditionality, severity, and subject. Existing models for determining modifiers of clinical entities involve regular expression or features weights that are trained independently for each modifier.   Methods: We develop and evaluate a multi-task transformer architecture design where modifiers are learned and predicted jointly using the publicly available SemEval 2015 Task 14 corpus and a new Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) data set that contains modifiers shared with SemEval as well as novel modifiers specific for OUD. We evaluate the effectiveness of our multi-task learning approach versus previously published systems and assess the feasibility of transfer learning for clinical entity modifiers when only a portion of clinical modifiers are shared.   Results: Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results on the ShARe corpus from SemEval 2015 Task 14, showing an increase of 1.1% on weighted accuracy, 1.7% on unweighted accuracy, and 10% on micro F1 scores.   Conclusions: We show that learned weights from our shared model can be effectively transferred to a new partially matched data set, validating the use of transfer learning for clinical text modifiers",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15222v2,2024-01
HiFT: A Hierarchical Full Parameter Fine-Tuning Strategy,"Yongkang Liu, Yiqun Zhang, Qian Li, Tong Liu, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang, Hinrich Schütze","Full-parameter fine-tuning has become the go-to choice for adapting language models (LMs) to downstream tasks due to its excellent performance. As LMs grow in size, fine-tuning the full parameters of LMs requires a prohibitively large amount of GPU memory. Existing approaches utilize zeroth-order optimizer to conserve GPU memory, which can potentially compromise the performance of LMs as non-zero order optimizers tend to converge more readily on most downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel optimizer-independent end-to-end hierarchical fine-tuning strategy, HiFT, which only updates a subset of parameters at each training step. HiFT can significantly reduce the amount of gradients and optimizer state parameters residing in GPU memory at the same time, thereby reducing GPU memory usage. Our results demonstrate that: (1) HiFT achieves comparable performance to parameter-efficient fine-tuning and standard full parameter fine-tuning. (2) HiFT supports various optimizers including AdamW, AdaGrad, SGD, etc. (3) HiFT can save more than 60\% GPU memory compared with standard full-parameter fine-tuning for 7B model. (4) HiFT enables full-parameter fine-tuning of a 7B model on single 48G A6000 with a precision of 32 using the AdamW optimizer, without using any memory saving techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15207v3,2024-01
Scalable Qualitative Coding with LLMs: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Matches Human Performance in Some Hermeneutic Tasks,Zackary Okun Dunivin,"Qualitative coding, or content analysis, extracts meaning from text to discern quantitative patterns across a corpus of texts. Recently, advances in the interpretive abilities of large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating the coding process (applying category labels to texts), thereby enabling human researchers to concentrate on more creative research aspects, while delegating these interpretive tasks to AI. Our case study comprises a set of socio-historical codes on dense, paragraph-long passages representative of a humanistic study. We show that GPT-4 is capable of human-equivalent interpretations, whereas GPT-3.5 is not. Compared to our human-derived gold standard, GPT-4 delivers excellent intercoder reliability (Cohen's $\kappa \geq 0.79$) for 3 of 9 codes, and substantial reliability ($\kappa \geq 0.6$) for 8 of 9 codes. In contrast, GPT-3.5 greatly underperforms for all codes ($mean(\kappa) = 0.34$; $max(\kappa) = 0.55$). Importantly, we find that coding fidelity improves considerably when the LLM is prompted to give rationale justifying its coding decisions (chain-of-thought reasoning). We present these and other findings along with a set of best practices for adapting traditional codebooks for LLMs. Our results indicate that for certain codebooks, state-of-the-art LLMs are already adept at large-scale content analysis. Furthermore, they suggest the next generation of models will likely render AI coding a viable option for a majority of codebooks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15170v2,2024-01
EAGLE: Speculative Sampling Requires Rethinking Feature Uncertainty,"Yuhui Li, Fangyun Wei, Chao Zhang, Hongyang Zhang","Autoregressive decoding makes the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) time-consuming. In this paper, we reconsider speculative sampling and derive two key observations. Firstly, autoregression at the feature (second-to-top-layer) level is more straightforward than at the token level. Secondly, the inherent uncertainty in feature (second-to-top-layer) level autoregression constrains its performance. Based on these insights, we introduce EAGLE (Extrapolation Algorithm for Greater Language-model Efficiency), a simple yet highly efficient speculative sampling framework. By incorporating a token sequence advanced by one time step, EAGLE effectively resolves the uncertainty, enabling precise second-to-top-layer feature prediction with minimal overhead. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of EAGLE, including all models from the Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat series, the MoE model Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, and tasks in dialogue, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and instruction following. For LLaMA2-Chat 70B, EAGLE achieved a latency speedup ratio of 2.7x-3.5x, doubled throughput, while maintaining the distribution of the generated text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15077v2,2024-01
Pairing Orthographically Variant Literary Words to Standard Equivalents Using Neural Edit Distance Models,"Craig Messner, Tom Lippincott","We present a novel corpus consisting of orthographically variant words found in works of 19th century U.S. literature annotated with their corresponding ""standard"" word pair. We train a set of neural edit distance models to pair these variants with their standard forms, and compare the performance of these models to the performance of a set of neural edit distance models trained on a corpus of orthographic errors made by L2 English learners. Finally, we analyze the relative performance of these models in the light of different negative training sample generation strategies, and offer concluding remarks on the unique challenge literary orthographic variation poses to string pairing methodologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15068v1,2024-01
Deep Learning Based Amharic Chatbot for FAQs in Universities,"Goitom Ybrah Hailu, Hadush Hailu, Shishay Welay","University students often spend a considerable amount of time seeking answers to common questions from administrators or teachers. This can become tedious for both parties, leading to a need for a solution. In response, this paper proposes a chatbot model that utilizes natural language processing and deep learning techniques to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) in the Amharic language. Chatbots are computer programs that simulate human conversation through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), acting as a virtual assistant to handle questions and other tasks. The proposed chatbot program employs tokenization, normalization, stop word removal, and stemming to analyze and categorize Amharic input sentences. Three machine learning model algorithms were used to classify tokens and retrieve appropriate responses: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Na\""ive Bayes, and deep neural networks implemented through TensorFlow, Keras, and NLTK. The deep learning model achieved the best results with 91.55% accuracy and a validation loss of 0.3548 using an Adam optimizer and SoftMax activation function. The chatbot model was integrated with Facebook Messenger and deployed on a Heroku server for 24-hour accessibility. The experimental results demonstrate that the chatbot framework achieved its objectives and effectively addressed challenges such as Amharic Fidel variation, morphological variation, and lexical gaps. Future research could explore the integration of Amharic WordNet to narrow the lexical gap and support more complex questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01720v2,2024-01
Deep learning-based approach for tomato classification in complex scenes,"Mikael A. Mousse, Bethel C. A. R. K. Atohoun, Cina Motamed","Tracking ripening tomatoes is time consuming and labor intensive. Artificial intelligence technologies combined with those of computer vision can help users optimize the process of monitoring the ripening status of plants. To this end, we have proposed a tomato ripening monitoring approach based on deep learning in complex scenes. The objective is to detect mature tomatoes and harvest them in a timely manner. The proposed approach is declined in two parts. Firstly, the images of the scene are transmitted to the pre-processing layer. This process allows the detection of areas of interest (area of the image containing tomatoes). Then, these images are used as input to the maturity detection layer. This layer, based on a deep neural network learning algorithm, classifies the tomato thumbnails provided to it in one of the following five categories: green, brittle, pink, pale red, mature red. The experiments are based on images collected from the internet gathered through searches using tomato state across diverse languages including English, German, French, and Spanish. The experimental results of the maturity detection layer on a dataset composed of images of tomatoes taken under the extreme conditions, gave a good classification rate.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15055v1,2024-01
LongFin: A Multimodal Document Understanding Model for Long Financial Domain Documents,"Ahmed Masry, Amir Hajian","Document AI is a growing research field that focuses on the comprehension and extraction of information from scanned and digital documents to make everyday business operations more efficient. Numerous downstream tasks and datasets have been introduced to facilitate the training of AI models capable of parsing and extracting information from various document types such as receipts and scanned forms. Despite these advancements, both existing datasets and models fail to address critical challenges that arise in industrial contexts. Existing datasets primarily comprise short documents consisting of a single page, while existing models are constrained by a limited maximum length, often set at 512 tokens. Consequently, the practical application of these methods in financial services, where documents can span multiple pages, is severely impeded. To overcome these challenges, we introduce LongFin, a multimodal document AI model capable of encoding up to 4K tokens. We also propose the LongForms dataset, a comprehensive financial dataset that encapsulates several industrial challenges in financial documents. Through an extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the LongFin model on the LongForms dataset, surpassing the performance of existing public models while maintaining comparable results on existing single-page benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15050v1,2024-01
Health Text Simplification: An Annotated Corpus for Digestive Cancer Education and Novel Strategies for Reinforcement Learning,"Md Mushfiqur Rahman, Mohammad Sabik Irbaz, Kai North, Michelle S. Williams, Marcos Zampieri, Kevin Lybarger","Objective: The reading level of health educational materials significantly influences the understandability and accessibility of the information, particularly for minoritized populations. Many patient educational resources surpass the reading level and complexity of widely accepted standards. There is a critical need for high-performing text simplification models in health information to enhance dissemination and literacy. This need is particularly acute in cancer education, where effective prevention and screening education can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality.   Methods: We introduce Simplified Digestive Cancer (SimpleDC), a parallel corpus of cancer education materials tailored for health text simplification research, comprising educational content from the American Cancer Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Cancer Institute. Utilizing SimpleDC alongside the existing Med-EASi corpus, we explore Large Language Model (LLM)-based simplification methods, including fine-tuning, reinforcement learning (RL), reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), domain adaptation, and prompt-based approaches. Our experimentation encompasses Llama 2 and GPT-4. A novel RLHF reward function is introduced, featuring a lightweight model adept at distinguishing between original and simplified texts, thereby enhancing the model's effectiveness with unlabeled data.   Results: Fine-tuned Llama 2 models demonstrated high performance across various metrics.

The results underscore that RL/RLHF can augment fine-tuning, facilitating model training on unlabeled text and improving performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15043v3,2024-01
PROXYQA: An Alternative Framework for Evaluating Long-Form Text Generation with Large Language Models,"Haochen Tan, Zhijiang Guo, Zhan Shi, Lu Xu, Zhili Liu, Yunlong Feng, Xiaoguang Li, Yasheng Wang, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu, Linqi Song","Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in understanding long-form contents. However, exploring their capability for generating long-form contents, such as reports and articles, has been relatively unexplored and inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks. The prevalent evaluation methods, which predominantly rely on crowdsourcing, are recognized for their labor-intensive nature and lack of efficiency, whereas automated metrics, such as the ROUGE score, demonstrate discordance with human judgment criteria. In this paper, we propose ProxyQA, an innovative framework dedicated to assessing long-text generation. ProxyQA comprises in-depth human-curated meta-questions spanning various domains, each accompanied by specific proxy-questions with pre-annotated answers. LLMs are tasked to generate extensive content in response to these meta-questions, by engaging an evaluator and incorporating the generated texts as contextual background, ProxyQA assesses the generated content's quality through the evaluator's accuracy in addressing the proxy-questions. We examine multiple LLMs, emphasizing ProxyQA's demanding nature as a high-quality assessment tool. Human evaluation demonstrates that the proxy-question method is notably self-consistent and aligns closely with human evaluative standards.

Measuring Moral Inconsistencies in Large Language Models,"Vamshi Krishna Bonagiri, Sreeram Vennam, Manas Gaur, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru","A Large Language Model (LLM) is considered consistent if semantically equivalent prompts produce semantically equivalent responses. Despite recent advancements showcasing the impressive capabilities of LLMs in conversational systems, we show that even state-of-the-art LLMs are highly inconsistent in their generations, questioning their reliability. Prior research has tried to measure this with task-specific accuracy. However, this approach is unsuitable for moral scenarios, such as the trolley problem, with no ""correct"" answer. To address this issue, we propose a novel information-theoretic measure called Semantic Graph Entropy (SGE) to measure the consistency of an LLM in moral scenarios. We leverage ""Rules of Thumb"" (RoTs) to explain a model's decision-making strategies and further enhance our metric. Compared to existing consistency metrics, SGE correlates better with human judgments across five LLMs. In the future, we aim to investigate the root causes of LLM inconsistencies and propose improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01719v3,2024-01
SliceGPT: Compress Large Language Models by Deleting Rows and Columns,"Saleh Ashkboos, Maximilian L. Croci, Marcelo Gennari do Nascimento, Torsten Hoefler, James Hensman","Large language models have become the cornerstone of natural language processing, but their use comes with substantial costs in terms of compute and memory resources. Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for LLAMA2-70B, OPT 66B and Phi-2 models while maintaining 99%, 99% and 90% zero-shot task performance of the dense model respectively. Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA2-70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained models.

Do LLMs Dream of Ontologies?,"Marco Bombieri, Paolo Fiorini, Simone Paolo Ponzetto, Marco Rospocher","Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized automated text understanding and generation. The performance of these models relies on the high number of parameters of the underlying neural architectures, which allows LLMs to memorize part of the vast quantity of data seen during the training. This paper investigates whether and to what extent general-purpose pre-trained LLMs have memorized information from known ontologies. Our results show that LLMs partially know ontologies: they can, and do indeed, memorize concepts from ontologies mentioned in the text, but the level of memorization of their concepts seems to vary proportionally to their popularity on the Web, the primary source of their training material. We additionally propose new metrics to estimate the degree of memorization of ontological information in LLMs by measuring the consistency of the output produced across different prompt repetitions, query languages, and degrees of determinism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14931v1,2024-01

The Power of Noise: Redefining Retrieval for RAG Systems,"Florin Cuconasu, Giovanni Trappolini, Federico Siciliano, Simone Filice, Cesare Campagnano, Yoelle Maarek, Nicola Tonellotto, Fabrizio Silvestri","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a method to extend beyond the pre-trained knowledge of Large Language Models by augmenting the original prompt with relevant passages or documents retrieved by an Information Retrieval (IR) system. RAG has become increasingly important for Generative AI solutions, especially in enterprise settings or in any domain in which knowledge is constantly refreshed and cannot be memorized in the LLM. We argue here that the retrieval component of RAG systems, be it dense or sparse, deserves increased attention from the research community, and accordingly, we conduct the first comprehensive and systematic examination of the retrieval strategy of RAG systems. We focus, in particular, on the type of passages IR systems within a RAG solution should retrieve. Our analysis considers multiple factors, such as the relevance of the passages included in the prompt context, their position, and their number. One counter-intuitive finding of this work is that the retriever's highest-scoring documents that are not directly relevant to the query (e.g., do not contain the answer) negatively impact the effectiveness of the LLM. Even more surprising, we discovered that adding random documents in the prompt improves the LLM accuracy by up to 35%. These results highlight the need to investigate the appropriate strategies when integrating retrieval with LLMs, thereby laying the groundwork for future research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14887v4,2024-01
F-Eval: Assessing Fundamental Abilities with Refined Evaluation Methods,"Yu Sun, Keyu Chen, Shujie Wang, Peiji Li, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang, Dahua Lin","Large language models (LLMs) garner significant attention for their unprecedented performance, leading to an increasing number of researches evaluating LLMs. However, these evaluation benchmarks are limited to assessing the instruction-following capabilities, overlooking the fundamental abilities that emerge during the pre-training stage. Previous subjective evaluation methods mainly reply on scoring by API models. However, in the absence of references, large models have shown limited ability to discern subtle differences. To bridge the gap, we propose F-Eval, a bilingual evaluation benchmark to evaluate the fundamental abilities, including expression, commonsense and logic. The tasks in F-Eval include multi-choice objective tasks, open-ended objective tasks, reference-based subjective tasks and reference-free subjective tasks. For reference-free subjective tasks, we devise new evaluation methods, serving as alternatives to scoring by API models. We conduct evaluations on 13 advanced LLMs. Results show that our evaluation methods show higher correlation coefficients and larger distinction than other evaluators.

Evaluation of LLM Chatbots for OSINT-based Cyber Threat Awareness,"Samaneh Shafee, Alysson Bessani, Pedro M. Ferreira","Knowledge sharing about emerging threats is crucial in the rapidly advancing field of cybersecurity and forms the foundation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). In this context, Large Language Models are becoming increasingly significant in the field of cybersecurity, presenting a wide range of opportunities. This study surveys the performance of ChatGPT, GPT4all, Dolly, Stanford Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, Falcon, and Vicuna chatbots in binary classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks performed using Open Source INTelligence (OSINT). We utilize well-established data collected in previous research from Twitter to assess the competitiveness of these chatbots when compared to specialized models trained for those tasks. In binary classification experiments, Chatbot GPT-4 as a commercial model achieved an acceptable F1 score of 0.94, and the open-source GPT4all model achieved an F1 score of 0.90. However, concerning cybersecurity entity recognition, all evaluated chatbots have limitations and are less effective. This study demonstrates the capability of chatbots for OSINT binary classification and shows that they require further improvement in NER to effectively replace specially trained models.

However, most models currently used in chemistry are specialist models that require training and tuning for specific tasks. A more generic and efficient solution would be an AI model that could address many tasks and support free-form dialogue in the broad field of chemistry. In its utmost form, such a generalist AI chemist could be referred to as Chemical General Intelligence. Large language models (LLMs) have recently logged tremendous success in the general domain of natural language processing, showing emerging task generalization and free-form dialogue capabilities. However, domain knowledge of chemistry is largely missing when training general-domain LLMs. The lack of such knowledge greatly hinders the performance of generalist LLMs in the field of chemistry. To this end, we develop ChemDFM, a pioneering LLM for chemistry trained on 34B tokens from chemical literature and textbooks, and fine-tuned using 2.7M instructions. As a result, it can understand and reason with chemical knowledge in free-form dialogue. Quantitative evaluations show that ChemDFM significantly surpasses most representative open-source LLMs. It outperforms GPT-4 on a great portion of chemical tasks, despite the substantial size difference.

Large Language Model Adaptation for Financial Sentiment Analysis,"Pau Rodriguez Inserte, Mariam Nakhlé, Raheel Qader, Gaetan Caillaut, Jingshu Liu","Natural language processing (NLP) has recently gained relevance within financial institutions by providing highly valuable insights into companies and markets' financial documents. However, the landscape of the financial domain presents extra challenges for NLP, due to the complexity of the texts and the use of specific terminology. Generalist language models tend to fall short in tasks specifically tailored for finance, even when using large language models (LLMs) with great natural language understanding and generative capabilities. This paper presents a study on LLM adaptation methods targeted at the financial domain and with high emphasis on financial sentiment analysis. To this purpose, two foundation models with less than 1.5B parameters have been adapted using a wide range of strategies. We show that through careful fine-tuning on both financial documents and instructions, these foundation models can be adapted to the target domain.

Furthermore, with the text dataset that has been successfully cleaned, sentiment analysis and epistemic categorization will be done in each sentence of the text. Sentiment analysis is divided into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral.

LLMs are increasingly employed to create a variety of outputs, including annotations, preferences, instruction prompts, simulated dialogues, and free text. As these forms of LLM-generated data often intersect in their application, they exert mutual influence on each other and raise significant concerns about the quality and diversity of the artificial data incorporated into training cycles, leading to an artificial data ecosystem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to aggregate various types of LLM-generated text data, from more tightly constrained data like ""task labels"" to more lightly constrained ""free-form text"". We then stress test the quality and implications of LLM-generated artificial data, comparing it with human data across various existing benchmarks. Despite artificial data's capability to match human performance, this paper reveals significant hidden disparities, especially in complex tasks where LLMs often miss the nuanced understanding of intrinsic human-generated content. This study critically examines diverse LLM-generated data and emphasizes the need for ethical practices in data creation and when using LLMs. It highlights the LLMs' shortcomings in replicating human traits and behaviors, underscoring the importance of addressing biases and artifacts produced in LLM-generated content for future research and development.

Taiyi-Diffusion-XL: Advancing Bilingual Text-to-Image Generation with Large Vision-Language Model Support,"Xiaojun Wu, Dixiang Zhang, Ruyi Gan, Junyu Lu, Ziwei Wu, Renliang Sun, Jiaxing Zhang, Pingjian Zhang, Yan Song","Recent advancements in text-to-image models have significantly enhanced image generation capabilities, yet a notable gap of open-source models persists in bilingual or Chinese language support. To address this need, we present Taiyi-Diffusion-XL, a new Chinese and English bilingual text-to-image model which is developed by extending the capabilities of CLIP and Stable-Diffusion-XL through a process of bilingual continuous pre-training. This approach includes the efficient expansion of vocabulary by integrating the most frequently used Chinese characters into CLIP's tokenizer and embedding layers, coupled with an absolute position encoding expansion. Additionally, we enrich text prompts by large vision-language model, leading to better images captions and possess higher visual quality. These enhancements are subsequently applied to downstream text-to-image models. Our empirical results indicate that the developed CLIP model excels in bilingual image-text retrieval.Furthermore, the bilingual image generation capabilities of Taiyi-Diffusion-XL surpass previous models. This research leads to the development and open-sourcing of the Taiyi-Diffusion-XL model, representing a notable advancement in the field of image generation, particularly for Chinese language applications. This contribution is a step forward in addressing the need for more diverse language support in multimodal research. The model and demonstration are made publicly available at \href{https://huggingface.co/IDEA-CCNL/Taiyi-Stable-Diffusion-XL-3.5B/}, fostering further research and collaboration in this domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14688v3,2024-01

UNIT-DSR: Dysarthric Speech Reconstruction System Using Speech Unit Normalization,"Yuejiao Wang, Xixin Wu, Disong Wang, Lingwei Meng, Helen Meng","Dysarthric speech reconstruction (DSR) systems aim to automatically convert dysarthric speech into normal-sounding speech. The technology eases communication with speakers affected by the neuromotor disorder and enhances their social inclusion. NED-based (Neural Encoder-Decoder) systems have significantly improved the intelligibility of the reconstructed speech as compared with GAN-based (Generative Adversarial Network) approaches, but the approach is still limited by training inefficiency caused by the cascaded pipeline and auxiliary tasks of the content encoder, which may in turn affect the quality of reconstruction. Inspired by self-supervised speech representation learning and discrete speech units, we propose a Unit-DSR system, which harnesses the powerful domain-adaptation capacity of HuBERT for training efficiency improvement and utilizes speech units to constrain the dysarthric content restoration in a discrete linguistic space. Compared with NED approaches, the Unit-DSR system only consists of a speech unit normalizer and a Unit HiFi-GAN vocoder, which is considerably simpler without cascaded sub-modules or auxiliary tasks. Results on the UASpeech corpus indicate that Unit-DSR outperforms competitive baselines in terms of content restoration, reaching a 28.2% relative average word error rate reduction when compared to original dysarthric speech, and shows robustness against speed perturbation and noise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14664v1,2024-01

A Korean Legal Judgment Prediction Dataset for Insurance Disputes,"Alice Saebom Kwak, Cheonkam Jeong, Ji Weon Lim, Byeongcheol Min","This paper introduces a Korean legal judgment prediction (LJP) dataset for insurance disputes. Successful LJP models on insurance disputes can benefit insurance companies and their customers. It can save both sides' time and money by allowing them to predict how the result would come out if they proceed to the dispute mediation process. As is often the case with low-resource languages, there is a limitation on the amount of data available for this specific task. To mitigate this issue, we investigate how one can achieve a good performance despite the limitation in data. In our experiment, we demonstrate that Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning (SetFit, Tunstall et al., 2022) is a good alternative to standard fine-tuning when training data are limited. The models fine-tuned with the SetFit approach on our data show similar performance to the Korean LJP benchmark models (Hwang et al., 2022) despite the much smaller data size.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14654v1,2024-01
Benchmarking Large Language Models in Complex Question Answering Attribution using Knowledge Graphs,"Nan Hu, Jiaoyan Chen, Yike Wu, Guilin Qi, Sheng Bi, Tongtong Wu, Jeff Z. Pan","The attribution of question answering is to provide citations for supporting generated statements, and has attracted wide research attention. The current methods for automatically evaluating the attribution, which are often based on Large Language Models (LLMs), are still inadequate, particularly in recognizing subtle differences between attributions, and complex relationships between citations and statements. To compare these attribution evaluation methods and develop new ones, we introduce a set of fine-grained categories (i.e., supportive, insufficient, contradictory and irrelevant) for measuring the attribution, and develop a Complex Attributed Question Answering (CAQA) benchmark by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) for automatically generating attributions of different categories to question-answer pairs. Our analysis reveals that existing evaluators perform poorly under fine-grained attribution settings and exhibit weaknesses in complex citation-statement reasoning. Our CAQA benchmark, validated with human annotations, emerges as a promising tool for selecting and developing LLM attribution evaluators.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14640v1,2024-01
T-Rex: Text-assisted Retrosynthesis Prediction,"Yifeng Liu, Hanwen Xu, Tangqi Fang, Haocheng Xi, Zixuan Liu, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Sheng Wang","As a fundamental task in computational chemistry, retrosynthesis prediction aims to identify a set of reactants to synthesize a target molecule. Existing template-free approaches only consider the graph structures of the target molecule, which often cannot generalize well to rare reaction types and large molecules. Here, we propose T-Rex, a text-assisted retrosynthesis prediction approach that exploits pre-trained text language models, such as ChatGPT, to assist the generation of reactants. T-Rex first exploits ChatGPT to generate a description for the target molecule and rank candidate reaction centers based both the description and the molecular graph. It then re-ranks these candidates by querying the descriptions for each reactants and examines which group of reactants can best synthesize the target molecule. We observed that T-Rex substantially outperformed graph-based state-of-the-art approaches on two datasets, indicating the effectiveness of considering text information. We further found that T-Rex outperformed the variant that only use ChatGPT-based description without the re-ranking step, demonstrate how our framework outperformed a straightforward integration of ChatGPT and graph information. Collectively, we show that text generated by pre-trained language models can substantially improve retrosynthesis prediction, opening up new avenues for exploiting ChatGPT to advance computational chemistry.

An Empirical Investigation of Domain Adaptation Ability for Chinese Spelling Check Models,"Xi Wang, Ruoqing Zhao, Hongliang Dai, Piji Li","Chinese Spelling Check (CSC) is a meaningful task in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which aims at detecting spelling errors in Chinese texts and then correcting these errors. However, CSC models are based on pretrained language models, which are trained on a general corpus. Consequently, their performance may drop when confronted with downstream tasks involving domain-specific terms. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation about the domain adaption ability of various typical CSC models by building three new datasets encompassing rich domain-specific terms from the financial, medical, and legal domains. Then we conduct empirical investigations in the corresponding domain-specific test datasets to ascertain the cross-domain adaptation ability of several typical CSC models.

Toward Practical Automatic Speech Recognition and Post-Processing: a Call for Explainable Error Benchmark Guideline,"Seonmin Koo, Chanjun Park, Jinsung Kim, Jaehyung Seo, Sugyeong Eo, Hyeonseok Moon, Heuiseok Lim","Automatic speech recognition (ASR) outcomes serve as input for downstream tasks, substantially impacting the satisfaction level of end-users. Hence, the diagnosis and enhancement of the vulnerabilities present in the ASR model bear significant importance. However, traditional evaluation methodologies of ASR systems generate a singular, composite quantitative metric, which fails to provide comprehensive insight into specific vulnerabilities. This lack of detail extends to the post-processing stage, resulting in further obfuscation of potential weaknesses. Despite an ASR model's ability to recognize utterances accurately, subpar readability can negatively affect user satisfaction, giving rise to a trade-off between recognition accuracy and user-friendliness. To effectively address this, it is imperative to consider both the speech-level, crucial for recognition accuracy, and the text-level, critical for user-friendliness. Consequently, we propose the development of an Error Explainable Benchmark (EEB) dataset. This dataset, while considering both speech- and text-level, enables a granular understanding of the model's shortcomings. Our proposition provides a structured pathway for a more `real-world-centric' evaluation, a marked shift away from abstracted, traditional methods, allowing for the detection and rectification of nuanced system weaknesses, ultimately aiming for an improved user experience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14625v1,2024-01
Query of CC: Unearthing Large Scale Domain-Specific Knowledge from Public Corpora,"Zhaoye Fei, Yunfan Shao, Linyang Li, Zhiyuan Zeng, Conghui He, Hang Yan, Dahua Lin, Xipeng Qiu","Large language models have demonstrated remarkable potential in various tasks, however, there remains a significant scarcity of open-source models and data for specific domains.

Alternative Speech: Complementary Method to Counter-Narrative for Better Discourse,"Seungyoon Lee, Dahyun Jung, Chanjun Park, Seolhwa Lee, Heuiseok Lim","We introduce the concept of ""Alternative Speech"" as a new way to directly combat hate speech and complement the limitations of counter-narrative. An alternative speech provides practical alternatives to hate speech in real-world scenarios by offering speech-level corrections to speakers while considering the surrounding context and promoting speakers to reform. Further, an alternative speech can combat hate speech alongside counter-narratives, offering a useful tool to address social issues such as racial discrimination and gender inequality. We propose the new concept and provide detailed guidelines for constructing the necessary dataset. Through discussion, we demonstrate that combining alternative speech and counter-narrative can be a more effective strategy for combating hate speech by complementing specificity and guiding capacity of counter-narrative. This paper presents another perspective for dealing with hate speech, offering viable remedies to complement the constraints of current approaches to mitigating harmful bias.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14616v1,2024-01
Enhancing Diagnostic Accuracy through Multi-Agent Conversations: Using Large Language Models to Mitigate Cognitive Bias,"Yu He Ke, Rui Yang, Sui An Lie, Taylor Xin Yi Lim, Hairil Rizal Abdullah, Daniel Shu Wei Ting, Nan Liu","Background: Cognitive biases in clinical decision-making significantly contribute to errors in diagnosis and suboptimal patient outcomes. Addressing these biases presents a formidable challenge in the medical field.   Objective: This study explores the role of large language models (LLMs) in mitigating these biases through the utilization of a multi-agent framework. We simulate the clinical decision-making processes through multi-agent conversation and evaluate its efficacy in improving diagnostic accuracy.   Methods: A total of 16 published and unpublished case reports where cognitive biases have resulted in misdiagnoses were identified from the literature. In the multi-agent framework, we leveraged GPT-4 to facilitate interactions among four simulated agents to replicate clinical team dynamics. Each agent has a distinct role: 1) To make the final diagnosis after considering the discussions, 2) The devil's advocate and correct confirmation and anchoring bias, 3) The tutor and facilitator of the discussion to reduce premature closure bias, and 4) To record and summarize the findings. A total of 80 simulations were evaluated for the accuracy of initial diagnosis, top differential diagnosis and final two differential diagnoses.   Results: In a total of 80 responses evaluating both initial and final diagnoses, the initial diagnosis had an accuracy of 0% (0/80), but following multi-agent discussions, the accuracy for the top differential diagnosis increased to 71.3% (57/80), and for the final two differential diagnoses, to 80.0% (64/80).   Conclusions: The framework demonstrated an ability to re-evaluate and correct misconceptions, even in scenarios with misleading initial investigations.

In this study, we constructed nuanced and ambiguous scenarios, we translated them in 10 languages, and we predicted their associated sentiment using popular LLMs. The results are validated against post-hoc human responses. Ambiguous scenarios are often well-coped by ChatGPT and Gemini, but we recognise significant biases and inconsistent performance across models and evaluated human languages.

Language Modelling Approaches to Adaptive Machine Translation,Yasmin Moslem,"Consistency is a key requirement of high-quality translation. It is especially important to adhere to pre-approved terminology and adapt to corrected translations in domain-specific projects. Machine translation (MT) has achieved significant progress in the area of domain adaptation. However, in-domain data scarcity is common in translation settings, due to the lack of specialised datasets and terminology, or inconsistency and inaccuracy of available in-domain translations. In such scenarios where there is insufficient in-domain data to fine-tune MT models, producing translations that are consistent with the relevant context is challenging. While real-time adaptation can make use of smaller amounts of in-domain data to improve the translation on the fly, it remains challenging due to supported context limitations and efficiency constraints. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown interesting capabilities of in-context learning, where they learn to replicate certain input-output text generation patterns, without further fine-tuning. Such capabilities have opened new horizons for domain-specific data augmentation and real-time adaptive MT. This work attempts to address two main relevant questions: 1) in scenarios involving human interaction and continuous feedback, can we employ language models to improve the quality of adaptive MT at inference time? and 2) in the absence of sufficient in-domain data, can we use pre-trained large-scale language models to improve the process of MT domain adaptation?",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14559v1,2024-01
Looking Right is Sometimes Right: Investigating the Capabilities of Decoder-only LLMs for Sequence Labeling,"David Dukić, Jan Šnajder","Pre-trained language models based on masked language modeling (MLM) excel in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. While fine-tuned MLM-based encoders consistently outperform causal language modeling decoders of comparable size, recent decoder-only large language models (LLMs) perform on par with smaller MLM-based encoders. Although their performance improves with scale, LLMs fall short of achieving state-of-the-art results in information extraction (IE) tasks, many of which are formulated as sequence labeling (SL). We hypothesize that LLMs' poor SL performance stems from causal masking, which prevents the model from attending to tokens on the right of the current token. Yet, how exactly and to what extent LLMs' performance on SL can be improved remains unclear. We explore techniques for improving the SL performance of open LLMs on IE tasks by applying layer-wise removal of the causal mask (CM) during LLM fine-tuning. This approach yields performance gains competitive with state-of-the-art SL models, matching or outperforming the results of CM removal from all blocks. Our findings hold for diverse SL tasks, demonstrating that open LLMs with layer-dependent CM removal outperform strong MLM-based encoders and even instruction-tuned LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14556v3,2024-01
Relative Value Biases in Large Language Models,"William M.

The present study tested whether large language models would exhibit a similar bias. We had gpt-4-1106-preview (GPT-4 Turbo) and Llama-2-70B make repeated choices between pairs of options with the goal of maximizing payoffs. A complete record of previous outcomes was included in each prompt. Both models exhibited relative value decision biases similar to those observed in humans and animals. Making relative comparisons among outcomes more explicit magnified the bias, whereas prompting the models to estimate expected outcomes caused the bias to disappear. These results have implications for the potential mechanisms that contribute to context-dependent choice in human agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14530v1,2024-01

We also show cases where multilingual models perform better on the task compared to monolingual models by a statistically significant margin, indicating that multilingual data presents additional opportunities for models to learn about cross-lingual, computational properties of euphemisms. In a follow-up analysis, we focus on universal euphemistic ""categories"" such as death and bodily functions among others.

Empathy and the Right to Be an Exception: What LLMs Can and Cannot Do,"William Kidder, Jason D'Cruz, Kush R. Varshney","Advances in the performance of large language models (LLMs) have led some researchers to propose the emergence of theory of mind (ToM) in artificial intelligence (AI). LLMs can attribute beliefs, desires, intentions, and emotions, and they will improve in their accuracy. Rather than employing the characteristically human method of empathy, they learn to attribute mental states by recognizing linguistic patterns in a dataset that typically do not include that individual. We ask whether LLMs' inability to empathize precludes them from honoring an individual's right to be an exception, that is, from making assessments of character and predictions of behavior that reflect appropriate sensitivity to a person's individuality. Can LLMs seriously consider an individual's claim that their case is different based on internal mental states like beliefs, desires, and intentions, or are they limited to judging that case based on its similarities to others? We propose that the method of empathy has special significance for honoring the right to be an exception that is distinct from the value of predictive accuracy, at which LLMs excel. We conclude by considering whether using empathy to consider exceptional cases has intrinsic or merely practical value and we introduce conceptual and empirical avenues for advancing this investigation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14523v1,2024-01
TrICy: Trigger-guided Data-to-text Generation with Intent aware Attention-Copy,"Vibhav Agarwal, Sourav Ghosh, Harichandana BSS, Himanshu Arora, Barath Raj Kandur Raja","Data-to-text (D2T) generation is a crucial task in many natural language understanding (NLU) applications and forms the foundation of task-oriented dialog systems. In the context of conversational AI solutions that can work directly with local data on the user's device, architectures utilizing large pre-trained language models (PLMs) are impractical for on-device deployment due to a high memory footprint. To this end, we propose TrICy, a novel lightweight framework for an enhanced D2T task that generates text sequences based on the intent in context and may further be guided by user-provided triggers. We leverage an attention-copy mechanism to predict out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words accurately. Performance analyses on E2E NLG dataset (BLEU: 66.43%, ROUGE-L: 70.14%), WebNLG dataset (BLEU: Seen 64.08%, Unseen 52.35%), and our Custom dataset related to text messaging applications, showcase our architecture's effectiveness. Moreover, we show that by leveraging an optional trigger input, data-to-text generation quality increases significantly and achieves the new SOTA score of 69.29% BLEU for E2E NLG. Furthermore, our analyses show that TrICy achieves at least 24% and 3% improvement in BLEU and METEOR respectively over LLMs like GPT-3, ChatGPT, and Llama 2. We also demonstrate that in some scenarios, performance improvement due to triggers is observed even when they are absent in training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01714v1,2024-01
Prompting Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Clinical Prediction with Structured Longitudinal Electronic Health Record Data,"Yinghao Zhu, Zixiang Wang, Junyi Gao, Yuning Tong, Jingkun An, Weibin Liao, Ewen M. Harrison, Liantao Ma, Chengwei Pan","The inherent complexity of structured longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data poses a significant challenge when integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), which are traditionally tailored for natural language processing. Motivated by the urgent need for swift decision-making during new disease outbreaks, where traditional predictive models often fail due to a lack of historical data, this research investigates the adaptability of LLMs, like GPT-4, to EHR data. We particularly focus on their zero-shot capabilities, which enable them to make predictions in scenarios in which they haven't been explicitly trained. In response to the longitudinal, sparse, and knowledge-infused nature of EHR data, our prompting approach involves taking into account specific EHR characteristics such as units and reference ranges, and employing an in-context learning strategy that aligns with clinical contexts. Our comprehensive experiments on the MIMIC-IV and TJH datasets demonstrate that with our elaborately designed prompting framework, LLMs can improve prediction performance in key tasks such as mortality, length-of-stay, and 30-day readmission by about 35\%, surpassing ML models in few-shot settings. Our research underscores the potential of LLMs in enhancing clinical decision-making, especially in urgent healthcare situations like the outbreak of emerging diseases with no labeled data.

To address this challenge, we construct K-QA, a dataset containing 1,212 patient questions originating from real-world conversations held on K Health (an AI-driven clinical platform). We employ a panel of in-house physicians to answer and manually decompose a subset of K-QA into self-contained statements. Additionally, we formulate two NLI-based evaluation metrics approximating recall and precision: (1) comprehensiveness, measuring the percentage of essential clinical information in the generated answer and (2) hallucination rate, measuring the number of statements from the physician-curated response contradicted by the LLM answer. Finally, we use K-QA along with these metrics to evaluate several state-of-the-art models, as well as the effect of in-context learning and medically-oriented augmented retrieval schemes developed by the authors. Our findings indicate that in-context learning improves the comprehensiveness of the models, and augmented retrieval is effective in reducing hallucinations.

Results: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs with a minimum of 16,000 tokens and also included OpenAI's proprietary and cost-efficient GPT-3.5 Turbo for comparison. The highest accuracy was observed for Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, particularly in tasks focused on information retrieval from single and multiple patient documents. However, all models struggled significantly in tasks requiring the identification of missing information, highlighting a critical area for improvement in clinical data interpretation.   Conclusion: While LLMs show considerable potential for processing long clinical documents, their current accuracy levels are insufficient for reliable clinical use, especially in scenarios requiring the identification of missing information. The LongHealth benchmark provides a more realistic assessment of LLMs in a healthcare setting and highlights the need for further model refinement for safe and effective clinical application.   We make the benchmark and evaluation code publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14490v1,2024-01
Modular Adaptation of Multilingual Encoders to Written Swiss German Dialect,"Jannis Vamvas, Noëmi Aepli, Rico Sennrich","Creating neural text encoders for written Swiss German is challenging due to a dearth of training data combined with dialectal variation. In this paper, we build on several existing multilingual encoders and adapt them to Swiss German using continued pre-training. Evaluation on three diverse downstream tasks shows that simply adding a Swiss German adapter to a modular encoder achieves 97.5% of fully monolithic adaptation performance. We further find that for the task of retrieving Swiss German sentences given Standard German queries, adapting a character-level model is more effective than the other adaptation strategies.

Wordflow: Social Prompt Engineering for Large Language Models,"Zijie J. Wang, Aishwarya Chakravarthy, David Munechika, Duen Horng Chau","Large language models (LLMs) require well-crafted prompts for effective use. Prompt engineering, the process of designing prompts, is challenging, particularly for non-experts who are less familiar with AI technologies. While researchers have proposed techniques and tools to assist LLM users in prompt design, these works primarily target AI application developers rather than non-experts. To address this research gap, we propose social prompt engineering, a novel paradigm that leverages social computing techniques to facilitate collaborative prompt design. To investigate social prompt engineering, we introduce Wordflow, an open-source and social text editor that enables everyday users to easily create, run, share, and discover LLM prompts. Additionally, by leveraging modern web technologies, Wordflow allows users to run LLMs locally and privately in their browsers. Two usage scenarios highlight how social prompt engineering and our tool can enhance laypeople's interaction with LLMs. Wordflow is publicly accessible at https://poloclub.github.io/wordflow.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14447v1,2024-01
Socially Aware Synthetic Data Generation for Suicidal Ideation Detection Using Large Language Models,"Hamideh Ghanadian, Isar Nejadgholi, Hussein Al Osman","Suicidal ideation detection is a vital research area that holds great potential for improving mental health support systems. However, the sensitivity surrounding suicide-related data poses challenges in accessing large-scale, annotated datasets necessary for training effective machine learning models. To address this limitation, we introduce an innovative strategy that leverages the capabilities of generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, Flan-T5, and Llama, to create synthetic data for suicidal ideation detection. Our data generation approach is grounded in social factors extracted from psychology literature and aims to ensure coverage of essential information related to suicidal ideation. In our study, we benchmarked against state-of-the-art NLP classification models, specifically, those centered around the BERT family structures. When trained on the real-world dataset, UMD, these conventional models tend to yield F1-scores ranging from 0.75 to 0.87. Our synthetic data-driven method, informed by social factors, offers consistent F1-scores of 0.82 for both models, suggesting that the richness of topics in synthetic data can bridge the performance gap across different model complexities. Most impressively, when we combined a mere 30% of the UMD dataset with our synthetic data, we witnessed a substantial increase in performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.88 on the UMD test set. Such results underscore the cost-effectiveness and potential of our approach in confronting major challenges in the field, such as data scarcity and the quest for diversity in data representation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01712v1,2024-01
TURNA: A Turkish Encoder-Decoder Language Model for Enhanced Understanding and Generation,"Gökçe Uludoğan, Zeynep Yirmibeşoğlu Balal, Furkan Akkurt, Melikşah Türker, Onur Güngör, Susan Üsküdarlı","The recent advances in natural language processing have predominantly favored well-resourced English-centric models, resulting in a significant gap with low-resource languages. In this work, we introduce the language model TURNA, which is developed for the low-resource language Turkish and is capable of both natural language understanding and generation tasks. TURNA is pretrained with an encoder-decoder architecture based on the unified framework UL2 with a diverse corpus that we specifically curated for this purpose. We evaluated TURNA with three generation tasks and five understanding tasks for Turkish.

Genie: Achieving Human Parity in Content-Grounded Datasets Generation,"Asaf Yehudai, Boaz Carmeli, Yosi Mass, Ofir Arviv, Nathaniel Mills, Assaf Toledo, Eyal Shnarch, Leshem Choshen","The lack of high-quality data for content-grounded generation tasks has been identified as a major obstacle to advancing these tasks. To address this gap, we propose Genie, a novel method for automatically generating high-quality content-grounded data. It consists of three stages: (a) Content Preparation, (b) Generation: creating task-specific examples from the content (e.g., question-answer pairs or summaries). (c) Filtering mechanism aiming to ensure the quality and faithfulness of the generated data. We showcase this methodology by generating three large-scale synthetic data, making wishes, for Long-Form Question-Answering (LFQA), summarization, and information extraction. In a human evaluation, our generated data was found to be natural and of high quality. Furthermore, we compare models trained on our data with models trained on human-written data -- ELI5 and ASQA for LFQA and CNN-DailyMail for Summarization. We show that our models are on par with or outperforming models trained on human-generated data and consistently outperforming them in faithfulness. Finally, we applied our method to create LFQA data within the medical domain and compared a model trained on it with models trained on other domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14367v1,2024-01
A Comparative Analysis of Noise Reduction Methods in Sentiment Analysis on Noisy Bangla Texts,"Kazi Toufique Elahi, Tasnuva Binte Rahman, Shakil Shahriar, Samir Sarker, Md. Tanvir Rouf Shawon, G. M. Shahariar","While Bangla is considered a language with limited resources, sentiment analysis has been a subject of extensive research in the literature. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of exploration into sentiment analysis specifically in the realm of noisy Bangla texts. In this paper, we introduce a dataset (NC-SentNoB) that we annotated manually to identify ten different types of noise found in a pre-existing sentiment analysis dataset comprising of around 15K noisy Bangla texts. At first, given an input noisy text, we identify the noise type, addressing this as a multi-label classification task. Then, we introduce baseline noise reduction methods to alleviate noise prior to conducting sentiment analysis. Finally, we assess the performance of fine-tuned sentiment analysis models with both noisy and noise-reduced texts to make comparisons. The experimental findings indicate that the noise reduction methods utilized are not satisfactory, highlighting the need for more suitable noise reduction methods in future research endeavors.

Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM's capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges.

RomanSetu: Efficiently unlocking multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models via Romanization,"Jaavid Aktar Husain, Raj Dabre, Aswanth Kumar, Jay Gala, Thanmay Jayakumar, Ratish Puduppully, Anoop Kunchukuttan","This study addresses the challenge of extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to non-English languages that use non-Roman scripts. We propose an approach that utilizes the romanized form of text as an interface for LLMs, hypothesizing that its frequent informal use and shared tokens with English enhance cross-lingual alignment. Our approach involves the continual pretraining of an English LLM like Llama 2 on romanized text of non-English, non-Roman script languages, followed by instruction tuning on romanized data. The results indicate that romanized text not only reduces token fertility by 2x-4x but also matches or outperforms native script representation across various NLU, NLG, and MT tasks. Moreover, the embeddings computed on romanized text exhibit closer alignment with their English translations than those from the native script. Our approach presents a promising direction for leveraging the power of English LLMs in languages traditionally underrepresented in NLP.

Transformers and Cortical Waves: Encoders for Pulling In Context Across Time,"Lyle Muller, Patricia S. Churchland, Terrence J. Sejnowski","The capabilities of transformer networks such as ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the world's attention. The crucial computational mechanism underlying their performance relies on transforming a complete input sequence - for example, all the words in a sentence - into a long ""encoding vector"" that allows transformers to learn long-range temporal dependencies in naturalistic sequences. Specifically, ""self-attention"" applied to this encoding vector enhances temporal context in transformers by computing associations between pairs of words in the input sequence. We suggest that waves of neural activity traveling across single cortical areas or multiple regions at the whole-brain scale could implement a similar encoding principle. By encapsulating recent input history into a single spatial pattern at each moment in time, cortical waves may enable temporal context to be extracted from sequences of sensory inputs, the same computational principle used in transformers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14267v3,2024-01

Nonetheless, most existing works focus on boosting code LLMs from the perspective of programming capabilities, while their natural language capabilities receive less attention. To fill this gap, we thus propose a novel framework, comprising two modules: AttentionExtractor, which is responsible for extracting key phrases from the user's natural language requirements, and AttentionCoder, which leverages these extracted phrases to generate target code to solve the requirement. This framework pioneers an innovative idea by seamlessly integrating code LLMs with traditional natural language processing tools. To validate the effectiveness of the framework, we craft a new code generation benchmark, called MultiNL-H, covering five natural languages. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14242v1,2024-01
Enhanced Labeling Technique for Reddit Text and Fine-Tuned Longformer Models for Classifying Depression Severity in English and Luganda,"Richard Kimera, Daniela N. Rim, Joseph Kirabira, Ubong Godwin Udomah, Heeyoul Choi","Depression is a global burden and one of the most challenging mental health conditions to control. Experts can detect its severity early using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaire, administer appropriate medication to patients, and impede its progression. Due to the fear of potential stigmatization, many patients turn to social media platforms like Reddit for advice and assistance at various stages of their journey. This research extracts text from Reddit to facilitate the diagnostic process. It employs a proposed labeling approach to categorize the text and subsequently fine-tunes the Longformer model.

Assessing the Portability of Parameter Matrices Trained by Parameter-Efficient Finetuning Methods,"Mohammed Sabry, Anya Belz","As the cost of training ever larger language models has grown, so has the interest in reusing previously learnt knowledge. Transfer learning methods have shown how reusing non-task-specific knowledge can help in subsequent task-specific learning. In this paper, we investigate the inverse: porting whole functional modules that encode task-specific knowledge from one model to another. We designed a study comprising 1,440 training/testing runs to test the portability of modules trained by parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) techniques, using sentiment analysis as an example task. We test portability in a wide range of scenarios, involving different PEFT techniques and different pretrained host models, among other dimensions. We compare the performance of ported modules with that of equivalent modules trained (i) from scratch, and (ii) from parameters sampled from the same distribution as the ported module. We find that the ported modules far outperform the two alternatives tested, but that there are interesting performance differences between the four PEFT techniques. We conclude that task-specific knowledge in the form of structurally modular sets of parameters as produced by PEFT techniques is highly portable, but that degree of success depends on type of PEFT and on differences between originating and receiving pretrained models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14228v1,2024-01
Commonsense-augmented Memory Construction and Management in Long-term Conversations via Context-aware Persona Refinement,"Hana Kim, Kai Tzu-iunn Ong, Seoyeon Kim, Dongha Lee, Jinyoung Yeo","Memorizing and utilizing speakers' personas is a common practice for response generation in long-term conversations. Yet, human-authored datasets often provide uninformative persona sentences that hinder response quality. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages commonsense-based persona expansion to address such issues in long-term conversation. While prior work focuses on not producing personas that contradict others, we focus on transforming contradictory personas into sentences that contain rich speaker information, by refining them based on their contextual backgrounds with designed strategies. As the pioneer of persona expansion in multi-session settings, our framework facilitates better response generation via human-like persona refinement.

Explicitly Representing Syntax Improves Sentence-to-layout Prediction of Unexpected Situations,"Wolf Nuyts, Ruben Cartuyvels, Marie-Francine Moens","Recognizing visual entities in a natural language sentence and arranging them in a 2D spatial layout require a compositional understanding of language and space. This task of layout prediction is valuable in text-to-image synthesis as it allows localized and controlled in-painting of the image. In this comparative study it is shown that we can predict layouts from language representations that implicitly or explicitly encode sentence syntax, if the sentences mention similar entity-relationships to the ones seen during training. To test compositional understanding, we collect a test set of grammatically correct sentences and layouts describing compositions of entities and relations that unlikely have been seen during training. Performance on this test set substantially drops, showing that current models rely on correlations in the training data and have difficulties in understanding the structure of the input sentences. We propose a novel structural loss function that better enforces the syntactic structure of the input sentence and show large performance gains in the task of 2D spatial layout prediction conditioned on text. The loss has the potential to be used in other generation tasks where a tree-like structure underlies the conditioning modality. Code, trained models and the USCOCO evaluation set are available via github.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14212v3,2024-01
Semantic Sensitivities and Inconsistent Predictions: Measuring the Fragility of NLI Models,"Erik Arakelyan, Zhaoqi Liu, Isabelle Augenstein","Recent studies of the emergent capabilities of transformer-based Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models have indicated that they have an understanding of lexical and compositional semantics. We provide evidence that suggests these claims should be taken with a grain of salt: we find that state-of-the-art Natural Language Inference (NLI) models are sensitive towards minor semantics preserving surface-form variations, which lead to sizable inconsistent model decisions during inference. Notably, this behaviour differs from valid and in-depth comprehension of compositional semantics, however does neither emerge when evaluating model accuracy on standard benchmarks nor when probing for syntactic, monotonic, and logically robust reasoning. We propose a novel framework to measure the extent of semantic sensitivity. To this end, we evaluate NLI models on adversarially generated examples containing minor semantics-preserving surface-form input noise. This is achieved using conditional text generation, with the explicit condition that the NLI model predicts the relationship between the original and adversarial inputs as a symmetric equivalence entailment. We systematically study the effects of the phenomenon across NLI models for $\textbf{in-}$ and $\textbf{out-of-}$ domain settings. Our experiments show that semantic sensitivity causes performance degradations of $12.92\%$ and $23.71\%$ average over $\textbf{in-}$ and $\textbf{out-of-}$ domain settings, respectively. We further perform ablation studies, analysing this phenomenon across models, datasets, and variations in inference and show that semantic sensitivity can lead to major inconsistency within model predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14440v2,2024-01

Parameter-Efficient Conversational Recommender System as a Language Processing Task,"Mathieu Ravaut, Hao Zhang, Lu Xu, Aixin Sun, Yong Liu","Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to recommend relevant items to users by eliciting user preference through natural language conversation. Prior work often utilizes external knowledge graphs for items' semantic information, a language model for dialogue generation, and a recommendation module for ranking relevant items. This combination of multiple components suffers from a cumbersome training process, and leads to semantic misalignment issues between dialogue generation and item recommendation. In this paper, we represent items in natural language and formulate CRS as a natural language processing task. Accordingly, we leverage the power of pre-trained language models to encode items, understand user intent via conversation, perform item recommendation through semantic matching, and generate dialogues. As a unified model, our PECRS (Parameter-Efficient CRS), can be optimized in a single stage, without relying on non-textual metadata such as a knowledge graph. Experiments on two benchmark CRS datasets, ReDial and INSPIRED, demonstrate the effectiveness of PECRS on recommendation and conversation.

How Can Large Language Models Understand Spatial-Temporal Data?,"Lei Liu, Shuo Yu, Runze Wang, Zhenxun Ma, Yanming Shen","While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate tasks like natural language processing and computer vision, harnessing their power for spatial-temporal forecasting remains challenging. The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14192v2,2024-01
BayesPrompt: Prompting Large-Scale Pre-Trained Language Models on Few-shot Inference via Debiased Domain Abstraction,"Jiangmeng Li, Fei Song, Yifan Jin, Wenwen Qiang, Changwen Zheng, Fuchun Sun, Hui Xiong","As a novel and effective fine-tuning paradigm based on large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), prompt-tuning aims to reduce the gap between downstream tasks and pre-training objectives. While prompt-tuning has yielded continuous advancements in various tasks, such an approach still remains a persistent defect: prompt-tuning methods fail to generalize to specific few-shot patterns. From the perspective of distribution analyses, we disclose that the intrinsic issues behind the phenomenon are the over-multitudinous conceptual knowledge contained in PLMs and the abridged knowledge for target downstream domains, which jointly result in that PLMs mis-locate the knowledge distributions corresponding to the target domains in the universal knowledge embedding space. To this end, we intuitively explore to approximate the unabridged target domains of downstream tasks in a debiased manner, and then abstract such domains to generate discriminative prompts, thereby providing the de-ambiguous guidance for PLMs. Guided by such an intuition, we propose a simple yet effective approach, namely BayesPrompt, to learn prompts that contain the domain discriminative information against the interference from domain-irrelevant knowledge. BayesPrompt primitively leverages known distributions to approximate the debiased factual distributions of target domains and further uniformly samples certain representative features from the approximated distributions to generate the ultimate prompts for PLMs. We provide theoretical insights with the connection to domain adaptation. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14166v3,2024-01
True Knowledge Comes from Practice: Aligning LLMs with Embodied Environments via Reinforcement Learning,"Weihao Tan, Wentao Zhang, Shanqi Liu, Longtao Zheng, Xinrun Wang, Bo An","Despite the impressive performance across numerous tasks, large language models (LLMs) often fail in solving simple decision-making tasks due to the misalignment of the knowledge in LLMs with environments. On the contrary, reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn policies from scratch, which makes them always align with environments but difficult to incorporate prior knowledge for efficient explorations. To narrow the gap, we propose TWOSOME, a novel general online framework that deploys LLMs as decision-making agents to efficiently interact and align with embodied environments via RL without requiring any prepared datasets or prior knowledge of the environments. Firstly, we query the joint probabilities of each valid action with LLMs to form behavior policies. Then, to enhance the stability and robustness of the policies, we propose two normalization methods and summarize four prompt design principles. Finally, we design a novel parameter-efficient training architecture where the actor and critic share one frozen LLM equipped with low-rank adapters (LoRA) updated by PPO. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TWOSOME. i) TWOSOME exhibits significantly better sample efficiency and performance compared to the conventional RL method, PPO, and prompt tuning method, SayCan, in both classical decision-making environment, Overcooked, and simulated household environment, VirtualHome. ii) Benefiting from LLMs' open-vocabulary feature, TWOSOME shows superior generalization ability to unseen tasks. iii) Under our framework, there is no significant loss of the LLMs' original ability during online PPO finetuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14151v2,2024-01

"On the Affinity, Rationality, and Diversity of Hierarchical Topic Modeling","Xiaobao Wu, Fengjun Pan, Thong Nguyen, Yichao Feng, Chaoqun Liu, Cong-Duy Nguyen, Anh Tuan Luu","Hierarchical topic modeling aims to discover latent topics from a corpus and organize them into a hierarchy to understand documents with desirable semantic granularity. However, existing work struggles with producing topic hierarchies of low affinity, rationality, and diversity, which hampers document understanding. To overcome these challenges, we in this paper propose Transport Plan and Context-aware Hierarchical Topic Model (TraCo). Instead of early simple topic dependencies, we propose a transport plan dependency method. It constrains dependencies to ensure their sparsity and balance, and also regularizes topic hierarchy building with them. This improves affinity and diversity of hierarchies. We further propose a context-aware disentangled decoder. Rather than previously entangled decoding, it distributes different semantic granularity to topics at different levels by disentangled decoding. This facilitates the rationality of hierarchies. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, effectively improving the affinity, rationality, and diversity of hierarchical topic modeling with better performance on downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14113v2,2024-01
Not My Voice! A Taxonomy of Ethical and Safety Harms of Speech Generators,"Wiebke Hutiri, Oresiti Papakyriakopoulos, Alice Xiang","The rapid and wide-scale adoption of AI to generate human speech poses a range of significant ethical and safety risks to society that need to be addressed. For example, a growing number of speech generation incidents are associated with swatting attacks in the United States, where anonymous perpetrators create synthetic voices that call police officers to close down schools and hospitals, or to violently gain access to innocent citizens' homes. Incidents like this demonstrate that multimodal generative AI risks and harms do not exist in isolation, but arise from the interactions of multiple stakeholders and technical AI systems. In this paper we analyse speech generation incidents to study how patterns of specific harms arise. We find that specific harms can be categorised according to the exposure of affected individuals, that is to say whether they are a subject of, interact with, suffer due to, or are excluded from speech generation systems. Similarly, specific harms are also a consequence of the motives of the creators and deployers of the systems. Based on these insights we propose a conceptual framework for modelling pathways to ethical and safety harms of AI, which we use to develop a taxonomy of harms of speech generators. Our relational approach captures the complexity of risks and harms in sociotechnical AI systems, and yields a taxonomy that can support appropriate policy interventions and decision making for the responsible development and release of speech generation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01708v2,2024-01

Traditional compression methods such as pruning, distillation, and low-rank approximation focus on reducing the effective number of neurons in the network, while quantization focuses on reducing the numerical precision of individual weights to reduce the model size while keeping the number of neurons fixed. While these compression methods have been relatively successful in practice, there is no compelling reason to believe that truncating the number of neurons is an optimal strategy. In this context, this paper introduces CompactifAI, an innovative LLM compression approach using quantum-inspired Tensor Networks that focuses on the model's correlation space instead, allowing for a more controlled, refined and interpretable model compression. Our method is versatile and can be implemented with - or on top of - other compression techniques. As a benchmark, we demonstrate that a combination of CompactifAI with quantization allows to reduce a 93% the memory size of LlaMA 7B, reducing also 70% the number of parameters, accelerating 50% the training and 25% the inference times of the model, and just with a small accuracy drop of 2% - 3%, going much beyond of what is achievable today by other compression techniques. Our methods also allow to perform a refined layer sensitivity profiling, showing that deeper layers tend to be more suitable for tensor network compression, which is compatible with recent observations on the ineffectiveness of those layers for LLM performance. Our results imply that standard LLMs are, in fact, heavily overparametrized, and do not need to be large at all.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14109v2,2024-01

While existing research often focuses on classifying claims as ""True"" or ""False,"" there is a limited exploration of generating explanations for claim credibility, particularly in Arabic. Ta'keed addresses this gap by assessing claim truthfulness based on retrieved snippets, utilizing two main components: information retrieval and LLM-based claim verification. We compiled the ArFactEx, a testing gold-labelled dataset with manually justified references, to evaluate the system. The initial model achieved a promising F1 score of 0.72 in the classification task. Meanwhile, the system's generated explanations are compared with gold-standard explanations syntactically and semantically. The study recommends evaluating using semantic similarities, resulting in an average cosine similarity score of 0.76.

This paper, not only as an overview of current prompt engineering methods, but also aims to highlight the limitation of designing prompts based on an anthropomorphic assumption that expects LLMs to think like humans. From our review of 50 representative studies, we demonstrate that a goal-oriented prompt formulation, which guides LLMs to follow established human logical thinking, significantly improves the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, We introduce a novel taxonomy that categorizes goal-oriented prompting methods into five interconnected stages and we demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework. With four future directions proposed, we hope to further emphasize the power and potential of goal-oriented prompt engineering in all fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14043v3,2024-01
(Chat)GPT v BERT: Dawn of Justice for Semantic Change Detection,"Francesco Periti, Haim Dubossarsky, Nina Tahmasebi","In the universe of Natural Language Processing, Transformer-based language models like BERT and (Chat)GPT have emerged as lexical superheroes with great power to solve open research problems. In this paper, we specifically focus on the temporal problem of semantic change, and evaluate their ability to solve two diachronic extensions of the Word-in-Context (WiC) task: TempoWiC and HistoWiC. In particular, we investigate the potential of a novel, off-the-shelf technology like ChatGPT (and GPT) 3.5 compared to BERT, which represents a family of models that currently stand as the state-of-the-art for modeling semantic change. Our experiments represent the first attempt to assess the use of (Chat)GPT for studying semantic change. Our results indicate that ChatGPT performs significantly worse than the foundational GPT version. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that (Chat)GPT achieves slightly lower performance than BERT in detecting long-term changes but performs significantly worse in detecting short-term changes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14040v3,2024-01
Accelerating Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Serving with Speculation,"Zhihao Zhang, Alan Zhu, Lijie Yang, Yihua Xu, Lanting Li, Phitchaya Mangpo Phothilimthana, Zhihao Jia","Retrieval-augmented language models (RaLM) have demonstrated the potential to solve knowledge-intensive natural language processing (NLP) tasks by combining a non-parametric knowledge base with a parametric language model. Instead of fine-tuning a fully parametric model, RaLM excels at its low-cost adaptation to the latest data and better source attribution mechanisms. Among various RaLM approaches, iterative RaLM delivers a better generation quality due to a more frequent interaction between the retriever and the language model. Despite the benefits, iterative RaLM usually encounters high overheads due to the frequent retrieval step. To this end, we propose RaLMSpec, a speculation-inspired framework that provides generic speed-up over iterative RaLM while preserving the same model outputs through speculative retrieval and batched verification. By further incorporating prefetching, optimal speculation stride scheduler, and asynchronous verification, RaLMSpec can automatically exploit the acceleration potential to the fullest. For naive iterative RaLM serving, extensive evaluations over three language models on four downstream QA datasets demonstrate that RaLMSpec can achieve a speed-up ratio of 1.75-2.39x, 1.04-1.39x, and 1.31-1.77x when the retriever is an exact dense retriever, approximate dense retriever, and sparse retriever respectively compared with the baseline. For KNN-LM serving, RaLMSpec can achieve a speed-up ratio up to 7.59x and 2.45x when the retriever is an exact dense retriever and approximate dense retriever, respectively, compared with the baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14021v1,2024-01

Towards Uncertainty-Aware Language Agent,"Jiuzhou Han, Wray Buntine, Ehsan Shareghi","While Language Agents have achieved promising success by placing Large Language Models at the core of a more versatile design that dynamically interacts with the external world, the existing approaches neglect the notion of uncertainty during these interactions. We present the Uncertainty-Aware Language Agent (UALA), a framework that orchestrates the interaction between the agent and the external world using uncertainty quantification. Compared with other well-known counterparts like ReAct, our extensive experiments across 3 representative tasks (HotpotQA, StrategyQA, MMLU) and various LLM sizes demonstrate that UALA brings a significant improvement of performance, while having a substantially lower reliance on the external world (i.e., reduced number of tool calls and tokens). Our analyses provide various insights including the great potential of UALA compared with agent fine-tuning, and underscore the unreliability of verbalised confidence of LLMs as a proxy for uncertainty.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14016v3,2024-01
CMMU: A Benchmark for Chinese Multi-modal Multi-type Question Understanding and Reasoning,"Zheqi He, Xinya Wu, Pengfei Zhou, Richeng Xuan, Guang Liu, Xi Yang, Qiannan Zhu, Hua Huang","Multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress and demonstrated powerful knowledge comprehension and reasoning abilities. However, the mastery of domain-specific knowledge, which is essential for evaluating the intelligence of MLLMs, continues to be a challenge. Current multi-modal benchmarks for domain-specific knowledge concentrate on multiple-choice questions and are predominantly available in English, which imposes limitations on the comprehensiveness of the evaluation. To this end, we introduce CMMU, a novel benchmark for multi-modal and multi-type question understanding and reasoning in Chinese. CMMU consists of 3,603 questions in 7 subjects, covering knowledge from primary to high school. The questions can be categorized into 3 types: multiple-choice, multiple-response, and fill-in-the-blank, bringing greater challenges to MLLMs. In addition, we propose an evaluation strategy called Positional Error Variance for assessing multiple-choice questions. The strategy aims to perform a quantitative analysis of position bias. We evaluate seven open-source MLLMs along with GPT4-V, Gemini-Pro, and Qwen-VL-Plus. The results demonstrate that CMMU poses a significant challenge to the recent MLLMs. The data and code are available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/CMMU.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.14011v3,2024-01
ConstraintChecker: A Plugin for Large Language Models to Reason on Commonsense Knowledge Bases,"Quyet V. Do, Tianqing Fang, Shizhe Diao, Zhaowei Wang, Yangqiu Song","Reasoning over Commonsense Knowledge Bases (CSKB), i.e. CSKB reasoning, has been explored as a way to acquire new commonsense knowledge based on reference knowledge in the original CSKBs and external prior knowledge. Despite the advancement of Large Language Models (LLM) and prompt engineering techniques in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle to deal with CSKB reasoning. One of the problems is that it is hard for them to acquire explicit relational constraints in CSKBs from only in-context exemplars, due to a lack of symbolic reasoning capabilities (Bengio et al., 2021). To this end, we proposed **ConstraintChecker**, a plugin over prompting techniques to provide and check explicit constraints. When considering a new knowledge instance, ConstraintChecker employs a rule-based module to produce a list of constraints, then it uses a zero-shot learning module to check whether this knowledge instance satisfies all constraints. The acquired constraint-checking result is then aggregated with the output of the main prompting technique to produce the final output. Experimental results on CSKB Reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by bringing consistent improvements over all prompting methods.

Investigate-Consolidate-Exploit: A General Strategy for Inter-Task Agent Self-Evolution,"Cheng Qian, Shihao Liang, Yujia Qin, Yining Ye, Xin Cong, Yankai Lin, Yesai Wu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","This paper introduces Investigate-Consolidate-Exploit (ICE), a novel strategy for enhancing the adaptability and flexibility of AI agents through inter-task self-evolution. Unlike existing methods focused on intra-task learning, ICE promotes the transfer of knowledge between tasks for genuine self-evolution, similar to human experience learning. The strategy dynamically investigates planning and execution trajectories, consolidates them into simplified workflows and pipelines, and exploits them for improved task execution. Our experiments on the XAgent framework demonstrate ICE's effectiveness, reducing API calls by as much as 80% and significantly decreasing the demand for the model's capability. Specifically, when combined with GPT-3.5, ICE's performance matches that of raw GPT-4 across various agent tasks. We argue that this self-evolution approach represents a paradigm shift in agent design, contributing to a more robust AI community and ecosystem, and moving a step closer to full autonomy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13996v1,2024-01
Towards Consistent Natural-Language Explanations via Explanation-Consistency Finetuning,"Yanda Chen, Chandan Singh, Xiaodong Liu, Simiao Zuo, Bin Yu, He He, Jianfeng Gao","Large language models (LLMs) often generate convincing, fluent explanations. However, different from humans, they often generate inconsistent explanations on different inputs. For example, an LLM may generate the explanation ""all birds can fly"" when answering the question ""Can sparrows fly?"" but meanwhile answer ""no"" to the related question ""Can penguins fly?"". Explanations should be consistent across related examples so that they allow a human to simulate the LLM's decision process on multiple examples. We propose explanation-consistency finetuning (EC-finetuning), a method that adapts LLMs to generate more consistent natural-language explanations on related examples. EC-finetuning involves finetuning LLMs on synthetic data that is carefully constructed to contain consistent explanations. Across a variety of question-answering datasets in various domains, EC-finetuning yields a 10.0% relative explanation consistency improvement on four finetuning datasets, and generalizes to seven out-of-distribution datasets not seen during finetuning (+4.5% relative).

Routoo: Learning to Route to Large Language Models Effectively,"Alireza Mohammadshahi, Arshad Rafiq Shaikh, Majid Yazdani","LLMs with superior response quality--particularly larger or closed-source models--often come with higher inference costs, making their deployment inefficient and costly. Meanwhile, developing foundational LLMs from scratch is becoming increasingly resource-intensive and impractical for many applications. To address the challenge of balancing quality and cost, we introduce Routoo, an architecture designed to optimize the selection of LLMs for specific prompts based on performance, cost, and efficiency. Routoo provides controllability over the trade-off between inference cost and quality, enabling significant reductions in inference costs for a given quality requirement. Routoo comprises two key components: a performance predictor and cost-aware selector. The performance predictor is a lightweight LLM that estimates the expected performance of various underlying LLMs on a given prompt without executing them. The cost-aware selector module then selects the most suitable model based on these predictions and constraints such as cost and latency, significantly reducing inference costs for the same quality. We evaluated Routoo using the MMLU benchmark across 57 domains employing open-source models. Our results show that Routoo matches the performance of the Mixtral 8x7b model while reducing inference costs by one-third. Additionally, by allowing increased costs, Routoo surpasses Mixtral's accuracy by over 5% at equivalent costs, achieving an accuracy of 75.9%. When integrating GPT4 into our model pool, Routoo nearly matches GPT4's performance at half the cost and exceeds it with a 25% cost reduction. These outcomes highlight Routoo's potential to significantly reduce inference costs without compromising quality, and even to establish new state-of-the-art results by leveraging the collective capabilities of multiple LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13979v3,2024-01
Adaptive Text Watermark for Large Language Models,"Yepeng Liu, Yuheng Bu","The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to increasing concerns about the misuse of AI-generated text, and watermarking for LLM-generated text has emerged as a potential solution. However, it is challenging to generate high-quality watermarked text while maintaining strong security, robustness, and the ability to detect watermarks without prior knowledge of the prompt or model. This paper proposes an adaptive watermarking strategy to address this problem. To improve the text quality and maintain robustness, we adaptively add watermarking to token distributions with high entropy measured using an auxiliary model and keep the low entropy token distributions untouched. For the sake of security and to further minimize the watermark's impact on text quality, instead of using a fixed green/red list generated from a random secret key, which can be vulnerable to decryption and forgery, we adaptively scale up the output logits in proportion based on the semantic embedding of previously generated text using a well designed semantic mapping model. Our experiments involving various LLMs demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable robustness performance to existing watermark methods. Additionally, the text generated by our method has perplexity comparable to that of \emph{un-watermarked} LLMs while maintaining security even under various attacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13927v2,2024-01
LocMoE: A Low-Overhead MoE for Large Language Model Training,"Jing Li, Zhijie Sun, Xuan He, Li Zeng, Yi Lin, Entong Li, Binfan Zheng, Rongqian Zhao, Xin Chen","The Mixtures-of-Experts (MoE) model is a widespread distributed and integrated learning method for large language models (LLM), which is favored due to its ability to sparsify and expand models efficiently. However, the performance of MoE is limited by load imbalance and high latency of All-to-All communication, along with relatively redundant computation owing to large expert capacity. Load imbalance may result from existing routing policies that consistently tend to select certain experts. The frequent inter-node communication in the All-to-All procedure also significantly prolongs the training time. To alleviate the above performance problems, we propose a novel routing strategy that combines load balance and locality by converting partial inter-node communication to that of intra-node. Notably, we elucidate that there is a minimum threshold for expert capacity, calculated through the maximal angular deviation between the gating weights of the experts and the assigned tokens. We port these modifications on the PanGu-Sigma model based on the MindSpore framework with multi-level routing and conduct experiments on Ascend clusters. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed LocMoE reduces training time per epoch by 12.68% to 22.24% compared to classical routers, such as hash router and switch router, without impacting the model accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13920v3,2024-01
WebVoyager: Building an End-to-End Web Agent with Large Multimodal Models,"Hongliang He, Wenlin Yao, Kaixin Ma, Wenhao Yu, Yong Dai, Hongming Zhang, Zhenzhong Lan, Dong Yu","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new era marked by the development of autonomous applications in real-world scenarios, which drives innovation in creating advanced web agents. Existing web agents typically only handle one input modality and are evaluated only in simplified web simulators or static web snapshots, greatly limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce WebVoyager, an innovative Large Multimodal Model (LMM) powered web agent that can complete user instructions end-to-end by interacting with real-world websites. Moreover, we establish a new benchmark by compiling real-world tasks from 15 popular websites and introduce an automatic evaluation protocol leveraging multimodal understanding abilities of GPT-4V to evaluate open-ended web agents. We show that WebVoyager achieves a 59.1% task success rate on our benchmark, significantly surpassing the performance of both GPT-4 (All Tools) and the WebVoyager (text-only) setups, underscoring the exceptional capability of WebVoyager.

MULTIVERSE: Exposing Large Language Model Alignment Problems in Diverse Worlds,"Xiaolong Jin, Zhuo Zhang, Xiangyu Zhang","Large Language Model (LLM) alignment aims to ensure that LLM outputs match with human values. Researchers have demonstrated the severity of alignment problems with a large spectrum of jailbreak techniques that can induce LLMs to produce malicious content during conversations. Finding the corresponding jailbreaking prompts usually requires substantial human intelligence or computation resources. In this paper, we report that LLMs have different levels of alignment in various contexts. As such, by systematically constructing many contexts, called worlds, leveraging a Domain Specific Language describing possible worlds (e.g., time, location, characters, actions and languages) and the corresponding compiler, we can cost-effectively expose latent alignment issues. Given the low cost of our method, we are able to conduct a large scale study regarding LLM alignment issues in different worlds. Our results show that our method outperforms the-state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques on both effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, our results indicate that existing LLMs are extremely vulnerable to nesting worlds and programming language worlds. They imply that existing alignment training focuses on the real-world and is lacking in various (virtual) worlds where LLMs can be exploited.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01706v1,2024-01
No More Distractions: an Adaptive Up-Sampling Algorithm to Reduce Data Artifacts,Han Chen,"Researchers recently found out that sometimes language models achieve high accuracy on benchmark data set, but they can not generalize very well with even little changes to the original data set. This is sometimes due to data artifacts, model is learning the spurious correlation between tokens and labels, instead of the semantics and logic. In this work, we analyzed SNLI data and visualized such spurious correlations. We proposed an adaptive up-sampling algorithm to correct the data artifacts, which is simple and effective, and does not need human edits or annotation. We did an experiment applying the algorithm to fix the data artifacts in SNLI data and the model trained with corrected data performed significantly better than the model trained with raw SNLI data, overall, as well as on the subset we corrected.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13907v1,2024-01

A comparative study of zero-shot inference with large language models and supervised modeling in breast cancer pathology classification,"Madhumita Sushil, Travis Zack, Divneet Mandair, Zhiwei Zheng, Ahmed Wali, Yan-Ning Yu, Yuwei Quan, Atul J. Butte","Although supervised machine learning is popular for information extraction from clinical notes, creating large annotated datasets requires extensive domain expertise and is time-consuming. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising transfer learning capability. In this study, we explored whether recent LLMs can reduce the need for large-scale data annotations. We curated a manually-labeled dataset of 769 breast cancer pathology reports, labeled with 13 categories, to compare zero-shot classification capability of the GPT-4 model and the GPT-3.5 model with supervised classification performance of three model architectures: random forests classifier, long short-term memory networks with attention (LSTM-Att), and the UCSF-BERT model. Across all 13 tasks, the GPT-4 model performed either significantly better than or as well as the best supervised model, the LSTM-Att model (average macro F1 score of 0.83 vs. 0.75). On tasks with high imbalance between labels, the differences were more prominent. Frequent sources of GPT-4 errors included inferences from multiple samples and complex task design. On complex tasks where large annotated datasets cannot be easily collected, LLMs can reduce the burden of large-scale data labeling. However, if the use of LLMs is prohibitive, the use of simpler supervised models with large annotated datasets can provide comparable results. LLMs demonstrated the potential to speed up the execution of clinical NLP studies by reducing the need for curating large annotated datasets. This may result in an increase in the utilization of NLP-based variables and outcomes in observational clinical studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13887v1,2024-01

This analysis motivates our expansion beyond behavioral definitions to encompass harms to cognitive and affective states. The paper outlines high-level requirements for measurement: identifying the necessary expertise to implement this approach and illustrating it through a case study. Our work highlights the unique vulnerabilities of large language models to perpetrating representational harms, particularly when these harms go unmeasured and unmitigated. The work concludes by presenting proposed mitigations and delineating when to employ them.

Unmasking and Quantifying Racial Bias of Large Language Models in Medical Report Generation,"Yifan Yang, Xiaoyu Liu, Qiao Jin, Furong Huang, Zhiyong Lu","Large language models like GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 hold promise for healthcare professionals, but they may inadvertently inherit biases during their training, potentially affecting their utility in medical applications. Despite few attempts in the past, the precise impact and extent of these biases remain uncertain. Through both qualitative and quantitative analyses, we find that these models tend to project higher costs and longer hospitalizations for White populations and exhibit optimistic views in challenging medical scenarios with much higher survival rates. These biases, which mirror real-world healthcare disparities, are evident in the generation of patient backgrounds, the association of specific diseases with certain races, and disparities in treatment recommendations, etc. Our findings underscore the critical need for future research to address and mitigate biases in language models, especially in critical healthcare applications, to ensure fair and accurate outcomes for all patients.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13867v1,2024-01
TPD: Enhancing Student Language Model Reasoning via Principle Discovery and Guidance,"Haorui Wang, Rongzhi Zhang, Yinghao Li, Lingkai Kong, Yuchen Zhuang, Xiusi Chen, Chao Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable reasoning abilities. However, larger models often surpass their smaller counterparts in reasoning tasks, posing the challenge of effectively transferring these capabilities from larger models. Existing approaches heavily rely on extensive fine-tuning data or continuous interactions with a superior teacher LLM during inference. We introduce a principle-based teacher-student framework called ``Teaching via Principle Discovery'' (TPD) to address these limitations. Inspired by human learning mechanisms, TPD mimics the interaction between a teacher and a student using a principle-based approach. The teacher LLM generates problem-solving instructions and corrective principles based on the student LLM's errors. These principles guide the refinement of instructions and the selection of instructive examples from a validation set. This enables the student model to learn from both the teacher's guidance and its own mistakes. Once the student model begins making inferences, TPD requires no further intervention from the teacher LLM or humans. Through extensive experiments across eight reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TPD. Compared to standard chain-of-thought prompting, TPD significantly improves the student model's performance, achieving $6.2\%$ improvement on average.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13849v1,2024-01
Steering Language Models with Game-Theoretic Solvers,"Ian Gemp, Roma Patel, Yoram Bachrach, Marc Lanctot, Vibhavari Dasagi, Luke Marris, Georgios Piliouras, Siqi Liu, Karl Tuyls","Mathematical models of interactions among rational agents have long been studied in game theory. However these interactions are often over a small set of discrete game actions which is very different from how humans communicate in natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce a framework that allows equilibrium solvers to work over the space of natural language dialogue generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by modelling the players, strategies and payoffs in a ""game"" of dialogue, we create a binding from natural language interactions to the conventional symbolic logic of game theory. Given this binding, we can ask existing game-theoretic algorithms to provide us with strategic solutions (e.g., what string an LLM should generate to maximize payoff in the face of strategic partners or opponents), giving us predictors of stable, rational conversational strategies. We focus on three domains that require different negotiation strategies: scheduling meetings, trading fruit and debate, and evaluate an LLM's generated language when guided by solvers. We see that LLMs that follow game-theory solvers result in dialogue generations that are less exploitable than the control (no guidance from solvers), and the language generated results in higher rewards, in all negotiation domains. We discuss future implications of this work, and how game-theoretic solvers that can leverage the expressivity of natural language can open up a new avenue of guiding language research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01704v3,2024-01
The Calibration Gap between Model and Human Confidence in Large Language Models,"Mark Steyvers, Heliodoro Tejeda, Aakriti Kumar, Catarina Belem, Sheer Karny, Xinyue Hu, Lukas Mayer, Padhraic Smyth","For large language models (LLMs) to be trusted by humans they need to be well-calibrated in the sense that they can accurately assess and communicate how likely it is that their predictions are correct. Recent work has focused on the quality of internal LLM confidence assessments, but the question remains of how well LLMs can communicate this internal model confidence to human users. This paper explores the disparity between external human confidence in an LLM's responses and the internal confidence of the model. Through experiments involving multiple-choice questions, we systematically examine human users' ability to discern the reliability of LLM outputs. Our study focuses on two key areas: (1) assessing users' perception of true LLM confidence and (2) investigating the impact of tailored explanations on this perception. The research highlights that default explanations from LLMs often lead to user overestimation of both the model's confidence and its' accuracy. By modifying the explanations to more accurately reflect the LLM's internal confidence, we observe a significant shift in user perception, aligning it more closely with the model's actual confidence levels. This adjustment in explanatory approach demonstrates potential for enhancing user trust and accuracy in assessing LLM outputs. The findings underscore the importance of transparent communication of confidence levels in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications where understanding the reliability of AI-generated information is essential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13835v1,2024-01
Automated Root Causing of Cloud Incidents using In-Context Learning with GPT-4,"Xuchao Zhang, Supriyo Ghosh, Chetan Bansal, Rujia Wang, Minghua Ma, Yu Kang, Saravan Rajmohan","Root Cause Analysis (RCA) plays a pivotal role in the incident diagnosis process for cloud services, requiring on-call engineers to identify the primary issues and implement corrective actions to prevent future recurrences. Improving the incident RCA process is vital for minimizing service downtime, customer impact and manual toil. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have introduced state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, which have proven effective in tackling various AIOps problems, ranging from code authoring to incident management. Nonetheless, the GPT-4 model's immense size presents challenges when trying to fine-tune it on user data because of the significant GPU resource demand and the necessity for continuous model fine-tuning with the emergence of new data. To address the high cost of fine-tuning LLM, we propose an in-context learning approach for automated root causing, which eliminates the need for fine-tuning. We conduct extensive study over 100,000 production incidents, comparing several large language models using multiple metrics. The results reveal that our in-context learning approach outperforms the previous fine-tuned large language models such as GPT-3 by an average of 24.8\% across all metrics, with an impressive 49.7\% improvement over the zero-shot model. Moreover, human evaluation involving actual incident owners demonstrates its superiority over the fine-tuned model, achieving a 43.5\% improvement in correctness and an 8.7\% enhancement in readability. The impressive results demonstrate the viability of utilizing a vanilla GPT model for the RCA task, thereby avoiding the high computational and maintenance costs associated with a fine-tuned model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13810v1,2024-01
Investigating the Efficacy of Large Language Models for Code Clone Detection,"Mohamad Khajezade, Jie JW Wu, Fatemeh Hendijani Fard, Gema Rodríguez-Pérez, Mohamed Sami Shehata","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various natural language processing and software engineering tasks, such as code generation. The LLMs are mainly utilized in the prompt-based zero/few-shot paradigm to guide the model in accomplishing the task. GPT-based models are one of the popular ones studied for tasks such as code comment generation or test generation. These tasks are `generative' tasks. However, there is limited research on the usage of LLMs for `non-generative' tasks such as classification using the prompt-based paradigm. In this preliminary exploratory study, we investigated the applicability of LLMs for Code Clone Detection (CCD), a non-generative task. By building a mono-lingual and cross-lingual CCD dataset derived from CodeNet, we first investigated two different prompts using ChatGPT to detect Type-4 code clones in Java-Java and Java-Ruby pairs in a zero-shot setting. We then conducted an analysis to understand the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT in CCD. ChatGPT surpasses the baselines in cross-language CCD attaining an F1-score of 0.877 and achieves comparable performance to fully fine-tuned models for mono-lingual CCD, with an F1-score of 0.878. Also, the prompt and the difficulty level of the problems has an impact on the performance of ChatGPT. Finally we provide insights and future directions based on our initial analysis",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13802v3,2024-01
A Unified Approach to Emotion Detection and Task-Oriented Dialogue Modeling,"Armand Stricker, Patrick Paroubek","In current text-based task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, user emotion detection (ED) is often overlooked or is typically treated as a separate and independent task, requiring additional training. In contrast, our work demonstrates that seamlessly unifying ED and TOD modeling brings about mutual benefits, and is therefore an alternative to be considered. Our method consists in augmenting SimpleToD, an end-to-end TOD system, by extending belief state tracking to include ED, relying on a single language model. We evaluate our approach using GPT-2 and Llama-2 on the EmoWOZ benchmark, a version of MultiWOZ annotated with emotions. Our results reveal a general increase in performance for ED and task results. Our findings also indicate that user emotions provide useful contextual conditioning for system responses, and can be leveraged to further refine responses in terms of empathy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13789v3,2024-01

MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model,"Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush","Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the inductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in significantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive Transformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence length. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an appealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient decoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM trained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show MambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art subword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits of token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of efficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized drafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\times$ inference speedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding efficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs in enabling token-free language modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13660v3,2024-01
VisualWebArena: Evaluating Multimodal Agents on Realistic Visual Web Tasks,"Jing Yu Koh, Robert Lo, Lawrence Jang, Vikram Duvvur, Ming Chong Lim, Po-Yu Huang, Graham Neubig, Shuyan Zhou, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Daniel Fried","Autonomous agents capable of planning, reasoning, and executing actions on the web offer a promising avenue for automating computer tasks. However, the majority of existing benchmarks primarily focus on text-based agents, neglecting many natural tasks that require visual information to effectively solve. Given that most computer interfaces cater to human perception, visual information often augments textual data in ways that text-only models struggle to harness effectively. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisualWebArena, a benchmark designed to assess the performance of multimodal web agents on realistic \textit{visually grounded tasks}. VisualWebArena comprises of a set of diverse and complex web-based tasks that evaluate various capabilities of autonomous multimodal agents. To perform on this benchmark, agents need to accurately process image-text inputs, interpret natural language instructions, and execute actions on websites to accomplish user-defined objectives. We conduct an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM-based autonomous agents, including several multimodal models. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, we identify several limitations of text-only LLM agents, and reveal gaps in the capabilities of state-of-the-art multimodal language agents. VisualWebArena provides a framework for evaluating multimodal autonomous language agents, and offers insights towards building stronger autonomous agents for the web.

Fluent dreaming for language models,"T. Ben Thompson, Zygimantas Straznickas, Michael Sklar","Feature visualization, also known as ""dreaming"", offers insights into vision models by optimizing the inputs to maximize a neuron's activation or other internal component. However, dreaming has not been successfully applied to language models because the input space is discrete. We extend Greedy Coordinate Gradient, a method from the language model adversarial attack literature, to design the Evolutionary Prompt Optimization (EPO) algorithm. EPO optimizes the input prompt to simultaneously maximize the Pareto frontier between a chosen internal feature and prompt fluency, enabling fluent dreaming for language models. We demonstrate dreaming with neurons, output logits and arbitrary directions in activation space. We measure the fluency of the resulting prompts and compare language model dreaming with max-activating dataset examples. Critically, fluent dreaming allows automatically exploring the behavior of model internals in reaction to mildly out-of-distribution prompts. Code for running EPO is available at https://github.com/Confirm-Solutions/dreamy.

DenoSent: A Denoising Objective for Self-Supervised Sentence Representation Learning,"Xinghao Wang, Junliang He, Pengyu Wang, Yunhua Zhou, Tianxiang Sun, Xipeng Qiu","Contrastive-learning-based methods have dominated sentence representation learning. These methods regularize the representation space by pulling similar sentence representations closer and pushing away the dissimilar ones and have been proven effective in various NLP tasks, e.g., semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. However, it is challenging for these methods to learn fine-grained semantics as they only learn from the inter-sentence perspective, i.e., their supervision signal comes from the relationship between data samples. In this work, we propose a novel denoising objective that inherits from another perspective, i.e., the intra-sentence perspective. By introducing both discrete and continuous noise, we generate noisy sentences and then train our model to restore them to their original form. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that this approach delivers competitive results on both semantic textual similarity (STS) and a wide range of transfer tasks, standing up well in comparison to contrastive-learning-based methods. Notably, the proposed intra-sentence denoising objective complements existing inter-sentence contrastive methodologies and can be integrated with them to further enhance performance.

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey aimed at facilitating further research of MM-LLMs. Initially, we outline general design formulations for model architecture and training pipeline. Subsequently, we introduce a taxonomy encompassing 126 MM-LLMs, each characterized by its specific formulations. Furthermore, we review the performance of selected MM-LLMs on mainstream benchmarks and summarize key training recipes to enhance the potency of MM-LLMs. Finally, we explore promising directions for MM-LLMs while concurrently maintaining a real-time tracking website for the latest developments in the field.

Consistency Guided Knowledge Retrieval and Denoising in LLMs for Zero-shot Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction,"Qi Sun, Kun Huang, Xiaocui Yang, Rong Tong, Kun Zhang, Soujanya Poria","Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (DocRTE) is a fundamental task in information systems that aims to simultaneously extract entities with semantic relations from a document. Existing methods heavily rely on a substantial amount of fully labeled data. However, collecting and annotating data for newly emerging relations is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and LLaMA, exhibit impressive long-text generation capabilities, inspiring us to explore an alternative approach for obtaining auto-labeled documents with new relations. In this paper, we propose a Zero-shot Document-level Relation Triplet Extraction (ZeroDocRTE) framework, which generates labeled data by retrieval and denoising knowledge from LLMs, called GenRDK. Specifically, we propose a chain-of-retrieval prompt to guide ChatGPT to generate labeled long-text data step by step. To improve the quality of synthetic data, we propose a denoising strategy based on the consistency of cross-document knowledge. Leveraging our denoised synthetic data, we proceed to fine-tune the LLaMA2-13B-Chat for extracting document-level relation triplets. We perform experiments for both zero-shot document-level relation and triplet extraction on two public datasets. The experimental results illustrate that our GenRDK framework outperforms strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13598v1,2024-01
Graph Guided Question Answer Generation for Procedural Question-Answering,"Hai X. Pham, Isma Hadji, Xinnuo Xu, Ziedune Degutyte, Jay Rainey, Evangelos Kazakos, Afsaneh Fazly, Georgios Tzimiropoulos, Brais Martinez","In this paper, we focus on task-specific question answering (QA). To this end, we introduce a method for generating exhaustive and high-quality training data, which allows us to train compact (e.g., run on a mobile device), task-specific QA models that are competitive against GPT variants. The key technological enabler is a novel mechanism for automatic question-answer generation from procedural text which can ingest large amounts of textual instructions and produce exhaustive in-domain QA training data. While current QA data generation methods can produce well-formed and varied data, their non-exhaustive nature is sub-optimal for training a QA model. In contrast, we leverage the highly structured aspect of procedural text and represent each step and the overall flow of the procedure as graphs. We then condition on graph nodes to automatically generate QA pairs in an exhaustive and controllable manner. Comprehensive evaluations of our method show that: 1) small models trained with our data achieve excellent performance on the target QA task, even exceeding that of GPT3 and ChatGPT despite being several orders of magnitude smaller. 2) semantic coverage is the key indicator for downstream QA performance. Crucially, while large language models excel at syntactic diversity, this does not necessarily result in improvements on the end QA model. In contrast, the higher semantic coverage provided by our method is critical for QA performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13594v1,2024-01
Evaluation of General Large Language Models in Contextually Assessing Semantic Concepts Extracted from Adult Critical Care Electronic Health Record Notes,"Darren Liu, Cheng Ding, Delgersuren Bold, Monique Bouvier, Jiaying Lu, Benjamin Shickel, Craig S. Jabaley, Wenhui Zhang, Soojin Park, Michael J. Young, Mark S. Wainwright, Gilles Clermont, Parisa Rashidi, Eric S. Rosenthal, Laurie Dimisko, Ran Xiao, Joo Heung Yoon, Carl Yang, Xiao Hu","The field of healthcare has increasingly turned its focus towards Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their remarkable performance. However, their performance in actual clinical applications has been underexplored. Traditional evaluations based on question-answering tasks don't fully capture the nuanced contexts. This gap highlights the need for more in-depth and practical assessments of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings. Objective: We sought to evaluate the performance of LLMs in the complex clinical context of adult critical care medicine using systematic and comprehensible analytic methods, including clinician annotation and adjudication. Methods: We investigated the performance of three general LLMs in understanding and processing real-world clinical notes. Concepts from 150 clinical notes were identified by MetaMap and then labeled by 9 clinicians. Each LLM's proficiency was evaluated by identifying the temporality and negation of these concepts using different prompts for an in-depth analysis. Results: GPT-4 showed overall superior performance compared to other LLMs. In contrast, both GPT-3.5 and text-davinci-003 exhibit enhanced performance when the appropriate prompting strategies are employed. The GPT family models have demonstrated considerable efficiency, evidenced by their cost-effectiveness and time-saving capabilities. Conclusion: A comprehensive qualitative performance evaluation framework for LLMs is developed and operationalized. This framework goes beyond singular performance aspects. With expert annotations, this methodology not only validates LLMs' capabilities in processing complex medical data but also establishes a benchmark for future LLM evaluations across specialized domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13588v1,2024-01
Instruction Fine-Tuning: Does Prompt Loss Matter?,"Mathew Huerta-Enochian, Seung Yong Ko","We present a novel study analyzing the effects of various prompt loss token weights (PLW) for supervised instruction fine-tuning (SIFT). While prompt-masking (PLW = 0) is common for SIFT, some fine-tuning APIs support fractional PLWs and suggest that using a small non-zero PLW can help stabilize learning when fine-tuning on short-completion data. However, there has never been a study confirming this claim, and OpenAI, a major cloud-based SIFT provider, recently removed this parameter from their fine-tuning API. We found that performance of models fine-tuned on short-completion data had a statistically-significant negative quadratic relationship with PLW. Using small values (0.01 - 0.5) of PLW produced better results on multiple-choice and short-generation benchmarks (outperforming models fine-tuned on long-completion data) while large values (~ 1.0) of PLW produced better results on long-generation benchmarks. We explained this effect and verified its importance through additional experiments. This research serves as a warning to API providers about the importance of providing a PLW parameter for SIFT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13586v4,2024-01
Large Malaysian Language Model Based on Mistral for Enhanced Local Language Understanding,"Husein Zolkepli, Aisyah Razak, Kamarul Adha, Ariff Nazhan","In this paper, we present significant advancements in the pretraining of Mistral 7B, a large-scale language model, using a dataset of 32.6 GB, equivalent to 1.1 billion tokens. We explore the impact of extending the context length, releasing models with context lengths of 4096 and 32768 tokens, and further refining performance with a specialized 16384 context length instruction-tuned model, we called it Malaysian Mistral.   Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of continue pretraining and the influence of extended context lengths on Mistral 7B's language understanding capabilities.

SpeechGPT-Gen: Scaling Chain-of-Information Speech Generation,"Dong Zhang, Xin Zhang, Jun Zhan, Shimin Li, Yaqian Zhou, Xipeng Qiu","Benefiting from effective speech modeling, current Speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in in-context speech generation and efficient generalization to unseen speakers. However, the prevailing information modeling process is encumbered by certain redundancies, leading to inefficiencies in speech generation. We propose Chain-of-Information Generation (CoIG), a method for decoupling semantic and perceptual information in large-scale speech generation. Building on this, we develop SpeechGPT-Gen, an 8-billion-parameter SLLM efficient in semantic and perceptual information modeling. It comprises an autoregressive model based on LLM for semantic information modeling and a non-autoregressive model employing flow matching for perceptual information modeling. Additionally, we introduce the novel approach of infusing semantic information into the prior distribution to enhance the efficiency of flow matching. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SpeechGPT-Gen markedly excels in zero-shot text-to-speech, zero-shot voice conversion, and speech-to-speech dialogue, underscoring CoIG's remarkable proficiency in capturing and modeling speech's semantic and perceptual dimensions.

Can GPT-3.5 Generate and Code Discharge Summaries?,"Matúš Falis, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Hang Dong, Luke Daines, Siddharth Basetti, Michael Holder, Rose S Penfold, Alexandra Birch, Beatrice Alex","Objective: To investigate GPT-3.5 in generating and coding medical documents with ICD-10 codes for data augmentation on low-resources labels.   Materials and Methods: Employing GPT-3.5 we generated and coded 9,606 discharge summaries based on lists of ICD-10 code descriptions of patients with infrequent (generation) codes within the MIMIC-IV dataset. Combined with the baseline training set, this formed an augmented training set. Neural coding models were trained on baseline and augmented data and evaluated on a MIMIC-IV test set. We report micro- and macro-F1 scores on the full codeset, generation codes, and their families. Weak Hierarchical Confusion Matrices were employed to determine within-family and outside-of-family coding errors in the latter codesets. The coding performance of GPT-3.5 was evaluated both on prompt-guided self-generated data and real MIMIC-IV data. Clinical professionals evaluated the clinical acceptability of the generated documents.   Results: Augmentation slightly hinders the overall performance of the models but improves performance for the generation candidate codes and their families, including one unseen in the baseline training data. Augmented models display lower out-of-family error rates. GPT-3.5 can identify ICD-10 codes by the prompted descriptions, but performs poorly on real data. Evaluators note the correctness of generated concepts while suffering in variety, supporting information, and narrative.   Discussion and Conclusion: GPT-3.5 alone is unsuitable for ICD-10 coding. Augmentation positively affects generation code families but mainly benefits codes with existing examples. Augmentation reduces out-of-family errors. Discharge summaries generated by GPT-3.5 state prompted concepts correctly but lack variety, and authenticity in narratives. They are unsuitable for clinical practice.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13512v2,2024-01
"How AI Ideas Affect the Creativity, Diversity, and Evolution of Human Ideas: Evidence From a Large, Dynamic Experiment","Joshua Ashkinaze, Julia Mendelsohn, Li Qiwei, Ceren Budak, Eric Gilbert","Exposure to large language model output is rapidly increasing. How will seeing AI-generated ideas affect human ideas? We conducted an experiment (800+ participants, 40+ countries) where participants viewed creative ideas that were from ChatGPT or prior experimental participants and then brainstormed their own idea. We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition -- speaks to the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having LLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. AI made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from AI and that participants may knowingly adopt AI ideas when the task is difficult. Our findings suggest that introducing AI ideas may increase collective diversity but not individual creativity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13481v2,2024-01
SciMMIR: Benchmarking Scientific Multi-modal Information Retrieval,"Siwei Wu, Yizhi Li, Kang Zhu, Ge Zhang, Yiming Liang, Kaijing Ma, Chenghao Xiao, Haoran Zhang, Bohao Yang, Wenhu Chen, Wenhao Huang, Noura Al Moubayed, Jie Fu, Chenghua Lin","Multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) is a rapidly evolving field, where significant progress, particularly in image-text pairing, has been made through advanced representation learning and cross-modality alignment research. However, current benchmarks for evaluating MMIR performance in image-text pairing within the scientific domain show a notable gap, where chart and table images described in scholarly language usually do not play a significant role. To bridge this gap, we develop a specialised scientific MMIR (SciMMIR) benchmark by leveraging open-access paper collections to extract data relevant to the scientific domain. This benchmark comprises 530K meticulously curated image-text pairs, extracted from figures and tables with detailed captions in scientific documents.

SpeechDPR: End-to-End Spoken Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Spoken Question Answering,"Chyi-Jiunn Lin, Guan-Ting Lin, Yung-Sung Chuang, Wei-Lun Wu, Shang-Wen Li, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Hung-yi Lee, Lin-shan Lee","Spoken Question Answering (SQA) is essential for machines to reply to user's question by finding the answer span within a given spoken passage. SQA has been previously achieved without ASR to avoid recognition errors and Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems. However, the real-world problem of Open-domain SQA (openSQA), in which the machine needs to first retrieve passages that possibly contain the answer from a spoken archive in addition, was never considered. This paper proposes the first known end-to-end framework, Speech Dense Passage Retriever (SpeechDPR), for the retrieval component of the openSQA problem. SpeechDPR learns a sentence-level semantic representation by distilling knowledge from the cascading model of unsupervised ASR (UASR) and text dense retriever (TDR). No manually transcribed speech data is needed. Initial experiments showed performance comparable to the cascading model of UASR and TDR, and significantly better when UASR was poor, verifying this approach is more robust to speech recognition errors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13463v3,2024-01
Question answering systems for health professionals at the point of care -- a systematic review,"Gregory Kell, Angus Roberts, Serge Umansky, Linglong Qian, Davide Ferrari, Frank Soboczenski, Byron Wallace, Nikhil Patel, Iain J Marshall","Objective: Question answering (QA) systems have the potential to improve the quality of clinical care by providing health professionals with the latest and most relevant evidence. However, QA systems have not been widely adopted. This systematic review aims to characterize current medical QA systems, assess their suitability for healthcare, and identify areas of improvement.   Materials and methods: We searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ACL Anthology and forward and backward citations on 7th February 2023. We included peer-reviewed journal and conference papers describing the design and evaluation of biomedical QA systems. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. We conducted a narrative synthesis and risk of bias assessment for each study. We assessed the utility of biomedical QA systems.   Results: We included 79 studies and identified themes, including question realism, answer reliability, answer utility, clinical specialism, systems, usability, and evaluation methods. Clinicians' questions used to train and evaluate QA systems were restricted to certain sources, types and complexity levels. No system communicated confidence levels in the answers or sources. Many studies suffered from high risks of bias and applicability concerns. Only 8 studies completely satisfied any criterion for clinical utility, and only 7 reported user evaluations. Most systems were built with limited input from clinicians.   Discussion: While machine learning methods have led to increased accuracy, most studies imperfectly reflected real-world healthcare information needs. Key research priorities include developing more realistic healthcare QA datasets and considering the reliability of answer sources, rather than merely focusing on accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01700v1,2024-01
Clue-Guided Path Exploration: Optimizing Knowledge Graph Retrieval with Large Language Models to Address the Information Black Box Challenge,"Dehao Tao, Feng Huang, Congqi Wang, Yongfeng Huang, Minghu Jiang","In recent times, large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities. However, updating their knowledge poses challenges, potentially leading to inaccuracies when confronted with unfamiliar queries. To address this issue, integrating external knowledge bases such as knowledge graphs with large language models is a viable approach. The key challenge lies in extracting the required knowledge from knowledge graphs based on natural language, demanding high semantic understanding. Therefore, researchers are considering leveraging large language models directly for knowledge retrieval from these graphs. Current efforts typically rely on the comprehensive problem-solving capabilities of large language models. We argue that a problem we term the 'information black box' can significantly impact the practical effectiveness of such methods. Moreover, this kind of methods is less effective for scenarios where the questions are unfamiliar to the large language models. In this paper, we propose a Clue-Guided Path Exploration (CGPE) framework to optimize knowledge retrieval based on large language models. By addressing the 'information black box' issue and employing single-task approaches instead of complex tasks, we have enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of using large language models for retrieving knowledge graphs. Experiments on open-source datasets reveal that CGPE outperforms previous methods and is highly applicable to LLMs with fewer parameters. In some instances, even ChatGLM3, with its 6 billion parameters, can rival the performance of GPT-4. Furthermore, the results indicate a minimal invocation frequency of CGPE on LLMs, suggesting reduced computational overhead. For organizations and individuals facing constraints in computational resources, our research offers significant practical value.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13444v2,2024-01
Text Categorization Can Enhance Domain-Agnostic Stopword Extraction,"Houcemeddine Turki, Naome A. Etori, Mohamed Ali Hadj Taieb, Abdul-Hakeem Omotayo, Chris Chinenye Emezue, Mohamed Ben Aouicha, Ayodele Awokoya, Falalu Ibrahim Lawan, Doreen Nixdorf","This paper investigates the role of text categorization in streamlining stopword extraction in natural language processing (NLP), specifically focusing on nine African languages alongside French. By leveraging the MasakhaNEWS, African Stopwords Project, and MasakhaPOS datasets, our findings emphasize that text categorization effectively identifies domain-agnostic stopwords with over 80% detection success rate for most examined languages. Nevertheless, linguistic variances result in lower detection rates for certain languages. Interestingly, we find that while over 40% of stopwords are common across news categories, less than 15% are unique to a single category. Uncommon stopwords add depth to text but their classification as stopwords depends on context. Therefore combining statistical and linguistic approaches creates comprehensive stopword lists, highlighting the value of our hybrid method.

Large language model empowered participatory urban planning,"Zhilun Zhou, Yuming Lin, Yong Li","Participatory urban planning is the mainstream of modern urban planning and involves the active engagement of different stakeholders. However, the traditional participatory paradigm encounters challenges in time and manpower, while the generative planning tools fail to provide adjustable and inclusive solutions. This research introduces an innovative urban planning approach integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) within the participatory process. The framework, based on the crafted LLM agent, consists of role-play, collaborative generation, and feedback iteration, solving a community-level land-use task catering to 1000 distinct interests. Empirical experiments in diverse urban communities exhibit LLM's adaptability and effectiveness across varied planning scenarios. The results were evaluated on four metrics, surpassing human experts in satisfaction and inclusion, and rivaling state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods in service and ecology. Further analysis shows the advantage of LLM agents in providing adjustable and inclusive solutions with natural language reasoning and strong scalability.

APT-Pipe: A Prompt-Tuning Tool for Social Data Annotation using ChatGPT,"Yiming Zhu, Zhizhuo Yin, Gareth Tyson, Ehsan-Ul Haq, Lik-Hang Lee, Pan Hui","Recent research has highlighted the potential of LLM applications, like ChatGPT, for performing label annotation on social computing text. However, it is already well known that performance hinges on the quality of the input prompts. To address this, there has been a flurry of research into prompt tuning -- techniques and guidelines that attempt to improve the quality of prompts. Yet these largely rely on manual effort and prior knowledge of the dataset being annotated. To address this limitation, we propose APT-Pipe, an automated prompt-tuning pipeline. APT-Pipe aims to automatically tune prompts to enhance ChatGPT's text classification performance on any given dataset. We implement APT-Pipe and test it across twelve distinct text classification datasets. We find that prompts tuned by APT-Pipe help ChatGPT achieve higher weighted F1-score on nine out of twelve experimented datasets, with an improvement of 7.01% on average. We further highlight APT-Pipe's flexibility as a framework by showing how it can be extended to support additional tuning mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01697v4,2024-01

Towards Explainable Harmful Meme Detection through Multimodal Debate between Large Language Models,"Hongzhan Lin, Ziyang Luo, Wei Gao, Jing Ma, Bo Wang, Ruichao Yang","The age of social media is flooded with Internet memes, necessitating a clear grasp and effective identification of harmful ones. This task presents a significant challenge due to the implicit meaning embedded in memes, which is not explicitly conveyed through the surface text and image. However, existing harmful meme detection methods do not present readable explanations that unveil such implicit meaning to support their detection decisions. In this paper, we propose an explainable approach to detect harmful memes, achieved through reasoning over conflicting rationales from both harmless and harmful positions. Specifically, inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) on text generation and reasoning, we first elicit multimodal debate between LLMs to generate the explanations derived from the contradictory arguments. Then we propose to fine-tune a small language model as the debate judge for harmfulness inference, to facilitate multimodal fusion between the harmfulness rationales and the intrinsic multimodal information within memes. In this way, our model is empowered to perform dialectical reasoning over intricate and implicit harm-indicative patterns, utilizing multimodal explanations originating from both harmless and harmful arguments. Extensive experiments on three public meme datasets demonstrate that our harmful meme detection approach achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for explaining the meme harmfulness of the model predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13298v1,2024-01
Can AI Assistants Know What They Don't Know?,"Qinyuan Cheng, Tianxiang Sun, Xiangyang Liu, Wenwei Zhang, Zhangyue Yin, Shimin Li, Linyang Li, Zhengfu He, Kai Chen, Xipeng Qiu","Recently, AI assistants based on large language models (LLMs) show surprising performance in many tasks, such as dialogue, solving math problems, writing code, and using tools. Although LLMs possess intensive world knowledge, they still make factual errors when facing some knowledge intensive tasks, like open-domain question answering. These untruthful responses from the AI assistant may cause significant risks in practical applications. We believe that an AI assistant's refusal to answer questions it does not know is a crucial method for reducing hallucinations and making the assistant truthful. Therefore, in this paper, we ask the question ""Can AI assistants know what they don't know and express them through natural language?"" To answer this question, we construct a model-specific ""I don't know"" (Idk) dataset for an assistant, which contains its known and unknown questions, based on existing open-domain question answering datasets. Then we align the assistant with its corresponding Idk dataset and observe whether it can refuse to answer its unknown questions after alignment. Experimental results show that after alignment with Idk datasets, the assistant can refuse to answer most its unknown questions. For questions they attempt to answer, the accuracy is significantly higher than before the alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13275v2,2024-01
"MF-AED-AEC: Speech Emotion Recognition by Leveraging Multimodal Fusion, Asr Error Detection, and Asr Error Correction","Jiajun He, Xiaohan Shi, Xingfeng Li, Tomoki Toda","The prevalent approach in speech emotion recognition (SER) involves integrating both audio and textual information to comprehensively identify the speaker's emotion, with the text generally obtained through automatic speech recognition (ASR). An essential issue of this approach is that ASR errors from the text modality can worsen the performance of SER. Previous studies have proposed using an auxiliary ASR error detection task to adaptively assign weights of each word in ASR hypotheses. However, this approach has limited improvement potential because it does not address the coherence of semantic information in the text. Additionally, the inherent heterogeneity of different modalities leads to distribution gaps between their representations, making their fusion challenging. Therefore, in this paper, we incorporate two auxiliary tasks, ASR error detection (AED) and ASR error correction (AEC), to enhance the semantic coherence of ASR text, and further introduce a novel multi-modal fusion (MF) method to learn shared representations across modalities. We refer to our method as MF-AED-AEC. Experimental results indicate that MF-AED-AEC significantly outperforms the baseline model by a margin of 4.1\%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13260v2,2024-01
UniMS-RAG: A Unified Multi-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Personalized Dialogue Systems,"Hongru Wang, Wenyu Huang, Yang Deng, Rui Wang, Zezhong Wang, Yufei Wang, Fei Mi, Jeff Z. Pan, Kam-Fai Wong","Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown exceptional capabilities in many natual language understanding and generation tasks. However, the personalization issue still remains a much-coveted property, especially when it comes to the multiple sources involved in the dialogue system. To better plan and incorporate the use of multiple sources in generating personalized response, we firstly decompose it into three sub-tasks: Knowledge Source Selection, Knowledge Retrieval, and Response Generation. We then propose a novel Unified Multi-Source Retrieval-Augmented Generation system (UniMS-RAG) Specifically, we unify these three sub-tasks with different formulations into the same sequence-to-sequence paradigm during the training, to adaptively retrieve evidences and evaluate the relevance on-demand using special tokens, called acting tokens and evaluation tokens. Enabling language models to generate acting tokens facilitates interaction with various knowledge sources, allowing them to adapt their behavior to diverse task requirements. Meanwhile, evaluation tokens gauge the relevance score between the dialogue context and the retrieved evidence. In addition, we carefully design a self-refinement mechanism to iteratively refine the generated response considering 1) the consistency scores between the generated response and retrieved evidence; and 2) the relevance scores. Experiments on two personalized datasets (DuLeMon and KBP) show that UniMS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on the knowledge source selection and response generation task with itself as a retriever in a unified manner. Extensive analyses and discussions are provided for shedding some new perspectives for personalized dialogue systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13256v3,2024-01
SEER: Facilitating Structured Reasoning and Explanation via Reinforcement Learning,"Guoxin Chen, Kexin Tang, Chao Yang, Fuying Ye, Yu Qiao, Yiming Qian","Elucidating the reasoning process with structured explanations from question to answer is crucial, as it significantly enhances the interpretability, traceability, and trustworthiness of question-answering (QA) systems. However, structured explanations demand models to perform intricately structured reasoning, which poses great challenges. Most existing methods focus on single-step reasoning through supervised learning, ignoring logical dependencies between steps. Moreover, existing reinforcement learning (RL) based methods overlook the structured relationships, underutilizing the potential of RL in structured reasoning. In this paper, we propose SEER, a novel method that maximizes a structure-based return to facilitate structured reasoning and explanation. Our proposed structure-based return precisely describes the hierarchical and branching structure inherent in structured reasoning, effectively capturing the intricate relationships between different reasoning steps. In addition, we introduce a fine-grained reward function to meticulously delineate diverse reasoning steps. Extensive experiments show that SEER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 6.9% over RL-based methods on EntailmentBank, a 4.4% average improvement on STREET benchmark, and exhibiting outstanding efficiency and cross-dataset generalization performance.

From Random to Informed Data Selection: A Diversity-Based Approach to Optimize Human Annotation and Few-Shot Learning,"Alexandre Alcoforado, Thomas Palmeira Ferraz, Lucas Hideki Okamura, Israel Campos Fama, Arnold Moya Lavado, Bárbara Dias Bueno, Bruno Veloso, Anna Helena Reali Costa","A major challenge in Natural Language Processing is obtaining annotated data for supervised learning. An option is the use of crowdsourcing platforms for data annotation. However, crowdsourcing introduces issues related to the annotator's experience, consistency, and biases. An alternative is to use zero-shot methods, which in turn have limitations compared to their few-shot or fully supervised counterparts. Recent advancements driven by large language models show potential, but struggle to adapt to specialized domains with severely limited data. The most common approaches therefore involve the human itself randomly annotating a set of datapoints to build initial datasets. But randomly sampling data to be annotated is often inefficient as it ignores the characteristics of the data and the specific needs of the model. The situation worsens when working with imbalanced datasets, as random sampling tends to heavily bias towards the majority classes, leading to excessive annotated data. To address these issues, this paper contributes an automatic and informed data selection architecture to build a small dataset for few-shot learning. Our proposal minimizes the quantity and maximizes diversity of data selected for human annotation, while improving model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13229v1,2024-01
LPNL: Scalable Link Prediction with Large Language Models,"Baolong Bi, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Xueqi Cheng","Exploring the application of large language models (LLMs) to graph learning is a emerging endeavor. However, the vast amount of information inherent in large graphs poses significant challenges to this process. This work focuses on the link prediction task and introduces $\textbf{LPNL}$ (Link Prediction via Natural Language), a framework based on large language models designed for scalable link prediction on large-scale heterogeneous graphs. We design novel prompts for link prediction that articulate graph details in natural language. We propose a two-stage sampling pipeline to extract crucial information from the graphs, and a divide-and-conquer strategy to control the input tokens within predefined limits, addressing the challenge of overwhelming information. We fine-tune a T5 model based on our self-supervised learning designed for link prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LPNL outperforms multiple advanced baselines in link prediction tasks on large-scale graphs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13227v3,2024-01
HiGen: Hierarchy-Aware Sequence Generation for Hierarchical Text Classification,"Vidit Jain, Mukund Rungta, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Zeyu Wang, Mu Gao, Jeffrey Skolnick, Chao Zhang","Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a complex subtask under multi-label text classification, characterized by a hierarchical label taxonomy and data imbalance. The best-performing models aim to learn a static representation by combining document and hierarchical label information. However, the relevance of document sections can vary based on the hierarchy level, necessitating a dynamic document representation. To address this, we propose HiGen, a text-generation-based framework utilizing language models to encode dynamic text representations. We introduce a level-guided loss function to capture the relationship between text and label name semantics. Our approach incorporates a task-specific pretraining strategy, adapting the language model to in-domain knowledge and significantly enhancing performance for classes with limited examples. Furthermore, we present a new and valuable dataset called ENZYME, designed for HTC, which comprises articles from PubMed with the goal of predicting Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers. Through extensive experiments on the ENZYME dataset and the widely recognized WOS and NYT datasets, our methodology demonstrates superior performance, surpassing existing approaches while efficiently handling data and mitigating class imbalance. The data and code will be released publicly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01696v2,2024-01
TAT-LLM: A Specialized Language Model for Discrete Reasoning over Tabular and Textual Data,"Fengbin Zhu, Ziyang Liu, Fuli Feng, Chao Wang, Moxin Li, Tat-Seng Chua","In this work, we address question answering (QA) over a hybrid of tabular and textual data that are very common content on the Web (e.g. SEC filings), where discrete reasoning capabilities are often required. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated strong multi-step reasoning capabilities. We then consider harnessing the amazing power of LLMs to solve our task. We abstract a Step-wise Pipeline for tabular and textual QA, which consists of three key steps, including Extractor, Reasoner and Executor, and initially design an instruction to instantiate the pipeline and validate that GPT-4 outperforms all existing methods. However, utilizing an online LLM like GPT-4 holds various challenges in terms of cost, latency, and data security risk, which motivates us to specialize smaller LLMs in this task. We develop a TAT-LLM language model by fine-tuning LLaMA 2 with the training data generated automatically from existing expert-annotated datasets following the Step-wise Pipeline. The experimental results have verified that our TAT-LLM model can outperform all baseline models, including the previous best fine-tuned models and very large-scale LLMs like GPT-4 on FinQA, TAT-QA and TAT-DQA benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13223v3,2024-01
ULTRA: Unleash LLMs' Potential for Event Argument Extraction through Hierarchical Modeling and Pair-wise Refinement,"Xinliang Frederick Zhang, Carter Blum, Temma Choji, Shalin Shah, Alakananda Vempala","Structural extraction of events within discourse is critical since it avails a deeper understanding of communication patterns and behavior trends. Event argument extraction (EAE), at the core of event-centric understanding, is the task of identifying role-specific text spans (i.e., arguments) for a given event. Document-level EAE (DocEAE) focuses on arguments that are scattered across an entire document. In this work, we explore the capabilities of open source Large Language Models (LLMs), i.e., Flan-UL2, for the DocEAE task. To this end, we propose ULTRA, a hierarchical framework that extracts event arguments more cost-effectively -- the method needs as few as 50 annotations and doesn't require hitting costly API endpoints. Further, it alleviates the positional bias issue intrinsic to LLMs. ULTRA first sequentially reads text chunks of a document to generate a candidate argument set, upon which ULTRA learns to drop non-pertinent candidates through self-refinement. We further introduce LEAFER to address the challenge LLMs face in locating the exact boundary of an argument span. ULTRA outperforms strong baselines, which include strong supervised models and ChatGPT, by 9.8% when evaluated by the exact match (EM) metric.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13218v1,2024-01
"Better Call GPT, Comparing Large Language Models Against Lawyers","Lauren Martin, Nick Whitehouse, Stephanie Yiu, Lizzie Catterson, Rivindu Perera","This paper presents a groundbreaking comparison between Large Language Models and traditional legal contract reviewers, Junior Lawyers and Legal Process Outsourcers. We dissect whether LLMs can outperform humans in accuracy, speed, and cost efficiency during contract review. Our empirical analysis benchmarks LLMs against a ground truth set by Senior Lawyers, uncovering that advanced models match or exceed human accuracy in determining legal issues. In speed, LLMs complete reviews in mere seconds, eclipsing the hours required by their human counterparts. Cost wise, LLMs operate at a fraction of the price, offering a staggering 99.97 percent reduction in cost over traditional methods. These results are not just statistics, they signal a seismic shift in legal practice. LLMs stand poised to disrupt the legal industry, enhancing accessibility and efficiency of legal services.

Language-Guided World Models: A Model-Based Approach to AI Control,"Alex Zhang, Khanh Nguyen, Jens Tuyls, Albert Lin, Karthik Narasimhan","This paper introduces the concept of Language-Guided World Models (LWMs) -- probabilistic models that can simulate environments by reading texts. Agents equipped with these models provide humans with more extensive and efficient control, allowing them to simultaneously alter agent behaviors in multiple tasks via natural verbal communication. In this work, we take initial steps in developing robust LWMs that can generalize to compositionally novel language descriptions. We design a challenging world modeling benchmark based on the game of MESSENGER (Hanjie et al., 2021), featuring evaluation settings that require varying degrees of compositional generalization. Our experiments reveal the lack of generalizability of the state-of-the-art Transformer model, as it offers marginal improvements in simulation quality over a no-text baseline. We devise a more robust model by fusing the Transformer with the EMMA attention mechanism (Hanjie et al., 2021). Our model substantially outperforms the Transformer and approaches the performance of a model with an oracle semantic parsing and grounding capability. To demonstrate the practicality of this model in improving AI safety and transparency, we simulate a scenario in which the model enables an agent to present plans to a human before execution, and to revise plans based on their language feedback.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01695v3,2024-01
MLLMReID: Multimodal Large Language Model-based Person Re-identification,"Shan Yang, Yongfei Zhang","Multimodal large language models (MLLM) have achieved satisfactory results in many tasks. However, their performance in the task of ReID (ReID) has not been explored to date. This paper will investigate how to adapt them for the task of ReID. An intuitive idea is to fine-tune MLLM with ReID image-text datasets, and then use their visual encoder as a backbone for ReID. However, there still exist two apparent issues: (1) Designing instructions for ReID, MLLMs may overfit specific instructions, and designing a variety of instructions will lead to higher costs. (2) When fine-tuning the visual encoder of a MLLM, it is not trained synchronously with the ReID task. As a result, the effectiveness of the visual encoder fine-tuning cannot be directly reflected in the performance of the ReID task. To address these problems, this paper proposes MLLMReID: Multimodal Large Language Model-based ReID. Firstly, we proposed Common Instruction, a simple approach that leverages the essence ability of LLMs to continue writing, avoiding complex and diverse instruction design. Secondly, we propose a multi-task learning-based synchronization module to ensure that the visual encoder of the MLLM is trained synchronously with the ReID task. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13201v3,2024-01
AgentBoard: An Analytical Evaluation Board of Multi-turn LLM Agents,"Chang Ma, Junlei Zhang, Zhihao Zhu, Cheng Yang, Yujiu Yang, Yaohui Jin, Zhenzhong Lan, Lingpeng Kong, Junxian He","Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) as general-purpose agents is essential for understanding their capabilities and facilitating their integration into practical applications. However, the evaluation process presents substantial challenges. A primary obstacle is the benchmarking of agent performance across diverse scenarios within a unified framework, especially in maintaining partially-observable environments and ensuring multi-round interactions. Moreover, current evaluation frameworks mostly focus on the final success rate, revealing few insights during the process and failing to provide a deep understanding of the model abilities. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentBoard, a pioneering comprehensive benchmark and accompanied open-source evaluation framework tailored to analytical evaluation of LLM agents. AgentBoard offers a fine-grained progress rate metric that captures incremental advancements as well as a comprehensive evaluation toolkit that features easy assessment of agents for multi-faceted analysis. This not only sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of LLM agents but also propels the interpretability of their performance to the forefront.

CFMatch: Aligning Automated Answer Equivalence Evaluation with Expert Judgments For Open-Domain Question Answering,"Zongxia Li, Ishani Mondal, Yijun Liang, Huy Nghiem, Jordan Boyd-Graber","Question answering (QA) can only make progress if we know if an answer is correct, but for many of the most challenging and interesting QA examples, current evaluation metrics to determine answer equivalence (AE) often do not align with human judgments, particularly more verbose, free-form answers from large language models (LLM). There are two challenges: a lack of data and that models are too big: LLM-based scorers can correlate better with human judges, but this task has only been tested on limited QA datasets, and even when available, update of the model is limited because LLMs are large and often expensive. We rectify both of these issues by providing clear and consistent guidelines for evaluating AE in machine QA adopted from professional human QA contests. We also introduce a combination of standard evaluation and a more efficient, robust, and lightweight discriminate AE classifier-based matching method (CFMatch, smaller than 1 MB), trained and validated to more accurately evaluate answer correctness in accordance with adopted expert AE rules that are more aligned with human judgments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13170v4,2024-01
Misgendering and Assuming Gender in Machine Translation when Working with Low-Resource Languages,"Sourojit Ghosh, Srishti Chatterjee","This chapter focuses on gender-related errors in machine translation (MT) in the context of low-resource languages. We begin by explaining what low-resource languages are, examining the inseparable social and computational factors that create such linguistic hierarchies. We demonstrate through a case study of our mother tongue Bengali, a global language spoken by almost 300 million people but still classified as low-resource, how gender is assumed and inferred in translations to and from the high(est)-resource English when no such information is provided in source texts. We discuss the postcolonial and societal impacts of such errors leading to linguistic erasure and representational harms, and conclude by discussing potential solutions towards uplifting languages by providing them more agency in MT conversations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13165v3,2024-01

In this paper, we present SpacTor, a new training procedure consisting of (1) a hybrid objective combining span corruption (SC) and token replacement detection (RTD), and (2) a two-stage curriculum that optimizes the hybrid objective over the initial $\tau$ iterations, then transitions to standard SC loss. We show empirically that the effectiveness of the hybrid objective is tied to the two-stage pre-training schedule, and provide extensive analysis on why this is the case. In our experiments with encoder-decoder architectures (T5) on a variety of NLP tasks, SpacTor-T5 yields the same downstream performance as standard SC pre-training, while enabling a 50% reduction in pre-training iterations and 40% reduction in total FLOPs. Alternatively, given the same amount of computing budget, we find that SpacTor results in significantly improved downstream benchmark performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13160v1,2024-01

In this work we firstly analyse different sampling strategies to provide insights into the training of CB for ASR with correlation plots between the bias embeddings among various training stages. Secondly, we introduce a neighbourhood attention (NA) that localizes self attention (SA) to the nearest neighbouring frames to further refine the CB output.

ARGS: Alignment as Reward-Guided Search,"Maxim Khanov, Jirayu Burapacheep, Yixuan Li","Aligning large language models with human objectives is paramount, yet common approaches including RLHF suffer from unstable and resource-intensive training. In response to this challenge, we introduce ARGS, Alignment as Reward-Guided Search, a novel framework that integrates alignment into the decoding process, eliminating the need for expensive RL training. By adjusting the model's probabilistic predictions using a reward signal, ARGS generates texts with semantic diversity while being aligned with human preferences, offering a promising and flexible solution for aligning language models. Notably, ARGS demonstrates consistent enhancements in average reward compared to baselines across diverse alignment tasks and various model dimensions. For example, under the same greedy-based decoding strategy, our method improves the average reward by 19.56% relative to the baseline and secures a preference or tie score of 64.33% in GPT-4 evaluation. We believe that our framework, emphasizing decoding-time alignment, paves the way for more responsive language models in the future.

The Language Barrier: Dissecting Safety Challenges of LLMs in Multilingual Contexts,"Lingfeng Shen, Weiting Tan, Sihao Chen, Yunmo Chen, Jingyu Zhang, Haoran Xu, Boyuan Zheng, Philipp Koehn, Daniel Khashabi","As the influence of large language models (LLMs) spans across global communities, their safety challenges in multilingual settings become paramount for alignment research. This paper examines the variations in safety challenges faced by LLMs across different languages and discusses approaches to alleviating such concerns. By comparing how state-of-the-art LLMs respond to the same set of malicious prompts written in higher- vs. lower-resource languages, we observe that (1) LLMs tend to generate unsafe responses much more often when a malicious prompt is written in a lower-resource language, and (2) LLMs tend to generate more irrelevant responses to malicious prompts in lower-resource languages. To understand where the discrepancy can be attributed, we study the effect of instruction tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or supervised finetuning (SFT) on the HH-RLHF dataset. Surprisingly, while training with high-resource languages improves model alignment, training in lower-resource languages yields minimal improvement. This suggests that the bottleneck of cross-lingual alignment is rooted in the pretraining stage. Our findings highlight the challenges in cross-lingual LLM safety, and we hope they inform future research in this direction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13136v1,2024-01

More recently, various vaccinations have been developed to aid in the prevention or reduction of the severity of the COVID-19 infection. Despite the effectiveness of the precautionary measures and the vaccines, there are several controversies that are massively shared on social media platforms like Twitter. In this paper, we explore the use of state-of-the-art transformer-based language models to study people's acceptance of vaccines in Nigeria. We developed a novel dataset by crawling multi-lingual tweets using relevant hashtags and keywords. Our analysis and visualizations revealed that most tweets expressed neutral sentiments about COVID-19 vaccines, with some individuals expressing positive views, and there was no strong preference for specific vaccine types, although Moderna received slightly more positive sentiment. We also found out that fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM with an appropriate dataset can yield competitive results, even if the LLM was not initially pre-trained on the specific language of that dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13133v1,2024-01
Seed-Guided Fine-Grained Entity Typing in Science and Engineering Domains,"Yu Zhang, Yunyi Zhang, Yanzhen Shen, Yu Deng, Lucian Popa, Larisa Shwartz, ChengXiang Zhai, Jiawei Han","Accurately typing entity mentions from text segments is a fundamental task for various natural language processing applications. Many previous approaches rely on massive human-annotated data to perform entity typing. Nevertheless, collecting such data in highly specialized science and engineering domains (e.g., software engineering and security) can be time-consuming and costly, without mentioning the domain gaps between training and inference data if the model needs to be applied to confidential datasets. In this paper, we study the task of seed-guided fine-grained entity typing in science and engineering domains, which takes the name and a few seed entities for each entity type as the only supervision and aims to classify new entity mentions into both seen and unseen types (i.e., those without seed entities). To solve this problem, we propose SEType which first enriches the weak supervision by finding more entities for each seen type from an unlabeled corpus using the contextualized representations of pre-trained language models. It then matches the enriched entities to unlabeled text to get pseudo-labeled samples and trains a textual entailment model that can make inferences for both seen and unseen types. Extensive experiments on two datasets covering four domains demonstrate the effectiveness of SEType in comparison with various baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13129v2,2024-01
Quality of Answers of Generative Large Language Models vs Peer Patients for Interpreting Lab Test Results for Lay Patients: Evaluation Study,"Zhe He, Balu Bhasuran, Qiao Jin, Shubo Tian, Karim Hanna, Cindy Shavor, Lisbeth Garcia Arguello, Patrick Murray, Zhiyong Lu","Lab results are often confusing and hard to understand. Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have opened a promising avenue for patients to get their questions answered. We aim to assess the feasibility of using LLMs to generate relevant, accurate, helpful, and unharmful responses to lab test-related questions asked by patients and to identify potential issues that can be mitigated with augmentation approaches. We first collected lab test results related question and answer data from Yahoo! Answers and selected 53 QA pairs for this study. Using the LangChain framework and ChatGPT web portal, we generated responses to the 53 questions from four LLMs including GPT-4, Meta LLaMA 2, MedAlpaca, and ORCA_mini. We first assessed the similarity of their answers using standard QA similarity-based evaluation metrics including ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore. We also utilized an LLM-based evaluator to judge whether a target model has higher quality in terms of relevance, correctness, helpfulness, and safety than the baseline model. Finally, we performed a manual evaluation with medical experts for all the responses to seven selected questions on the same four aspects. The results of Win Rate and medical expert evaluation both showed that GPT-4's responses achieved better scores than all the other LLM responses and human responses on all four aspects (relevance, correctness, helpfulness, and safety). However, LLM responses occasionally also suffer from a lack of interpretation in one's medical context, incorrect statements, and lack of references. We find that compared to other three LLMs and human answer from the Q&A website, GPT-4's responses are more accurate, helpful, relevant, and safer. However, there are cases which GPT-4 responses are inaccurate and not individualized. We identified a number of ways to improve the quality of LLM responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01693v1,2024-01
Maximizing Data Efficiency for Cross-Lingual TTS Adaptation by Self-Supervised Representation Mixing and Embedding Initialization,"Wei-Ping Huang, Sung-Feng Huang, Hung-yi Lee","This paper presents an effective transfer learning framework for language adaptation in text-to-speech systems, with a focus on achieving language adaptation using minimal labeled and unlabeled data. While many works focus on reducing the usage of labeled data, very few consider minimizing the usage of unlabeled data. By utilizing self-supervised features in the pretraining stage, replacing the noisy portion of pseudo labels with these features during fine-tuning, and incorporating an embedding initialization trick, our method leverages more information from unlabeled data compared to conventional approaches. Experimental results show that our framework is able to synthesize intelligible speech in unseen languages with only 4 utterances of labeled data and 15 minutes of unlabeled data. Our methodology continues to surpass conventional techniques, even when a greater volume of data is accessible.

Through the years, much work has been done on data augmentation for the English language. In contrast, very less work has been done on Indian languages. This is contrary to the fact that data augmentation is used to deal with data scarcity. In this work, we focus on implementing techniques like Easy Data Augmentation, Back Translation, Paraphrasing, Text Generation using LLMs, and Text Expansion using LLMs for text classification on different languages. We focus on 6 Indian languages namely: Sindhi, Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati, Telugu, and Sanskrit. According to our knowledge, no such work exists for text augmentation on Indian languages.

HAZARD Challenge: Embodied Decision Making in Dynamically Changing Environments,"Qinhong Zhou, Sunli Chen, Yisong Wang, Haozhe Xu, Weihua Du, Hongxin Zhang, Yilun Du, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Chuang Gan","Recent advances in high-fidelity virtual environments serve as one of the major driving forces for building intelligent embodied agents to perceive, reason and interact with the physical world. Typically, these environments remain unchanged unless agents interact with them. However, in real-world scenarios, agents might also face dynamically changing environments characterized by unexpected events and need to rapidly take action accordingly. To remedy this gap, we propose a new simulated embodied benchmark, called HAZARD, specifically designed to assess the decision-making abilities of embodied agents in dynamic situations. HAZARD consists of three unexpected disaster scenarios, including fire, flood, and wind, and specifically supports the utilization of large language models (LLMs) to assist common sense reasoning and decision-making. This benchmark enables us to evaluate autonomous agents' decision-making capabilities across various pipelines, including reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based, and search-based methods in dynamically changing environments. As a first step toward addressing this challenge using large language models, we further develop an LLM-based agent and perform an in-depth analysis of its promise and challenge of solving these challenging tasks.

In-Context Language Learning: Architectures and Algorithms,"Ekin Akyürek, Bailin Wang, Yoon Kim, Jacob Andreas","Large-scale neural language models exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context learning (ICL): they can infer novel functions from datasets provided as input. Most of our current understanding of when and how ICL arises comes from LMs trained on extremely simple learning problems like linear regression and associative recall. There remains a significant gap between these model problems and the ""real"" ICL exhibited by LMs trained on large text corpora, which involves not just retrieval and function approximation but free-form generation of language and other structured outputs. In this paper, we study ICL through the lens of a new family of model problems we term in context language learning (ICLL). In ICLL, LMs are presented with a set of strings from a formal language, and must generate additional strings from the same language. We focus on in-context learning of regular languages generated by random finite automata. We evaluate a diverse set of neural sequence models (including several RNNs, Transformers, and state-space model variants) on regular ICLL tasks, aiming to answer three questions: (1) Which model classes are empirically capable of ICLL? (2) What algorithmic solutions do successful models implement to perform ICLL? (3) What architectural changes can improve ICLL in less performant models? We first show that Transformers significantly outperform neural sequence models with recurrent or convolutional representations on ICLL tasks. Next, we provide evidence that their ability to do so relies on specialized ""n-gram heads"" (higher-order variants of induction heads) that compute input-conditional next-token distributions. Finally, we show that hard-wiring these heads into neural models improves performance not just on ICLL, but natural language modeling -- improving the perplexity of 340M-parameter models by up to 1.14 points (6.7%) on the SlimPajama dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12973v2,2024-01
Raidar: geneRative AI Detection viA Rewriting,"Chengzhi Mao, Carl Vondrick, Hao Wang, Junfeng Yang","We find that large language models (LLMs) are more likely to modify human-written text than AI-generated text when tasked with rewriting. This tendency arises because LLMs often perceive AI-generated text as high-quality, leading to fewer modifications. We introduce a method to detect AI-generated content by prompting LLMs to rewrite text and calculating the editing distance of the output. We dubbed our geneRative AI Detection viA Rewriting method Raidar. Raidar significantly improves the F1 detection scores of existing AI content detection models -- both academic and commercial -- across various domains, including News, creative writing, student essays, code, Yelp reviews, and arXiv papers, with gains of up to 29 points. Operating solely on word symbols without high-dimensional features, our method is compatible with black box LLMs, and is inherently robust on new content. Our results illustrate the unique imprint of machine-generated text through the lens of the machines themselves.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12970v2,2024-01
AutoRT: Embodied Foundation Models for Large Scale Orchestration of Robotic Agents,"Michael Ahn, Debidatta Dwibedi, Chelsea Finn, Montse Gonzalez Arenas, Keerthana Gopalakrishnan, Karol Hausman, Brian Ichter, Alex Irpan, Nikhil Joshi, Ryan Julian, Sean Kirmani, Isabel Leal, Edward Lee, Sergey Levine, Yao Lu, Isabel Leal, Sharath Maddineni, Kanishka Rao, Dorsa Sadigh, Pannag Sanketi, Pierre Sermanet, Quan Vuong, Stefan Welker, Fei Xia, Ted Xiao, Peng Xu, Steve Xu, Zhuo Xu","Foundation models that incorporate language, vision, and more recently actions have revolutionized the ability to harness internet scale data to reason about useful tasks. However, one of the key challenges of training embodied foundation models is the lack of data grounded in the physical world. In this paper, we propose AutoRT, a system that leverages existing foundation models to scale up the deployment of operational robots in completely unseen scenarios with minimal human supervision. AutoRT leverages vision-language models (VLMs) for scene understanding and grounding, and further uses large language models (LLMs) for proposing diverse and novel instructions to be performed by a fleet of robots. Guiding data collection by tapping into the knowledge of foundation models enables AutoRT to effectively reason about autonomy tradeoffs and safety while significantly scaling up data collection for robot learning. We demonstrate AutoRT proposing instructions to over 20 robots across multiple buildings and collecting 77k real robot episodes via both teleoperation and autonomous robot policies. We experimentally show that such ""in-the-wild"" data collected by AutoRT is significantly more diverse, and that AutoRT's use of LLMs allows for instruction following data collection robots that can align to human preferences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12963v2,2024-01
Meta-Prompting: Enhancing Language Models with Task-Agnostic Scaffolding,"Mirac Suzgun, Adam Tauman Kalai","We introduce meta-prompting, an effective scaffolding technique designed to enhance the functionality of language models (LMs). This approach transforms a single LM into a multi-faceted conductor, adept at managing and integrating multiple independent LM queries. By employing high-level instructions, meta-prompting guides the LM to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks. These subtasks are then handled by distinct ""expert"" instances of the same LM, each operating under specific, tailored instructions. Central to this process is the LM itself, in its role as the conductor, which ensures seamless communication and effective integration of the outputs from these expert models. It additionally employs its inherent critical thinking and robust verification processes to refine and authenticate the end result. This collaborative prompting approach empowers a single LM to simultaneously act as a comprehensive orchestrator and a panel of diverse experts, significantly enhancing its performance across a wide array of tasks. The zero-shot, task-agnostic nature of meta-prompting greatly simplifies user interaction by obviating the need for detailed, task-specific instructions. Furthermore, our research demonstrates the seamless integration of external tools, such as a Python interpreter, into the meta-prompting framework, thereby broadening its applicability and utility. Through rigorous experimentation with GPT-4, we establish the superiority of meta-prompting over conventional scaffolding methods: When averaged across all tasks, including the Game of 24, Checkmate-in-One, and Python Programming Puzzles, meta-prompting, augmented with a Python interpreter functionality, surpasses standard prompting by 17.1%, expert (dynamic) prompting by 17.3%, and multipersona prompting by 15.2%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12954v1,2024-01
Transformer-Based Models Are Not Yet Perfect At Learning to Emulate Structural Recursion,"Dylan Zhang, Curt Tigges, Zory Zhang, Stella Biderman, Maxim Raginsky, Talia Ringer","This paper investigates the ability of transformer-based models to learn structural recursion from examples. Recursion is a universal concept in both natural and formal languages. Structural recursion is central to the programming language and formal mathematics tasks where symbolic tools currently excel beyond neural models, such as inferring semantic relations between datatypes and emulating program behavior. We introduce a general framework that nicely connects the abstract concepts of structural recursion in the programming language domain to concrete sequence modeling problems and learned models' behavior. The framework includes a representation that captures the general \textit{syntax} of structural recursion, coupled with two different frameworks for understanding their \textit{semantics} -- one that is more natural from a programming languages perspective and one that helps bridge that perspective with a mechanistic understanding of the underlying transformer architecture.   With our framework as a powerful conceptual tool, we identify different issues under various set-ups. The models trained to emulate recursive computations cannot fully capture the recursion yet instead fit short-cut algorithms and thus cannot solve certain edge cases that are under-represented in the training distribution. In addition, it is difficult for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to mine recursive rules from in-context demonstrations. Meanwhile, these LLMs fail in interesting ways when emulating reduction (step-wise computation) of the recursive function.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12947v1,2024-01
Multicultural Name Recognition For Previously Unseen Names,Alexandra Loessberg-Zahl,"State of the art Named Entity Recognition (NER) models have achieved an impressive ability to extract common phrases from text that belong to labels such as location, organization, time, and person. However, typical NER systems that rely on having seen a specific entity in their training data in order to label an entity perform poorly on rare or unseen entities ta in order to label an entity perform poorly on rare or unseen entities (Derczynski et al., 2017). This paper attempts to improve recognition of person names, a diverse category that can grow any time someone is born or changes their name. In order for downstream tasks to not exhibit bias based on cultural background, a model should perform well on names from a variety of backgrounds. In this paper I experiment with the training data and input structure of an English Bi-LSTM name recognition model. I look at names from 103 countries to compare how well the model performs on names from different cultures, specifically in the context of a downstream task where extracted names will be matched to information on file. I find that a model with combined character and word input outperforms word-only models and may improve on accuracy compared to classical NER models that are not geared toward identifying unseen entity values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12941v1,2024-01
Red Teaming Visual Language Models,"Mukai Li, Lei Li, Yuwei Yin, Masood Ahmed, Zhenguang Liu, Qi Liu","VLMs (Vision-Language Models) extend the capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) to accept multimodal inputs. Since it has been verified that LLMs can be induced to generate harmful or inaccurate content through specific test cases (termed as Red Teaming), how VLMs perform in similar scenarios, especially with their combination of textual and visual inputs, remains a question. To explore this problem, we present a novel red teaming dataset RTVLM, which encompasses 10 subtasks (e.g., image misleading, multi-modal jail-breaking, face fairness, etc) under 4 primary aspects (faithfulness, privacy, safety, fairness). Our RTVLM is the first red-teaming dataset to benchmark current VLMs in terms of these 4 different aspects. Detailed analysis shows that 10 prominent open-sourced VLMs struggle with the red teaming in different degrees and have up to 31% performance gap with GPT-4V. Additionally, we simply apply red teaming alignment to LLaVA-v1.5 with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) using RTVLM, and this bolsters the models' performance with 10% in RTVLM test set, 13% in MM-Hal, and without noticeable decline in MM-Bench, overpassing other LLaVA-based models with regular alignment data. This reveals that current open-sourced VLMs still lack red teaming alignment. Our code and datasets will be open-source.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12915v1,2024-01
Linguistic-Based Mild Cognitive Impairment Detection Using Informative Loss,"Ali Pourramezan Fard, Mohammad H. Mahoor, Muath Alsuhaibani, Hiroko H. Dodgec","This paper presents a deep learning method using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, to distinguish between Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Normal Cognitive (NC) conditions in older adults. We propose a framework that analyzes transcripts generated from video interviews collected within the I-CONECT study project, a randomized controlled trial aimed at improving cognitive functions through video chats. Our proposed NLP framework consists of two Transformer-based modules, namely Sentence Embedding (SE) and Sentence Cross Attention (SCA). First, the SE module captures contextual relationships between words within each sentence. Subsequently, the SCA module extracts temporal features from a sequence of sentences. This feature is then used by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the classification of subjects into MCI or NC. To build a robust model, we propose a novel loss function, called InfoLoss, that considers the reduction in entropy by observing each sequence of sentences to ultimately enhance the classification accuracy. The results of our comprehensive model evaluation using the I-CONECT dataset show that our framework can distinguish between MCI and NC with an average area under the curve of 84.75%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01690v1,2024-01
From Understanding to Utilization: A Survey on Explainability for Large Language Models,"Haoyan Luo, Lucia Specia","Explainability for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical yet challenging aspect of natural language processing. As LLMs are increasingly integral to diverse applications, their ""black-box"" nature sparks significant concerns regarding transparency and ethical use. This survey underscores the imperative for increased explainability in LLMs, delving into both the research on explainability and the various methodologies and tasks that utilize an understanding of these models. Our focus is primarily on pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs, such as LLaMA family, which pose distinctive interpretability challenges due to their scale and complexity. In terms of existing methods, we classify them into local and global analyses, based on their explanatory objectives. When considering the utilization of explainability, we explore several compelling methods that concentrate on model editing, control generation, and model enhancement. Additionally, we examine representative evaluation metrics and datasets, elucidating their advantages and limitations. Our goal is to reconcile theoretical and empirical understanding with practical implementation, proposing exciting avenues for explanatory techniques and their applications in the LLMs era.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12874v2,2024-01
Improving Machine Translation with Human Feedback: An Exploration of Quality Estimation as a Reward Model,"Zhiwei He, Xing Wang, Wenxiang Jiao, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang, Shuming Shi, Zhaopeng Tu","Insufficient modeling of human preferences within the reward model is a major obstacle for leveraging human feedback to improve translation quality. Fortunately, quality estimation (QE), which predicts the quality of a given translation without reference, has achieved impressive alignment with human evaluations in the last two years. In this work, we investigate the potential of employing the QE model as the reward model to predict human preferences for feedback training. We first identify the overoptimization problem during QE-based feedback training, manifested as an increase in reward while translation quality declines. We examine the problem and argue that the vulnerability of the QE model might lead to high rewards for incorrect translations, resulting in overoptimization and error propagation. To address the problem, we adopt a simple yet effective method that uses heuristic rules to detect the incorrect translations and assigns a penalty term to the reward scores of them. Experimental results show that the proposed QE-based feedback training achieves consistent and significant improvements across various settings, further verified through human preference studies. Our subsequent analysis demonstrates the high data efficiency of the proposed QE-based feedback training: it outperforms systems using larger parallel corpora by a small amount of monolingual data.

KAM-CoT: Knowledge Augmented Multimodal Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning,"Debjyoti Mondal, Suraj Modi, Subhadarshi Panda, Rituraj Singh, Godawari Sudhakar Rao","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in natural language processing tasks by leveraging chain of thought (CoT) that enables step-by-step thinking. Extending LLMs with multimodal capabilities is the recent interest, but incurs computational cost and requires substantial hardware resources. To address these challenges, we propose KAM-CoT a framework that integrates CoT reasoning, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and multiple modalities for a comprehensive understanding of multimodal tasks. KAM-CoT adopts a two-stage training process with KG grounding to generate effective rationales and answers. By incorporating external knowledge from KGs during reasoning, the model gains a deeper contextual understanding reducing hallucinations and enhancing the quality of answers. This knowledge-augmented CoT reasoning empowers the model to handle questions requiring external context, providing more informed answers. Experimental findings show KAM-CoT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. On the ScienceQA dataset, we achieve an average accuracy of 93.87%, surpassing GPT-3.5 (75.17%) by 18% and GPT-4 (83.99%) by 10%. Remarkably, KAM-CoT achieves these results with only 280M trainable parameters at a time, demonstrating its cost-efficiency and effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12863v1,2024-01
Gradient Flow of Energy: A General and Efficient Approach for Entity Alignment Decoding,"Yuanyi Wang, Haifeng Sun, Jingyu Wang, Qi Qi, Shaoling Sun, Jianxin Liao","Entity alignment (EA), a pivotal process in integrating multi-source Knowledge Graphs (KGs), seeks to identify equivalent entity pairs across these graphs. Most existing approaches regard EA as a graph representation learning task, concentrating on enhancing graph encoders. However, the decoding process in EA - essential for effective operation and alignment accuracy - has received limited attention and remains tailored to specific datasets and model architectures, necessitating both entity and additional explicit relation embeddings. This specificity limits its applicability, particularly in GNN-based models. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, generalized, and efficient decoding approach for EA, relying solely on entity embeddings. Our method optimizes the decoding process by minimizing Dirichlet energy, leading to the gradient flow within the graph, to maximize graph homophily. The discretization of the gradient flow produces a fast and scalable approach, termed Triple Feature Propagation (TFP). TFP innovatively generalizes adjacency matrices to multi-views matrices:entity-to-entity, entity-to-relation, relation-to-entity, and relation-to-triple. The gradient flow through generalized matrices enables TFP to harness the multi-view structural information of KGs. Rigorous experimentation on diverse public datasets demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances various EA methods. Notably, the approach achieves these advancements with less than 6 seconds of additional computational time, establishing a new benchmark in efficiency and adaptability for future EA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12798v3,2024-01

However, current evaluation platforms, such as the widely recognized HuggingFace open LLM leaderboard, neglect a crucial aspect -- uncertainty, which is vital for thoroughly assessing LLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmarking approach for LLMs that integrates uncertainty quantification. Our examination involves nine LLMs (LLM series) spanning five representative natural language processing tasks. Our findings reveal that: I) LLMs with higher accuracy may exhibit lower certainty; II) Larger-scale LLMs may display greater uncertainty compared to their smaller counterparts; and III) Instruction-finetuning tends to increase the uncertainty of LLMs. These results underscore the significance of incorporating uncertainty in the evaluation of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12794v3,2024-01

What the Weight?! A Unified Framework for Zero-Shot Knowledge Composition,"Carolin Holtermann, Markus Frohmann, Navid Rekabsaz, Anne Lauscher","The knowledge encapsulated in a model is the core factor determining its final performance on downstream tasks. Much research in NLP has focused on efficient methods for storing and adapting different types of knowledge, e.g., in dedicated modularized structures, and on how to effectively combine these, e.g., by learning additional parameters. However, given the many possible options, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms involved in these compositions is missing, and hence it remains unclear which strategies to utilize. To address this research gap, we propose a novel framework for zero-shot module composition, which encompasses existing and some novel variations for selecting, weighting, and combining parameter modules under a single unified notion. Focusing on the scenario of domain knowledge and adapter layers, our framework provides a systematic unification of concepts, allowing us to conduct the first comprehensive benchmarking study of various zero-shot knowledge composition strategies. In particular, we test two module combination methods and five selection and weighting strategies for their effectiveness and efficiency in an extensive experimental setup. Our results highlight the efficacy of ensembling but also hint at the power of simple though often-ignored weighting methods. Further in-depth analyses allow us to understand the role of weighting vs. top-k selection, and show that, to a certain extent, the performance of adapter composition can even be predicted.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12756v2,2024-01
A Comprehensive View of the Biases of Toxicity and Sentiment Analysis Methods Towards Utterances with African American English Expressions,"Guilherme H. Resende, Luiz F. Nery, Fabrício Benevenuto, Savvas Zannettou, Flavio Figueiredo","Language is a dynamic aspect of our culture that changes when expressed in different technologies/communities. Online social networks have enabled the diffusion and evolution of different dialects, including African American English (AAE). However, this increased usage is not without barriers. One particular barrier is how sentiment (Vader, TextBlob, and Flair) and toxicity (Google's Perspective and the open-source Detoxify) methods present biases towards utterances with AAE expressions. Consider Google's Perspective to understand bias. Here, an utterance such as ``All n*ggers deserve to die respectfully. The police murder us.'' it reaches a higher toxicity than ``African-Americans deserve to die respectfully. The police murder us.''. This score difference likely arises because the tool cannot understand the re-appropriation of the term ``n*gger''. One explanation for this bias is that AI models are trained on limited datasets, and using such a term in training data is more likely to appear in a toxic utterance. While this may be plausible, the tool will make mistakes regardless. Here, we study bias on two Web-based (YouTube and Twitter) datasets and two spoken English datasets. Our analysis shows how most models present biases towards AAE in most settings. We isolate the impact of AAE expression usage via linguistic control features from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software, grammatical control features extracted via Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging from Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, and the semantic of utterances by comparing sentence embeddings from recent language models. We present consistent results on how a heavy usage of AAE expressions may cause the speaker to be considered substantially more toxic, even when speaking about nearly the same subject. Our study complements similar analyses focusing on small datasets and/or one method only.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12720v1,2024-01
Generating Zero-shot Abstractive Explanations for Rumour Verification,"Iman Munire Bilal, Preslav Nakov, Rob Procter, Maria Liakata","The task of rumour verification in social media concerns assessing the veracity of a claim on the basis of conversation threads that result from it. While previous work has focused on predicting a veracity label, here we reformulate the task to generate model-centric free-text explanations of a rumour's veracity. The approach is model agnostic in that it generalises to any model. Here we propose a novel GNN-based rumour verification model. We follow a zero-shot approach by first applying post-hoc explainability methods to score the most important posts within a thread and then we use these posts to generate informative explanations using opinion-guided summarisation. To evaluate the informativeness of the explanatory summaries, we exploit the few-shot learning capabilities of a large language model (LLM). Our experiments show that LLMs can have similar agreement to humans in evaluating summaries. Importantly, we show explanatory abstractive summaries are more informative and better reflect the predicted rumour veracity than just using the highest ranking posts in the thread.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12713v3,2024-01
Energy-based Automated Model Evaluation,"Ru Peng, Heming Zou, Haobo Wang, Yawen Zeng, Zenan Huang, Junbo Zhao","The conventional evaluation protocols on machine learning models rely heavily on a labeled, i.i.d-assumed testing dataset, which is not often present in real world applications. The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) shows an alternative to this traditional workflow, by forming a proximal prediction pipeline of the testing performance without the presence of ground-truth labels. Despite its recent successes, the AutoEval frameworks still suffer from an overconfidence issue, substantial storage and computational cost. In that regard, we propose a novel measure -- Meta-Distribution Energy (MDE) -- that allows the AutoEval framework to be both more efficient and effective. The core of the MDE is to establish a meta-distribution statistic, on the information (energy) associated with individual samples, then offer a smoother representation enabled by energy-based learning. We further provide our theoretical insights by connecting the MDE with the classification loss. We provide extensive experiments across modalities, datasets and different architectural backbones to validate MDE's validity, together with its superiority compared with prior approaches. We also prove MDE's versatility by showing its seamless integration with large-scale models, and easy adaption to learning scenarios with noisy- or imbalanced- labels.

This paper introduces a novel framework that combines graph-driven context retrieval in conjunction to knowledge graphs based enhancement, honing the proficiency of LLMs, especially in domain specific community question answering platforms like AskUbuntu, Unix, and ServerFault. We conduct experiments on various LLMs with different parameter sizes to evaluate their ability to ground knowledge and determine factual accuracy in answers to open-ended questions.

SLANG: New Concept Comprehension of Large Language Models,"Lingrui Mei, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Baolong Bi, Xueqi Cheng","The dynamic nature of language, particularly evident in the realm of slang and memes on the Internet, poses serious challenges to the adaptability of large language models (LLMs).

In pursuit of this goal, we introduce $\textbf{SLANG}$, a benchmark designed to autonomously integrate novel data and assess LLMs' ability to comprehend emerging concepts, alongside $\textbf{FOCUS}$, an approach uses causal inference to enhance LLMs to understand new phrases and their colloquial context. Our benchmark and approach involves understanding real-world instances of linguistic shifts, serving as contextual beacons, to form more precise and contextually relevant connections between newly emerging expressions and their meanings.

With LLMCheckup, we present an easily accessible tool that allows users to chat with any state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) about its behavior. We enable LLMs to generate explanations and perform user intent recognition without fine-tuning, by connecting them with a broad spectrum of Explainable AI (XAI) methods, including white-box explainability tools such as feature attributions, and self-explanations (e.g., for rationale generation). LLM-based (self-)explanations are presented as an interactive dialogue that supports follow-up questions and generates suggestions.

DREditor: An Time-efficient Approach for Building a Domain-specific Dense Retrieval Model,"Chen Huang, Duanyu Feng, Wenqiang Lei, Jiancheng Lv","Deploying dense retrieval models efficiently is becoming increasingly important across various industries. This is especially true for enterprise search services, where customizing search engines to meet the time demands of different enterprises in different domains is crucial. Motivated by this, we develop a time-efficient approach called DREditor to edit the matching rule of an off-the-shelf dense retrieval model to suit a specific domain. This is achieved by directly calibrating the output embeddings of the model using an efficient and effective linear mapping. This mapping is powered by an edit operator that is obtained by solving a specially constructed least squares problem. Compared to implicit rule modification via long-time finetuning, our experimental results show that DREditor provides significant advantages on different domain-specific datasets, dataset sources, retrieval models, and computing devices. It consistently enhances time efficiency by 100-300 times while maintaining comparable or even superior retrieval performance. In a broader context, we take the first step to introduce a novel embedding calibration approach for the retrieval task, filling the technical blank in the current field of embedding calibration. This approach also paves the way for building domain-specific dense retrieval models efficiently and inexpensively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12540v1,2024-01
BiTA: Bi-Directional Tuning for Lossless Acceleration in Large Language Models,"Feng Lin, Hanling Yi, Hongbin Li, Yifan Yang, Xiaotian Yu, Guangming Lu, Rong Xiao","Large language models (LLMs) commonly employ autoregressive generation during inference, leading to high memory bandwidth demand and consequently extended latency. To mitigate this inefficiency, we present Bi-directional Tuning for lossless Acceleration (BiTA), an innovative method expediting LLMs via streamlined semi-autoregressive generation and draft verification. Inspired by the concept of prompt tuning, we enhance LLMs with a parameter-efficient design called bi-directional tuning for the capability in semi-autoregressive generation. Employing efficient tree-based decoding, the models perform draft candidate generation and verification in parallel, ensuring outputs identical to their autoregressive counterparts under greedy sampling. BiTA serves as a lightweight plug-in module, seamlessly boosting the inference efficiency of existing LLMs without requiring additional assistance models or incurring significant extra memory costs. Applying the proposed BiTA, LLaMA-2-70B-Chat achieves a 2.7$\times$ speedup on the MT-Bench benchmark. Extensive experiments confirm our method surpasses state-of-the-art acceleration techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12522v2,2024-01
Key Information Retrieval to Classify the Unstructured Data Content of Preferential Trade Agreements,"Jiahui Zhao, Ziyi Meng, Stepan Gordeev, Zijie Pan, Dongjin Song, Sandro Steinbach, Caiwen Ding","With the rapid proliferation of textual data, predicting long texts has emerged as a significant challenge in the domain of natural language processing. Traditional text prediction methods encounter substantial difficulties when grappling with long texts, primarily due to the presence of redundant and irrelevant information, which impedes the model's capacity to capture pivotal insights from the text. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach to long-text classification and prediction. Initially, we employ embedding techniques to condense the long texts, aiming to diminish the redundancy therein. Subsequently,the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) embedding method is utilized for text classification training. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method realizes considerable performance enhancements in classifying long texts of Preferential Trade Agreements. Furthermore, the condensation of text through embedding methods not only augments prediction accuracy but also substantially reduces computational complexity. Overall, this paper presents a strategy for long-text prediction, offering a valuable reference for researchers and engineers in the natural language processing sphere.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12520v1,2024-01
"Comparing Pre-trained Human Language Models: Is it Better with Human Context as Groups, Individual Traits, or Both?","Nikita Soni, Niranjan Balasubramanian, H. Andrew Schwartz, Dirk Hovy","Pre-trained language models consider the context of neighboring words and documents but lack any author context of the human generating the text. However, language depends on the author's states, traits, social, situational, and environmental attributes, collectively referred to as human context (Soni et al., 2024). Human-centered natural language processing requires incorporating human context into language models. Currently, two methods exist: pre-training with 1) group-wise attributes (e.g., over-45-year-olds) or 2) individual traits. Group attributes are simple but coarse -- not all 45-year-olds write the same way -- while individual traits allow for more personalized representations, but require more complex modeling and data. It is unclear which approach benefits what tasks. We compare pre-training models with human context via 1) group attributes, 2) individual users, and 3) a combined approach on five user- and document-level tasks. Our results show that there is no best approach, but that human-centered language modeling holds avenues for different methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12492v3,2024-01
Assessing and Understanding Creativity in Large Language Models,"Yunpu Zhao, Rui Zhang, Wenyi Li, Di Huang, Jiaming Guo, Shaohui Peng, Yifan Hao, Yuanbo Wen, Xing Hu, Zidong Du, Qi Guo, Ling Li, Yunji Chen","In the field of natural language processing, the rapid development of large language model (LLM) has attracted more and more attention. LLMs have shown a high level of creativity in various tasks, but the methods for assessing such creativity are inadequate. The assessment of LLM creativity needs to consider differences from humans, requiring multi-dimensional measurement while balancing accuracy and efficiency. This paper aims to establish an efficient framework for assessing the level of creativity in LLMs. By adapting the modified Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, the research evaluates the creative performance of various LLMs across 7 tasks, emphasizing 4 criteria including Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration. In this context, we develop a comprehensive dataset of 700 questions for testing and an LLM-based evaluation method. In addition, this study presents a novel analysis of LLMs' responses to diverse prompts and role-play situations. We found that the creativity of LLMs primarily falls short in originality, while excelling in elaboration. Besides, the use of prompts and the role-play settings of the model significantly influence creativity. Additionally, the experimental results also indicate that collaboration among multiple LLMs can enhance originality. Notably, our findings reveal a consensus between human evaluations and LLMs regarding the personality traits that influence creativity. The findings underscore the significant impact of LLM design on creativity and bridges artificial intelligence and human creativity, offering insights into LLMs' creativity and potential applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12491v1,2024-01
Large Language Models are Superpositions of All Characters: Attaining Arbitrary Role-play via Self-Alignment,"Keming Lu, Bowen Yu, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou","Considerable efforts have been invested in augmenting the role-playing proficiency of open-source large language models (LLMs) by emulating proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless, we posit that LLMs inherently harbor role-play capabilities, owing to the extensive knowledge of characters and potential dialogues ingrained in their vast training corpora. Thus, in this study, we introduce Ditto, a self-alignment method for role-play. Ditto capitalizes on character knowledge, encouraging an instruction-following LLM to simulate role-play dialogues as a variant of reading comprehension. This method creates a role-play training set comprising 4,000 characters, surpassing the scale of currently available datasets by tenfold regarding the number of roles. Subsequently, we fine-tune the LLM using this self-generated dataset to augment its role-playing capabilities. Upon evaluating our meticulously constructed and reproducible role-play benchmark and the roleplay subset of MT-Bench, Ditto, in various parameter scales, consistently maintains a consistent role identity and provides accurate role-specific knowledge in multi-turn role-play conversations. Notably, it outperforms all open-source role-play baselines, showcasing performance levels comparable to advanced proprietary chatbots. Furthermore, we present the first comprehensive cross-supervision alignment experiment in the role-play domain, revealing that the intrinsic capabilities of LLMs confine the knowledge within role-play. Meanwhile, the role-play styles can be easily acquired with the guidance of smaller models. We open-source related resources at https://github.com/OFA-Sys/Ditto.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12474v1,2024-01

Fast Adversarial Training against Textual Adversarial Attacks,"Yichen Yang, Xin Liu, Kun He","Many adversarial defense methods have been proposed to enhance the adversarial robustness of natural language processing models. However, most of them introduce additional pre-set linguistic knowledge and assume that the synonym candidates used by attackers are accessible, which is an ideal assumption. We delve into adversarial training in the embedding space and propose a Fast Adversarial Training (FAT) method to improve the model robustness in the synonym-unaware scenario from the perspective of single-step perturbation generation and perturbation initialization. Based on the observation that the adversarial perturbations crafted by single-step and multi-step gradient ascent are similar, FAT uses single-step gradient ascent to craft adversarial examples in the embedding space to expedite the training process. Based on the observation that the perturbations generated on the identical training sample in successive epochs are similar, FAT fully utilizes historical information when initializing the perturbation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAT significantly boosts the robustness of BERT models in the synonym-unaware scenario, and outperforms the defense baselines under various attacks with character-level and word-level modifications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12461v1,2024-01
CIM-MLC: A Multi-level Compilation Stack for Computing-In-Memory Accelerators,"Songyun Qu, Shixin Zhao, Bing Li, Yintao He, Xuyi Cai, Lei Zhang, Ying Wang","In recent years, various computing-in-memory (CIM) processors have been presented, showing superior performance over traditional architectures. To unleash the potential of various CIM architectures, such as device precision, crossbar size, and crossbar number, it is necessary to develop compilation tools that are fully aware of the CIM architectural details and implementation diversity. However, due to the lack of architectural support in current popular open-source compiling stacks, existing CIM designs either manually deploy networks or build their own compilers, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although some works expose the specific CIM device programming interfaces to compilers, they are often bound to a fixed CIM architecture, lacking the flexibility to support the CIM architectures with different computing granularity. On the other hand, existing compilation works usually consider the scheduling of limited operation types (such as crossbar-bound matrix-vector multiplication). Unlike conventional processors, CIM accelerators are featured by their diverse architecture, circuit, and device, which cannot be simply abstracted by a single level if we seek to fully explore the advantages brought by CIM. Therefore, we propose CIM-MLC, a universal multi-level compilation framework for general CIM architectures. We first establish a general hardware abstraction for CIM architectures and computing modes to represent various CIM accelerators. Based on the proposed abstraction, CIM-MLC can compile tasks onto a wide range of CIM accelerators having different devices, architectures, and programming interfaces. More importantly, compared with existing compilation work, CIM-MLC can explore the mapping and scheduling strategies across multiple architectural tiers, which form a tractable yet effective design space, to achieve better scheduling and instruction generation results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12428v2,2024-01
The Neglected Tails in Vision-Language Models,"Shubham Parashar, Zhiqiu Lin, Tian Liu, Xiangjue Dong, Yanan Li, Deva Ramanan, James Caverlee, Shu Kong","Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in zero-shot recognition but their performance varies greatly across different visual concepts. For example, although CLIP achieves impressive accuracy on ImageNet (60-80%), its performance drops below 10% for more than ten concepts like night snake, presumably due to their limited presence in the pretraining data. However, measuring the frequency of concepts in VLMs' large-scale datasets is challenging. We address this by using large language models (LLMs) to count the number of pretraining texts that contain synonyms of these concepts. Our analysis confirms that popular datasets, such as LAION, exhibit a long-tailed concept distribution, yielding biased performance in VLMs. We also find that downstream applications of VLMs, including visual chatbots (e.g., GPT-4V) and text-to-image models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), often fail to recognize or generate images of rare concepts identified by our method. To mitigate the imbalanced performance of zero-shot VLMs, we propose REtrieval-Augmented Learning (REAL). First, instead of prompting VLMs using the original class names, REAL uses their most frequent synonyms found in pretraining texts. This simple change already outperforms costly human-engineered and LLM-enriched prompts over nine benchmark datasets. Second, REAL trains a linear classifier on a small yet balanced set of pretraining data retrieved using concept synonyms. REAL surpasses the previous zero-shot SOTA, using 400x less storage and 10,000x less training time!",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12425v3,2024-01
How Far Can 100 Samples Go? Unlocking Overall Zero-Shot Multilingual Translation via Tiny Multi-Parallel Data,"Di Wu, Shaomu Tan, Yan Meng, David Stap, Christof Monz","Zero-shot translation aims to translate between language pairs not seen during training in Multilingual Machine Translation (MMT) and is largely considered an open problem. A common, albeit resource-consuming, solution is to add as many related translation directions as possible to the training corpus. In this paper, we show that for an English-centric model, surprisingly large zero-shot improvements can be achieved by simply fine-tuning with a very small amount of multi-parallel data. For example, on the EC30 dataset, we obtain up to +21.7 ChrF non-English overall improvements (870 directions) by using only 100 multi-parallel samples while preserving English-centric translation quality. When investigating the size effect of fine-tuning data and its transfer capabilities, we found that already a small, randomly sampled set of fine-tuning directions is sufficient to achieve comparable improvements. The resulting non-English performance is close to the complete translation upper bound. Even in a minimal setting -- fine-tuning with only one single sample -- the well-known off-target issue is almost completely resolved, explaining parts -- but not all -- of the observed improvements in translation quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12413v2,2024-01
Enhancing In-context Learning via Linear Probe Calibration,"Momin Abbas, Yi Zhou, Parikshit Ram, Nathalie Baracaldo, Horst Samulowitz, Theodoros Salonidis, Tianyi Chen","In-context learning (ICL) is a new paradigm for natural language processing that utilizes Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-like models. This approach uses prompts that include in-context demonstrations to generate the corresponding output for a new query input. However, applying ICL in real cases does not scale with the number of samples, and lacks robustness to different prompt templates and demonstration permutations. In this paper, we first show that GPT-like models using ICL result in unreliable predictions based on a new metric based on Shannon entropy. Then, to solve this problem, we propose a new technique called the Linear Probe Calibration (LinC), a method that calibrates the model's output probabilities, resulting in reliable predictions and improved performance, while requiring only minimal additional samples (as few as five labeled data samples). LinC significantly enhances the ICL test performance of GPT models on various benchmark datasets, with an average improvement of up to 21%, and up to a 50% improvement in some cases, and significantly boosts the performance of PEFT methods, especially in the low resource regime. Moreover, LinC achieves lower expected calibration error, and is highly robust to varying label proportions, prompt templates, and demonstration permutations.

Development of an NLP-driven computer-based test guide for visually impaired students,"Tubo Faustinah Nemieboka, Ikechukwu E. Onyenwe, Doris C. Asogwa","In recent years, advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have revolutionized the field of accessibility and exclusivity of testing, particularly for visually impaired students (VIS). CBT has shown in years back its relevance in terms of administering exams electronically, making the test process easier, providing quicker and more accurate results, and offering greater flexibility and accessibility for candidates. Yet, its relevance was not felt by the visually impaired students as they cannot access printed documents. Hence, in this paper, we present an NLP-driven Computer-Based Test guide for visually impaired students. It employs a speech technology pre-trained methods to provide real-time assistance and support to visually impaired students. The system utilizes NLP technologies to convert the text-based questions and the associated options in a machine-readable format. Subsequently, the speech technology pre-trained model processes the converted text enabling the VIS to comprehend and analyze the content. Furthermore, we validated that this pre-trained model is not perverse by testing for accuracy using sample audio datasets labels (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) to compare with the voice recordings obtained from 20 VIS which is been predicted by the system to attain values for precision, recall, and F1-scores. These metrics are used to assess the performance of the pre-trained model and have indicated that it is proficient enough to give its better performance to the evaluated system.

This paper focuses on Subtask A & B. Each subtask is supported by three datasets for training, development, and testing. To tackle this task, two methods: 1) using traditional machine learning (ML) with natural language preprocessing (NLP) for feature extraction, and 2) fine-tuning LLMs for text classification.

Cheap Learning: Maximising Performance of Language Models for Social Data Science Using Minimal Data,"Leonardo Castro-Gonzalez, Yi-Ling Chung, Hannak Rose Kirk, John Francis, Angus R. Williams, Pica Johansson, Jonathan Bright","The field of machine learning has recently made significant progress in reducing the requirements for labelled training data when building new models. These `cheaper' learning techniques hold significant potential for the social sciences, where development of large labelled training datasets is often a significant practical impediment to the use of machine learning for analytical tasks. In this article we review three `cheap' techniques that have developed in recent years: weak supervision, transfer learning and prompt engineering. For the latter, we also review the particular case of zero-shot prompting of large language models. For each technique we provide a guide of how it works and demonstrate its application across six different realistic social science applications (two different tasks paired with three different dataset makeups). We show good performance for all techniques, and in particular we demonstrate how prompting of large language models can achieve high accuracy at very low cost. Our results are accompanied by a code repository to make it easy for others to duplicate our work and use it in their own research.

GRATH: Gradual Self-Truthifying for Large Language Models,"Weixin Chen, Dawn Song, Bo Li","Truthfulness is paramount for large language models (LLMs) as they are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. However, existing LLMs still struggle with generating truthful content, as evidenced by their modest performance on benchmarks like TruthfulQA. To address this issue, we propose GRAdual self-truTHifying (GRATH), a novel post-processing method to enhance truthfulness of LLMs. GRATH utilizes out-of-domain question prompts to generate pairwise truthfulness training data with each pair containing a question and its correct and incorrect answers, and then optimizes the model via direct preference optimization (DPO) to learn from the truthfulness difference between answer pairs. GRATH iteratively refines truthfulness data and updates the model, leading to a gradual improvement in model truthfulness in a self-supervised manner. Empirically, we evaluate GRATH using different 7B-LLMs and compare with LLMs with similar or even larger sizes on benchmark datasets. Our results show that GRATH effectively improves LLMs' truthfulness without compromising other core capabilities. Notably, GRATH achieves state-of-the-art performance on TruthfulQA, with MC1 accuracy of 54.71% and MC2 accuracy of 69.10%, which even surpass those on 70B-LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12292v2,2024-01

This scale of radiological studies provides a significant opportunity to streamline CXR interpretation and documentation. While foundation models are a promising solution, the lack of publicly available large-scale datasets and benchmarks inhibits their iterative development and real-world evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we constructed a large-scale dataset (CheXinstruct), which we utilized to train a vision-language foundation model (CheXagent). We systematically demonstrated competitive performance across eight distinct task types on our novel evaluation benchmark (CheXbench). Beyond technical validation, we assessed the real-world utility of CheXagent in directly drafting radiology reports. Our clinical assessment with eight radiologists revealed a 36% time saving for residents using CheXagent-drafted reports, while attending radiologists showed no significant time difference editing resident-drafted or CheXagent-drafted reports. The CheXagent-drafted reports improved the writing efficiency of both radiology residents and attending radiologists in 81% and 61% of cases, respectively, without loss of quality.

APT: Adaptive Pruning and Tuning Pretrained Language Models for Efficient Training and Inference,"Bowen Zhao, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Qingqing Cao","Fine-tuning and inference with large Language Models (LM) are generally known to be expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning over pretrained LMs reduces training memory by updating a small number of LM parameters but does not improve inference efficiency. Structured pruning improves LM inference efficiency by removing consistent parameter blocks, yet often increases training memory and time. To improve both training and inference efficiency, we introduce APT that adaptively prunes and tunes parameters for the LMs. At the early stage of fine-tuning, APT dynamically adds salient tuning parameters for fast and accurate convergence while discarding unimportant parameters for efficiency. Compared to baselines, our experiments show that APT maintains up to 98% task performance when pruning RoBERTa and T5 models with 40% parameters left while keeping 86.4% LLaMA models' performance with 70% parameters remained. Furthermore, APT speeds up LMs fine-tuning by up to 8x and reduces large LMs memory training footprint by up to 70%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12200v2,2024-01
Text Embedding Inversion Security for Multilingual Language Models,"Yiyi Chen, Heather Lent, Johannes Bjerva","Textual data is often represented as real-numbered embeddings in NLP, particularly with the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and Embeddings as a Service (EaaS). However, storing sensitive information as embeddings can be susceptible to security breaches, as research shows that text can be reconstructed from embeddings, even without knowledge of the underlying model. While defence mechanisms have been explored, these are exclusively focused on English, leaving other languages potentially exposed to attacks. This work explores LLM security through multilingual embedding inversion. We define the problem of black-box multilingual and cross-lingual inversion attacks, and explore their potential implications. Our findings suggest that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to inversion attacks, in part because English-based defences may be ineffective. To alleviate this, we propose a simple masking defense effective for both monolingual and multilingual models. This study is the first to investigate multilingual inversion attacks, shedding light on the differences in attacks and defenses across monolingual and multilingual settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12192v4,2024-01
WARM: On the Benefits of Weight Averaged Reward Models,"Alexandre Ramé, Nino Vieillard, Léonard Hussenot, Robert Dadashi, Geoffrey Cideron, Olivier Bachem, Johan Ferret","Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RLHF) can lead to reward hacking, where LLMs exploit failures in the reward model (RM) to achieve seemingly high rewards without meeting the underlying objectives. We identify two primary challenges when designing RMs to mitigate reward hacking: distribution shifts during the RL process and inconsistencies in human preferences. As a solution, we propose Weight Averaged Reward Models (WARM), first fine-tuning multiple RMs, then averaging them in the weight space. This strategy follows the observation that fine-tuned weights remain linearly mode connected when sharing the same pre-training. By averaging weights, WARM improves efficiency compared to the traditional ensembling of predictions, while improving reliability under distribution shifts and robustness to preference inconsistencies. Our experiments on summarization tasks, using best-of-N and RL methods, shows that WARM improves the overall quality and alignment of LLM predictions; for example, a policy RL fine-tuned with WARM has a 79.4% win rate against a policy RL fine-tuned with a single RM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12187v1,2024-01
Universal Neurons in GPT2 Language Models,"Wes Gurnee, Theo Horsley, Zifan Carl Guo, Tara Rezaei Kheirkhah, Qinyi Sun, Will Hathaway, Neel Nanda, Dimitris Bertsimas","A basic question within the emerging field of mechanistic interpretability is the degree to which neural networks learn the same underlying mechanisms. In other words, are neural mechanisms universal across different models? In this work, we study the universality of individual neurons across GPT2 models trained from different initial random seeds, motivated by the hypothesis that universal neurons are likely to be interpretable. In particular, we compute pairwise correlations of neuron activations over 100 million tokens for every neuron pair across five different seeds and find that 1-5\% of neurons are universal, that is, pairs of neurons which consistently activate on the same inputs. We then study these universal neurons in detail, finding that they usually have clear interpretations and taxonomize them into a small number of neuron families. We conclude by studying patterns in neuron weights to establish several universal functional roles of neurons in simple circuits: deactivating attention heads, changing the entropy of the next token distribution, and predicting the next token to (not) be within a particular set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12181v1,2024-01
In-Context Learning for Extreme Multi-Label Classification,"Karel D'Oosterlinck, Omar Khattab, François Remy, Thomas Demeester, Chris Develder, Christopher Potts","Multi-label classification problems with thousands of classes are hard to solve with in-context learning alone, as language models (LMs) might lack prior knowledge about the precise classes or how to assign them, and it is generally infeasible to demonstrate every class in a prompt. We propose a general program, $\texttt{Infer--Retrieve--Rank}$, that defines multi-step interactions between LMs and retrievers to efficiently tackle such problems. We implement this program using the $\texttt{DSPy}$ programming model, which specifies in-context systems in a declarative manner, and use $\texttt{DSPy}$ optimizers to tune it towards specific datasets by bootstrapping only tens of few-shot examples. Our primary extreme classification program, optimized separately for each task, attains state-of-the-art results across three benchmarks (HOUSE, TECH, TECHWOLF). We apply the same program to a benchmark with vastly different characteristics and attain competitive performance as well (BioDEX).

SpatialVLM: Endowing Vision-Language Models with Spatial Reasoning Capabilities,"Boyuan Chen, Zhuo Xu, Sean Kirmani, Brian Ichter, Danny Driess, Pete Florence, Dorsa Sadigh, Leonidas Guibas, Fei Xia","Understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. While Vision Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in certain VQA benchmarks, they still lack capabilities in 3D spatial reasoning, such as recognizing quantitative relationships of physical objects like distances or size differences. We hypothesize that VLMs' limited spatial reasoning capability is due to the lack of 3D spatial knowledge in training data and aim to solve this problem by training VLMs with Internet-scale spatial reasoning data. To this end, we present a system to facilitate this approach. We first develop an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that scales up to 2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images. We then investigate various factors in the training recipe, including data quality, training pipeline, and VLM architecture. Our work features the first internet-scale 3D spatial reasoning dataset in metric space. By training a VLM on such data, we significantly enhance its ability on both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA. Finally, we demonstrate that this VLM unlocks novel downstream applications in chain-of-thought spatial reasoning and robotics due to its quantitative estimation capability.

Anisotropy Is Inherent to Self-Attention in Transformers,"Nathan Godey, Éric de la Clergerie, Benoît Sagot","The representation degeneration problem is a phenomenon that is widely observed among self-supervised learning methods based on Transformers. In NLP, it takes the form of anisotropy, a singular property of hidden representations which makes them unexpectedly close to each other in terms of angular distance (cosine-similarity). Some recent works tend to show that anisotropy is a consequence of optimizing the cross-entropy loss on long-tailed distributions of tokens. We show in this paper that anisotropy can also be observed empirically in language models with specific objectives that should not suffer directly from the same consequences. We also show that the anisotropy problem extends to Transformers trained on other modalities. Our observations suggest that anisotropy is actually inherent to Transformers-based models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12143v2,2024-01

We scrutinize five major threats--prompt injection, jailbreaking, Personal Identifiable Information (PII) exposure, sexually explicit content, and hate-based content--going beyond mere identification to assess their critical ethical consequences and the urgency they create for robust defensive strategies. The escalating reliance on LLMs underscores the crucial need for ensuring these systems operate within the bounds of ethical norms, particularly as their misuse can lead to significant societal and individual harm. We propose conceptualizing and developing an evaluative tool tailored for LLMs, which would serve a dual purpose: guiding developers and designers in preemptive fortification of backend systems and scrutinizing the ethical dimensions of LLM chatbot responses during the testing phase. By comparing LLM responses with those expected from humans in a moral context, we aim to discern the degree to which AI behaviors align with the ethical values held by a broader society. Ultimately, this paper not only underscores the ethical troubles presented by LLMs; it also highlights a path toward cultivating trust in these systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12273v2,2024-01
The Curious Case of Nonverbal Abstract Reasoning with Multi-Modal Large Language Models,"Kian Ahrabian, Zhivar Sourati, Kexuan Sun, Jiarui Zhang, Yifan Jiang, Fred Morstatter, Jay Pujara","While large language models (LLMs) are still being adopted to new domains and utilized in novel applications, we are experiencing an influx of the new generation of foundation models, namely multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). These models integrate verbal and visual information, opening new possibilities to demonstrate more complex reasoning abilities at the intersection of the two modalities. However, despite the revolutionizing prospect of MLLMs, our understanding of their reasoning abilities is limited. In this study, we assess the nonverbal abstract reasoning abilities of open-source and closed-source MLLMs using variations of Raven's Progressive Matrices. Our experiments reveal the challenging nature of such problems for MLLMs while showcasing the immense gap between open-source and closed-source models. We also uncover critical shortcomings of visual and textual perceptions, subjecting the models to low-performance ceilings. Finally, to improve MLLMs' performance, we experiment with different methods, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting, leading to a significant (up to 100%) boost in performance. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/isi-mmlm-rpm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12117v3,2024-01
An Empirical Study of In-context Learning in LLMs for Machine Translation,"Pranjal A. Chitale, Jay Gala, Raj Dabre","Recent interest has surged in employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for machine translation (MT) via in-context learning (ICL) (Vilar et al., 2023). Most prior studies primarily focus on optimizing translation quality, with limited attention to understanding the specific aspects of ICL that influence the said quality. To this end, we perform the first of its kind, an exhaustive study of in-context learning for machine translation. We first establish that ICL is primarily example-driven and not instruction-driven. Following this, we conduct an extensive exploration of various aspects of the examples to understand their influence on downstream performance. Our analysis includes factors such as quality and quantity of demonstrations, spatial proximity, and source versus target originality. Further, we also investigate challenging scenarios involving indirectness and misalignment of examples to understand the limits of ICL. While we establish the significance of the quality of the target distribution over the source distribution of demonstrations, we further observe that perturbations sometimes act as regularizers, resulting in performance improvements. Surprisingly, ICL does not necessitate examples from the same task, and a related task with the same target distribution proves sufficient. We hope that our study acts as a guiding resource for considerations in utilizing ICL for MT. Our code is available on https://github.com/PranjalChitale/in-context-mt-analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12097v3,2024-01
Unsupervised Learning of Graph from Recipes,"Aissatou Diallo, Antonis Bikakis, Luke Dickens, Anthony Hunter, Rob Miller","Cooking recipes are one of the most readily available kinds of procedural text. They consist of natural language instructions that can be challenging to interpret. In this paper, we propose a model to identify relevant information from recipes and generate a graph to represent the sequence of actions in the recipe. In contrast with other approaches, we use an unsupervised approach. We iteratively learn the graph structure and the parameters of a $\mathsf{GNN}$ encoding the texts (text-to-graph) one sequence at a time while providing the supervision by decoding the graph into text (graph-to-text) and comparing the generated text to the input. We evaluate the approach by comparing the identified entities with annotated datasets, comparing the difference between the input and output texts, and comparing our generated graphs with those generated by state of the art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12088v1,2024-01
Revisiting Demonstration Selection Strategies in In-Context Learning,"Keqin Peng, Liang Ding, Yancheng Yuan, Xuebo Liu, Min Zhang, Yuanxin Ouyang, Dacheng Tao","Large language models (LLMs) have shown an impressive ability to perform a wide range of tasks using in-context learning (ICL), where a few examples are used to describe a task to the model. However, the performance of ICL varies significantly with the choice of demonstrations, and it is still unclear why this happens or what factors will influence its choice. In this work, we first revisit the factors contributing to this variance from both data and model aspects, and find that the choice of demonstration is both data- and model-dependent. We further proposed a data- and model-dependent demonstration selection method, \textbf{TopK + ConE}, based on the assumption that \textit{the performance of a demonstration positively correlates with its contribution to the model's understanding of the test samples}, resulting in a simple and effective recipe for ICL. Empirically, our method yields consistent improvements in both language understanding and generation tasks with different model scales. Further analyses confirm that, besides the generality and stability under different circumstances, our method provides a unified explanation for the effectiveness of previous methods. Code will be released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12087v2,2024-01
West-of-N: Synthetic Preferences for Self-Improving Reward Models,"Alizée Pace, Jonathan Mallinson, Eric Malmi, Sebastian Krause, Aliaksei Severyn","The success of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in language model alignment is strongly dependent on the quality of the underlying reward model. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improve reward model quality by generating synthetic preference data, thereby augmenting the training dataset with on-policy, high-quality preference pairs. Motivated by the promising results of Best-of-N sampling strategies in language model training, we extend their application to reward model training. This results in a self-training strategy to generate preference pairs by selecting the best and worst candidates in a pool of responses to a given query. Empirically, we find that this approach improves the performance of any reward model, with an effect comparable to the addition of a similar quantity of human preference data. This work opens up new avenues of research for improving RLHF for language model alignment, by offering synthetic preference generation as a solution to reward modeling challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12086v2,2024-01
Temporal Blind Spots in Large Language Models,"Jonas Wallat, Adam Jatowt, Avishek Anand","Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their unparalleled ability to perform various natural language processing tasks. These models, benefiting from their advanced natural language understanding capabilities, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance. However, the pre-training data utilized in LLMs is often confined to a specific corpus, resulting in inherent freshness and temporal scope limitations. Consequently, this raises concerns regarding the effectiveness of LLMs for tasks involving temporal intents. In this study, we aim to investigate the underlying limitations of general-purpose LLMs when deployed for tasks that require a temporal understanding. We pay particular attention to handling factual temporal knowledge through three popular temporal QA datasets. Specifically, we observe low performance on detailed questions about the past and, surprisingly, for rather new information. In manual and automatic testing, we find multiple temporal errors and characterize the conditions under which QA performance deteriorates. Our analysis contributes to understanding LLM limitations and offers valuable insights into developing future models that can better cater to the demands of temporally-oriented tasks.

Cross-lingual Transfer Learning for Javanese Dependency Parsing,"Fadli Aulawi Al Ghiffari, Ika Alfina, Kurniawati Azizah","While structure learning achieves remarkable performance in high-resource languages, the situation differs for under-represented languages due to the scarcity of annotated data. This study focuses on assessing the efficacy of transfer learning in enhancing dependency parsing for Javanese, a language spoken by 80 million individuals but characterized by limited representation in natural language processing. We utilized the Universal Dependencies dataset consisting of dependency treebanks from more than 100 languages, including Javanese. We propose two learning strategies to train the model: transfer learning (TL) and hierarchical transfer learning (HTL). While TL only uses a source language to pre-train the model, the HTL method uses a source language and an intermediate language in the learning process. The results show that our best model uses the HTL method, which improves performance with an increase of 10% for both UAS and LAS evaluations compared to the baseline model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12072v1,2024-01
Spotting LLMs With Binoculars: Zero-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text,"Abhimanyu Hans, Avi Schwarzschild, Valeriia Cherepanova, Hamid Kazemi, Aniruddha Saha, Micah Goldblum, Jonas Geiping, Tom Goldstein","Detecting text generated by modern large language models is thought to be hard, as both LLMs and humans can exhibit a wide range of complex behaviors. However, we find that a score based on contrasting two closely related language models is highly accurate at separating human-generated and machine-generated text. Based on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only requires simple calculations using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method, called Binoculars, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without any training data. It is capable of spotting machine text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively evaluate Binoculars on a number of text sources and in varied situations. Over a wide range of document types, Binoculars detects over 90% of generated samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite not being trained on any ChatGPT data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12070v3,2024-01
ALMs: Authorial Language Models for Authorship Attribution,"Weihang Huang, Akira Murakami, Jack Grieve","In this paper, we introduce an authorship attribution method called Authorial Language Models (ALMs) that involves identifying the most likely author of a questioned document based on the perplexity of the questioned document calculated for a set of causal language models fine-tuned on the writings of a set of candidate author. We benchmarked ALMs against state-of-art-systems using the CCAT50 dataset and the Blogs50 datasets. We find that ALMs achieves a macro-average accuracy score of 83.6% on Blogs50, outperforming all other methods, and 74.9% on CCAT50, matching the performance of the best method. To assess the performance of ALMs on shorter texts, we also conducted text ablation testing. We found that to reach a macro-average accuracy of 70%, ALMs needs 40 tokens on Blogs50 and 400 tokens on CCAT50, while to reach 60% ALMs requires 20 tokens on Blogs50 and 70 tokens on CCAT50.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12005v2,2024-01

Synergizing Machine Learning & Symbolic Methods: A Survey on Hybrid Approaches to Natural Language Processing,"Rrubaa Panchendrarajan, Arkaitz Zubiaga","The advancement of machine learning and symbolic approaches have underscored their strengths and weaknesses in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While machine learning approaches are powerful in identifying patterns in data, they often fall short in learning commonsense and the factual knowledge required for the NLP tasks. Meanwhile, the symbolic methods excel in representing knowledge-rich data. However, they struggle to adapt dynamic data and generalize the knowledge. Bridging these two paradigms through hybrid approaches enables the alleviation of weaknesses in both while preserving their strengths. Recent studies extol the virtues of this union, showcasing promising results in a wide range of NLP tasks. In this paper, we present an overview of hybrid approaches used for NLP. Specifically, we delve into the state-of-the-art hybrid approaches used for a broad spectrum of NLP tasks requiring natural language understanding, generation, and reasoning.

"Claim Detection for Automated Fact-checking: A Survey on Monolingual, Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Research","Rrubaa Panchendrarajan, Arkaitz Zubiaga","Automated fact-checking has drawn considerable attention over the past few decades due to the increase in the diffusion of misinformation on online platforms. This is often carried out as a sequence of tasks comprising (i) the detection of sentences circulating in online platforms which constitute claims needing verification, followed by (ii) the verification process of those claims. This survey focuses on the former, by discussing existing efforts towards detecting claims needing fact-checking, with a particular focus on multilingual data and methods. This is a challenging and fertile direction where existing methods are yet far from matching human performance due to the profoundly challenging nature of the issue. Especially, the dissemination of information across multiple social platforms, articulated in multiple languages and modalities demands more generalized solutions for combating misinformation. Focusing on multilingual misinformation, we present a comprehensive survey of existing multilingual claim detection research. We present state-of-the-art multilingual claim detection research categorized into three key factors of the problem, verifiability, priority, and similarity.

Blinded by Generated Contexts: How Language Models Merge Generated and Retrieved Contexts When Knowledge Conflicts?,"Hexiang Tan, Fei Sun, Wanli Yang, Yuanzhuo Wang, Qi Cao, Xueqi Cheng","While auxiliary information has become a key to enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), relatively little is known about how LLMs merge these contexts, specifically contexts generated by LLMs and those retrieved from external sources. To investigate this, we formulate a systematic framework to identify whether LLMs' responses are attributed to either generated or retrieved contexts. To easily trace the origin of the response, we construct datasets with conflicting contexts, i.e., each question is paired with both generated and retrieved contexts, yet only one of them contains the correct answer. Our experiments reveal a significant bias in several LLMs (GPT-4/3.5 and Llama2) to favor generated contexts, even when they provide incorrect information. We further identify two key factors contributing to this bias: i) contexts generated by LLMs typically show greater similarity to the questions, increasing their likelihood of being selected; ii) the segmentation process used in retrieved contexts disrupts their completeness, thereby hindering their full utilization in LLMs. Our analysis enhances the understanding of how LLMs merge diverse contexts, offers valuable insights for advancing current LLM augmentation methods, and highlights the risk of generated misinformation for retrieval-augmented LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11911v6,2024-01

However, the potential misuse of this intelligence for malicious purposes presents significant risks. To date, comprehensive research on the safety issues associated with multi-agent systems remains limited. In this paper, we explore these concerns through the innovative lens of agent psychology, revealing that the dark psychological states of agents constitute a significant threat to safety. To tackle these concerns, we propose a comprehensive framework (PsySafe) grounded in agent psychology, focusing on three key areas: firstly, identifying how dark personality traits in agents can lead to risky behaviors; secondly, evaluating the safety of multi-agent systems from the psychological and behavioral perspectives, and thirdly, devising effective strategies to mitigate these risks. Our experiments reveal several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents, agents' self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior, and the correlation between agents' psychological assessments and dangerous behaviors.

The increasing human-like capabilities of AI are also attracting attention in social science research, leading to various studies exploring the combination of these two fields. In this survey, we systematically categorize previous explorations in the combination of AI and social science into two directions that share common technical approaches but differ in their research objectives. The first direction is focused on AI for social science, where AI is utilized as a powerful tool to enhance various stages of social science research. While the second direction is the social science of AI, which examines AI agents as social entities with their human-like cognitive and linguistic capabilities. By conducting a thorough review, particularly on the substantial progress facilitated by recent advancements in large language models, this paper introduces a fresh perspective to reassess the relationship between AI and social science, provides a cohesive framework that allows researchers to understand the distinctions and connections between AI for social science and social science of AI, and also summarized state-of-art experiment simulation platforms to facilitate research in these two directions.

Hallucination is Inevitable: An Innate Limitation of Large Language Models,"Ziwei Xu, Sanjay Jain, Mohan Kankanhalli","Hallucination has been widely recognized to be a significant drawback for large language models (LLMs). There have been many works that attempt to reduce the extent of hallucination. These efforts have mostly been empirical so far, which cannot answer the fundamental question whether it can be completely eliminated. In this paper, we formalize the problem and show that it is impossible to eliminate hallucination in LLMs. Specifically, we define a formal world where hallucination is defined as inconsistencies between a computable LLM and a computable ground truth function. By employing results from learning theory, we show that LLMs cannot learn all of the computable functions and will therefore always hallucinate. Since the formal world is a part of the real world which is much more complicated, hallucinations are also inevitable for real world LLMs. Furthermore, for real world LLMs constrained by provable time complexity, we describe the hallucination-prone tasks and empirically validate our claims. Finally, using the formal world framework, we discuss the possible mechanisms and efficacies of existing hallucination mitigators as well as the practical implications on the safe deployment of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11817v1,2024-01
Semantic Prompt Learning for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Ci-Siang Lin, Chien-Yi Wang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Min-Hung Chen","Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) aims to train segmentation models using image data with only image-level supervision. Since precise pixel-level annotations are not accessible, existing methods typically focus on producing pseudo masks for training segmentation models by refining CAM-like heatmaps. However, the produced heatmaps may capture only the discriminative image regions of object categories or the associated co-occurring backgrounds. To address the issues, we propose a Semantic Prompt Learning for WSSS (SemPLeS) framework, which learns to effectively prompt the CLIP latent space to enhance the semantic alignment between the segmented regions and the target object categories. More specifically, we propose Contrastive Prompt Learning and Prompt-guided Semantic Refinement to learn the prompts that adequately describe and suppress the co-occurring backgrounds associated with each object category. In this way, SemPLeS can perform better semantic alignment between object regions and class labels, resulting in desired pseudo masks for training segmentation models. The proposed SemPLeS framework achieves competitive performance on standard WSSS benchmarks, PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO2014, and shows compatibility with other WSSS methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11791v3,2024-01

A Framework to Implement 1+N Multi-task Fine-tuning Pattern in LLMs Using the CGC-LORA Algorithm,"Chao Song, Zhihao Ye, Qiqiang Lin, Qiuying Peng, Jun Wang","With the productive evolution of large language models (LLMs) in the field of natural language processing (NLP), tons of effort has been made to effectively fine-tune common pre-trained LLMs to fulfill a variety of tasks in one or multiple specific domain. In practice, there are two prevailing ways, in which the adaptation can be achieved: (i) Multiple Independent Models: Pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned a few times independently using the corresponding training samples from each task. (ii) An Integrated Model: Samples from all tasks are employed to fine-tune a pre-trianed LLM unitedly. To address the high computing cost and seesawing issue simultaneously, we propose a unified framework that implements a 1 + N mutli-task fine-tuning pattern in LLMs using a novel Customized Gate Control (CGC) Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) algorithm. Our work aims to take an advantage of both MTL (i.e., CGC) and PEFT (i.e., LoRA) scheme. For a given cluster of tasks, we design an innovative layer that contains two types of experts as additional trainable parameters to make LoRA be compatible with MTL. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct well-designed experiments on two public datasets.

Speak It Out: Solving Symbol-Related Problems with Symbol-to-Language Conversion for Language Models,"Yile Wang, Sijie Cheng, Zixin Sun, Peng Li, Yang Liu","Symbols (or more broadly, non-natural language textual representations) such as numerical sequences, molecular formulas, and table delimiters widely exist, playing important roles in various tasks such as abstract reasoning, chemical property prediction, and table question answering. Despite the impressive natural language comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs), their reasoning abilities for symbols remain inadequate, which could attributed to the difference between symbol representations and general natural languages. We propose symbol-to-language (S2L), a tuning-free method that enables large language models to solve symbol-related problems with information expressed in natural language. Specifically, S2L first converts the symbols involved to language-based representations, which can be implemented by prompting LLMs or leveraging external tools, then these language-based representations are integrated into the original problem via direct substitution or concatenation, serving as useful input information for LLMs. We evaluate the S2L method using both API-based (GPT-4, ChatGPT) and open-source (OpenChat) models over eight symbol-related tasks, ranging from symbol-only abstract reasoning to sentiment analysis in social media. Experimental results show that S2L consistently leads to superior performance. For example, by employing S2L for GPT-4, there can be average significant improvements of +21.9% and +9.5% for subtasks in 1D-ARC and Dyck language, respectively.

Community-based Behavioral Understanding of Crisis Activity Concerns using Social Media Data: A Study on the 2023 Canadian Wildfires in New York City,"Khondhaker Al Momin, Md Sami Hasnine, Arif Mohaimin Sadri","New York City (NYC) topped the global chart for the worst air pollution in June 2023, owing to the wildfire smoke drifting in from Canada. This unprecedented situation caused significant travel disruptions and shifts in traditional activity patterns of NYC residents. This study utilized large-scale social media data to study different crisis activity concerns (i.e., evacuation, staying indoors, shopping, and recreational activities among others) in the emergence of the 2023 Canadian wildfire smoke in NYC. In this regard, one week (June 02 through June 09, 2023) geotagged Twitter data from NYC were retrieved and used in the analysis. The tweets were processed using advanced text classification techniques and later integrated with national databases such as Social Security Administration data, Census, and American Community Survey. Finally, a model has been developed to make community inferences of different activity concerns in a major wildfire. The findings suggest, during wildfires, females are less likely to engage in discussions about evacuation, trips for medical, social, or recreational purposes, and commuting for work, likely influenced by workplaces maintaining operations despite poor air quality. There were also racial disparities in these discussions, with Asians being more likely than Hispanics to discuss evacuation and work commute, and African Americans being less likely to discuss social and recreational activities. Additionally, individuals from low-income neighborhoods and non-higher education students expressed fewer concerns about evacuation.

"Leveraging Social Media Data to Identify Factors Influencing Public Attitude Towards Accessibility, Socioeconomic Disparity and Public Transportation","Khondhaker Al Momin, Arif Mohaimin Sadri, Md Sami Hasnine","This study proposes a novel method to understand the factors affecting individuals' perception of transport accessibility, socioeconomic disparity, and public infrastructure. As opposed to the time consuming and expensive survey-based approach, this method can generate organic large-scale responses from social media and develop statistical models to understand individuals' perceptions of various transportation issues. This study retrieved and analyzed 36,098 tweets from New York City from March 19, 2020, to May 15, 2022. A state-of-the-art natural language processing algorithm is used for text mining and classification. A data fusion technique has been adopted to generate a series of socioeconomic traits that are used as explanatory variables in the model. The model results show that females and individuals of Asian origin tend to discuss transportation accessibility more than their counterparts, with those experiencing high neighborhood traffic also being more vocal. However, disadvantaged individuals, including the unemployed and those living in low-income neighborhoods or in areas with high natural hazard risks, tend to communicate less about such issues. As for socioeconomic disparity, individuals of Asian origin and those experiencing various types of air pollution are more likely to discuss these topics on Twitter, often with a negative sentiment. However, unemployed, or disadvantaged individuals, as well as those living in areas with high natural hazard risks or expected losses, are less inclined to tweet about this subject. Lack of internet accessibility could be a reason why many disadvantaged individuals do not tweet about transport accessibility and subsidized internet could be a possible solution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01682v1,2024-01
Emojis Decoded: Leveraging ChatGPT for Enhanced Understanding in Social Media Communications,"Yuhang Zhou, Paiheng Xu, Xiyao Wang, Xuan Lu, Ge Gao, Wei Ai","Emojis, which encapsulate semantics beyond mere words or phrases, have become prevalent in social network communications. This has spurred increasing scholarly interest in exploring their attributes and functionalities. However, emoji-related research and application face two primary challenges. First, researchers typically rely on crowd-sourcing to annotate emojis in order to understand their sentiments, usage intentions, and semantic meanings. Second, subjective interpretations by users can often lead to misunderstandings of emojis and cause the communication barrier. Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various annotation tasks, with ChatGPT demonstrating expertise across multiple domains. In our study, we assess ChatGPT's effectiveness in handling previously annotated and downstream tasks. Our objective is to validate the hypothesis that ChatGPT can serve as a viable alternative to human annotators in emoji research and that its ability to explain emoji meanings can enhance clarity and transparency in online communications. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT has extensive knowledge of emojis. It is adept at elucidating the meaning of emojis across various application scenarios and demonstrates the potential to replace human annotators in a range of tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01681v2,2024-01
Keep Decoding Parallel with Effective Knowledge Distillation from Language Models to End-to-end Speech Recognisers,"Michael Hentschel, Yuta Nishikawa, Tatsuya Komatsu, Yusuke Fujita","This study presents a novel approach for knowledge distillation (KD) from a BERT teacher model to an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model using intermediate layers. To distil the teacher's knowledge, we use an attention decoder that learns from BERT's token probabilities. Our method shows that language model (LM) information can be more effectively distilled into an ASR model using both the intermediate layers and the final layer. By using the intermediate layers as distillation target, we can more effectively distil LM knowledge into the lower network layers. Using our method, we achieve better recognition accuracy than with shallow fusion of an external LM, allowing us to maintain fast parallel decoding. Experiments on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing greedy decoding with connectionist temporal classification (CTC).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11700v1,2024-01
Streaming Bilingual End-to-End ASR model using Attention over Multiple Softmax,"Aditya Patil, Vikas Joshi, Purvi Agrawal, Rupesh Mehta","Even with several advancements in multilingual modeling, it is challenging to recognize multiple languages using a single neural model, without knowing the input language and most multilingual models assume the availability of the input language. In this work, we propose a novel bilingual end-to-end (E2E) modeling approach, where a single neural model can recognize both languages and also support switching between the languages, without any language input from the user. The proposed model has shared encoder and prediction networks, with language-specific joint networks that are combined via a self-attention mechanism. As the language-specific posteriors are combined, it produces a single posterior probability over all the output symbols, enabling a single beam search decoding and also allowing dynamic switching between the languages. The proposed approach outperforms the conventional bilingual baseline with 13.3%, 8.23% and 1.3% word error rate relative reduction on Hindi, English and code-mixed test sets, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11645v1,2024-01

Text-to-Image Cross-Modal Generation: A Systematic Review,"Maciej Żelaszczyk, Jacek Mańdziuk","We review research on generating visual data from text from the angle of ""cross-modal generation."" This point of view allows us to draw parallels between various methods geared towards working on input text and producing visual output, without limiting the analysis to narrow sub-areas. It also results in the identification of common templates in the field, which are then compared and contrasted both within pools of similar methods and across lines of research. We provide a breakdown of text-to-image generation into various flavors of image-from-text methods, video-from-text methods, image editing, self-supervised and graph-based approaches.

Large Language Model based Multi-Agents: A Survey of Progress and Challenges,"Taicheng Guo, Xiuying Chen, Yaqi Wang, Ruidi Chang, Shichao Pei, Nitesh V. Chawla, Olaf Wiest, Xiangliang Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide array of tasks. Due to the impressive planning and reasoning abilities of LLMs, they have been used as autonomous agents to do many tasks automatically. Recently, based on the development of using one LLM as a single planning or decision-making agent, LLM-based multi-agent systems have achieved considerable progress in complex problem-solving and world simulation. To provide the community with an overview of this dynamic field, we present this survey to offer an in-depth discussion on the essential aspects of multi-agent systems based on LLMs, as well as the challenges.

In-context Learning with Retrieved Demonstrations for Language Models: A Survey,"Man Luo, Xin Xu, Yue Liu, Panupong Pasupat, Mehran Kazemi","Language models, especially pre-trained large language models, have showcased remarkable abilities as few-shot in-context learners (ICL), adept at adapting to new tasks with just a few demonstrations in the input context. However, the model's ability to perform ICL is sensitive to the choice of the few-shot demonstrations. Instead of using a fixed set of demonstrations, one recent development is to retrieve demonstrations tailored to each input query. The implementation of demonstration retrieval is relatively straightforward, leveraging existing databases and retrieval systems. This not only improves the efficiency and scalability of the learning process but also has been shown to reduce biases inherent in manual example selection. In light of the encouraging results and growing research in ICL with retrieved demonstrations, we conduct an extensive review of studies in this area. In this survey, we discuss and compare different design choices for retrieval models, retrieval training procedures, and inference algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11624v5,2024-01
Robust Evaluation Measures for Evaluating Social Biases in Masked Language Models,Yang Liu,"Many evaluation measures are used to evaluate social biases in masked language models (MLMs). However, we find that these previously proposed evaluation measures are lacking robustness in scenarios with limited datasets. This is because these measures are obtained by comparing the pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scores of the stereotypical and anti-stereotypical samples using an indicator function. The disadvantage is the limited mining of the PLL score sets without capturing its distributional information. In this paper, we represent a PLL score set as a Gaussian distribution and use Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence and Jensen Shannon (JS) divergence to construct evaluation measures for the distributions of stereotypical and anti-stereotypical PLL scores. Experimental results on the publicly available datasets StereoSet (SS) and CrowS-Pairs (CP) show that our proposed measures are significantly more robust and interpretable than those proposed previously.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11601v1,2024-01
CheX-GPT: Harnessing Large Language Models for Enhanced Chest X-ray Report Labeling,"Jawook Gu, Kihyun You, Han-Cheol Cho, Jiho Kim, Eun Kyoung Hong, Byungseok Roh","Free-text radiology reports present a rich data source for various medical tasks, but effectively labeling these texts remains challenging. Traditional rule-based labeling methods fall short of capturing the nuances of diverse free-text patterns. Moreover, models using expert-annotated data are limited by data scarcity and pre-defined classes, impacting their performance, flexibility and scalability. To address these issues, our study offers three main contributions: 1) We demonstrate the potential of GPT as an adept labeler using carefully designed prompts. 2) Utilizing only the data labeled by GPT, we trained a BERT-based labeler, CheX-GPT, which operates faster and more efficiently than its GPT counterpart. 3) To benchmark labeler performance, we introduced a publicly available expert-annotated test set, MIMIC-500, comprising 500 cases from the MIMIC validation set. Our findings demonstrate that CheX-GPT not only excels in labeling accuracy over existing models, but also showcases superior efficiency, flexibility, and scalability, supported by our introduction of the MIMIC-500 dataset for robust benchmarking.

With Greater Text Comes Greater Necessity: Inference-Time Training Helps Long Text Generation,"Y. Wang, D. Ma, D. Cai","Long text generation, such as novel writing and discourse-level translation with extremely long contexts, presents significant challenges to current language models. Existing methods mainly focus on extending the model's context window through strategies like length extrapolation. However, these approaches demand substantial hardware resources during the training and/or inference phases. Our proposed method, Temp-Lora, introduces an alternative concept. Instead of relying on the KV cache to store all context information, we embeds this information directly into a temporary Lora module. In the process of long text generation, this module is progressively trained with text generated previously. This approach not only efficiently preserves contextual knowledge but also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's parameters given that the module is discarded post-generation. Extensive experiments on the PG19 language modeling benchmark and the GuoFeng discourse-level translation benchmark validate the effectiveness of Temp-Lora. Our results show that: 1) Temp-Lora substantially enhances generation quality for long text, as indicated by a 13.2% decrease in perplexity (PPL) on a subset of PG19, and a 29.3% decrease in PPL along with a 113.2% increase in BLEU score on a subset of GuoFeng, 2) Temp-Lora is compatible with and enhances most existing long text generation methods, and 3) Temp-Lora can greatly reduce computational costs by shortening the context window. For example, we can ensure a moderate improvement in generation quality (a decrease of 3.8% in PPL) while enabling a 51.5% memory usage reduction and a 60.0% decrease in latency for inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11504v3,2024-01
Towards Better Inclusivity: A Diverse Tweet Corpus of English Varieties,"Nhi Pham, Lachlan Pham, Adam L. Meyers","The prevalence of social media presents a growing opportunity to collect and analyse examples of English varieties. Whilst usage of these varieties was - and, in many cases, still is - used only in spoken contexts or hard-to-access private messages, social media sites like Twitter provide a platform for users to communicate informally in a scrapeable format. Notably, Indian English (Hinglish), Singaporean English (Singlish), and African-American English (AAE) can be commonly found online. These varieties pose a challenge to existing natural language processing (NLP) tools as they often differ orthographically and syntactically from standard English for which the majority of these tools are built. NLP models trained on standard English texts produced biased outcomes for users of underrepresented varieties. Some research has aimed to overcome the inherent biases caused by unrepresentative data through techniques like data augmentation or adjusting training models.   We aim to address the issue of bias at its root - the data itself. We curate a dataset of tweets from countries with high proportions of underserved English variety speakers, and propose an annotation framework of six categorical classifications along a pseudo-spectrum that measures the degree of standard English and that thereby indirectly aims to surface the manifestations of English varieties in these tweets. Following best annotation practices, our growing corpus features 170,800 tweets taken from 7 countries, labeled by annotators who are from those countries and can communicate in regionally-dominant varieties of English. Our corpus highlights the accuracy discrepancies in pre-trained language identifiers between western English and non-western (i.e., less standard) English varieties. We hope to contribute to the growing literature identifying and reducing the implicit demographic discrepancies in NLP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11487v1,2024-01
Over-Reasoning and Redundant Calculation of Large Language Models,"Cheng-Han Chiang, Hung-yi Lee","Large language models (LLMs) can solve problems step-by-step. While this chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning boosts LLMs' performance, it is unclear if LLMs \textit{know} when to use CoT and whether those CoT are always necessary to answer the question. This paper shows that LLMs tend to generate redundant calculations and reasoning on a manually constructed math QA dataset, GSM8K-Zero. GSM8K-Zero is constructed such that the questions can be answered without any calculations, but LLMs, including Llama-2 models and Claude-2, tend to generate lengthy and unnecessary calculations to answer the questions. We also conduct experiments to explain why LLMs generate redundant calculations and reasonings.

Estimating the Usefulness of Clarifying Questions and Answers for Conversational Search,"Ivan Sekulić, Weronika Łajewska, Krisztian Balog, Fabio Crestani","While the body of research directed towards constructing and generating clarifying questions in mixed-initiative conversational search systems is vast, research aimed at processing and comprehending users' answers to such questions is scarce. To this end, we present a simple yet effective method for processing answers to clarifying questions, moving away from previous work that simply appends answers to the original query and thus potentially degrades retrieval performance. Specifically, we propose a classifier for assessing usefulness of the prompted clarifying question and an answer given by the user. Useful questions or answers are further appended to the conversation history and passed to a transformer-based query rewriting module. Results demonstrate significant improvements over strong non-mixed-initiative baselines. Furthermore, the proposed approach mitigates the performance drops when non useful questions and answers are utilized.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11463v1,2024-01
Linear Alignment: A Closed-form Solution for Aligning Human Preferences without Tuning and Feedback,"Songyang Gao, Qiming Ge, Wei Shen, Shihan Dou, Junjie Ye, Xiao Wang, Rui Zheng, Yicheng Zou, Zhi Chen, Hang Yan, Qi Zhang, Dahua Lin","The success of AI assistants based on Language Models (LLMs) hinges on Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to comprehend and align with user intentions. However, traditional alignment algorithms, such as PPO, are hampered by complex annotation and training requirements. This reliance limits the applicability of RLHF and hinders the development of professional assistants tailored to diverse human preferences. In this work, we introduce \textit{Linear Alignment}, a novel algorithm that aligns language models with human preferences in one single inference step, eliminating the reliance on data annotation and model training. Linear alignment incorporates a new parameterization for policy optimization under divergence constraints, which enables the extraction of optimal policy in a closed-form manner and facilitates the direct estimation of the aligned response. Extensive experiments on both general and personalized preference datasets demonstrate that linear alignment significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of LLM alignment across diverse scenarios.

Towards Reliable and Factual Response Generation: Detecting Unanswerable Questions in Information-Seeking Conversations,"Weronika Łajewska, Krisztian Balog","Generative AI models face the challenge of hallucinations that can undermine users' trust in such systems. We approach the problem of conversational information seeking as a two-step process, where relevant passages in a corpus are identified first and then summarized into a final system response. This way we can automatically assess if the answer to the user's question is present in the corpus. Specifically, our proposed method employs a sentence-level classifier to detect if the answer is present, then aggregates these predictions on the passage level, and eventually across the top-ranked passages to arrive at a final answerability estimate. For training and evaluation, we develop a dataset based on the TREC CAsT benchmark that includes answerability labels on the sentence, passage, and ranking levels. We demonstrate that our proposed method represents a strong baseline and outperforms a state-of-the-art LLM on the answerability prediction task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11452v1,2024-01
Instructional Fingerprinting of Large Language Models,"Jiashu Xu, Fei Wang, Mingyu Derek Ma, Pang Wei Koh, Chaowei Xiao, Muhao Chen","The exorbitant cost of training Large language models (LLMs) from scratch makes it essential to fingerprint the models to protect intellectual property via ownership authentication and to ensure downstream users and developers comply with their license terms (e.g. restricting commercial use). In this study, we present a pilot study on LLM fingerprinting as a form of very lightweight instruction tuning. Model publisher specifies a confidential private key and implants it as an instruction backdoor that causes the LLM to generate specific text when the key is present. Results on 11 popularly-used LLMs showed that this approach is lightweight and does not affect the normal behavior of the model. It also prevents publisher overclaim, maintains robustness against fingerprint guessing and parameter-efficient training, and supports multi-stage fingerprinting akin to MIT License.

Majority or Minority: Data Imbalance Learning Method for Named Entity Recognition,"Sota Nemoto, Shunsuke Kitada, Hitoshi Iyatomi","Data imbalance presents a significant challenge in various machine learning (ML) tasks, particularly named entity recognition (NER) within natural language processing (NLP). NER exhibits a data imbalance with a long-tail distribution, featuring numerous minority classes (i.e., entity classes) and a single majority class (i.e., O-class). This imbalance leads to misclassifications of the entity classes as the O-class. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple and effective learning method named majority or minority (MoM) learning. MoM learning incorporates the loss computed only for samples whose ground truth is the majority class into the loss of the conventional ML model. Evaluation experiments on four NER datasets (Japanese and English) showed that MoM learning improves prediction performance of the minority classes without sacrificing the performance of the majority class and is more effective than widely known and state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated MoM learning using frameworks as sequential labeling and machine reading comprehension, which are commonly used in NER. Furthermore, MoM learning has achieved consistent performance improvements regardless of language or framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11431v2,2024-01
SEBERTNets: Sequence Enhanced BERT Networks for Event Entity Extraction Tasks Oriented to the Finance Field,"Congqing He, Xiangyu Zhu, Yuquan Le, Yuzhong Liu, Jianhong Yin","Event extraction lies at the cores of investment analysis and asset management in the financial field, and thus has received much attention.

In this paper, we propose a novel model, Sequence Enhanced BERT Networks (SEBERTNets for short), which can inherit the advantages of the BERT,and while capturing sequence semantic information. In addition, motivated by recommendation system, we propose Hybrid Sequence Enhanced BERT Networks (HSEBERTNets for short), which uses a multi-channel recall method to recall all the corresponding event entity.

MolTailor: Tailoring Chemical Molecular Representation to Specific Tasks via Text Prompts,"Haoqiang Guo, Sendong Zhao, Haochun Wang, Yanrui Du, Bing Qin","Deep learning is now widely used in drug discovery, providing significant acceleration and cost reduction. As the most fundamental building block, molecular representation is essential for predicting molecular properties to enable various downstream applications. Most existing methods attempt to incorporate more information to learn better representations. However, not all features are equally important for a specific task. Ignoring this would potentially compromise the training efficiency and predictive accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, which treats language models as an agent and molecular pretraining models as a knowledge base. The agent accentuates task-relevant features in the molecular representation by understanding the natural language description of the task, just as a tailor customizes clothes for clients. Thus, we call this approach MolTailor. Evaluations demonstrate MolTailor's superior performance over baselines, validating the efficacy of enhancing relevance for molecular representation learning. This illustrates the potential of language model guided optimization to better exploit and unleash the capabilities of existing powerful molecular representation methods.

However, the performance of these models in domain-specific tasks such as medical Q&A remains largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by comparing the performance of general and medical-specific distilled LMs for medical Q&A.

Using Large Language Model for End-to-End Chinese ASR and NER,"Yuang Li, Jiawei Yu, Min Zhang, Mengxin Ren, Yanqing Zhao, Xiaofeng Zhao, Shimin Tao, Jinsong Su, Hao Yang","Mapping speech tokens to the same feature space as text tokens has become the paradigm for the integration of speech modality into decoder-only large language models (LLMs). An alternative approach is to use an encoder-decoder architecture that incorporates speech features through cross-attention. This approach, however, has received less attention in the literature. In this work, we connect the Whisper encoder with ChatGLM3 and provide in-depth comparisons of these two approaches using Chinese automatic speech recognition (ASR) and name entity recognition (NER) tasks. We evaluate them not only by conventional metrics like the F1 score but also by a novel fine-grained taxonomy of ASR-NER errors. Our experiments reveal that encoder-decoder architecture outperforms decoder-only architecture with a short context, while decoder-only architecture benefits from a long context as it fully exploits all layers of the LLM. By using LLM, we significantly reduced the entity omission errors and improved the entity ASR accuracy compared to the Conformer baseline. Additionally, we obtained a state-of-the-art (SOTA) F1 score of 0.805 on the AISHELL-NER test set by using chain-of-thought (CoT) NER which first infers long-form ASR transcriptions and then predicts NER labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11382v2,2024-01
Language Models as Hierarchy Encoders,"Yuan He, Zhangdie Yuan, Jiaoyan Chen, Ian Horrocks","Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincar\'e ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11374v4,2024-01
Finding a Needle in the Adversarial Haystack: A Targeted Paraphrasing Approach For Uncovering Edge Cases with Minimal Distribution Distortion,"Aly M. Kassem, Sherif Saad","Adversarial attacks against language models(LMs) are a significant concern. In particular, adversarial samples exploit the model's sensitivity to small input changes. While these changes appear insignificant on the semantics of the input sample, they result in significant decay in model performance. In this paper, we propose Targeted Paraphrasing via RL (TPRL), an approach to automatically learn a policy to generate challenging samples that most likely improve the model's performance. TPRL leverages FLAN T5, a language model, as a generator and employs a self learned policy using a proximal policy gradient to generate the adversarial examples automatically. TPRL's reward is based on the confusion induced in the classifier, preserving the original text meaning through a Mutual Implication score. We demonstrate and evaluate TPRL's effectiveness in discovering natural adversarial attacks and improving model performance through extensive experiments on four diverse NLP classification tasks via Automatic and Human evaluation. TPRL outperforms strong baselines, exhibits generalizability across classifiers and datasets, and combines the strengths of language modeling and reinforcement learning to generate diverse and influential adversarial examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11373v2,2024-01
Confidence Preservation Property in Knowledge Distillation Abstractions,"Dmitry Vengertsev, Elena Sherman","Social media platforms prevent malicious activities by detecting harmful content of posts and comments. To that end, they employ large-scale deep neural network language models for sentiment analysis and content understanding. Some models, like BERT, are complex, and have numerous parameters, which makes them expensive to operate and maintain. To overcome these deficiencies, industry experts employ a knowledge distillation compression technique, where a distilled model is trained to reproduce the classification behavior of the original model. The distillation processes terminates when the distillation loss function reaches the stopping criteria. This function is mainly designed to ensure that the original and the distilled models exhibit alike classification behaviors. However, besides classification accuracy, there are additional properties of the original model that the distilled model should preserve to be considered as an appropriate abstraction. In this work, we explore whether distilled TinyBERT models preserve confidence values of the original BERT models, and investigate how this confidence preservation property could guide tuning hyperparameters of the distillation process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11365v1,2024-01

ProLex: A Benchmark for Language Proficiency-oriented Lexical Substitution,"Xuanming Zhang, Zixun Chen, Zhou Yu","Lexical Substitution discovers appropriate substitutes for a given target word in a context sentence. However, the task fails to consider substitutes that are of equal or higher proficiency than the target, an aspect that could be beneficial for language learners looking to improve their writing. To bridge this gap, we propose a new task, language proficiency-oriented lexical substitution. We also introduce ProLex, a novel benchmark designed to assess systems' ability to generate not only appropriate substitutes but also substitutes that demonstrate better language proficiency. Besides the benchmark, we propose models that can automatically perform the new task. We show that our best model, a Llama2-13B model fine-tuned with task-specific synthetic data, outperforms ChatGPT by an average of 3.2% in F-score and achieves comparable results with GPT-4 on ProLex.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11356v3,2024-01
Identifying and Analyzing Task-Encoding Tokens in Large Language Models,"Yu Bai, Heyan Huang, Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano, Marc-Antoine Rondeau, Sanxing Chen, Yang Gao, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung","In-context learning (ICL) has become an effective solution for few-shot learning in natural language processing. However, our understanding of ICL's working mechanisms is limited, specifically regarding how models learn to perform tasks from ICL demonstrations. For example, unexpectedly large changes in performance can arise from small changes in the prompt, leaving prompt design a largely empirical endeavour. In this paper, we investigate this problem by identifying and analyzing task-encoding tokens on whose representations the task performance depends. Using experiments that ablate the representations of different token types, we find that template and stopword tokens are the most prone to be task-encoding. In addition, we demonstrate experimentally that lexical meaning, repetition, and text formatting are the main distinguishing characteristics of these tokens. Our work sheds light on how large language models (LLMs) learn to perform a task from demonstrations, deepens our understanding of the varied roles different types of tokens play in LLMs, and provides insights for avoiding instability from improperly utilizing task-encoding tokens.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11323v2,2024-01
PRILoRA: Pruned and Rank-Increasing Low-Rank Adaptation,"Nadav Benedek, Lior Wolf","With the proliferation of large pre-trained language models (PLMs), fine-tuning all model parameters becomes increasingly inefficient, particularly when dealing with numerous downstream tasks that entail substantial training and storage costs. Several approaches aimed at achieving parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) have been proposed. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stands out as an archetypal method, incorporating trainable rank decomposition matrices into each target module. Nevertheless, LoRA does not consider the varying importance of each layer. To address these challenges, we introduce PRILoRA, which linearly allocates a different rank for each layer, in an increasing manner, and performs pruning throughout the training process, considering both the temporary magnitude of weights and the accumulated statistics of the input to any given layer. We validate the effectiveness of PRILoRA through extensive experiments on eight GLUE benchmarks, setting a new state of the art.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11316v1,2024-01

Word-Level ASR Quality Estimation for Efficient Corpus Sampling and Post-Editing through Analyzing Attentions of a Reference-Free Metric,"Golara Javadi, Kamer Ali Yuksel, Yunsu Kim, Thiago Castro Ferreira, Mohamed Al-Badrashiny","In the realm of automatic speech recognition (ASR), the quest for models that not only perform with high accuracy but also offer transparency in their decision-making processes is crucial. The potential of quality estimation (QE) metrics is introduced and evaluated as a novel tool to enhance explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in ASR systems. Through experiments and analyses, the capabilities of the NoRefER (No Reference Error Rate) metric are explored in identifying word-level errors to aid post-editors in refining ASR hypotheses. The investigation also extends to the utility of NoRefER in the corpus-building process, demonstrating its effectiveness in augmenting datasets with insightful annotations. The diagnostic aspects of NoRefER are examined, revealing its ability to provide valuable insights into model behaviors and decision patterns. This has proven beneficial for prioritizing hypotheses in post-editing workflows and fine-tuning ASR models. The findings suggest that NoRefER is not merely a tool for error detection but also a comprehensive framework for enhancing ASR systems' transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness.

Drop your Decoder: Pre-training with Bag-of-Word Prediction for Dense Passage Retrieval,"Guangyuan Ma, Xing Wu, Zijia Lin, Songlin Hu","Masked auto-encoder pre-training has emerged as a prevalent technique for initializing and enhancing dense retrieval systems. It generally utilizes additional Transformer decoder blocks to provide sustainable supervision signals and compress contextual information into dense representations. However, the underlying reasons for the effectiveness of such a pre-training technique remain unclear. The usage of additional Transformer-based decoders also incurs significant computational costs. In this study, we aim to shed light on this issue by revealing that masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training with enhanced decoding significantly improves the term coverage of input tokens in dense representations, compared to vanilla BERT checkpoints. Building upon this observation, we propose a modification to the traditional MAE by replacing the decoder of a masked auto-encoder with a completely simplified Bag-of-Word prediction task. This modification enables the efficient compression of lexical signals into dense representations through unsupervised pre-training. Remarkably, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on several large-scale retrieval benchmarks without requiring any additional parameters, which provides a 67% training speed-up compared to standard masked auto-encoder pre-training with enhanced decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11248v2,2024-01
"Prompt-RAG: Pioneering Vector Embedding-Free Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Niche Domains, Exemplified by Korean Medicine","Bongsu Kang, Jundong Kim, Tae-Rim Yun, Chang-Eop Kim","We propose a natural language prompt-based retrieval augmented generation (Prompt-RAG), a novel approach to enhance the performance of generative large language models (LLMs) in niche domains. Conventional RAG methods mostly require vector embeddings, yet the suitability of generic LLM-based embedding representations for specialized domains remains uncertain. To explore and exemplify this point, we compared vector embeddings from Korean Medicine (KM) and Conventional Medicine (CM) documents, finding that KM document embeddings correlated more with token overlaps and less with human-assessed document relatedness, in contrast to CM embeddings. Prompt-RAG, distinct from conventional RAG models, operates without the need for embedding vectors. Its performance was assessed through a Question-Answering (QA) chatbot application, where responses were evaluated for relevance, readability, and informativeness. The results showed that Prompt-RAG outperformed existing models, including ChatGPT and conventional vector embedding-based RAGs, in terms of relevance and informativeness. Despite challenges like content structuring and response latency, the advancements in LLMs are expected to encourage the use of Prompt-RAG, making it a promising tool for other domains in need of RAG methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11246v1,2024-01

End-to-End Argument Mining over Varying Rhetorical Structures,Elena Chistova,"Rhetorical Structure Theory implies no single discourse interpretation of a text, and the limitations of RST parsers further exacerbate inconsistent parsing of similar structures. Therefore, it is important to take into account that the same argumentative structure can be found in semantically similar texts with varying rhetorical structures. In this work, the differences between paraphrases within the same argument scheme are evaluated from a rhetorical perspective. The study proposes a deep dependency parsing model to assess the connection between rhetorical and argument structures. The model utilizes rhetorical relations; RST structures of paraphrases serve as training data augmentations. The method allows for end-to-end argumentation analysis using a rhetorical tree instead of a word sequence. It is evaluated on the bilingual Microtexts corpus, and the first results on fully-fledged argument parsing for the Russian version of the corpus are reported. The results suggest that argument mining can benefit from multiple variants of discourse structure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11218v1,2024-01
Unfair TOS: An Automated Approach using Customized BERT,"Bathini Sai Akash, Akshara Kupireddy, Lalita Bhanu Murthy","Terms of Service (ToS) form an integral part of any agreement as it defines the legal relationship between a service provider and an end-user. Not only do they establish and delineate reciprocal rights and responsibilities, but they also provide users with information on essential aspects of contracts that pertain to the use of digital spaces. These aspects include a wide range of topics, including limitation of liability, data protection, etc. Users tend to accept the ToS without going through it before using any application or service. Such ignorance puts them in a potentially weaker situation in case any action is required. Existing methodologies for the detection or classification of unfair clauses are however obsolete and show modest performance. In this research paper, we present SOTA(State of The Art) results on unfair clause detection from ToS documents based on unprecedented custom BERT Fine-tuning in conjunction with SVC(Support Vector Classifier). The study shows proficient performance with a macro F1-score of 0.922 at unfair clause detection, and superior performance is also shown in the classification of unfair clauses by each tag. Further, a comparative analysis is performed by answering research questions on the Transformer models utilized.

InferAligner: Inference-Time Alignment for Harmlessness through Cross-Model Guidance,"Pengyu Wang, Dong Zhang, Linyang Li, Chenkun Tan, Xinghao Wang, Ke Ren, Botian Jiang, Xipeng Qiu","With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), they are not only used as general-purpose AI assistants but are also customized through further fine-tuning to meet the requirements of different applications. A pivotal factor in the success of current LLMs is the alignment process. Current alignment methods, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), focus on training-time alignment and are often complex and cumbersome to implement. Therefore, we develop \textbf{InferAligner}, a novel inference-time alignment method that utilizes cross-model guidance for harmlessness alignment. InferAligner utilizes safety steering vectors extracted from safety-aligned model to modify the activations of the target model when responding to harmful inputs, thereby guiding the target model to provide harmless responses. Experimental results show that our method can be very effectively applied to domain-specific models in finance, medicine, and mathematics, as well as to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as LLaVA. It significantly diminishes the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of both harmful instructions and jailbreak attacks, while maintaining almost unchanged performance in downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11206v1,2024-01
How the Advent of Ubiquitous Large Language Models both Stymie and Turbocharge Dynamic Adversarial Question Generation,"Yoo Yeon Sung, Ishani Mondal, Jordan Boyd-Graber","Dynamic adversarial question generation, where humans write examples to stump a model, aims to create examples that are realistic and informative. However, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has been a double-edged sword for human authors: more people are interested in seeing and pushing the limits of these models, but because the models are so much stronger an opponent, they are harder to defeat. To understand how these models impact adversarial question writing process, we enrich the writing guidance with LLMs and retrieval models for the authors to reason why their questions are not adversarial. While authors could create interesting, challenging adversarial questions, they sometimes resort to tricks that result in poor questions that are ambiguous, subjective, or confusing not just to a computer but also to humans. To address these issues, we propose new metrics and incentives for eliciting good, challenging questions and present a new dataset of adversarially authored questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11185v1,2024-01
Embedding Ontologies via Incorporating Extensional and Intensional Knowledge,"Keyu Wang, Guilin Qi, Jiaoyan Chen, Yi Huang, Tianxing Wu","Ontologies contain rich knowledge within domain, which can be divided into two categories, namely extensional knowledge and intensional knowledge. Extensional knowledge provides information about the concrete instances that belong to specific concepts in the ontology, while intensional knowledge details inherent properties, characteristics, and semantic associations among concepts. However, existing ontology embedding approaches fail to take both extensional knowledge and intensional knowledge into fine consideration simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel ontology embedding approach named EIKE (Extensional and Intensional Knowledge Embedding) by representing ontologies in two spaces, called extensional space and intensional space. EIKE presents a unified framework for embedding instances, concepts and their relations in an ontology, applying a geometry-based method to model extensional knowledge and a pretrained language model to model intensional knowledge, which can capture both structure information and textual information. Experimental results show that EIKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in three datasets for both triple classification and link prediction, indicating that EIKE provides a more comprehensive and representative perspective of the domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01677v3,2024-01
Density Adaptive Attention is All You Need: Robust Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Across Multiple Modalities,"Georgios Ioannides, Aman Chadha, Aaron Elkins","We propose the Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM), a novel probabilistic attention framework that can be used for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT), and the Density Adaptive Transformer (DAT), designed to enhance information aggregation across multiple modalities, including Speech, Text, and Vision. DAAM integrates learnable mean and variance into its attention mechanism, implemented in a multi-head framework, enabling it to collectively model any probability distribution for dynamic recalibration of feature significance. This method demonstrates significant improvements, especially with highly non-stationary data, surpassing the state-of-the-art attention techniques in model performance, up to approximately +20% (abs.) in accuracy. Empirically, DAAM exhibits superior adaptability and efficacy across a diverse range of tasks, including emotion recognition in speech, image classification, and text classification, thereby establishing its robustness and versatility in handling data across multiple modalities.

Enhancing Large Language Models for Clinical Decision Support by Incorporating Clinical Practice Guidelines,"David Oniani, Xizhi Wu, Shyam Visweswaran, Sumit Kapoor, Shravan Kooragayalu, Katelyn Polanska, Yanshan Wang","Background Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced with Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs), can significantly improve Clinical Decision Support (CDS). However, methods for incorporating CPGs into LLMs are not well studied. Methods We develop three distinct methods for incorporating CPGs into LLMs: Binary Decision Tree (BDT), Program-Aided Graph Construction (PAGC), and Chain-of-Thought-Few-Shot Prompting (CoT-FSP). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we create a set of synthetic patient descriptions and conduct both automatic and human evaluation of the responses generated by four LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, LLaMA, and PaLM 2. Zero-Shot Prompting (ZSP) was used as the baseline method. We focus on CDS for COVID-19 outpatient treatment as the case study. Results All four LLMs exhibit improved performance when enhanced with CPGs compared to the baseline ZSP. BDT outperformed both CoT-FSP and PAGC in automatic evaluation. All of the proposed methods demonstrated high performance in human evaluation. Conclusion LLMs enhanced with CPGs demonstrate superior performance, as compared to plain LLMs with ZSP, in providing accurate recommendations for COVID-19 outpatient treatment, which also highlights the potential for broader applications beyond the case study.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11120v2,2024-01
Toward Robust Multimodal Learning using Multimodal Foundational Models,"Xianbing Zhao, Soujanya Poria, Xuejiao Li, Yixin Chen, Buzhou Tang","Existing multimodal sentiment analysis tasks are highly rely on the assumption that the training and test sets are complete multimodal data, while this assumption can be difficult to hold: the multimodal data are often incomplete in real-world scenarios. Therefore, a robust multimodal model in scenarios with randomly missing modalities is highly preferred. Recently, CLIP-based multimodal foundational models have demonstrated impressive performance on numerous multimodal tasks by learning the aligned cross-modal semantics of image and text pairs, but the multimodal foundational models are also unable to directly address scenarios involving modality absence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple and effective framework, namely TRML, Toward Robust Multimodal Learning using Multimodal Foundational Models. TRML employs generated virtual modalities to replace missing modalities, and aligns the semantic spaces between the generated and missing modalities. Concretely, we design a missing modality inference module to generate virtual modaliites and replace missing modalities. We also design a semantic matching learning module to align semantic spaces generated and missing modalities. Under the prompt of complete modality, our model captures the semantics of missing modalities by leveraging the aligned cross-modal semantic space. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach on three multimodal sentiment analysis benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and MELD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13697v1,2024-01
Exploiting Duality in Open Information Extraction with Predicate Prompt,"Zhen Chen, Jingping Liu, Deqing Yang, Yanghua Xiao, Huimin Xu, Zongyu Wang, Rui Xie, Yunsen Xian","Open information extraction (OpenIE) aims to extract the schema-free triplets in the form of (\emph{subject}, \emph{predicate}, \emph{object}) from a given sentence. Compared with general information extraction (IE), OpenIE poses more challenges for the IE models, {especially when multiple complicated triplets exist in a sentence. To extract these complicated triplets more effectively, in this paper we propose a novel generative OpenIE model, namely \emph{DualOIE}, which achieves a dual task at the same time as extracting some triplets from the sentence, i.e., converting the triplets into the sentence.} Such dual task encourages the model to correctly recognize the structure of the given sentence and thus is helpful to extract all potential triplets from the sentence. Specifically, DualOIE extracts the triplets in two steps: 1) first extracting a sequence of all potential predicates, 2) then using the predicate sequence as a prompt to induce the generation of triplets. Our experiments on two benchmarks and our dataset constructed from Meituan demonstrate that DualOIE achieves the best performance among the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the online A/B test on Meituan platform shows that 0.93\% improvement of QV-CTR and 0.56\% improvement of UV-CTR have been obtained when the triplets extracted by DualOIE were leveraged in Meituan's search system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11107v1,2024-01

This study focused on evaluating and enhancing the clinical capabilities of LLMs in specific domains, using osteoarthritis (OA) management as a case study. A domain specific benchmark framework was developed, which evaluate LLMs across a spectrum from domain-specific knowledge to clinical applications in real-world clinical scenarios. DocOA, a specialized LLM tailored for OA management that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and instruction prompts, was developed. The study compared the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and a specialized assistant, DocOA, using objective and human evaluations. Results showed that general LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were less effective in the specialized domain of OA management, particularly in providing personalized treatment recommendations.

An Information Retrieval and Extraction Tool for Covid-19 Related Papers,Marcos V. L. Pivetta,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe impacts on health systems worldwide. Its critical nature and the increased interest of individuals and organizations to develop countermeasures to the problem has led to a surge of new studies in scientific journals. Objetive: We sought to develop a tool that incorporates, in a novel way, aspects of Information Retrieval (IR) and Extraction (IE) applied to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). The main focus of this paper is to provide researchers with a better search tool for COVID-19 related papers, helping them find reference papers and hightlight relevant entities in text. Method: We applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model, based on research aspects, the topics of all English abstracts in CORD-19. Relevant named entities of each abstract were extracted and linked to the corresponding UMLS concept. Regular expressions and the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm were used to rank relevant papers. Results: Our tool has shown the potential to assist researchers by automating a topic-based search of CORD-19 papers. Nonetheless, we identified that more fine-tuned topic modeling parameters and increased accuracy of the research aspect classifier model could lead to a more accurate and reliable tool. Conclusion: We emphasize the need of new automated tools to help researchers find relevant COVID-19 documents, in addition to automatically extracting useful information contained in them.

Mining experimental data from Materials Science literature with Large Language Models: an evaluation study,"Luca Foppiano, Guillaume Lambard, Toshiyuki Amagasa, Masashi Ishii","This study is dedicated to assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4-Turbo in extracting structured information from scientific documents in materials science. To this end, we primarily focus on two critical tasks of information extraction: (i) a named entity recognition (NER) of studied materials and physical properties and (ii) a relation extraction (RE) between these entities. Due to the evident lack of datasets within Materials Informatics (MI), we evaluated using SuperMat, based on superconductor research, and MeasEval, a generic measurement evaluation corpus. The performance of LLMs in executing these tasks is benchmarked against traditional models based on the BERT architecture and rule-based approaches (baseline). We introduce a novel methodology for the comparative analysis of intricate material expressions, emphasising the standardisation of chemical formulas to tackle the complexities inherent in materials science information assessment. For NER, LLMs fail to outperform the baseline with zero-shot prompting and exhibit only limited improvement with few-shot prompting. However, a GPT-3.5-Turbo fine-tuned with the appropriate strategy for RE outperforms all models, including the baseline. Without any fine-tuning, GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo display remarkable reasoning and relationship extraction capabilities after being provided with merely a couple of examples, surpassing the baseline. Overall, the results suggest that although LLMs demonstrate relevant reasoning skills in connecting concepts, specialised models are currently a better choice for tasks requiring extracting complex domain-specific entities like materials. These insights provide initial guidance applicable to other materials science sub-domains in future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11052v3,2024-01

Pruning for Protection: Increasing Jailbreak Resistance in Aligned LLMs Without Fine-Tuning,"Adib Hasan, Ileana Rugina, Alex Wang","This paper investigates the impact of model compression on the way Large Language Models (LLMs) process prompts, particularly concerning jailbreak resistance. We show that moderate WANDA pruning can enhance resistance to jailbreaking attacks without fine-tuning, while maintaining performance on standard benchmarks. To systematically evaluate this safety enhancement, we introduce a dataset of 225 harmful tasks across five categories. Our analysis of LLaMA-2 Chat, Vicuna 1.3, and Mistral Instruct v0.2 reveals that pruning benefits correlate with initial model safety levels. We interpret these results by examining changes in attention patterns and perplexity shifts, demonstrating that pruned models exhibit sharper attention and increased sensitivity to artificial jailbreak constructs. We extend our evaluation to the AdvBench harmful behavior tasks and the GCG attack method. We find that LLaMA-2 is much safer on AdvBench prompts than on our dataset when evaluated with manual jailbreak attempts, and that pruning is effective against both automated attacks and manual jailbreaking on Advbench.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10862v3,2024-01
Advancements in eHealth Data Analytics through Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning,"Elena-Simona Apostol, Ciprian-Octavian Truică","The healthcare environment is commonly referred to as ""information-rich"" but also ""knowledge poor"". Healthcare systems collect huge amounts of data from various sources: lab reports, medical letters, logs of medical tools or programs, medical prescriptions, etc. These massive sets of data can provide great knowledge and information that can improve the medical services, and overall the healthcare domain, such as disease prediction by analyzing the patient's symptoms or disease prevention, by facilitating the discovery of behavioral factors for diseases. Unfortunately, only a relatively small volume of the textual eHealth data is processed and interpreted, an important factor being the difficulty in efficiently performing Big Data operations. In the medical field, detecting domain-specific multi-word terms is a crucial task as they can define an entire concept with a few words. A term can be defined as a linguistic structure or a concept, and it is composed of one or more words with a specific meaning to a domain. All the terms of a domain create its terminology. This chapter offers a critical study of the current, most performant solutions for analyzing unstructured (image and textual) eHealth data. This study also provides a comparison of the current Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning techniques in the eHealth context. Finally, we examine and discuss some of the current issues, and we define a set of research directions in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10850v1,2024-01
Using LLMs to discover emerging coded antisemitic hate-speech in extremist social media,"Dhanush Kikkisetti, Raza Ul Mustafa, Wendy Melillo, Roberto Corizzo, Zois Boukouvalas, Jeff Gill, Nathalie Japkowicz","Online hate speech proliferation has created a difficult problem for social media platforms. A particular challenge relates to the use of coded language by groups interested in both creating a sense of belonging for its users and evading detection. Coded language evolves quickly and its use varies over time. This paper proposes a methodology for detecting emerging coded hate-laden terminology. The methodology is tested in the context of online antisemitic discourse. The approach considers posts scraped from social media platforms, often used by extremist users. The posts are scraped using seed expressions related to previously known discourse of hatred towards Jews. The method begins by identifying the expressions most representative of each post and calculating their frequency in the whole corpus. It filters out grammatically incoherent expressions as well as previously encountered ones so as to focus on emergent well-formed terminology. This is followed by an assessment of semantic similarity to known antisemitic terminology using a fine-tuned large language model, and subsequent filtering out of the expressions that are too distant from known expressions of hatred. Emergent antisemitic expressions containing terms clearly relating to Jewish topics are then removed to return only coded expressions of hatred.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10841v2,2024-01
Recent Advances in Named Entity Recognition: A Comprehensive Survey and Comparative Study,"Imed Keraghel, Stanislas Morbieu, Mohamed Nadif","Named Entity Recognition seeks to extract substrings within a text that name real-world objects and to determine their type (for example, whether they refer to persons or organizations). In this survey, we first present an overview of recent popular approaches, including advancements in Transformer-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) that have not had much coverage in other surveys. In addition, we discuss reinforcement learning and graph-based approaches, highlighting their role in enhancing NER performance. Second, we focus on methods designed for datasets with scarce annotations. Third, we evaluate the performance of the main NER implementations on a variety of datasets with differing characteristics (as regards their domain, their size, and their number of classes). We thus provide a deep comparison of algorithms that have never been considered together. Our experiments shed some light on how the characteristics of datasets affect the behavior of the methods we compare.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10825v3,2024-01
Quantifying Similarity: Text-Mining Approaches to Evaluate ChatGPT and Google Bard Content in Relation to BioMedical Literature,"Jakub Klimczak, Ahmed Abdeen Hamed","Background: The emergence of generative AI tools, empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has shown powerful capabilities in generating content. To date, the assessment of the usefulness of such content, generated by what is known as prompt engineering, has become an interesting research question. Objectives Using the mean of prompt engineering, we assess the similarity and closeness of such contents to real literature produced by scientists. Methods In this exploratory analysis, (1) we prompt-engineer ChatGPT and Google Bard to generate clinical content to be compared with literature counterparts, (2) we assess the similarities of the contents generated by comparing them with counterparts from biomedical literature. Our approach is to use text-mining approaches to compare documents and associated bigrams and to use network analysis to assess the terms' centrality. Results The experiments demonstrated that ChatGPT outperformed Google Bard in cosine document similarity (38% to 34%), Jaccard document similarity (23% to 19%), TF-IDF bigram similarity (47% to 41%), and term network centrality (degree and closeness). We also found new links that emerged in ChatGPT bigram networks that did not exist in literature bigram networks. Conclusions: The obtained similarity results show that ChatGPT outperformed Google Bard in document similarity, bigrams, and degree and closeness centrality. We also observed that ChatGPT offers linkage to terms that are connected in the literature. Such connections could inspire asking interesting questions and generate new hypotheses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05116v2,2024-01
Medusa: Simple LLM Inference Acceleration Framework with Multiple Decoding Heads,"Tianle Cai, Yuhong Li, Zhengyang Geng, Hongwu Peng, Jason D. Lee, Deming Chen, Tri Dao","Large Language Models (LLMs) employ auto-regressive decoding that requires sequential computation, with each step reliant on the previous one's output. This creates a bottleneck as each step necessitates moving the full model parameters from High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to the accelerator's cache. While methods such as speculative decoding have been suggested to address this issue, their implementation is impeded by the challenges associated with acquiring and maintaining a separate draft model. In this paper, we present Medusa, an efficient method that augments LLM inference by adding extra decoding heads to predict multiple subsequent tokens in parallel. Using a tree-based attention mechanism, Medusa constructs multiple candidate continuations and verifies them simultaneously in each decoding step. By leveraging parallel processing, Medusa substantially reduces the number of decoding steps required. We present two levels of fine-tuning procedures for Medusa to meet the needs of different use cases: Medusa-1: Medusa is directly fine-tuned on top of a frozen backbone LLM, enabling lossless inference acceleration. Medusa-2: Medusa is fine-tuned together with the backbone LLM, enabling better prediction accuracy of Medusa heads and higher speedup but needing a special training recipe that preserves the backbone model's capabilities.   Moreover, we propose several extensions that improve or expand the utility of Medusa, including a self-distillation to handle situations where no training data is available and a typical acceptance scheme to boost the acceptance rate while maintaining generation quality. We evaluate Medusa on models of various sizes and training procedures. Our experiments demonstrate that Medusa-1 can achieve over 2.2x speedup without compromising generation quality, while Medusa-2 further improves the speedup to 2.3-3.6x.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10774v3,2024-01
Knowledge Verification to Nip Hallucination in the Bud,"Fanqi Wan, Xinting Huang, Leyang Cui, Xiaojun Quan, Wei Bi, Shuming Shi","While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various tasks following human alignment, they may still generate responses that sound plausible but contradict factual knowledge, a phenomenon known as hallucination. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of mitigating hallucinations by verifying and minimizing the inconsistency between external knowledge present in the alignment data and the intrinsic knowledge embedded within foundation LLMs. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called Knowledge Consistent Alignment (KCA), which employs a well-aligned LLM to automatically formulate assessments based on external knowledge to evaluate the knowledge boundaries of foundation LLMs. To address knowledge inconsistencies in the alignment data, KCA implements several specific strategies to deal with these data instances. We demonstrate the superior efficacy of KCA in reducing hallucinations across six benchmarks, utilizing foundation LLMs of varying backbones and scales. This confirms the effectiveness of mitigating hallucinations by reducing knowledge inconsistency. Our code, model weights, and data are openly accessible at \url{https://github.com/fanqiwan/KCA}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10768v5,2024-01
Combining topic modelling and citation network analysis to study case law from the European Court on Human Rights on the right to respect for private and family life,"M. Mohammadi, L. M. Bruijn, M. Wieling, M. Vols","As legal case law databases such as HUDOC continue to grow rapidly, it has become essential for legal researchers to find efficient methods to handle such large-scale data sets. Such case law databases usually consist of the textual content of cases together with the citations between them. This paper focuses on case law from the European Court of Human Rights on Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, the right to respect private and family life, home and correspondence. In this study, we demonstrate and compare the potential of topic modelling and citation network to find and organize case law on Article 8 based on their general themes and citation patterns, respectively. Additionally, we explore whether combining these two techniques leads to better results compared to the application of only one of the methods. We evaluate the effectiveness of the combined method on a unique manually collected and annotated dataset of Aricle 8 case law on evictions. The results of our experiments show that our combined (text and citation-based) approach provides the best results in finding and grouping case law, providing scholars with an effective way to extract and analyse relevant cases on a specific issue.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16429v1,2024-01
Structured Code Representations Enable Data-Efficient Adaptation of Code Language Models,"Mayank Agarwal, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Yoon Kim, Jie Chen","Current language models tailored for code tasks often adopt the pre-training-then-fine-tuning paradigm from natural language processing, modeling source code as plain text. This approach, however, overlooks the unambiguous structures inherent in programming languages. In this work, we explore data-efficient adaptation of pre-trained code models by further pre-training and fine-tuning them with program structures. Specifically, we represent programs as parse trees -- also known as concrete syntax trees (CSTs) -- and adapt pre-trained models on serialized CSTs. Although the models that we adapt have been pre-trained only on the surface form of programs, we find that a small amount of continual pre-training and fine-tuning on CSTs without changing the model architecture yields improvements over the baseline approach across various code tasks. The improvements are found to be particularly significant when there are limited training examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating program structures with plain-text representation even when working with backbone models that have not been pre-trained with structures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10716v1,2024-01
Q&A Prompts: Discovering Rich Visual Clues through Mining Question-Answer Prompts for VQA requiring Diverse World Knowledge,"Haibo Wang, Weifeng Ge","With the breakthrough of multi-modal large language models, answering complex visual questions that demand advanced reasoning abilities and world knowledge has become a much more important testbed for developing AI models than ever. However, equipping AI models with robust cross-modality reasoning ability remains challenging since the cognition scheme of humans has not been understood systematically. In this paper, we believe that if we can collect visual clues in the given image as much as possible, we will recognize the image more accurately, understand the question better, recall relevant knowledge more easily, and finally reason out the answer. We discover these rich visual clues by mining question-answer pairs in images and sending them into multi-modal large language models as prompts. We call the proposed method Q&A Prompts. Specifically, we first use the image-answer pairs and the corresponding questions in the training set as inputs and outputs to train a visual question generation model. Then, we use an image tagging model to identify various instances and send packaged image-tag pairs into the visual question generation model to generate relevant questions with the extracted image tags as answers. Finally, we encode these generated question-answer pairs as prompts with a visual-aware prompting module and send them into pre-trained multi-modal large language models to reason out the final answers. Experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our Q&A Prompts achieves substantial improvements on the challenging visual question answering datasets requiring reasoning over diverse world knowledge, such as OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10712v5,2024-01
Weakly Supervised Gaussian Contrastive Grounding with Large Multimodal Models for Video Question Answering,"Haibo Wang, Chenghang Lai, Yixuan Sun, Weifeng Ge","Video Question Answering (VideoQA) aims to answer natural language questions based on the information observed in videos. Despite the recent success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in image-language understanding and reasoning, they deal with VideoQA insufficiently, by simply taking uniformly sampled frames as visual inputs, which ignores question-relevant visual clues. Moreover, there are no human annotations for question-critical timestamps in existing VideoQA datasets. In light of this, we propose a novel weakly supervised framework to enforce the LMMs to reason out the answers with question-critical moments as visual inputs. Specifically, we first fuse the question and answer pairs as event descriptions to find multiple keyframes as target moments and pseudo-labels, with the visual-language alignment capability of the CLIP models. With these pseudo-labeled keyframes as additionally weak supervision, we devise a lightweight Gaussian-based Contrastive Grounding (GCG) module. GCG learns multiple Gaussian functions to characterize the temporal structure of the video, and sample question-critical frames as positive moments to be the visual inputs of LMMs. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our framework, and we achieve substantial improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10711v4,2024-01
LangBridge: Multilingual Reasoning Without Multilingual Supervision,"Dongkeun Yoon, Joel Jang, Sungdong Kim, Seungone Kim, Sheikh Shafayat, Minjoon Seo","We introduce LangBridge, a zero-shot approach to adapt language models for multilingual reasoning tasks without multilingual supervision. LangBridge operates by bridging two models, each specialized in different aspects: (1) one specialized in understanding multiple languages (e.g., mT5 encoder) and (2) one specialized in reasoning (e.g., MetaMath). LangBridge connects the two models by introducing minimal trainable parameters between them. Despite utilizing only English data for training, LangBridge considerably enhances the performance of language models on low-resource languages across mathematical reasoning, code completion, logical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. Our analysis suggests that the efficacy of LangBridge stems from the language-agnostic characteristics of multilingual representations. We publicly release our code and models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10695v2,2024-01
Accelerating Multilingual Language Model for Excessively Tokenized Languages,"Jimin Hong, Gibbeum Lee, Jaewoong Cho","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have remarkably enhanced performances on a variety of tasks in multiple languages. However, tokenizers in LLMs trained primarily on English-centric corpora often overly fragment a text into character or Unicode-level tokens in non-Roman alphabetic languages, leading to inefficient text generation. We introduce a simple yet effective framework to accelerate text generation in such languages. Our approach involves employing a new language model head with a vocabulary set tailored to a specific target language for a pre-trained LLM. This is followed by fine-tuning the new head while incorporating a verification step to ensure the model's performance is preserved. We show that this targeted fine-tuning, while freezing other model parameters, effectively reduces token fragmentation for the target language. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework increases the generation speed by a factor of 1.7 while maintaining the performance of pre-trained multilingual models on target monolingual tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10660v2,2024-01
Attentive Fusion: A Transformer-based Approach to Multimodal Hate Speech Detection,"Atanu Mandal, Gargi Roy, Amit Barman, Indranil Dutta, Sudip Kumar Naskar","With the recent surge and exponential growth of social media usage, scrutinizing social media content for the presence of any hateful content is of utmost importance. Researchers have been diligently working since the past decade on distinguishing between content that promotes hatred and content that does not. Traditionally, the main focus has been on analyzing textual content. However, recent research attempts have also commenced into the identification of audio-based content. Nevertheless, studies have shown that relying solely on audio or text-based content may be ineffective, as recent upsurge indicates that individuals often employ sarcasm in their speech and writing. To overcome these challenges, we present an approach to identify whether a speech promotes hate or not utilizing both audio and textual representations. Our methodology is based on the Transformer framework that incorporates both audio and text sampling, accompanied by our very own layer called ""Attentive Fusion"". The results of our study surpassed previous state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an impressive macro F1 score of 0.927 on the Test Set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10653v1,2024-01
"Sowing the Wind, Reaping the Whirlwind: The Impact of Editing Language Models","Rima Hazra, Sayan Layek, Somnath Banerjee, Soujanya Poria","In the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence, the concept of Red-Teaming or Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a crucial area of study. This approach is especially significant in terms of assessing and enhancing the safety and robustness of these models. This paper investigates the intricate consequences of such modifications through model editing, uncovering a complex relationship between enhancing model accuracy and preserving its ethical integrity. Our in-depth analysis reveals a striking paradox: while injecting accurate information is crucial for model reliability, it can paradoxically destabilize the model's foundational framework, resulting in unpredictable and potentially unsafe behaviors. Additionally, we propose a benchmark dataset NicheHazardQA to investigate this unsafe behavior both within the same and cross topical domain. This aspect of our research sheds light on how the edits, impact the model's safety metrics and guardrails. Our findings show that model editing serves as a cost-effective tool for topical red-teaming by methodically applying targeted edits and evaluating the resultant model behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10647v5,2024-01

Self-training from Self-memory in Data-to-text Generation,Hoang-Thang Ta,"This paper introduces a novel training model, self-training from self-memory (STSM) in data-to-text generation (DTG), allowing the model to self-train on subsets, including self-memory as outputs inferred directly from the trained models and/or the new data. The quality of self-memory is validated by two models, data-to-text (D2T) and text-to-data (T2D), by two pre-defined conditions: (1) the appearance of all source values in the outputs of the D2T model and (2) the ability to convert back to source data in the outputs in the T2D model. We utilize a greedy algorithm to generate shorter D2T outputs if they contain all source values. Subsequently, we use the T2D model to confirm that these outputs can capture input relationships by demonstrating their capacity to convert text back into data. With 30% of the dataset, we can train the D2T model with a competitive performance compared to full training in the same setup. We experiment with our model on two datasets, E2E NLG and DART. STSM offers the D2T model a generalization capability from its subset memory while reducing training data volume. Ultimately, we anticipate that this paper will contribute to continual learning solutions that adapt to new training data, incorporating it as a form of self-memory in DTG tasks.

Unlike prior models that depend on explicit task identification inputs, OrchMoE automatically discerns task categories, streamlining the learning process. This is achieved through an integrated mechanism comprising an Automatic Task Classification module and a Task-Skill Allocation module, which collectively deduce task-specific classifications and tailor skill allocation matrices. Our extensive evaluations on the 'Super Natural Instructions' dataset, featuring 1,600 diverse instructional tasks, indicate that OrchMoE substantially outperforms comparable multi-adapter baselines in terms of both performance and sample utilization efficiency, all while operating within the same parameter constraints.

Progressive Distillation Based on Masked Generation Feature Method for Knowledge Graph Completion,"Cunhang Fan, Yujie Chen, Jun Xue, Yonghui Kong, Jianhua Tao, Zhao Lv","In recent years, knowledge graph completion (KGC) models based on pre-trained language model (PLM) have shown promising results. However, the large number of parameters and high computational cost of PLM models pose challenges for their application in downstream tasks. This paper proposes a progressive distillation method based on masked generation features for KGC task, aiming to significantly reduce the complexity of pre-trained models. Specifically, we perform pre-distillation on PLM to obtain high-quality teacher models, and compress the PLM network to obtain multi-grade student models. However, traditional feature distillation suffers from the limitation of having a single representation of information in teacher models. To solve this problem, we propose masked generation of teacher-student features, which contain richer representation information. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in representation ability between teacher and student. Therefore, we design a progressive distillation method to distill student models at each grade level, enabling efficient knowledge transfer from teachers to students. The experimental results demonstrate that the model in the pre-distillation stage surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in the progressive distillation stage, the model significantly reduces the model parameters while maintaining a certain level of performance. Specifically, the model parameters of the lower-grade student model are reduced by 56.7\% compared to the baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12997v2,2024-01
Speech Swin-Transformer: Exploring a Hierarchical Transformer with Shifted Windows for Speech Emotion Recognition,"Yong Wang, Cheng Lu, Hailun Lian, Yan Zhao, Björn Schuller, Yuan Zong, Wenming Zheng","Swin-Transformer has demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision by leveraging its hierarchical feature representation based on Transformer. In speech signals, emotional information is distributed across different scales of speech features, e.\,g., word, phrase, and utterance. Drawing above inspiration, this paper presents a hierarchical speech Transformer with shifted windows to aggregate multi-scale emotion features for speech emotion recognition (SER), called Speech Swin-Transformer. Specifically, we first divide the speech spectrogram into segment-level patches in the time domain, composed of multiple frame patches. These segment-level patches are then encoded using a stack of Swin blocks, in which a local window Transformer is utilized to explore local inter-frame emotional information across frame patches of each segment patch. After that, we also design a shifted window Transformer to compensate for patch correlations near the boundaries of segment patches. Finally, we employ a patch merging operation to aggregate segment-level emotional features for hierarchical speech representation by expanding the receptive field of Transformer from frame-level to segment-level. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Speech Swin-Transformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10536v1,2024-01
"The ""Colonial Impulse"" of Natural Language Processing: An Audit of Bengali Sentiment Analysis Tools and Their Identity-based Biases","Dipto Das, Shion Guha, Jed Brubaker, Bryan Semaan","While colonization has sociohistorically impacted people's identities across various dimensions, those colonial values and biases continue to be perpetuated by sociotechnical systems. One category of sociotechnical systems--sentiment analysis tools--can also perpetuate colonial values and bias, yet less attention has been paid to how such tools may be complicit in perpetuating coloniality, although they are often used to guide various practices (e.g., content moderation). In this paper, we explore potential bias in sentiment analysis tools in the context of Bengali communities that have experienced and continue to experience the impacts of colonialism. Drawing on identity categories most impacted by colonialism amongst local Bengali communities, we focused our analytic attention on gender, religion, and nationality. We conducted an algorithmic audit of all sentiment analysis tools for Bengali, available on the Python package index (PyPI) and GitHub. Despite similar semantic content and structure, our analyses showed that in addition to inconsistencies in output from different tools, Bengali sentiment analysis tools exhibit bias between different identity categories and respond differently to different ways of identity expression. Connecting our findings with colonially shaped sociocultural structures of Bengali communities, we discuss the implications of downstream bias of sentiment analysis tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10535v1,2024-01
SocraSynth: Multi-LLM Reasoning with Conditional Statistics,Edward Y. Chang,"Large language models (LLMs), while promising, face criticisms for biases, hallucinations, and a lack of reasoning capability. This paper introduces SocraSynth, a multi-LLM agent reasoning platform developed to mitigate these issues. SocraSynth utilizes conditional statistics and systematic context enhancement through continuous arguments, alongside adjustable debate contentiousness levels. The platform typically involves a human moderator and two LLM agents representing opposing viewpoints on a given subject. SocraSynth operates in two main phases: knowledge generation and reasoning evaluation. In the knowledge generation phase, the moderator defines the debate topic and contentiousness level, prompting the agents to formulate supporting arguments for their respective stances. The reasoning evaluation phase then employs Socratic reasoning and formal logic principles to appraise the quality of the arguments presented. The dialogue concludes with the moderator adjusting the contentiousness from confrontational to collaborative, gathering final, conciliatory remarks to aid in human reasoning and decision-making. Through case studies in three distinct application domains, this paper showcases SocraSynth's effectiveness in fostering rigorous research, dynamic reasoning, comprehensive assessment, and enhanced collaboration. This underscores the value of multi-agent interactions in leveraging LLMs for advanced knowledge extraction and decision-making support.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06634v1,2024-01

However, current MLLM benchmarks are predominantly designed to evaluate reasoning based on static information about a single image, and the ability of modern MLLMs to extrapolate from image sequences, which is essential for understanding our ever-changing world, has been less investigated. To address this challenge, this paper introduces Mementos, a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs' sequential image reasoning abilities. Mementos features 4,761 diverse image sequences with varying lengths. We also employ a GPT-4 assisted method to evaluate MLLM reasoning performance. Through a careful evaluation of nine recent MLLMs on Mementos, including GPT-4V and Gemini, we find that they struggle to accurately describe dynamic information about given image sequences, often leading to hallucinations/misrepresentations of objects and their corresponding behaviors. Our quantitative analysis and case studies identify three key factors impacting MLLMs' sequential image reasoning: the correlation between object and behavioral hallucinations, the influence of cooccurring behaviors, and the compounding impact of behavioral hallucinations.

Cross-lingual Editing in Multilingual Language Models,"Himanshu Beniwal, Kowsik Nandagopan D, Mayank Singh","The training of large language models (LLMs) necessitates substantial data and computational resources, and updating outdated LLMs entails significant efforts and resources. While numerous model editing techniques (METs) have emerged to efficiently update model outputs without retraining, their effectiveness in multilingual LLMs, where knowledge is stored in diverse languages, remains an underexplored research area. This research paper introduces the cross-lingual model editing (\textbf{XME}) paradigm, wherein a fact is edited in one language, and the subsequent update propagation is observed across other languages. To investigate the XME paradigm, we conducted experiments using BLOOM, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa using the two writing scripts: \textit{Latin} (English, French, and Spanish) and \textit{Indic} (Hindi, Gujarati, and Bengali). The results reveal notable performance limitations of state-of-the-art METs under the XME setting, mainly when the languages involved belong to two distinct script families. These findings highlight the need for further research and development of XME techniques to address these challenges.

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can discover diverse solutions to complex real-world problems. Motivated by the common collective and directionality of text generation and evolution, this paper illustrates the parallels between LLMs and EAs, which includes multiple one-to-one key characteristics: token representation and individual representation, position encoding and fitness shaping, position embedding and selection, Transformers block and reproduction, and model training and parameter adaptation. By examining these parallels, we analyze existing interdisciplinary research, with a specific focus on evolutionary fine-tuning and LLM-enhanced EAs. Drawing from these insights, valuable future directions are presented for advancing the integration of LLMs and EAs, while highlighting key challenges along the way.

However, until now, there is no practical Text-to-SQL benchmark dataset for financial analysis, and existing Text-to-SQL methods have not considered the unique characteristics of databases in financial applications, such as commonly existing wide tables. To address these issues, we collect a practical Text-to-SQL benchmark dataset and propose a model-agnostic Large Language Model (LLMs)-based Text-to-SQL framework for financial analysis. The benchmark dataset, BULL, is collected from the practical financial analysis business of Hundsun Technologies Inc., including databases for fund, stock, and macro economy. Besides, the proposed LLMs-based Text-to-SQL framework, FinSQL, provides a systematic treatment for financial Text-to-SQL from the perspectives of prompt construction, parameter-efficient fine-tuning and output calibration. Extensive experimental results on BULL demonstrate that FinSQL achieves the state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL performance at a small cost; furthermore, FinSQL can bring up to 36.64% performance improvement in scenarios requiring few-shot cross-database model transfer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10506v1,2024-01
Knowledge Fusion of Large Language Models,"Fanqi Wan, Xinting Huang, Deng Cai, Xiaojun Quan, Wei Bi, Shuming Shi","While training large language models (LLMs) from scratch can generate models with distinct functionalities and strengths, it comes at significant costs and may result in redundant capabilities. Alternatively, a cost-effective and compelling approach is to merge existing pre-trained LLMs into a more potent model. However, due to the varying architectures of these LLMs, directly blending their weights is impractical. In this paper, we introduce the notion of knowledge fusion for LLMs, aimed at combining the capabilities of existing LLMs and transferring them into a single LLM. By leveraging the generative distributions of source LLMs, we externalize their collective knowledge and unique strengths, thereby potentially elevating the capabilities of the target model beyond those of any individual source LLM. We validate our approach using three popular LLMs with different architectures--Llama-2, MPT, and OpenLLaMA--across various benchmarks and tasks. Our findings confirm that the fusion of LLMs can improve the performance of the target model across a range of capabilities such as reasoning, commonsense, and code generation. Our code, model weights, and data are public at \url{https://github.com/fanqiwan/FuseLLM}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10491v2,2024-01
Generative Dense Retrieval: Memory Can Be a Burden,"Peiwen Yuan, Xinglin Wang, Shaoxiong Feng, Boyuan Pan, Yiwei Li, Heda Wang, Xupeng Miao, Kan Li","Generative Retrieval (GR), autoregressively decoding relevant document identifiers given a query, has been shown to perform well under the setting of small-scale corpora. By memorizing the document corpus with model parameters, GR implicitly achieves deep interaction between query and document. However, such a memorizing mechanism faces three drawbacks: (1) Poor memory accuracy for fine-grained features of documents; (2) Memory confusion gets worse as the corpus size increases; (3) Huge memory update costs for new documents. To alleviate these problems, we propose the Generative Dense Retrieval (GDR) paradigm. Specifically, GDR first uses the limited memory volume to achieve inter-cluster matching from query to relevant document clusters. Memorizing-free matching mechanism from Dense Retrieval (DR) is then introduced to conduct fine-grained intra-cluster matching from clusters to relevant documents. The coarse-to-fine process maximizes the advantages of GR's deep interaction and DR's scalability. Besides, we design a cluster identifier constructing strategy to facilitate corpus memory and a cluster-adaptive negative sampling strategy to enhance the intra-cluster mapping ability. Empirical results show that GDR obtains an average of 3.0 R@100 improvement on NQ dataset under multiple settings and has better scalability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10487v1,2024-01
Escape Sky-high Cost: Early-stopping Self-Consistency for Multi-step Reasoning,"Yiwei Li, Peiwen Yuan, Shaoxiong Feng, Boyuan Pan, Xinglin Wang, Bin Sun, Heda Wang, Kan Li","Self-consistency (SC) has been a widely used decoding strategy for chain-of-thought reasoning. Despite bringing significant performance improvements across a variety of multi-step reasoning tasks, it is a high-cost method that requires multiple sampling with the preset size. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable sampling process, \textbf{E}arly-Stopping \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{C}onsistency (ESC), to greatly reduce the cost of SC without sacrificing performance. On this basis, one control scheme for ESC is further derivated to dynamically choose the performance-cost balance for different tasks and models. To demonstrate ESC's effectiveness, we conducted extensive experiments on three popular categories of reasoning tasks: arithmetic, commonsense and symbolic reasoning over language models with varying scales. The empirical results show that ESC reduces the average number of sampling of chain-of-thought reasoning by a significant margin on six benchmarks, including MATH (-33.8%), GSM8K (-80.1%), StrategyQA (-76.8%), CommonsenseQA (-78.5%), Coin Flip (-84.2%) and Last Letters (-67.4%), while attaining comparable performances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10480v1,2024-01
Named Entity Recognition Under Domain Shift via Metric Learning for Life Sciences,"Hongyi Liu, Qingyun Wang, Payam Karisani, Heng Ji","Named entity recognition is a key component of Information Extraction (IE), particularly in scientific domains such as biomedicine and chemistry, where large language models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, fall short. We investigate the applicability of transfer learning for enhancing a named entity recognition model trained in the biomedical domain (the source domain) to be used in the chemical domain (the target domain). A common practice for training such a model in a few-shot learning setting is to pretrain the model on the labeled source data, and then, to finetune it on a hand-full of labeled target examples. In our experiments, we observed that such a model is prone to mislabeling the source entities, which can often appear in the text, as the target entities. To alleviate this problem, we propose a model to transfer the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, but, at the same time, to project the source entities and target entities into separate regions of the feature space. This diminishes the risk of mislabeling the source entities as the target entities. Our model consists of two stages: 1) entity grouping in the source domain, which incorporates knowledge from annotated events to establish relations between entities, and 2) entity discrimination in the target domain, which relies on pseudo labeling and contrastive learning to enhance discrimination between the entities in the two domains. We conduct our extensive experiments across three source and three target datasets, demonstrating that our method outperforms the baselines by up to 5% absolute value.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10472v2,2024-01
DeepEdit: Knowledge Editing as Decoding with Constraints,"Yiwei Wang, Muhao Chen, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang","How to edit the knowledge in multi-step reasoning has become the major challenge in the knowledge editing (KE) of large language models (LLMs). The difficulty arises because the hallucinations of LLMs during multi-step reasoning often lead to incorrect use of new knowledge and incorrect answers. To address this issue, we design decoding constraints to ""regulate"" LLMs' reasoning, enhancing logical coherence when incorporating new knowledge. We propose a new KE framework: DEEPEDIT (Depth-first Search-based Constrained Decoding for Knowledge Editing), which enhances LLMs's ability to generate coherent reasoning chains with new knowledge through depth-first search. Our search selects the most important knowledge that satisfies our constraints as the reasoning step to efficiently increase the reasoning depth. In addition to DEEPEDIT, we propose two new KE benchmarks: MQUAKE-2002 and MQUAKE-HARD, which provide more precise and challenging assessments of KE approaches. Qualitatively, DEEPEDIT enables LLMs to produce succinct and coherent reasoning chains involving new knowledge. Quantitatively, it yields significant improvements on multiple KE benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10471v5,2024-01
Data-driven grapheme-to-phoneme representations for a lexicon-free text-to-speech,"Abhinav Garg, Jiyeon Kim, Sushil Khyalia, Chanwoo Kim, Dhananjaya Gowda","Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) is an essential first step in any modern, high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) system. Most of the current G2P systems rely on carefully hand-crafted lexicons developed by experts. This poses a two-fold problem. Firstly, the lexicons are generated using a fixed phoneme set, usually, ARPABET or IPA, which might not be the most optimal way to represent phonemes for all languages. Secondly, the man-hours required to produce such an expert lexicon are very high. In this paper, we eliminate both of these issues by using recent advances in self-supervised learning to obtain data-driven phoneme representations instead of fixed representations. We compare our lexicon-free approach against strong baselines that utilize a well-crafted lexicon. Furthermore, we show that our data-driven lexicon-free method performs as good or even marginally better than the conventional rule-based or lexicon-based neural G2Ps in terms of Mean Opinion Score (MOS) while using no prior language lexicon or phoneme set, i.e. no linguistic expertise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10465v1,2024-01
Critical Data Size of Language Models from a Grokking Perspective,"Xuekai Zhu, Yao Fu, Bowen Zhou, Zhouhan Lin","We explore the critical data size in language models, a threshold that marks a fundamental shift from quick memorization to slow generalization. We formalize the phase transition under the grokking configuration into the Data Efficiency Hypothesis and identify data insufficiency, sufficiency, and surplus regimes in language models training dynamics. We develop a grokking configuration to reproduce grokking on simplistic language models stably by rescaling initialization and weight decay. We show that generalization occurs only when language models reach a critical size. We analyze grokking across sample-wise and model-wise, verifying the proposed data efficiency hypothesis. Our experiments reveal smoother phase transitions occurring at the critical dataset size for language datasets. As the model size increases, this critical point also becomes larger, indicating that larger models require more data. Our results deepen the understanding of language model training, offering a novel perspective on the role of data in the learning mechanism of language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10463v3,2024-01
Contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition with Attention-Based Bias Phrase Boosted Beam Search,"Yui Sudo, Muhammad Shakeel, Yosuke Fukumoto, Yifan Peng, Shinji Watanabe","End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) methods exhibit remarkable performance. However, since the performance of such methods is intrinsically linked to the context present in the training data, E2E-ASR methods do not perform as desired for unseen user contexts (e.g., technical terms, personal names, and playlists). Thus, E2E-ASR methods must be easily contextualized by the user or developer. This paper proposes an attention-based contextual biasing method that can be customized using an editable phrase list (referred to as a bias list). The proposed method can be trained effectively by combining a bias phrase index loss and special tokens to detect the bias phrases in the input speech data. In addition, to improve the contextualization performance during inference further, we propose a bias phrase boosted (BPB) beam search algorithm based on the bias phrase index probability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves the word error rate and the character error rate of the target phrases in the bias list on both the Librispeech-960 (English) and our in-house (Japanese) dataset, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10449v1,2024-01
Investigating Training Strategies and Model Robustness of Low-Rank Adaptation for Language Modeling in Speech Recognition,"Yu Yu, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Tuan Dinh, Sungho Ryu, Jari Kolehmainen, Roger Ren, Denis Filimonov, Prashanth G. Shivakumar, Ankur Gandhe, Ariya Rastow, Jia Xu, Ivan Bulyko, Andreas Stolcke","The use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with frozen pretrained language models (PLMs) has become increasing popular as a mainstream, resource-efficient modeling approach for memory-constrained hardware. In this study, we first explore how to enhance model performance by introducing various LoRA training strategies, achieving relative word error rate reductions of 3.50\% on the public Librispeech dataset and of 3.67\% on an internal dataset in the messaging domain. To further characterize the stability of LoRA-based second-pass speech recognition models, we examine robustness against input perturbations. These perturbations are rooted in homophone replacements and a novel metric called N-best Perturbation-based Rescoring Robustness (NPRR), both designed to measure the relative degradation in the performance of rescoring models. Our experimental results indicate that while advanced variants of LoRA, such as dynamic rank-allocated LoRA, lead to performance degradation in $1$-best perturbation, they alleviate the degradation in $N$-best perturbation. This finding is in comparison to fully-tuned models and vanilla LoRA tuning baselines, suggesting that a comprehensive selection is needed when using LoRA-based adaptation for compute-cost savings and robust language modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10447v1,2024-01
Large Language Models are Efficient Learners of Noise-Robust Speech Recognition,"Yuchen Hu, Chen Chen, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Ruizhe Li, Chao Zhang, Pin-Yu Chen, EnSiong Chng","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have promoted generative error correction (GER) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), which leverages the rich linguistic knowledge and powerful reasoning ability of LLMs to improve recognition results. The latest work proposes a GER benchmark with HyPoradise dataset to learn the mapping from ASR N-best hypotheses to ground-truth transcription by efficient LLM finetuning, which shows great effectiveness but lacks specificity on noise-robust ASR. In this work, we extend the benchmark to noisy conditions and investigate if we can teach LLMs to perform denoising for GER just like what robust ASR do}, where one solution is introducing noise information as a conditioner into LLM. However, directly incorporating noise embeddings from audio encoder could harm the LLM tuning due to cross-modality gap. To this end, we propose to extract a language-space noise embedding from the N-best list to represent the noise conditions of source speech, which can promote the denoising process in GER. Furthermore, in order to enhance its representation ability of audio noise, we design a knowledge distillation (KD) approach via mutual information estimation to distill the real noise information in audio embeddings to our language embedding. Experiments on various latest LLMs demonstrate our approach achieves a new breakthrough with up to 53.9% correction improvement in terms of word error rate while with limited training data. Analysis shows that our language-space noise embedding can well represent the noise conditions of source speech, under which off-the-shelf LLMs show strong ability of language-space denoising.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10446v1,2024-01
Breaking the Curse of Multilinguality with Cross-lingual Expert Language Models,"Terra Blevins, Tomasz Limisiewicz, Suchin Gururangan, Margaret Li, Hila Gonen, Noah A. Smith, Luke Zettlemoyer","Despite their popularity in non-English NLP, multilingual language models often underperform monolingual ones due to inter-language competition for model parameters. We propose Cross-lingual Expert Language Models (X-ELM), which mitigate this competition by independently training language models on subsets of the multilingual corpus. This process specializes X-ELMs to different languages while remaining effective as a multilingual ensemble. Our experiments show that when given the same compute budget, X-ELM outperforms jointly trained multilingual models across all considered languages and that these gains transfer to downstream tasks. X-ELM provides additional benefits over performance improvements: new experts can be iteratively added, adapting X-ELM to new languages without catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, training is asynchronous, reducing the hardware requirements for multilingual training and democratizing multilingual modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10440v2,2024-01
Can Large Language Model Summarizers Adapt to Diverse Scientific Communication Goals?,"Marcio Fonseca, Shay B. Cohen","In this work, we investigate the controllability of large language models (LLMs) on scientific summarization tasks. We identify key stylistic and content coverage factors that characterize different types of summaries such as paper reviews, abstracts, and lay summaries. By controlling stylistic features, we find that non-fine-tuned LLMs outperform humans in the MuP review generation task, both in terms of similarity to reference summaries and human preferences. Also, we show that we can improve the controllability of LLMs with keyword-based classifier-free guidance (CFG) while achieving lexical overlap comparable to strong fine-tuned baselines on arXiv and PubMed. However, our results also indicate that LLMs cannot consistently generate long summaries with more than 8 sentences. Furthermore, these models exhibit limited capacity to produce highly abstractive lay summaries. Although LLMs demonstrate strong generic summarization competency, sophisticated content control without costly fine-tuning remains an open problem for domain-specific applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10415v2,2024-01
Learning High-Quality and General-Purpose Phrase Representations,"Lihu Chen, Gaël Varoquaux, Fabian M. Suchanek","Phrase representations play an important role in data science and natural language processing, benefiting various tasks like Entity Alignment, Record Linkage, Fuzzy Joins, and Paraphrase Classification. The current state-of-the-art method involves fine-tuning pre-trained language models for phrasal embeddings using contrastive learning. However, we have identified areas for improvement. First, these pre-trained models tend to be unnecessarily complex and require to be pre-trained on a corpus with context sentences. Second, leveraging the phrase type and morphology gives phrase representations that are both more precise and more flexible. We propose an improved framework to learn phrase representations in a context-free fashion. The framework employs phrase type classification as an auxiliary task and incorporates character-level information more effectively into the phrase representation. Furthermore, we design three granularities of data augmentation to increase the diversity of training samples. Our experiments across a wide range of tasks show that our approach generates superior phrase embeddings compared to previous methods while requiring a smaller model size.

Noise Contrastive Estimation-based Matching Framework for Low-Resource Security Attack Pattern Recognition,"Tu Nguyen, Nedim Šrndić, Alexander Neth","Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) represent sophisticated attack patterns in the cybersecurity domain, described encyclopedically in textual knowledge bases. Identifying TTPs in cybersecurity writing, often called TTP mapping, is an important and challenging task. Conventional learning approaches often target the problem in the classical multi-class or multilabel classification setting. This setting hinders the learning ability of the model due to a large number of classes (i.e., TTPs), the inevitable skewness of the label distribution and the complex hierarchical structure of the label space. We formulate the problem in a different learning paradigm, where the assignment of a text to a TTP label is decided by the direct semantic similarity between the two, thus reducing the complexity of competing solely over the large labeling space. To that end, we propose a neural matching architecture with an effective sampling-based learn-to-compare mechanism, facilitating the learning process of the matching model despite constrained resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10337v3,2024-01
ChatQA: Surpassing GPT-4 on Conversational QA and RAG,"Zihan Liu, Wei Ping, Rajarshi Roy, Peng Xu, Chankyu Lee, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro","In this work, we introduce ChatQA, a suite of models that outperform GPT-4 on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and conversational question answering (QA).

To address this, this paper presents MM-Interleaved, an end-to-end generative model for interleaved image-text data.

Chem-FINESE: Validating Fine-Grained Few-shot Entity Extraction through Text Reconstruction,"Qingyun Wang, Zixuan Zhang, Hongxiang Li, Xuan Liu, Jiawei Han, Huimin Zhao, Heng Ji","Fine-grained few-shot entity extraction in the chemical domain faces two unique challenges. First, compared with entity extraction tasks in the general domain, sentences from chemical papers usually contain more entities. Moreover, entity extraction models usually have difficulty extracting entities of long-tailed types. In this paper, we propose Chem-FINESE, a novel sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) based few-shot entity extraction approach, to address these two challenges. Our Chem-FINESE has two components: a seq2seq entity extractor to extract named entities from the input sentence and a seq2seq self-validation module to reconstruct the original input sentence from extracted entities. Inspired by the fact that a good entity extraction system needs to extract entities faithfully, our new self-validation module leverages entity extraction results to reconstruct the original input sentence. Besides, we design a new contrastive loss to reduce excessive copying during the extraction process. Finally, we release ChemNER+, a new fine-grained chemical entity extraction dataset that is annotated by domain experts with the ChemNER schema. Experiments in few-shot settings with both ChemNER+ and CHEMET datasets show that our newly proposed framework has contributed up to 8.26% and 6.84% absolute F1-score gains respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10189v4,2024-01

We find that open LLMs (Llama 2, Mistral, and Zephyr) can generate fluent and coherent texts in zero-shot settings from data in common formats collected with Quintd. However, we show that the semantic accuracy of the outputs is a major issue: both according to human annotators and our reference-free metric based on GPT-4, more than 80% of the outputs of open LLMs contain at least one semantic error.

A Comparison of Veterans with Problematic Opioid Use Identified through Natural Language Processing of Clinical Notes versus Using Diagnostic Codes,"Terri Elizabeth Workman, Joel Kupersmith, Phillip Ma, Christopher Spevak, Friedhelm Sandbrink, Yan Cheng Qing Zeng-Treitler","Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a data source for opioid research. Opioid use disorder is known to be under-coded as a diagnosis, yet problematic opioid use can be documented in clinical notes.   Objectives: Our goals were 1) to identify problematic opioid use from a full range of clinical notes; and 2) to compare the characteristics of patients identified as having problematic opioid use, exclusively documented in clinical notes, to those having documented ICD opioid use disorder diagnostic codes.   Materials and Methods: We developed and applied a natural language processing (NLP) tool to the clinical notes of a patient cohort (n=222,371) from two Veteran Affairs service regions to identify patients with problematic opioid use. We also used a set of ICD diagnostic codes to identify patients with opioid use disorder from the same cohort. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients identified only through NLP, to those of patients identified through ICD codes.   Results: NLP exclusively identified 57,331 patients; 6,997 patients had positive ICD code identifications. Patients exclusively identified through NLP were more likely to be women. Those identified through ICD codes were more likely to be male, younger, have concurrent benzodiazepine prescriptions, more comorbidities, more care encounters, and less likely to be married. Patients in the NLP and ICD groups had substantially elevated comorbidity levels compared to patients not documented as experiencing problematic opioid use.   Conclusions: NLP is a feasible approach for identifying problematic opioid use not otherwise recorded by ICD codes. Clinicians may be reluctant to code for opioid use disorder. It is therefore incumbent on the healthcare team to search for documentation of opioid concerns within clinical notes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12996v1,2024-01
Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model for Traffic Prediction,"Chenxi Liu, Sun Yang, Qianxiong Xu, Zhishuai Li, Cheng Long, Ziyue Li, Rui Zhao","Traffic prediction, an essential component for intelligent transportation systems, endeavours to use historical data to foresee future traffic features at specific locations. Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not improved. Recently, large language models have shown outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive pretraining while maintaining their fundamental structures. Motivated by these developments, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. In the ST-LLM, we define timesteps at each location as tokens and design a spatial-temporal embedding to learn the spatial location and global temporal patterns of these tokens. Additionally, we integrate these embeddings by a fusion convolution to each token for a unified spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, we innovate a partially frozen attention strategy to adapt the LLM to capture global spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM is a powerful spatial-temporal learner that outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and zero-shot prediction scenarios.

Adapters Mixup: Mixing Parameter-Efficient Adapters to Enhance the Adversarial Robustness of Fine-tuned Pre-trained Text Classifiers,"Tuc Nguyen, Thai Le","Existing works show that augmenting the training data of pre-trained language models (PLMs) for classification tasks fine-tuned via parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (PEFT) using both clean and adversarial examples can enhance their robustness under adversarial attacks. However, this adversarial training paradigm often leads to performance degradation on clean inputs and requires frequent re-training on the entire data to account for new, unknown attacks. To overcome these challenges while still harnessing the benefits of adversarial training and the efficiency of PEFT, this work proposes a novel approach, called AdpMixup, that combines two paradigms: (1) fine-tuning through adapters and (2) adversarial augmentation via mixup to dynamically leverage existing knowledge from a set of pre-known attacks for robust inference. Intuitively, AdpMixup fine-tunes PLMs with multiple adapters with both clean and pre-known adversarial examples and intelligently mixes them up in different ratios during prediction. Our experiments show AdpMixup achieves the best trade-off between training efficiency and robustness under both pre-known and unknown attacks, compared to existing baselines on five downstream tasks across six varied black-box attacks and 2 PLMs. All source code will be available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10111v2,2024-01
Power in Numbers: Robust reading comprehension by finetuning with four adversarial sentences per example,Ariel Marcus,"Recent models have achieved human level performance on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset when using F1 scores to evaluate the reading comprehension task. Yet, teaching machines to comprehend text has not been solved in the general case. By appending one adversarial sentence to the context paragraph, past research has shown that the F1 scores from reading comprehension models drop almost in half. In this paper, I replicate past adversarial research with a new model, ELECTRA-Small, and demonstrate that the new model's F1 score drops from 83.9% to 29.2%. To improve ELECTRA-Small's resistance to this attack, I finetune the model on SQuAD v1.1 training examples with one to five adversarial sentences appended to the context paragraph. Like past research, I find that the finetuned model on one adversarial sentence does not generalize well across evaluation datasets. However, when finetuned on four or five adversarial sentences the model attains an F1 score of more than 70% on most evaluation datasets with multiple appended and prepended adversarial sentences.

However, the commonly used FL approach (i.e., \textsc{FedAvg}) in S2T tasks typically suffers from extensive communication overhead due to multi-round interactions based on the whole model and performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity among clients.To address these issues, we propose a personalized federated S2T framework that introduces \textsc{FedLoRA}, a lightweight LoRA module for client-side tuning and interaction with the server to minimize communication overhead, and \textsc{FedMem}, a global model equipped with a $k$-nearest-neighbor ($k$NN) classifier that captures client-specific distributional shifts to achieve personalization and overcome data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments based on Conformer and Whisper backbone models on CoVoST and GigaSpeech benchmarks show that our approach significantly reduces the communication overhead on all S2T tasks and effectively personalizes the global model to overcome data heterogeneity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10070v1,2024-01
Code Prompting Elicits Conditional Reasoning Abilities in Text+Code LLMs,"Haritz Puerto, Martin Tutek, Somak Aditya, Xiaodan Zhu, Iryna Gurevych","Reasoning is a fundamental component of language understanding. Recent prompting techniques, such as chain of thought, have consistently improved LLMs' performance on various reasoning tasks. Nevertheless, there is still little understanding of what triggers reasoning abilities in LLMs in the inference stage. In this paper, we introduce code prompting, a chain of prompts that transforms a natural language problem into code and directly prompts the LLM using the generated code without resorting to external code execution. We hypothesize that code prompts can elicit certain reasoning capabilities of LLMs trained on text and code and utilize the proposed method to improve conditional reasoning, the ability to infer different conclusions depending on the fulfillment of certain conditions. We find that code prompting exhibits a high-performance boost for multiple LLMs (up to 22.52 percentage points on GPT 3.5, 7.75 on Mixtral, and 16.78 on Mistral) across multiple conditional reasoning datasets. We then conduct comprehensive experiments to understand how code prompts trigger reasoning abilities and which capabilities are elicited in the underlying models. Our analysis of GPT 3.5 reveals that the code formatting of the input problem is essential for performance improvement. Furthermore, code prompts improve sample efficiency of in-context learning and facilitate state tracking of variables or entities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10065v3,2024-01
Harmonizing Code-mixed Conversations: Personality-assisted Code-mixed Response Generation in Dialogues,"Shivani Kumar, Tanmoy Chakraborty","Code-mixing, the blending of multiple languages within a single conversation, introduces a distinctive challenge, particularly in the context of response generation. Capturing the intricacies of code-mixing proves to be a formidable task, given the wide-ranging variations influenced by individual speaking styles and cultural backgrounds. In this study, we explore response generation within code-mixed conversations. We introduce a novel approach centered on harnessing the Big Five personality traits acquired in an unsupervised manner from the conversations to bolster the performance of response generation. These inferred personality attributes are seamlessly woven into the fabric of the dialogue context, using a novel fusion mechanism, PA3. It uses an effective two-step attention formulation to fuse the dialogue and personality information. This fusion not only enhances the contextual relevance of generated responses but also elevates the overall performance of the model. Our experimental results, grounded in a dataset comprising of multi-party Hindi-English code-mix conversations, highlight the substantial advantages offered by personality-infused models over their conventional counterparts. This is evident in the increase observed in ROUGE and BLUE scores for the response generation task when the identified personality is seamlessly integrated into the dialogue context. Qualitative assessment for personality identification and response generation aligns well with our quantitative results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12995v1,2024-01
Antonym vs Synonym Distinction using InterlaCed Encoder NETworks (ICE-NET),"Muhammad Asif Ali, Yan Hu, Jianbin Qin, Di Wang","Antonyms vs synonyms distinction is a core challenge in lexico-semantic analysis and automated lexical resource construction. These pairs share a similar distributional context which makes it harder to distinguish them. Leading research in this regard attempts to capture the properties of the relation pairs, i.e., symmetry, transitivity, and trans-transitivity. However, the inability of existing research to appropriately model the relation-specific properties limits their end performance. In this paper, we propose InterlaCed Encoder NETworks (i.e., ICE-NET) for antonym vs synonym distinction, that aim to capture and model the relation-specific properties of the antonyms and synonyms pairs in order to perform the classification task in a performance-enhanced manner. Experimental evaluation using the benchmark datasets shows that ICE-NET outperforms the existing research by a relative score of upto 1.8% in F1-measure. We release the codes for ICE-NET at https://github.com/asif6827/ICENET.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10045v1,2024-01
Large Language Models for Scientific Information Extraction: An Empirical Study for Virology,"Mahsa Shamsabadi, Jennifer D'Souza, Sören Auer","In this paper, we champion the use of structured and semantic content representation of discourse-based scholarly communication, inspired by tools like Wikipedia infoboxes or structured Amazon product descriptions. These representations provide users with a concise overview, aiding scientists in navigating the dense academic landscape. Our novel automated approach leverages the robust text generation capabilities of LLMs to produce structured scholarly contribution summaries, offering both a practical solution and insights into LLMs' emergent abilities.   For LLMs, the prime focus is on improving their general intelligence as conversational agents. We argue that these models can also be applied effectively in information extraction (IE), specifically in complex IE tasks within terse domains like Science. This paradigm shift replaces the traditional modular, pipelined machine learning approach with a simpler objective expressed through instructions. Our results show that finetuned FLAN-T5 with 1000x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art GPT-davinci is competitive for the task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10040v1,2024-01
Evolutionary Computation in the Era of Large Language Model: Survey and Roadmap,"Xingyu Wu, Sheng-hao Wu, Jibin Wu, Liang Feng, Kay Chen Tan","Large language models (LLMs) have not only revolutionized natural language processing but also extended their prowess to various domains, marking a significant stride towards artificial general intelligence. The interplay between LLMs and evolutionary algorithms (EAs), despite differing in objectives and methodologies, share a common pursuit of applicability in complex problems. Meanwhile, EA can provide an optimization framework for LLM's further enhancement under black-box settings, empowering LLM with flexible global search capacities. On the other hand, the abundant domain knowledge inherent in LLMs could enable EA to conduct more intelligent searches. Furthermore, the text processing and generative capabilities of LLMs would aid in deploying EAs across a wide range of tasks. Based on these complementary advantages, this paper provides a thorough review and a forward-looking roadmap, categorizing the reciprocal inspiration into two main avenues: LLM-enhanced EA and EA-enhanced LLM. Some integrated synergy methods are further introduced to exemplify the complementarity between LLMs and EAs in diverse scenarios, including code generation, software engineering, neural architecture search, and various generation tasks. As the first comprehensive review focused on the EA research in the era of LLMs, this paper provides a foundational stepping stone for understanding the collaborative potential of LLMs and EAs. The identified challenges and future directions offer guidance for researchers and practitioners to unlock the full potential of this innovative collaboration in propelling advancements in optimization and artificial intelligence.

Framing Analysis of Health-Related Narratives: Conspiracy versus Mainstream Media,"Markus Reiter-Haas, Beate Klösch, Markus Hadler, Elisabeth Lex","Understanding how online media frame issues is crucial due to their impact on public opinion. Research on framing using natural language processing techniques mainly focuses on specific content features in messages and neglects their narrative elements. Also, the distinction between framing in different sources remains an understudied problem. We address those issues and investigate how the framing of health-related topics, such as COVID-19 and other diseases, differs between conspiracy and mainstream websites. We incorporate narrative information into the framing analysis by introducing a novel frame extraction approach based on semantic graphs. We find that health-related narratives in conspiracy media are predominantly framed in terms of beliefs, while mainstream media tend to present them in terms of science. We hope our work offers new ways for a more nuanced frame analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10030v1,2024-01
Self-Rewarding Language Models,"Weizhe Yuan, Richard Yuanzhe Pang, Kyunghyun Cho, Xian Li, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jing Xu, Jason Weston","We posit that to achieve superhuman agents, future models require superhuman feedback in order to provide an adequate training signal. Current approaches commonly train reward models from human preferences, which may then be bottlenecked by human performance level, and secondly these separate frozen reward models cannot then learn to improve during LLM training. In this work, we study Self-Rewarding Language Models, where the language model itself is used via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting to provide its own rewards during training. We show that during Iterative DPO training that not only does instruction following ability improve, but also the ability to provide high-quality rewards to itself. Fine-tuning Llama 2 70B on three iterations of our approach yields a model that outperforms many existing systems on the AlpacaEval 2.0 leaderboard, including Claude 2, Gemini Pro, and GPT-4 0613. While there is much left still to explore, this work opens the door to the possibility of models that can continually improve in both axes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10020v2,2024-01
R-Judge: Benchmarking Safety Risk Awareness for LLM Agents,"Tongxin Yuan, Zhiwei He, Lingzhong Dong, Yiming Wang, Ruijie Zhao, Tian Xia, Lizhen Xu, Binglin Zhou, Fangqi Li, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang, Gongshen Liu","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited great potential in autonomously completing tasks across real-world applications. Despite this, these LLM agents introduce unexpected safety risks when operating in interactive environments. Instead of centering on the harmlessness of LLM-generated content in most prior studies, this work addresses the imperative need for benchmarking the behavioral safety of LLM agents within diverse environments. We introduce R-Judge, a benchmark crafted to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in judging and identifying safety risks given agent interaction records. R-Judge comprises 569 records of multi-turn agent interaction, encompassing 27 key risk scenarios among 5 application categories and 10 risk types. It is of high-quality curation with annotated safety labels and risk descriptions. Evaluation of 11 LLMs on R-Judge shows considerable room for enhancing the risk awareness of LLMs: The best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves 74.42% while no other models significantly exceed the random. Moreover, we reveal that risk awareness in open agent scenarios is a multi-dimensional capability involving knowledge and reasoning, thus challenging for LLMs. With further experiments, we find that fine-tuning on safety judgment significantly improve model performance while straightforward prompting mechanisms fail. R-Judge is publicly available at https://github.com/Lordog/R-Judge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10019v3,2024-01

This paper presents a novel approach to develop a VLM with the ability to conduct explicit reasoning based on visual content and textual instructions. We introduce a system that can ask a question to acquire necessary knowledge, thereby enhancing the robustness and explicability of the reasoning process. To this end, we developed a novel dataset generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), designed to promote chain-of-thought reasoning combined with a question-asking mechanism. The dataset covers a range of tasks, from common ones like caption generation to specialized VQA tasks that require expert knowledge. Furthermore, using the dataset we created, we fine-tuned an existing VLM. This training enabled the models to generate questions and perform iterative reasoning during inference. The results demonstrated a stride toward a more robust, accurate, and interpretable VLM, capable of reasoning explicitly and seeking information proactively when confronted with ambiguous visual input.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10005v2,2024-01
Distantly Supervised Morpho-Syntactic Model for Relation Extraction,"Nicolas Gutehrlé, Iana Atanassova","The task of Information Extraction (IE) involves automatically converting unstructured textual content into structured data. Most research in this field concentrates on extracting all facts or a specific set of relationships from documents. In this paper, we present a method for the extraction and categorisation of an unrestricted set of relationships from text. Our method relies on morpho-syntactic extraction patterns obtained by a distant supervision method, and creates Syntactic and Semantic Indices to extract and classify candidate graphs. We evaluate our approach on six datasets built on Wikidata and Wikipedia. The evaluation shows that our approach can achieve Precision scores of up to 0.85, but with lower Recall and F1 scores. Our approach allows to quickly create rule-based systems for Information Extraction and to build annotated datasets to train machine-learning and deep-learning based classifiers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10002v1,2024-01
Gradable ChatGPT Translation Evaluation,"Hui Jiao, Bei Peng, Lu Zong, Xiaojun Zhang, Xinwei Li","ChatGPT, as a language model based on large-scale pre-training, has exerted a profound influence on the domain of machine translation. In ChatGPT, a ""Prompt"" refers to a segment of text or instruction employed to steer the model towards generating a specific category of response. The design of the translation prompt emerges as a key aspect that can wield influence over factors such as the style, precision and accuracy of the translation to a certain extent. However, there is a lack of a common standard and methodology on how to design and select a translation prompt. Accordingly, this paper proposes a generic taxonomy, which defines gradable translation prompts in terms of expression type, translation style, POS information and explicit statement, thus facilitating the construction of prompts endowed with distinct attributes tailored for various translation tasks.

Better Explain Transformers by Illuminating Important Information,"Linxin Song, Yan Cui, Ao Luo, Freddy Lecue, Irene Li","Transformer-based models excel in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, attracting countless efforts to explain their inner workings. Prior methods explain Transformers by focusing on the raw gradient and attention as token attribution scores, where non-relevant information is often considered during explanation computation, resulting in confusing results. In this work, we propose highlighting the important information and eliminating irrelevant information by a refined information flow on top of the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method. Specifically, we consider identifying syntactic and positional heads as important attention heads and focus on the relevance obtained from these important heads. Experimental results demonstrate that irrelevant information does distort output attribution scores and then should be masked during explanation computation. Compared to eight baselines on both classification and question-answering datasets, our method consistently outperforms with over 3\% to 33\% improvement on explanation metrics, providing superior explanation performance.

Sketch-Guided Constrained Decoding for Boosting Blackbox Large Language Models without Logit Access,"Saibo Geng, Berkay Döner, Chris Wendler, Martin Josifoski, Robert West","Constrained decoding, a technique for enforcing constraints on language model outputs, offers a way to control text generation without retraining or architectural modifications. Its application is, however, typically restricted to models that give users access to next-token distributions (usually via softmax logits), which poses a limitation with blackbox large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces sketch-guided constrained decoding (SGCD), a novel approach to constrained decoding for blackbox LLMs, which operates without access to the logits of the blackbox LLM. SGCD utilizes a locally hosted auxiliary model to refine the output of an unconstrained blackbox LLM, effectively treating this initial output as a ""sketch"" for further elaboration. This approach is complementary to traditional logit-based techniques and enables the application of constrained decoding in settings where full model transparency is unavailable. We demonstrate the efficacy of SGCD through experiments in closed information extraction and constituency parsing, showing how it enhances the utility and flexibility of blackbox LLMs for complex NLP tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09967v4,2024-01

Multimodal models, an extension of Large Language Models (LLMs), have exhibited remarkable capabilities in addressing a diverse array of tasks, ranging from image captioning and visual question answering (VQA) to visual grounding. While these models have showcased significant advancements, challenges persist in accurately interpreting images and answering the question, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the multimodal capabilities of existing models. In response to the limitations observed in current Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our proposed model Veagle, incorporates a unique mechanism inspired by the successes and insights of previous works. Veagle leverages a dynamic mechanism to project encoded visual information directly into the language model. This dynamic approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of intricate details present in visual contexts. To validate the effectiveness of Veagle, we conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, emphasizing tasks such as visual question answering and image understanding. Our results indicate a improvement of 5-6 \% in performance, with Veagle outperforming existing models by a notable margin. The outcomes underscore the model's versatility and applicability beyond traditional benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08773v2,2024-01
Meme-ingful Analysis: Enhanced Understanding of Cyberbullying in Memes Through Multimodal Explanations,"Prince Jha, Krishanu Maity, Raghav Jain, Apoorv Verma, Sriparna Saha, Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Internet memes have gained significant influence in communicating political, psychological, and sociocultural ideas. While memes are often humorous, there has been a rise in the use of memes for trolling and cyberbullying. Although a wide variety of effective deep learning-based models have been developed for detecting offensive multimodal memes, only a few works have been done on explainability aspect. Recent laws like ""right to explanations"" of General Data Protection Regulation, have spurred research in developing interpretable models rather than only focusing on performance. Motivated by this, we introduce {\em MultiBully-Ex}, the first benchmark dataset for multimodal explanation from code-mixed cyberbullying memes. Here, both visual and textual modalities are highlighted to explain why a given meme is cyberbullying. A Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) projection-based multimodal shared-private multitask approach has been proposed for visual and textual explanation of a meme.

Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network For Automatic Behavior Laying Hen Recognition,"Fréjus A. A. Laleye, Mikaël A.

This information is used as health and well-being indicators that help breeders better monitor laying hens, which involves early detection of problems for rapid and more effective intervention. In this work, we focus on the sound analysis for the recognition of the types of calls of the laying hens in order to propose a robust system of characterization of their behavior for a better monitoring. To do this, we first collected and annotated laying hen call signals, then designed an optimal acoustic characterization based on the combination of time and frequency domain features. We then used these features to build the multi-label classification models based on recurrent neural network to assign a semantic class to the vocalization that characterize the laying hen behavior.

Instant Answering in E-Commerce Buyer-Seller Messaging using Message-to-Question Reformulation,"Besnik Fetahu, Tejas Mehta, Qun Song, Nikhita Vedula, Oleg Rokhlenko, Shervin Malmasi","E-commerce customers frequently seek detailed product information for purchase decisions, commonly contacting sellers directly with extended queries. This manual response requirement imposes additional costs and disrupts buyer's shopping experience with response time fluctuations ranging from hours to days. We seek to automate buyer inquiries to sellers in a leading e-commerce store using a domain-specific federated Question Answering (QA) system. The main challenge is adapting current QA systems, designed for single questions, to address detailed customer queries. We address this with a low-latency, sequence-to-sequence approach, MESSAGE-TO-QUESTION ( M2Q ). It reformulates buyer messages into succinct questions by identifying and extracting the most salient information from a message. Evaluation against baselines shows that M2Q yields relative increases of 757% in question understanding, and 1,746% in answering rate from the federated QA system. Live deployment shows that automatic answering saves sellers from manually responding to millions of messages per year, and also accelerates customer purchase decisions by eliminating the need for buyers to wait for a reply",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09785v2,2024-01

Controllable Decontextualization of Yes/No Question and Answers into Factual Statements,"Lingbo Mo, Besnik Fetahu, Oleg Rokhlenko, Shervin Malmasi","Yes/No or polar questions represent one of the main linguistic question categories. They consist of a main interrogative clause, for which the answer is binary (assertion or negation). Polar questions and answers (PQA) represent a valuable knowledge resource present in many community and other curated QA sources, such as forums or e-commerce applications. Using answers to polar questions alone in other contexts is not trivial. Answers are contextualized, and presume that the interrogative question clause and any shared knowledge between the asker and answerer are provided.   We address the problem of controllable rewriting of answers to polar questions into decontextualized and succinct factual statements. We propose a Transformer sequence to sequence model that utilizes soft-constraints to ensure controllable rewriting, such that the output statement is semantically equivalent to its PQA input. Evaluation on three separate PQA datasets as measured through automated and human evaluation metrics show that our proposed approach achieves the best performance when compared to existing baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09775v1,2024-01
On the Audio Hallucinations in Large Audio-Video Language Models,"Taichi Nishimura, Shota Nakada, Masayoshi Kondo","Large audio-video language models can generate descriptions for both video and audio. However, they sometimes ignore audio content, producing audio descriptions solely reliant on visual information. This paper refers to this as audio hallucinations and analyzes them in large audio-video language models. We gather 1,000 sentences by inquiring about audio information and annotate them whether they contain hallucinations. If a sentence is hallucinated, we also categorize the type of hallucination. The results reveal that 332 sentences are hallucinated with distinct trends observed in nouns and verbs for each hallucination type. Based on this, we tackle a task of audio hallucination classification using pre-trained audio-text models in the zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Our experimental results reveal that the zero-shot models achieve higher performance (52.2% in F1) than the random (40.3%) and the fine-tuning models achieve 87.9%, outperforming the zero-shot models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09774v1,2024-01
A Comparative Study on Annotation Quality of Crowdsourcing and LLM via Label Aggregation,Jiyi Li,"Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can outperform crowdsourcing on the data annotation task is attracting interest recently. Some works verified this issue with the average performance of individual crowd workers and LLM workers on some specific NLP tasks by collecting new datasets. However, on the one hand, existing datasets for the studies of annotation quality in crowdsourcing are not yet utilized in such evaluations, which potentially provide reliable evaluations from a different viewpoint. On the other hand, the quality of these aggregated labels is crucial because, when utilizing crowdsourcing, the estimated labels aggregated from multiple crowd labels to the same instances are the eventually collected labels. Therefore, in this paper, we first investigate which existing crowdsourcing datasets can be used for a comparative study and create a benchmark. We then compare the quality between individual crowd labels and LLM labels and make the evaluations on the aggregated labels. In addition, we propose a Crowd-LLM hybrid label aggregation method and verify the performance. We find that adding LLM labels from good LLMs to existing crowdsourcing datasets can enhance the quality of the aggregated labels of the datasets, which is also higher than the quality of LLM labels themselves.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09760v1,2024-01
Resolving Regular Polysemy in Named Entities,"Shu-Kai Hsieh, Yu-Hsiang Tseng, Hsin-Yu Chou, Ching-Wen Yang, Yu-Yun Chang","Word sense disambiguation primarily addresses the lexical ambiguity of common words based on a predefined sense inventory. Conversely, proper names are usually considered to denote an ad-hoc real-world referent. Once the reference is decided, the ambiguity is purportedly resolved. However, proper names also exhibit ambiguities through appellativization, i.e., they act like common words and may denote different aspects of their referents. We proposed to address the ambiguities of proper names through the light of regular polysemy, which we formalized as dot objects. This paper introduces a combined word sense disambiguation (WSD) model for disambiguating common words against Chinese Wordnet (CWN) and proper names as dot objects. The model leverages the flexibility of a gloss-based model architecture, which takes advantage of the glosses and example sentences of CWN. We show that the model achieves competitive results on both common and proper nouns, even on a relatively sparse sense dataset. Aside from being a performant WSD tool, the model further facilitates the future development of the lexical resource.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09758v1,2024-01
Interplay of Semantic Communication and Knowledge Learning,"Fei Ni, Bingyan Wang, Rongpeng Li, Zhifeng Zhao, Honggang Zhang","In the swiftly advancing realm of communication technologies, Semantic Communication (SemCom), which emphasizes knowledge understanding and processing, has emerged as a hot topic. By integrating artificial intelligence technologies, SemCom facilitates a profound understanding, analysis and transmission of communication content. In this chapter, we clarify the means of knowledge learning in SemCom with a particular focus on the utilization of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Specifically, we first review existing efforts that combine SemCom with knowledge learning. Subsequently, we introduce a KG-enhanced SemCom system, wherein the receiver is carefully calibrated to leverage knowledge from its static knowledge base for ameliorating the decoding performance. Contingent upon this framework, we further explore potential approaches that can empower the system to operate in evolving knowledge base more effectively. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) for data augmentation, offering additional perspective into the potential implementation means of SemCom. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework yields superior performance on top of the KG-enhanced decoding and manifests its versatility under different scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03339v1,2024-01

Large Language Model Lateral Spear Phishing: A Comparative Study in Large-Scale Organizational Settings,"Mazal Bethany, Athanasios Galiopoulos, Emet Bethany, Mohammad Bahrami Karkevandi, Nishant Vishwamitra, Peyman Najafirad","The critical threat of phishing emails has been further exacerbated by the potential of LLMs to generate highly targeted, personalized, and automated spear phishing attacks. Two critical problems concerning LLM-facilitated phishing require further investigation: 1) Existing studies on lateral phishing lack specific examination of LLM integration for large-scale attacks targeting the entire organization, and 2) Current anti-phishing infrastructure, despite its extensive development, lacks the capability to prevent LLM-generated attacks, potentially impacting both employees and IT security incident management. However, the execution of such investigative studies necessitates a real-world environment, one that functions during regular business operations and mirrors the complexity of a large organizational infrastructure. This setting must also offer the flexibility required to facilitate a diverse array of experimental conditions, particularly the incorporation of phishing emails crafted by LLMs. This study is a pioneering exploration into the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the creation of targeted lateral phishing emails, targeting a large tier 1 university's operation and workforce of approximately 9,000 individuals over an 11-month period. It also evaluates the capability of email filtering infrastructure to detect such LLM-generated phishing attempts, providing insights into their effectiveness and identifying potential areas for improvement. Based on our findings, we propose machine learning-based detection techniques for such emails to detect LLM-generated phishing emails that were missed by the existing infrastructure, with an F1-score of 98.96.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09727v1,2024-01
Predicting Viral Rumors and Vulnerable Users for Infodemic Surveillance,"Xuan Zhang, Wei Gao","In the age of the infodemic, it is crucial to have tools for effectively monitoring the spread of rampant rumors that can quickly go viral, as well as identifying vulnerable users who may be more susceptible to spreading such misinformation. This proactive approach allows for timely preventive measures to be taken, mitigating the negative impact of false information on society. We propose a novel approach to predict viral rumors and vulnerable users using a unified graph neural network model. We pre-train network-based user embeddings and leverage a cross-attention mechanism between users and posts, together with a community-enhanced vulnerability propagation (CVP) method to improve user and propagation graph representations. Furthermore, we employ two multi-task training strategies to mitigate negative transfer effects among tasks in different settings, enhancing the overall performance of our approach. We also construct two datasets with ground-truth annotations on information virality and user vulnerability in rumor and non-rumor events, which are automatically derived from existing rumor detection datasets. Extensive evaluation results of our joint learning model confirm its superiority over strong baselines in all three tasks: rumor detection, virality prediction, and user vulnerability scoring. For instance, compared to the best baselines based on the Weibo dataset, our model makes 3.8\% and 3.0\% improvements on Accuracy and MacF1 for rumor detection, and reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 23.9\% and 16.5\% for virality prediction and user vulnerability scoring, respectively. Our findings suggest that our approach effectively captures the correlation between rumor virality and user vulnerability, leveraging this information to improve prediction performance and provide a valuable tool for infodemic surveillance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09724v1,2024-01
Curriculum Recommendations Using Transformer Base Model with InfoNCE Loss And Language Switching Method,"Xiaonan Xu, Bin Yuan, Yongyao Mo, Tianbo Song, Shulin Li","The Curriculum Recommendations paradigm is dedicated to fostering learning equality within the ever-evolving realms of educational technology and curriculum development. In acknowledging the inherent obstacles posed by existing methodologies, such as content conflicts and disruptions from language translation, this paradigm aims to confront and overcome these challenges. Notably, it addresses content conflicts and disruptions introduced by language translation, hindrances that can impede the creation of an all-encompassing and personalized learning experience. The paradigm's objective is to cultivate an educational environment that not only embraces diversity but also customizes learning experiences to suit the distinct needs of each learner. To overcome these challenges, our approach builds upon notable contributions in curriculum development and personalized learning, introducing three key innovations. These include the integration of Transformer Base Model to enhance computational efficiency, the implementation of InfoNCE Loss for accurate content-topic matching, and the adoption of a language switching strategy to alleviate translation-related ambiguities. Together, these innovations aim to collectively tackle inherent challenges and contribute to forging a more equitable and effective learning journey for a diverse range of learners. Competitive cross-validation scores underscore the efficacy of sentence-transformers/LaBSE, achieving 0.66314, showcasing our methodology's effectiveness in diverse linguistic nuances for content alignment prediction.

Large Language Models Help Reveal Unhealthy Diet and Body Concerns in Online Eating Disorders Communities,"Minh Duc Chu, Zihao He, Rebecca Dorn, Kristina Lerman","Eating disorders (ED), a severe mental health condition with high rates of mortality and morbidity, affect millions of people globally, especially adolescents. The proliferation of online communities that promote and normalize ED has been linked to this public health crisis. However, identifying harmful communities is challenging due to the use of coded language and other obfuscations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to surface implicit attitudes of online communities by adapting large language models (LLMs) to the language of the community. We describe an alignment method and evaluate results along multiple dimensions of semantics and affect. We then use the community-aligned LLM to respond to psychometric questionnaires designed to identify ED in individuals. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively adopt community-specific perspectives and reveal significant variations in eating disorder risks in different online communities. These findings highlight the utility of LLMs to reveal implicit attitudes and collective mindsets of communities, offering new tools for mitigating harmful content on social media.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09647v2,2024-01

We trained two 7B models from scratch on a science-oriented dataset of 300B tokens. For the first model, the 4.2B domain-specific tokens were included during pre-training and the second was adapted to the climate domain after pre-training. Additionally, ClimateGPT-7B, 13B and 70B are continuously pre-trained from Llama~2 on a domain-specific dataset of 4.2B tokens. Each model is instruction fine-tuned on a high-quality and human-generated domain-specific dataset that has been created in close cooperation with climate scientists. To reduce the number of hallucinations, we optimize the model for retrieval augmentation and propose a hierarchical retrieval strategy. To increase the accessibility of our model to non-English speakers, we propose to make use of cascaded machine translation and show that this approach can perform comparably to natively multilingual models while being easier to scale to a large number of languages. Further, to address the intrinsic interdisciplinary aspect of climate change we consider different research perspectives. Therefore, the model can produce in-depth answers focusing on different perspectives in addition to an overall answer. We propose a suite of automatic climate-specific benchmarks to evaluate LLMs. On these benchmarks, ClimateGPT-7B performs on par with the ten times larger Llama-2-70B Chat model while not degrading results on general domain benchmarks. Our human evaluation confirms the trends we saw in our benchmarks. All models were trained and evaluated using renewable energy and are released publicly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09646v1,2024-01

We piloted the tool with clinical notes donated by patients with a history of breast cancer and synthetic notes from a clinician. Participants (N=200, healthy, female-identifying patients) were randomly assigned three clinical notes in our tool with varying levels of augmentations and answered quantitative and qualitative questions evaluating their understanding of follow-up actions. Augmentations significantly increased their quantitative understanding scores.

Learning Shortcuts: On the Misleading Promise of NLU in Language Models,"Geetanjali Bihani, Julia Taylor Rayz","The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled significant performance gains in the field of natural language processing. However, recent studies have found that LLMs often resort to shortcuts when performing tasks, creating an illusion of enhanced performance while lacking generalizability in their decision rules. This phenomenon introduces challenges in accurately assessing natural language understanding in LLMs. Our paper provides a concise survey of relevant research in this area and puts forth a perspective on the implications of shortcut learning in the evaluation of language models, specifically for NLU tasks. This paper urges more research efforts to be put towards deepening our comprehension of shortcut learning, contributing to the development of more robust language models, and raising the standards of NLU evaluation in real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09615v2,2024-01
Aligning Large Language Models with Counterfactual DPO,Bradley Butcher,"Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a diverse range of applications. These models excel in generating text completions that are contextually coherent and cover an extensive array of subjects. However, the vast datasets required for their training make aligning response styles during the pretraining and instruction tuning phases challenging. Consequently, an additional alignment phase is typically employed, wherein the model is further trained with human preference data to better align its outputs with human expectations. While this process doesn't introduce new capabilities per se, it does accentuate generation styles innate to the model. This paper explores the utilization of counterfactual prompting within the framework of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the model's style without relying on human intervention. We demonstrate that this method effectively instils desirable behaviour, mitigates undesirable ones, and encourages the model to disregard inappropriate instructions. Our findings suggest that counterfactual prompting with DPO presents a low-resource way to fine-tune LLMs to meet the demands for responsible and ethically aligned AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09566v2,2024-01
"Improving Classification Performance With Human Feedback: Label a few, we label the rest","Natan Vidra, Thomas Clifford, Katherine Jijo, Eden Chung, Liang Zhang","In the realm of artificial intelligence, where a vast majority of data is unstructured, obtaining substantial amounts of labeled data to train supervised machine learning models poses a significant challenge. To address this, we delve into few-shot and active learning, where are goal is to improve AI models with human feedback on a few labeled examples. This paper focuses on understanding how a continuous feedback loop can refine models, thereby enhancing their accuracy, recall, and precision through incremental human input. By employing Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, BERT, and SetFit, we aim to analyze the efficacy of using a limited number of labeled examples to substantially improve model accuracy. We benchmark this approach on the Financial Phrasebank, Banking, Craigslist, Trec, Amazon Reviews datasets to prove that with just a few labeled examples, we are able to surpass the accuracy of zero shot large language models to provide enhanced text classification performance. We demonstrate that rather than needing to manually label millions of rows of data, we just need to label a few and the model can effectively predict the rest.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09555v1,2024-01

Deciphering Textual Authenticity: A Generalized Strategy through the Lens of Large Language Semantics for Detecting Human vs. Machine-Generated Text,"Mazal Bethany, Brandon Wherry, Emet Bethany, Nishant Vishwamitra, Anthony Rios, Peyman Najafirad","With the recent proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been an increasing demand for tools to detect machine-generated text. The effective detection of machine-generated text face two pertinent problems: First, they are severely limited in generalizing against real-world scenarios, where machine-generated text is produced by a variety of generators, including but not limited to GPT-4 and Dolly, and spans diverse domains, ranging from academic manuscripts to social media posts. Second, existing detection methodologies treat texts produced by LLMs through a restrictive binary classification lens, neglecting the nuanced diversity of artifacts generated by different LLMs. In this work, we undertake a systematic study on the detection of machine-generated text in real-world scenarios. We first study the effectiveness of state-of-the-art approaches and find that they are severely limited against text produced by diverse generators and domains in the real world. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations of the embeddings from a pretrained LLM's encoder show that they cannot reliably distinguish between human and machine-generated text. Based on our findings, we introduce a novel system, T5LLMCipher, for detecting machine-generated text using a pretrained T5 encoder combined with LLM embedding sub-clustering to address the text produced by diverse generators and domains in the real world. We evaluate our approach across 9 machine-generated text systems and 9 domains and find that our approach provides state-of-the-art generalization ability, with an average increase in F1 score on machine-generated text of 19.6\% on unseen generators and domains compared to the top performing existing approaches and correctly attributes the generator of text with an accuracy of 93.6\%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09407v3,2024-01
Evaluating LLMs' Mathematical and Coding Competency through Ontology-guided Interventions,"Pengfei Hong, Navonil Majumder, Deepanway Ghosal, Somak Aditya, Rada Mihalcea, Soujanya Poria","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased striking results on existing logical reasoning benchmarks, with some models even surpassing human performance. However, the true depth of their competencies and robustness in reasoning tasks remains an open question. To this end, in this paper, we focus on two popular reasoning tasks: arithmetic reasoning and code generation. Particularly, we introduce (i) a general ontology of perturbations for math and coding questions, (ii) a semi-automatic method to apply these perturbations, and (iii) two datasets, GSMORE and HUMANEVAL-CORE, respectively, of perturbed math and coding problems to probe LLM capabilities in numeric reasoning and coding tasks. Through comprehensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source LLMs, we show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions, suggesting that the current LLMs lack robust problem solving skills and structured reasoning abilities in many areas, as defined by our ontology.

SceneVerse: Scaling 3D Vision-Language Learning for Grounded Scene Understanding,"Baoxiong Jia, Yixin Chen, Huangyue Yu, Yan Wang, Xuesong Niu, Tengyu Liu, Qing Li, Siyuan Huang","3D vision-language grounding, which focuses on aligning language with the 3D physical environment, stands as a cornerstone in the development of embodied agents. In comparison to recent advancements in the 2D domain, grounding language in 3D scenes faces several significant challenges: (i) the inherent complexity of 3D scenes due to the diverse object configurations, their rich attributes, and intricate relationships; (ii) the scarcity of paired 3D vision-language data to support grounded learning; and (iii) the absence of a unified learning framework to distill knowledge from grounded 3D data. In this work, we aim to address these three major challenges in 3D vision-language by examining the potential of systematically upscaling 3D vision-language learning in indoor environments. We introduce the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, SceneVerse, encompassing about 68K 3D indoor scenes and comprising 2.5M vision-language pairs derived from both human annotations and our scalable scene-graph-based generation approach. We demonstrate that this scaling allows for a unified pre-training framework, Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), for 3D vision-language learning. Through extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of GPS by achieving state-of-the-art performance on all existing 3D visual grounding benchmarks. The vast potential of SceneVerse and GPS is unveiled through zero-shot transfer experiments in the challenging 3D vision-language tasks.

Large Language Models Are Neurosymbolic Reasoners,"Meng Fang, Shilong Deng, Yudi Zhang, Zijing Shi, Ling Chen, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Jun Wang","A wide range of real-world applications is characterized by their symbolic nature, necessitating a strong capability for symbolic reasoning. This paper investigates the potential application of Large Language Models (LLMs) as symbolic reasoners. We focus on text-based games, significant benchmarks for agents with natural language capabilities, particularly in symbolic tasks like math, map reading, sorting, and applying common sense in text-based worlds. To facilitate these agents, we propose an LLM agent designed to tackle symbolic challenges and achieve in-game objectives. We begin by initializing the LLM agent and informing it of its role. The agent then receives observations and a set of valid actions from the text-based games, along with a specific symbolic module. With these inputs, the LLM agent chooses an action and interacts with the game environments. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the capability of LLMs as automated agents for symbolic reasoning, and our LLM agent is effective in text-based games involving symbolic tasks, achieving an average performance of 88% across all tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09334v1,2024-01
Machines Do See Color: A Guideline to Classify Different Forms of Racist Discourse in Large Corpora,"Diana Davila Gordillo, Joan Timoneda, Sebastian Vallejo Vera","Current methods to identify and classify racist language in text rely on small-n qualitative approaches or large-n approaches focusing exclusively on overt forms of racist discourse. This article provides a step-by-step generalizable guideline to identify and classify different forms of racist discourse in large corpora. In our approach, we start by conceptualizing racism and its different manifestations. We then contextualize these racist manifestations to the time and place of interest, which allows researchers to identify their discursive form. Finally, we apply XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R), a cross-lingual model for supervised text classification with a cutting-edge contextual understanding of text. We show that XLM-R and XLM-R-Racismo, our pretrained model, outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in classifying racism in large corpora.

Estimating the severity of dental and oral problems via sentiment classification over clinical reports,"Sare Mahdavifar, Seyed Mostafa Fakhrahmad, Elham Ansarifard","Analyzing authors' sentiments in texts as a technique for identifying text polarity can be practical and useful in various fields, including medicine and dentistry. Currently, due to factors such as patients' limited knowledge about their condition, difficulties in accessing specialist doctors, or fear of illness, particularly in pandemic conditions, there might be a delay between receiving a radiology report and consulting a doctor. In some cases, this delay can pose significant risks to the patient, making timely decision-making crucial. Having an automatic system that can inform patients about the deterioration of their condition by analyzing the text of radiology reports could greatly impact timely decision-making. In this study, a dataset comprising 1,134 cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) photo reports was collected from the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Each case was examined, and an expert labeled a severity level for the patient's condition on each document. After preprocessing all the text data, a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network architecture, known as CNN-LSTM, was developed to detect the severity level of the patient's problem based on sentiment analysis in the radiologist's report. The model's performance was evaluated on two datasets, each with two and four classes, in both imbalanced and balanced scenarios. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we compared its performance with that of other classification models. The results, along with one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test, indicated that our proposed model (CNN-LSTM) performed the best according to precision, recall, and f-measure criteria. This suggests that it can be a reliable model for estimating the severity of oral and dental diseases, thereby assisting patients.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12993v1,2024-01
UniVIE: A Unified Label Space Approach to Visual Information Extraction from Form-like Documents,"Kai Hu, Jiawei Wang, Weihong Lin, Zhuoyao Zhong, Lei Sun, Qiang Huo","Existing methods for Visual Information Extraction (VIE) from form-like documents typically fragment the process into separate subtasks, such as key information extraction, key-value pair extraction, and choice group extraction. However, these approaches often overlook the hierarchical structure of form documents, including hierarchical key-value pairs and hierarchical choice groups. To address these limitations, we present a new perspective, reframing VIE as a relation prediction problem and unifying labels of different tasks into a single label space. This unified approach allows for the definition of various relation types and effectively tackles hierarchical relationships in form-like documents. In line with this perspective, we present UniVIE, a unified model that addresses the VIE problem comprehensively. UniVIE functions using a coarse-to-fine strategy. It initially generates tree proposals through a tree proposal network, which are subsequently refined into hierarchical trees by a relation decoder module. To enhance the relation prediction capabilities of UniVIE, we incorporate two novel tree constraints into the relation decoder: a tree attention mask and a tree level embedding. Extensive experimental evaluations on both our in-house dataset HierForms and a publicly available dataset SIBR, substantiate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness and potential of our unified approach in advancing the field of VIE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09220v1,2024-01

Fine-tuning Strategies for Domain Specific Question Answering under Low Annotation Budget Constraints,"Kunpeng Guo, Dennis Diefenbach, Antoine Gourru, Christophe Gravier","The progress introduced by pre-trained language models and their fine-tuning has resulted in significant improvements in most downstream NLP tasks. The unsupervised training of a language model combined with further target task fine-tuning has become the standard QA fine-tuning procedure. In this work, we demonstrate that this strategy is sub-optimal for fine-tuning QA models, especially under a low QA annotation budget, which is a usual setting in practice due to the extractive QA labeling cost. We draw our conclusions by conducting an exhaustive analysis of the performance of the alternatives of the sequential fine-tuning strategy on different QA datasets. Based on the experiments performed, we observed that the best strategy to fine-tune the QA model in low-budget settings is taking a pre-trained language model (PLM) and then fine-tuning PLM with a dataset composed of the target dataset and SQuAD dataset. With zero extra annotation effort, the best strategy outperforms the standard strategy by 2.28% to 6.48%. Our experiments provide one of the first investigations on how to best fine-tune a QA system under a low budget and are therefore of the utmost practical interest to the QA practitioners.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09168v1,2024-01

In this paper, we introduce TranSentence, a novel speech-to-speech translation without language-parallel speech data. To achieve this, we first adopt a language-agnostic sentence-level speech encoding that captures the semantic information of speech, irrespective of language. We then train our model to generate speech based on the encoded embedding obtained from a language-agnostic sentence-level speech encoder that is pre-trained with various languages. With this method, despite training exclusively on the target language's monolingual data, we can generate target language speech in the inference stage using language-agnostic speech embedding from the source language speech. Furthermore, we extend TranSentence to multilingual speech-to-speech translation. The experimental results demonstrate that TranSentence is superior to other models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12992v1,2024-01
Bridging Research and Readers: A Multi-Modal Automated Academic Papers Interpretation System,"Feng Jiang, Kuang Wang, Haizhou Li","In the contemporary information era, significantly accelerated by the advent of Large-scale Language Models, the proliferation of scientific literature is reaching unprecedented levels. Researchers urgently require efficient tools for reading and summarizing academic papers, uncovering significant scientific literature, and employing diverse interpretative methodologies. To address this burgeoning demand, the role of automated scientific literature interpretation systems has become paramount. However, prevailing models, both commercial and open-source, confront notable challenges: they often overlook multimodal data, grapple with summarizing over-length texts, and lack diverse user interfaces. In response, we introduce an open-source multi-modal automated academic paper interpretation system (MMAPIS) with three-step process stages, incorporating LLMs to augment its functionality. Our system first employs the hybrid modality preprocessing and alignment module to extract plain text, and tables or figures from documents separately. It then aligns this information based on the section names they belong to, ensuring that data with identical section names are categorized under the same section. Following this, we introduce a hierarchical discourse-aware summarization method. It utilizes the extracted section names to divide the article into shorter text segments, facilitating specific summarizations both within and between sections via LLMs with specific prompts. Finally, we have designed four types of diversified user interfaces, including paper recommendation, multimodal Q\&A, audio broadcasting, and interpretation blog, which can be widely applied across various scenarios. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations underscore the system's superiority, especially in scientific summarization, where it outperforms solutions relying solely on GPT-4.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09150v1,2024-01
Asynchronous Local-SGD Training for Language Modeling,"Bo Liu, Rachita Chhaparia, Arthur Douillard, Satyen Kale, Andrei A. Rusu, Jiajun Shen, Arthur Szlam, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato","Local stochastic gradient descent (Local-SGD), also referred to as federated averaging, is an approach to distributed optimization where each device performs more than one SGD update per communication. This work presents an empirical study of {\it asynchronous} Local-SGD for training language models; that is, each worker updates the global parameters as soon as it has finished its SGD steps. We conduct a comprehensive investigation by examining how worker hardware heterogeneity, model size, number of workers, and optimizer could impact the learning performance. We find that with naive implementations, asynchronous Local-SGD takes more iterations to converge than its synchronous counterpart despite updating the (global) model parameters more frequently. We identify momentum acceleration on the global parameters when worker gradients are stale as a key challenge. We propose a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on their computation speed. This approach, evaluated with models up to 150M parameters on the C4 dataset, matches the performance of synchronous Local-SGD in terms of perplexity per update step, and significantly surpasses it in terms of wall clock time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09135v2,2024-01
Should agentic conversational AI change how we think about ethics? Characterising an interactional ethics centred on respect,"Lize Alberts, Geoff Keeling, Amanda McCroskery","With the growing popularity of conversational agents based on large language models (LLMs), we need to ensure their behaviour is ethical and appropriate. Work in this area largely centres around the 'HHH' criteria: making outputs more helpful and honest, and avoiding harmful (biased, toxic, or inaccurate) statements. Whilst this semantic focus is useful when viewing LLM agents as mere mediums or output-generating systems, it fails to account for pragmatic factors that can make the same speech act seem more or less tactless or inconsiderate in different social situations. With the push towards agentic AI, wherein systems become increasingly proactive in chasing goals and performing actions in the world, considering the pragmatics of interaction becomes essential. We propose an interactional approach to ethics that is centred on relational and situational factors. We explore what it means for a system, as a social actor, to treat an individual respectfully in a (series of) interaction(s). Our work anticipates a set of largely unexplored risks at the level of situated social interaction, and offers practical suggestions to help agentic LLM technologies treat people well.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09082v2,2024-01
Code Simulation Challenges for Large Language Models,"Emanuele La Malfa, Christoph Weinhuber, Orazio Torre, Fangru Lin, Samuele Marro, Anthony Cohn, Nigel Shadbolt, Michael Wooldridge","Many reasoning, planning, and problem-solving tasks share an intrinsic algorithmic nature: correctly simulating each step is a sufficient condition to solve them correctly. This work studies to what extent Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate coding and algorithmic tasks to provide insights into general capabilities in such algorithmic reasoning tasks. We introduce benchmarks for straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the simulation capabilities of LLMs with sorting algorithms and nested loops and show that a routine's computational complexity directly affects an LLM's ability to simulate its execution. While the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong simulation capabilities, the process is fragile, seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition, and is affected by memorisation. We propose a novel off-the-shelf prompting method, Chain of Simulation (CoSm), which instructs LLMs to simulate code execution line by line/follow the computation pattern of compilers. CoSm efficiently helps LLMs reduce memorisation and shallow pattern recognition while improving simulation performance. We consider the success of CoSm in code simulation to be inspirational for other general routine simulation reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09074v4,2024-01
LLMs for Relational Reasoning: How Far are We?,"Zhiming Li, Yushi Cao, Xiufeng Xu, Junzhe Jiang, Xu Liu, Yon Shin Teo, Shang-wei Lin, Yang Liu","Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized many areas (e.g. natural language processing, software engineering, etc.) by achieving state-of-the-art performance on extensive downstream tasks. Aiming to achieve robust and general artificial intelligence, there has been a surge of interest in investigating the reasoning ability of the LLMs. Whereas the textual and numerical reasoning benchmarks adopted by previous works are rather shallow and simple, it is hard to conclude that the LLMs possess strong reasoning ability by merely achieving positive results on these benchmarks. Recent efforts have demonstrated that the LLMs are poor at solving sequential decision-making problems that require common-sense planning by evaluating their performance on the reinforcement learning benchmarks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth assessment of several state-of-the-art LLMs' reasoning ability based on the inductive logic programming (ILP) benchmark, which is broadly recognized as a representative and challenging measurement for evaluating logic program induction/synthesis systems as it requires inducing strict cause-effect logic to achieve robust deduction on independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples. Our evaluations illustrate that compared with the neural program induction systems which are much smaller in model size, the state-of-the-art LLMs are much poorer in terms of reasoning ability by achieving much lower performance and generalization using either natural language prompting or truth-value matrix prompting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09042v1,2024-01
Textual Summarisation of Large Sets: Towards a General Approach,"Kittipitch Kuptavanich, Ehud Reiter, Kees Van Deemter, Advaith Siddharthan","We are developing techniques to generate summary descriptions of sets of objects.

Explain Thyself Bully: Sentiment Aided Cyberbullying Detection with Explanation,"Krishanu Maity, Prince Jha, Raghav Jain, Sriparna Saha, Pushpak Bhattacharyya","Cyberbullying has become a big issue with the popularity of different social media networks and online communication apps. While plenty of research is going on to develop better models for cyberbullying detection in monolingual language, there is very little research on the code-mixed languages and explainability aspect of cyberbullying. Recent laws like ""right to explanations"" of General Data Protection Regulation, have spurred research in developing interpretable models rather than focusing on performance. Motivated by this we develop the first interpretable multi-task model called {\em mExCB} for automatic cyberbullying detection from code-mixed languages which can simultaneously solve several tasks, cyberbullying detection, explanation/rationale identification, target group detection and sentiment analysis. We have introduced {\em BullyExplain}, the first benchmark dataset for explainable cyberbullying detection in code-mixed language. Each post in {\em BullyExplain} dataset is annotated with four labels, i.e., {\em bully label, sentiment label, target and rationales (explainability)}, i.e., which phrases are being responsible for annotating the post as a bully. The proposed multitask framework (mExCB) based on CNN and GRU with word and sub-sentence (SS) level attention is able to outperform several baselines and state of the art models when applied on {\em BullyExplain} dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09023v1,2024-01
Augmenting Math Word Problems via Iterative Question Composing,"Haoxiong Liu, Yifan Zhang, Yifan Luo, Andrew Chi-Chih Yao","Despite the advancements in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning, solving competition-level math problems remains a significant challenge, especially for open-source LLMs without external tools. We introduce the MMIQC dataset, comprising a mixture of processed web data and synthetic question-response pairs, aimed at enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of base language models. Models fine-tuned on MMIQC consistently surpass their counterparts in performance on the MATH benchmark across various model sizes. Notably, Qwen-72B-MMIQC achieves a 45.0% accuracy, exceeding the previous open-source state-of-the-art by 8.2% and outperforming the initial version GPT-4 released in 2023. Extensive evaluation results on Hungarian high school finals suggest that such improvement can generalize to unseen data. Our ablation study on MMIQC reveals that a large part of the improvement can be attributed to our novel augmentation method, Iterative Question Composing (IQC), which involves iteratively composing new questions from seed problems using an LLM and applying rejection sampling through another LLM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09003v5,2024-01
AttackEval: How to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Jailbreak Attacking on Large Language Models,"Dong shu, Mingyu Jin, Chong Zhang, Liangyao Li, Zihao Zhou, Yongfeng Zhang","Ensuring the security of large language models (LLMs) against attacks has become increasingly urgent, with jailbreak attacks representing one of the most sophisticated threats. To deal with such risks, we introduce an innovative framework that can help evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Unlike traditional binary evaluations focusing solely on the robustness of LLMs, our method assesses the effectiveness of the attacking prompts themselves. We present two distinct evaluation frameworks: a coarse-grained evaluation and a fine-grained evaluation. Each framework uses a scoring range from 0 to 1, offering unique perspectives and allowing for the assessment of attack effectiveness in different scenarios. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive ground truth dataset specifically tailored for jailbreak prompts. This dataset serves as a crucial benchmark for our current study and provides a foundational resource for future research. By comparing with traditional evaluation methods, our study shows that the current results align with baseline metrics while offering a more nuanced and fine-grained assessment. It also helps identify potentially harmful attack prompts that might appear harmless in traditional evaluations. Overall, our work establishes a solid foundation for assessing a broader range of attack prompts in the area of prompt injection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09002v5,2024-01
Efficient Adapter Finetuning for Tail Languages in Streaming Multilingual ASR,"Junwen Bai, Bo Li, Qiujia Li, Tara N. Sainath, Trevor Strohman","The end-to-end ASR model is often desired in the streaming multilingual scenario since it is easier to deploy and can benefit from pre-trained speech models such as powerful foundation models. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous nature and imbalanced data abundance of different languages may cause performance degradation, leading to asynchronous peak performance for different languages during training, especially on tail ones. Sometimes even the data itself may become unavailable as a result of the enhanced privacy protection. Existing work tend to significantly increase the model size or learn language-specific decoders to accommodate each language separately. In this study, we explore simple yet effective Language-Dependent Adapter (LDA) finetuning under a cascaded Conformer transducer framework enhanced by teacher pseudo-labeling for tail languages in the streaming multilingual ASR. The adapter only accounts for 0.4% of the full model per language. It is plugged into the frozen foundation model and is the only trainable module during the finetuning process with noisy student training. The final model merges the adapter parameters from different checkpoints for different languages. The model performance is validated on a challenging multilingual dictation dataset, which includes 39 tail languages across Latin, Greek, Arabic, etc. Our proposed method brings 12.2% word error rate reduction on average and up to 37.5% on a single locale. Furthermore, we show that our parameter-efficient LDA can match the quality of the full model finetuning, thus greatly alleviating the asynchronous peak performance issue.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08992v1,2024-01
OCTO+: A Suite for Automatic Open-Vocabulary Object Placement in Mixed Reality,"Aditya Sharma, Luke Yoffe, Tobias Höllerer","One key challenge in Augmented Reality is the placement of virtual content in natural locations. Most existing automated techniques can only work with a closed-vocabulary, fixed set of objects. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate several methods for automatic object placement using recent advances in open-vocabulary vision-language models. Through a multifaceted evaluation, we identify a new state-of-the-art method, OCTO+. We also introduce a benchmark for automatically evaluating the placement of virtual objects in augmented reality, alleviating the need for costly user studies. Through this, in addition to human evaluations, we find that OCTO+ places objects in a valid region over 70% of the time, outperforming other methods on a range of metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08973v1,2024-01
ReFT: Reasoning with Reinforced Fine-Tuning,"Trung Quoc Luong, Xinbo Zhang, Zhanming Jie, Peng Sun, Xiaoran Jin, Hang Li","One way to enhance the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations. This approach does not show sufficiently strong generalization ability, however, because the training only relies on the given CoT data. In math problem-solving, for example, there is usually only one annotated reasoning path for each question in the training data. Intuitively, it would be better for the algorithm to learn from multiple annotated reasoning paths given a question. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) to enhance the generalizability of learning LLMs for reasoning, with math problem-solving as an example. ReFT first warmups the model with SFT, and then employs on-line reinforcement learning, specifically the PPO algorithm in this paper, to further fine-tune the model, where an abundance of reasoning paths are automatically sampled given the question and the rewards are naturally derived from the ground-truth answers. Extensive experiments on GSM8K, MathQA, and SVAMP datasets show that ReFT significantly outperforms SFT, and the performance can be potentially further boosted by combining inference-time strategies such as majority voting and re-ranking. Note that ReFT obtains the improvement by learning from the same training questions as SFT, without relying on extra or augmented training questions. This indicates a superior generalization ability for ReFT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08967v3,2024-01
A Context-Contrastive Inference Approach To Partial Diacritization,"Muhammad ElNokrashy, Badr AlKhamissi","Diacritization plays a pivotal role in improving readability and disambiguating the meaning of Arabic texts. Efforts have so far focused on marking every eligible character (Full Diacritization). Comparatively overlooked, Partial Diacritzation (PD) is the selection of a subset of characters to be marked to aid comprehension where needed. Research has indicated that excessive diacritic marks can hinder skilled readers -- reducing reading speed and accuracy. We conduct a behavioral experiment and show that partially marked text is often easier to read than fully marked text, and sometimes easier than plain text. In this light, we introduce Context-Contrastive Partial Diacritization (CCPD) -- a novel approach to PD which integrates seamlessly with existing Arabic diacritization systems. CCPD processes each word twice, once with context and once without, and diacritizes only the characters with disparities between the two inferences. Further, we introduce novel indicators for measuring partial diacritization quality, essential for establishing this as a machine learning task. Lastly, we introduce TD2, a Transformer-variant of an established model which offers a markedly different performance profile on our proposed indicators compared to all other known systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08919v3,2024-01

The challenge focuses on distant speaker diarization and automatic speech recognition (DASR) in far-field meeting scenarios, with single-channel and known-geometry multi-channel tracks, and serves as a launch platform for two new datasets: First, a benchmarking dataset of 315 meetings, averaging 6 minutes each, capturing a broad spectrum of real-world acoustic conditions and conversational dynamics. It is recorded across 30 conference rooms, featuring 4-8 attendees and a total of 35 unique speakers. Second, a 1000-hour simulated training dataset, synthesized with enhanced authenticity for real-world generalization, incorporating 15,000 real acoustic transfer functions. The tasks focus on single-device DASR, where multi-channel devices always share the same known geometry. This is aligned with common setups in actual conference rooms, and avoids technical complexities associated with multi-device tasks. It also allows for the development of geometry-specific solutions. The NOTSOFAR-1 Challenge aims to advance research in the field of distant conversational speech recognition, providing key resources to unlock the potential of data-driven methods, which we believe are currently constrained by the absence of comprehensive high-quality training and benchmarking datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08887v1,2024-01
Using i-vectors for subject-independent cross-session EEG transfer learning,"Jonathan Lasko, Jeff Ma, Mike Nicoletti, Jonathan Sussman-Fort, Sooyoung Jeong, William Hartmann","Cognitive load classification is the task of automatically determining an individual's utilization of working memory resources during performance of a task based on physiologic measures such as electroencephalography (EEG). In this paper, we follow a cross-disciplinary approach, where tools and methodologies from speech processing are used to tackle this problem. The corpus we use was released publicly in 2021 as part of the first passive brain-computer interface competition on cross-session workload estimation. We present our approach which used i-vector-based neural network classifiers to accomplish inter-subject cross-session EEG transfer learning, achieving 18% relative improvement over equivalent subject-dependent models. We also report experiments showing how our subject-independent models perform competitively on held-out subjects and improve with additional subject data, suggesting that subject-dependent training is not required for effective cognitive load determination.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08851v1,2024-01
Improving ASR Contextual Biasing with Guided Attention,"Jiyang Tang, Kwangyoun Kim, Suwon Shon, Felix Wu, Prashant Sridhar, Shinji Watanabe","In this paper, we propose a Guided Attention (GA) auxiliary training loss, which improves the effectiveness and robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) contextual biasing without introducing additional parameters. A common challenge in previous literature is that the word error rate (WER) reduction brought by contextual biasing diminishes as the number of bias phrases increases. To address this challenge, we employ a GA loss as an additional training objective besides the Transducer loss. The proposed GA loss aims to teach the cross attention how to align bias phrases with text tokens or audio frames. Compared to studies with similar motivations, the proposed loss operates directly on the cross attention weights and is easier to implement. Through extensive experiments based on Conformer Transducer with Contextual Adapter, we demonstrate that the proposed method not only leads to a lower WER but also retains its effectiveness as the number of bias phrases increases. Specifically, the GA loss decreases the WER of rare vocabularies by up to 19.2% on LibriSpeech compared to the contextual biasing baseline, and up to 49.3% compared to a vanilla Transducer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08835v1,2024-01
Revisiting Self-supervised Learning of Speech Representation from a Mutual Information Perspective,"Alexander H. Liu, Sung-Lin Yeh, James Glass","Existing studies on self-supervised speech representation learning have focused on developing new training methods and applying pre-trained models for different applications. However, the quality of these models is often measured by the performance of different downstream tasks. How well the representations access the information of interest is less studied. In this work, we take a closer look into existing self-supervised methods of speech from an information-theoretic perspective. We aim to develop metrics using mutual information to help practical problems such as model design and selection. We use linear probes to estimate the mutual information between the target information and learned representations, showing another insight into the accessibility to the target information from speech representations. Further, we explore the potential of evaluating representations in a self-supervised fashion, where we estimate the mutual information between different parts of the data without using any labels. Finally, we show that both supervised and unsupervised measures echo the performance of the models on layer-wise linear probing and speech recognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08833v1,2024-01
AiGen-FoodReview: A Multimodal Dataset of Machine-Generated Restaurant Reviews and Images on Social Media,"Alessandro Gambetti, Qiwei Han","Online reviews in the form of user-generated content (UGC) significantly impact consumer decision-making. However, the pervasive issue of not only human fake content but also machine-generated content challenges UGC's reliability. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) may pave the way to fabricate indistinguishable fake generated content at a much lower cost. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4-Turbo and DALL-E-2 models, we craft AiGen-FoodReview, a multi-modal dataset of 20,144 restaurant review-image pairs divided into authentic and machine-generated. We explore unimodal and multimodal detection models, achieving 99.80% multimodal accuracy with FLAVA. We use attributes from readability and photographic theories to score reviews and images, respectively, demonstrating their utility as hand-crafted features in scalable and interpretable detection models, with comparable performance. The paper contributes by open-sourcing the dataset and releasing fake review detectors, recommending its use in unimodal and multimodal fake review detection tasks, and evaluating linguistic and visual features in synthetic versus authentic data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08825v1,2024-01
HuixiangDou: Overcoming Group Chat Scenarios with LLM-based Technical Assistance,"Huanjun Kong, Songyang Zhang, Jiaying Li, Min Xiao, Jun Xu, Kai Chen","In this work, we present HuixiangDou, a technical assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLM). This system is designed to assist algorithm developers by providing insightful responses to questions related to open-source algorithm projects, such as computer vision and deep learning projects from OpenMMLab. We further explore the integration of this assistant into the group chats of instant messaging (IM) tools such as WeChat and Lark. Through several iterative improvements and trials, we have developed a sophisticated technical chat assistant capable of effectively answering users' technical questions without causing message flooding. This paper's contributions include: 1) Designing an algorithm pipeline specifically for group chat scenarios; 2) Verifying the reliable performance of text2vec in task rejection; 3) Identifying three critical requirements for LLMs in technical-assistant-like products, namely scoring ability, In-Context Learning (ICL), and Long Context.

MultiPLY: A Multisensory Object-Centric Embodied Large Language Model in 3D World,"Yining Hong, Zishuo Zheng, Peihao Chen, Yian Wang, Junyan Li, Chuang Gan","Human beings possess the capability to multiply a melange of multisensory cues while actively exploring and interacting with the 3D world. Current multi-modal large language models, however, passively absorb sensory data as inputs, lacking the capacity to actively interact with the objects in the 3D environment and dynamically collect their multisensory information. To usher in the study of this area, we propose MultiPLY, a multisensory embodied large language model that could incorporate multisensory interactive data, including visual, audio, tactile, and thermal information into large language models, thereby establishing the correlation among words, actions, and percepts. To this end, we first collect Multisensory Universe, a large-scale multisensory interaction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied agent to engage with the 3D environment. To perform instruction tuning with pre-trained LLM on such generated data, we first encode the 3D scene as abstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens denoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment, as well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of the agent at each time step. In the inference time, MultiPLY could generate action tokens, instructing the agent to take the action in the environment and obtain the next multisensory state observation. The observation is then appended back to the LLM via state tokens to generate subsequent text or action tokens. We demonstrate that MultiPLY outperforms baselines by a large margin through a diverse set of embodied tasks involving object retrieval, tool use, multisensory captioning, and task decomposition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08577v1,2024-01
MMToM-QA: Multimodal Theory of Mind Question Answering,"Chuanyang Jin, Yutong Wu, Jing Cao, Jiannan Xiang, Yen-Ling Kuo, Zhiting Hu, Tomer Ullman, Antonio Torralba, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Tianmin Shu","Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand people's mental states, is an essential ingredient for developing machines with human-level social intelligence. Recent machine learning models, particularly large language models, seem to show some aspects of ToM understanding. However, existing ToM benchmarks use unimodal datasets - either video or text. Human ToM, on the other hand, is more than video or text understanding. People can flexibly reason about another person's mind based on conceptual representations (e.g., goals, beliefs, plans) extracted from any available data. To address this, we introduce a multimodal Theory of Mind question answering (MMToM-QA) benchmark. MMToM-QA comprehensively evaluates machine ToM both on multimodal data and on different kinds of unimodal data about a person's activity in a household environment. To engineer multimodal ToM capacity, we propose a novel method, BIP-ALM (Bayesian Inverse Planning Accelerated by Language Models). BIP-ALM extracts unified representations from multimodal data and utilizes language models for scalable Bayesian inverse planning. We conducted a systematic comparison of human performance, BIP-ALM, and state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4. The experiments demonstrate that large language models and large multimodal models still lack robust ToM capacity. BIP-ALM, on the other hand, shows promising results, by leveraging the power of both model-based mental inference and language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08743v2,2024-01
"Deductive Closure Training of Language Models for Coherence, Accuracy, and Updatability","Afra Feyza Akyürek, Ekin Akyürek, Leshem Choshen, Derry Wijaya, Jacob Andreas","While language models (LMs) can sometimes generate factually correct text and estimate truth values of individual claims, these generally do not reflect a globally coherent, manipulable model of the world. As a consequence, current LMs also generate incorrect or nonsensical content, and are difficult to edit and bring up to date. We present a method called Deductive Closure Training (DCT) that uses LMs themselves to identify implications of (and contradictions within) the text that they generate, yielding an efficient self-supervised procedure for improving LM factuality. Given a collection of seed documents, DCT prompts LMs to generate additional text implied by these documents, reason globally about the correctness of this generated text, and finally fine-tune on text inferred to be correct. Given seed documents from a trusted source, DCT provides a tool for supervised model updating; if seed documents are sampled from the LM itself, DCT enables fully unsupervised fine-tuning for improved coherence and accuracy. Across the CREAK, MQUaKE, and Reversal Curse datasets, supervised DCT improves LM fact verification and text generation accuracy by 3-26%; on CREAK fully unsupervised DCT improves verification accuracy by 12%. These results show that LMs' reasoning capabilities during inference can be leveraged during training to improve their reliability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08574v2,2024-01
"Connect, Collapse, Corrupt: Learning Cross-Modal Tasks with Uni-Modal Data","Yuhui Zhang, Elaine Sui, Serena Yeung-Levy","Building cross-modal applications is challenging due to limited paired multi-modal data. Recent works have shown that leveraging a pre-trained multi-modal contrastive representation space enables cross-modal tasks to be learned from uni-modal data. This is based on the assumption that contrastive optimization makes embeddings from different modalities interchangeable. However, this assumption is under-explored due to the poorly understood geometry of the multi-modal contrastive space, where a modality gap exists. In our study, we provide a theoretical explanation of this space's geometry and introduce a three-step method, $C^3$ (Connect, Collapse, Corrupt), to bridge the modality gap, enhancing the interchangeability of embeddings. Our $C^3$ method significantly improves cross-modal learning from uni-modal data, achieving state-of-the-art results on zero-shot image / audio / video captioning and text-to-image generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08567v1,2024-01
Tuning Language Models by Proxy,"Alisa Liu, Xiaochuang Han, Yizhong Wang, Yulia Tsvetkov, Yejin Choi, Noah A. Smith","Despite the general capabilities of large pretrained language models, they consistently benefit from further adaptation to better achieve desired behaviors. However, tuning these models has become increasingly resource-intensive, or impossible when model weights are private. We introduce proxy-tuning, a lightweight decoding-time algorithm that operates on top of black-box LMs to achieve the same end as direct tuning, but by accessing only its predictions over the output vocabulary, not its parameters. Our method tunes a smaller LM, then applies the difference between the predictions of the small tuned and untuned LMs to shift the original predictions of the larger untuned model in the direction of tuning, while retaining the benefits of larger-scale pretraining. In experiments, when we apply proxy-tuning to Llama2-70B using proxies of only 7B size, we can close 88% of the gap between Llama2-70B and its truly-tuned chat version, when evaluated across knowledge, reasoning, and safety benchmarks. We then demonstrate the generality of proxy-tuning by applying it to domain adaptation on code, and task-specific finetuning on question-answering and math problems. Finally, we show how to proxy-tune a truly black-box LM, GPT-3.5, for temporal adaptation, increasing its knowledge about recent events. Our work demonstrates the promise of using small tuned LMs to efficiently customize large, potentially proprietary LMs through decoding-time guidance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08565v4,2024-01
Spatial Entity Resolution between Restaurant Locations and Transportation Destinations in Southeast Asia,"Emily Gao, Dominic Widdows","As a tech company, Grab has expanded from transportation to food delivery, aiming to serve Southeast Asia with hyperlocalized applications. Information about places as transportation destinations can help to improve our knowledge about places as restaurants, so long as the spatial entity resolution problem between these datasets can be solved. In this project, we attempted to recognize identical place entities from databases of Points-of-Interest (POI) and GrabFood restaurants, using their spatial and textual attributes, i.e., latitude, longitude, place name, and street address.   Distance metrics were calculated for these attributes and fed to tree-based classifiers. POI-restaurant matching was conducted separately for Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Experimental estimates demonstrate that a matching POI can be found for over 35% of restaurants in these countries. As part of these estimates, test datasets were manually created, and RandomForest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost perform well, with most accuracy, precision, and recall scores close to or higher than 90% for matched vs. unmatched classification.

Supporting Student Decisions on Learning Recommendations: An LLM-Based Chatbot with Knowledge Graph Contextualization for Conversational Explainability and Mentoring,"Hasan Abu-Rasheed, Mohamad Hussam Abdulsalam, Christian Weber, Madjid Fathi","Student commitment towards a learning recommendation is not separable from their understanding of the reasons it was recommended to them; and their ability to modify it based on that understanding. Among explainability approaches, chatbots offer the potential to engage the student in a conversation, similar to a discussion with a peer or a mentor. The capabilities of chatbots, however, are still not sufficient to replace a human mentor, despite the advancements of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLM). Therefore, we propose an approach to utilize chatbots as mediators of the conversation and sources of limited and controlled generation of explanations, to harvest the potential of LLMs while reducing their potential risks at the same time. The proposed LLM-based chatbot supports students in understanding learning-paths recommendations. We use a knowledge graph (KG) as a human-curated source of information, to regulate the LLM's output through defining its prompt's context. A group chat approach is developed to connect students with human mentors, either on demand or in cases that exceed the chatbot's pre-defined tasks. We evaluate the chatbot with a user study, to provide a proof-of-concept and highlight the potential requirements and limitations of utilizing chatbots in conversational explainability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08517v3,2024-01
The Gaps between Pre-train and Downstream Settings in Bias Evaluation and Debiasing,"Masahiro Kaneko, Danushka Bollegala, Timothy Baldwin","The output tendencies of Pre-trained Language Models (PLM) vary markedly before and after Fine-Tuning (FT) due to the updates to the model parameters. These divergences in output tendencies result in a gap in the social biases of PLMs. For example, there exits a low correlation between intrinsic bias scores of a PLM and its extrinsic bias scores under FT-based debiasing methods. Additionally, applying FT-based debiasing methods to a PLM leads to a decline in performance in downstream tasks. On the other hand, PLMs trained on large datasets can learn without parameter updates via In-Context Learning (ICL) using prompts. ICL induces smaller changes to PLMs compared to FT-based debiasing methods. Therefore, we hypothesize that the gap observed in pre-trained and FT models does not hold true for debiasing methods that use ICL. In this study, we demonstrate that ICL-based debiasing methods show a higher correlation between intrinsic and extrinsic bias scores compared to FT-based methods. Moreover, the performance degradation due to debiasing is also lower in the ICL case compared to that in the FT case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08511v1,2024-01
EmoLLMs: A Series of Emotional Large Language Models and Annotation Tools for Comprehensive Affective Analysis,"Zhiwei Liu, Kailai Yang, Tianlin Zhang, Qianqian Xie, Sophia Ananiadou","Sentiment analysis and emotion detection are important research topics in natural language processing (NLP) and benefit many downstream tasks. With the widespread application of LLMs, researchers have started exploring the application of LLMs based on instruction-tuning in the field of sentiment analysis. However, these models only focus on single aspects of affective classification tasks (e.g. sentimental polarity or categorical emotions), and overlook the regression tasks (e.g. sentiment strength or emotion intensity), which leads to poor performance in downstream tasks. The main reason is the lack of comprehensive affective instruction tuning datasets and evaluation benchmarks, which cover various affective classification and regression tasks. Moreover, although emotional information is useful for downstream tasks, existing downstream datasets lack high-quality and comprehensive affective annotations. In this paper, we propose EmoLLMs, the first series of open-sourced instruction-following LLMs for comprehensive affective analysis based on fine-tuning various LLMs with instruction data, the first multi-task affective analysis instruction dataset (AAID) with 234K data samples based on various classification and regression tasks to support LLM instruction tuning, and a comprehensive affective evaluation benchmark (AEB) with 14 tasks from various sources and domains to test the generalization ability of LLMs. We propose a series of EmoLLMs by fine-tuning LLMs with AAID to solve various affective instruction tasks. We compare our model with a variety of LLMs on AEB, where our models outperform all other open-sourced LLMs, and surpass ChatGPT and GPT-4 in most tasks, which shows that the series of EmoLLMs achieve the ChatGPT-level and GPT-4-level generalization capabilities on affective analysis tasks, and demonstrates our models can be used as affective annotation tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08508v2,2024-01
Code Generation with AlphaCodium: From Prompt Engineering to Flow Engineering,"Tal Ridnik, Dedy Kredo, Itamar Friedman","Code generation problems differ from common natural language problems - they require matching the exact syntax of the target language, identifying happy paths and edge cases, paying attention to numerous small details in the problem spec, and addressing other code-specific issues and requirements. Hence, many of the optimizations and tricks that have been successful in natural language generation may not be effective for code tasks. In this work, we propose a new approach to code generation by LLMs, which we call AlphaCodium - a test-based, multi-stage, code-oriented iterative flow, that improves the performances of LLMs on code problems. We tested AlphaCodium on a challenging code generation dataset called CodeContests, which includes competitive programming problems from platforms such as Codeforces. The proposed flow consistently and significantly improves results. On the validation set, for example, GPT-4 accuracy (pass@5) increased from 19% with a single well-designed direct prompt to 44% with the AlphaCodium flow. Many of the principles and best practices acquired in this work, we believe, are broadly applicable to general code generation tasks.

"Large Language Models Portray Socially Subordinate Groups as More Homogeneous, Consistent with a Bias Observed in Humans","Messi H. J. Lee, Jacob M. Montgomery, Calvin K. Lai","Large language models (LLMs) are becoming pervasive in everyday life, yet their propensity to reproduce biases inherited from training data remains a pressing concern. Prior investigations into bias in LLMs have focused on the association of social groups with stereotypical attributes. However, this is only one form of human bias such systems may reproduce. We investigate a new form of bias in LLMs that resembles a social psychological phenomenon where socially subordinate groups are perceived as more homogeneous than socially dominant groups. We had ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art LLM, generate texts about intersectional group identities and compared those texts on measures of homogeneity. We consistently found that ChatGPT portrayed African, Asian, and Hispanic Americans as more homogeneous than White Americans, indicating that the model described racial minority groups with a narrower range of human experience. ChatGPT also portrayed women as more homogeneous than men, but these differences were small. Finally, we found that the effect of gender differed across racial/ethnic groups such that the effect of gender was consistent within African and Hispanic Americans but not within Asian and White Americans. We argue that the tendency of LLMs to describe groups as less diverse risks perpetuating stereotypes and discriminatory behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08495v2,2024-01
Contrastive Perplexity for Controlled Generation: An Application in Detoxifying Large Language Models,"Tassilo Klein, Moin Nabi","The generation of undesirable and factually incorrect content of large language models poses a significant challenge and remains largely an unsolved issue. This paper studies the integration of a contrastive learning objective for fine-tuning LLMs for implicit knowledge editing and controlled text generation. Optimizing the training objective entails aligning text perplexities in a contrastive fashion. To facilitate training the model in a self-supervised fashion, we leverage an off-the-shelf LLM for training data generation. We showcase applicability in the domain of detoxification. Herein, the proposed approach leads to a significant decrease in the generation of toxic content while preserving general utility for downstream tasks such as commonsense reasoning and reading comprehension. The proposed approach is conceptually simple but empirically powerful.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08491v2,2024-01
Decentralised Emergence of Robust and Adaptive Linguistic Conventions in Populations of Autonomous Agents Grounded in Continuous Worlds,"Jérôme Botoko Ekila, Jens Nevens, Lara Verheyen, Katrien Beuls, Paul Van Eecke","This paper introduces a methodology through which a population of autonomous agents can establish a linguistic convention that enables them to refer to arbitrary entities that they observe in their environment. The linguistic convention emerges in a decentralised manner through local communicative interactions between pairs of agents drawn from the population. The convention consists of symbolic labels (word forms) associated to concept representations (word meanings) that are grounded in a continuous feature space. The concept representations of each agent are individually constructed yet compatible on a communicative level. Through a range of experiments, we show (i) that the methodology enables a population to converge on a communicatively effective, coherent and human-interpretable linguistic convention, (ii) that it is naturally robust against sensor defects in individual agents, (iii) that it can effectively deal with noisy observations, uncalibrated sensors and heteromorphic populations, (iv) that the method is adequate for continual learning, and (v) that the convention self-adapts to changes in the environment and communicative needs of the agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08461v1,2024-01
Reinforcement Learning for Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graph,Mi Wu,"Conversational question answering (ConvQA) over law knowledge bases (KBs) involves answering multi-turn natural language questions about law and hope to find answers in the law knowledge base. Despite many methods have been proposed. Existing law knowledge base ConvQA model assume that the input question is clear and can perfectly reflect user's intention. However, in real world, the input questions are noisy and inexplict. This makes the model hard to find the correct answer in the law knowledge bases. In this paper, we try to use reinforcement learning to solve this problem. The reinforcement learning agent can automatically learn how to find the answer based on the input question and the conversation history, even when the input question is inexplicit. We test the proposed method on several real world datasets and the results show the effectivenss of the proposed model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08460v1,2024-01
Topic Modelling: Going Beyond Token Outputs,"Lowri Williams, Eirini Anthi, Laura Arman, Pete Burnap","Topic modelling is a text mining technique for identifying salient themes from a number of documents. The output is commonly a set of topics consisting of isolated tokens that often co-occur in such documents. Manual effort is often associated with interpreting a topic's description from such tokens. However, from a human's perspective, such outputs may not adequately provide enough information to infer the meaning of the topics; thus, their interpretability is often inaccurately understood. Although several studies have attempted to automatically extend topic descriptions as a means of enhancing the interpretation of topic models, they rely on external language sources that may become unavailable, must be kept up-to-date to generate relevant results, and present privacy issues when training on or processing data. This paper presents a novel approach towards extending the output of traditional topic modelling methods beyond a list of isolated tokens. This approach removes the dependence on external sources by using the textual data itself by extracting high-scoring keywords and mapping them to the topic model's token outputs. To measure the interpretability of the proposed outputs against those of the traditional topic modelling approach, independent annotators manually scored each output based on their quality and usefulness, as well as the efficiency of the annotation task. The proposed approach demonstrated higher quality and usefulness, as well as higher efficiency in the annotation task, in comparison to the outputs of a traditional topic modelling method, demonstrating an increase in their interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12990v1,2024-01
"Machine Translation with Large Language Models: Prompt Engineering for Persian, English, and Russian Directions","Nooshin Pourkamali, Shler Ebrahim Sharifi","Generative large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, question answering, text summarization, and natural language understanding.   To further enhance the performance of LLMs in machine translation, we conducted an investigation into two popular prompting methods and their combination, focusing on cross-language combinations of Persian, English, and Russian. We employed n-shot feeding and tailored prompting frameworks. Our findings indicate that multilingual LLMs like PaLM exhibit human-like machine translation outputs, enabling superior fine-tuning of desired translation nuances in accordance with style guidelines and linguistic considerations. These models also excel in processing and applying prompts. However, the choice of language model, machine translation task, and the specific source and target languages necessitate certain considerations when adopting prompting frameworks and utilizing n-shot in-context learning.   Furthermore, we identified errors and limitations inherent in popular LLMs as machine translation tools and categorized them based on various linguistic metrics. This typology of errors provides valuable insights for utilizing LLMs effectively and offers methods for designing prompts for in-context learning. Our report aims to contribute to the advancement of machine translation with LLMs by improving both the accuracy and reliability of evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08429v1,2024-01
Ask the experts: sourcing high-quality datasets for nutritional counselling through Human-AI collaboration,"Simone Balloccu, Ehud Reiter, Vivek Kumar, Diego Reforgiato Recupero, Daniele Riboni","Large Language Models (LLMs), with their flexible generation abilities, can be powerful data sources in domains with few or no available corpora. However, problems like hallucinations and biases limit such applications. In this case study, we pick nutrition counselling, a domain lacking any public resource, and show that high-quality datasets can be gathered by combining LLMs, crowd-workers and nutrition experts. We first crowd-source and cluster a novel dataset of diet-related issues, then work with experts to prompt ChatGPT into producing related supportive text. Finally, we let the experts evaluate the safety of the generated text. We release HAI-coaching, the first expert-annotated nutrition counselling dataset containing ~2.4K dietary struggles from crowd workers, and ~97K related supportive texts generated by ChatGPT. Extensive analysis shows that ChatGPT while producing highly fluent and human-like text, also manifests harmful behaviours, especially in sensitive topics like mental health, making it unsuitable for unsupervised use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08420v1,2024-01
Contrastive Preference Optimization: Pushing the Boundaries of LLM Performance in Machine Translation,"Haoran Xu, Amr Sharaf, Yunmo Chen, Weiting Tan, Lingfeng Shen, Benjamin Van Durme, Kenton Murray, Young Jin Kim","Moderate-sized large language models (LLMs) -- those with 7B or 13B parameters -- exhibit promising machine translation (MT) performance. However, even the top-performing 13B LLM-based translation models, like ALMA, does not match the performance of state-of-the-art conventional encoder-decoder translation models or larger-scale LLMs such as GPT-4. In this study, we bridge this performance gap. We first assess the shortcomings of supervised fine-tuning for LLMs in the MT task, emphasizing the quality issues present in the reference data, despite being human-generated. Then, in contrast to SFT which mimics reference translations, we introduce Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO), a novel approach that trains models to avoid generating adequate but not perfect translations. Applying CPO to ALMA models with only 22K parallel sentences and 12M parameters yields significant improvements. The resulting model, called ALMA-R, can match or exceed the performance of the WMT competition winners and GPT-4 on WMT'21, WMT'22 and WMT'23 test datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08417v4,2024-01

Estevão Filho, Todd Hendry, Daniel Holstein, Jennifer Marsman, Nick Mecklenburg, Sara Malvar, Leonardo O. Nunes, Rafael Padilha, Morris Sharp, Bruno Silva, Swati Sharma, Vijay Aski, Ranveer Chandra","There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain-specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-Tuning. RAG augments the prompt with the external data, while fine-Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself. However, the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a pipeline for fine-tuning and RAG, and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs, including Llama2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our pipeline consists of multiple stages, including extracting information from PDFs, generating questions and answers, using them for fine-tuning, and leveraging GPT-4 for evaluating the results. We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine-Tuning pipeline. We conduct an in-depth study on an agricultural dataset. Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI, and we study a potentially disruptive application - what if we could provide location-specific insights to a farmer? Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic-specific knowledge, and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine-tuning. We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p. when fine-tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG, which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further. In one particular experiment, we also demonstrate that the fine-tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions, increasing answer similarity from 47% to 72%. Overall, the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry, paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08406v3,2024-01

Evaluation results confirmed that GPT-4V performs comparatively to human physicians regarding multi-choice accuracy (81.6% vs. 77.8%). GPT-4V also performs well in cases where physicians incorrectly answer, with over 78% accuracy. However, we discovered that GPT-4V frequently presents flawed rationales in cases where it makes the correct final choices (35.5%), most prominent in image comprehension (27.2%).

Into the crossfire: evaluating the use of a language model to crowdsource gun violence reports,"Adriano Belisario, Scott Hale, Luc Rocher","Gun violence is a pressing and growing human rights issue that affects nearly every dimension of the social fabric, from healthcare and education to psychology and the economy. Reliable data on firearm events is paramount to developing more effective public policy and emergency responses. However, the lack of comprehensive databases and the risks of in-person surveys prevent human rights organizations from collecting needed data in most countries. Here, we partner with a Brazilian human rights organization to conduct a systematic evaluation of language models to assist with monitoring real-world firearm events from social media data. We propose a fine-tuned BERT-based model trained on Twitter (now X) texts to distinguish gun violence reports from ordinary Portuguese texts. Our model achieves a high AUC score of 0.97. We then incorporate our model into a web application and test it in a live intervention. We study and interview Brazilian analysts who continuously fact-check social media texts to identify new gun violence events. Qualitative assessments show that our solution helped all analysts use their time more efficiently and expanded their search capacities. Quantitative assessments show that the use of our model was associated with more analysts' interactions with online users reporting gun violence. Taken together, our findings suggest that modern Natural Language Processing techniques can help support the work of human rights organizations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12989v1,2024-01
DoraemonGPT: Toward Understanding Dynamic Scenes with Large Language Models (Exemplified as A Video Agent),"Zongxin Yang, Guikun Chen, Xiaodi Li, Wenguan Wang, Yi Yang","Recent LLM-driven visual agents mainly focus on solving image-based tasks, which limits their ability to understand dynamic scenes, making it far from real-life applications like guiding students in laboratory experiments and identifying their mistakes. Hence, this paper explores DoraemonGPT, a comprehensive and conceptually elegant system driven by LLMs to understand dynamic scenes. Considering the video modality better reflects the ever-changing nature of real-world scenarios, we exemplify DoraemonGPT as a video agent. Given a video with a question/task, DoraemonGPT begins by converting the input video into a symbolic memory that stores task-related attributes. This structured representation allows for spatial-temporal querying and reasoning by well-designed sub-task tools, resulting in concise intermediate results. Recognizing that LLMs have limited internal knowledge when it comes to specialized domains (e.g., analyzing the scientific principles underlying experiments), we incorporate plug-and-play tools to assess external knowledge and address tasks across different domains. Moreover, a novel LLM-driven planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search is introduced to explore the large planning space for scheduling various tools. The planner iteratively finds feasible solutions by backpropagating the result's reward, and multiple solutions can be summarized into an improved final answer. We extensively evaluate DoraemonGPT's effectiveness on three benchmarks and several in-the-wild scenarios. The code will be released at https://github.com/z-x-yang/DoraemonGPT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08392v3,2024-01
Cross-lingual neural fuzzy matching for exploiting target-language monolingual corpora in computer-aided translation,"Miquel Esplà-Gomis, Víctor M. Sánchez-Cartagena, Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz, Felipe Sánchez-Martínez","Computer-aided translation (CAT) tools based on translation memories (MT) play a prominent role in the translation workflow of professional translators. However, the reduced availability of in-domain TMs, as compared to in-domain monolingual corpora, limits its adoption for a number of translation tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel neural approach aimed at overcoming this limitation by exploiting not only TMs, but also in-domain target-language (TL) monolingual corpora, and still enabling a similar functionality to that offered by conventional TM-based CAT tools. Our approach relies on cross-lingual sentence embeddings to retrieve translation proposals from TL monolingual corpora, and on a neural model to estimate their post-editing effort. The paper presents an automatic evaluation of these techniques on four language pairs that shows that our approach can successfully exploit monolingual texts in a TM-based CAT environment, increasing the amount of useful translation proposals, and that our neural model for estimating the post-editing effort enables the combination of translation proposals obtained from monolingual corpora and from TMs in the usual way. A human evaluation performed on a single language pair confirms the results of the automatic evaluation and seems to indicate that the translation proposals retrieved with our approach are more useful than what the automatic evaluation shows.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08374v1,2024-01
Few-Shot Learning for Chronic Disease Management: Leveraging Large Language Models and Multi-Prompt Engineering with Medical Knowledge Injection,"Haoxin Liu, Wenli Zhang, Jiaheng Xie, Buomsoo Kim, Zhu Zhang, Yidong Chai","This study harnesses state-of-the-art AI technology for chronic disease management, specifically in detecting various mental disorders through user-generated textual content. Existing studies typically rely on fully supervised machine learning, which presents challenges such as the labor-intensive manual process of annotating extensive training data for each disease and the need to design specialized deep learning architectures for each problem. To address such challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages advanced AI techniques, including large language models and multi-prompt engineering. Specifically, we address two key technical challenges in data-driven chronic disease management: (1) developing personalized prompts to represent each user's uniqueness and (2) incorporating medical knowledge into prompts to provide context for chronic disease detection, instruct learning objectives, and operationalize prediction goals. We evaluate our method using four mental disorders, which are prevalent chronic diseases worldwide, as research cases. On the depression detection task, our method (F1 = 0.975~0.978) significantly outperforms traditional supervised learning paradigms, including feature engineering (F1 = 0.760) and architecture engineering (F1 = 0.756). Meanwhile, our approach demonstrates success in few-shot learning, i.e., requiring only a minimal number of training examples to detect chronic diseases based on user-generated textual content (i.e., only 2, 10, or 100 subjects). Moreover, our method can be generalized to other mental disorder detection tasks, including anorexia, pathological gambling, and self-harm (F1 = 0.919~0.978).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12988v1,2024-01

Salute the Classic: Revisiting Challenges of Machine Translation in the Age of Large Language Models,"Jianhui Pang, Fanghua Ye, Longyue Wang, Dian Yu, Derek F. Wong, Shuming Shi, Zhaopeng Tu","The evolution of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been significantly influenced by six core challenges (Koehn and Knowles, 2017), which have acted as benchmarks for progress in this field. This study revisits these challenges, offering insights into their ongoing relevance in the context of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): domain mismatch, amount of parallel data, rare word prediction, translation of long sentences, attention model as word alignment, and sub-optimal beam search. Our empirical findings indicate that LLMs effectively lessen the reliance on parallel data for major languages in the pretraining phase. Additionally, the LLM-based translation system significantly enhances the translation of long sentences that contain approximately 80 words and shows the capability to translate documents of up to 512 words. However, despite these significant improvements, the challenges of domain mismatch and prediction of rare words persist. While the challenges of word alignment and beam search, specifically associated with NMT, may not apply to LLMs, we identify three new challenges for LLMs in translation tasks: inference efficiency, translation of low-resource languages in the pretraining phase, and human-aligned evaluation.

RoTBench: A Multi-Level Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Models in Tool Learning,"Junjie Ye, Yilong Wu, Songyang Gao, Caishuang Huang, Sixian Li, Guanyu Li, Xiaoran Fan, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang","Tool learning has generated widespread interest as a vital means of interaction between Large Language Models (LLMs) and the physical world. Current research predominantly emphasizes LLMs' capacity to utilize tools in well-structured environments while overlooking their stability when confronted with the inevitable noise of the real world. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoTBench, a multi-level benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, we establish five external environments, each featuring varying levels of noise (i.e., Clean, Slight, Medium, Heavy, and Union), providing an in-depth analysis of the model's resilience across three critical phases: tool selection, parameter identification, and content filling. Experiments involving six widely-used models underscore the urgent necessity for enhancing the robustness of LLMs in tool learning. For instance, the performance of GPT-4 even drops significantly from 80.00 to 58.10 when there is no substantial change in manual accuracy. More surprisingly, the noise correction capability inherent in the GPT family paradoxically impedes its adaptability in the face of mild noise. In light of these findings, we propose RoTTuning, a strategy that enriches the diversity of training environments to bolster the robustness of LLMs in tool learning.

Application of LLM Agents in Recruitment: A Novel Framework for Resume Screening,"Chengguang Gan, Qinghao Zhang, Tatsunori Mori","The automation of resume screening is a crucial aspect of the recruitment process in organizations. Automated resume screening systems often encompass a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This paper introduces a novel Large Language Models (LLMs) based agent framework for resume screening, aimed at enhancing efficiency and time management in recruitment processes. Our framework is distinct in its ability to efficiently summarize and grade each resume from a large dataset. Moreover, it utilizes LLM agents for decision-making. To evaluate our framework, we constructed a dataset from actual resumes and simulated a resume screening process. Subsequently, the outcomes of the simulation experiment were compared and subjected to detailed analysis. The results demonstrate that our automated resume screening framework is 11 times faster than traditional manual methods. Furthermore, by fine-tuning the LLMs, we observed a significant improvement in the F1 score, reaching 87.73\%, during the resume sentence classification phase. In the resume summarization and grading phase, our fine-tuned model surpassed the baseline performance of the GPT-3.5 model.

Anchor function: a type of benchmark functions for studying language models,"Zhongwang Zhang, Zhiwei Wang, Junjie Yao, Zhangchen Zhou, Xiaolong Li, Weinan E, Zhi-Qin John Xu","Understanding transformer-based language models is becoming increasingly crucial, particularly as they play pivotal roles in advancing towards artificial general intelligence. However, language model research faces significant challenges, especially for academic research groups with constrained resources. These challenges include complex data structures, unknown target functions, high computational costs and memory requirements, and a lack of interpretability in the inference process, etc. Drawing a parallel to the use of simple models in scientific research, we propose the concept of an anchor function. This is a type of benchmark function designed for studying language models in learning tasks that follow an ""anchor-key"" pattern. By utilizing the concept of an anchor function, we can construct a series of functions to simulate various language tasks. The anchor function plays a role analogous to that of mice in diabetes research, particularly suitable for academic research. We demonstrate the utility of the anchor function with an example, revealing two basic operations by attention structures in language models: shifting tokens and broadcasting one token from one position to many positions. These operations are also commonly observed in large language models.

Existing methods devise the learning module to acquire task-specific knowledge with parameter-efficient tuning (PET) block and the selection module to pick out the corresponding one for the testing input, aiming at handling the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer in CL. However, these methods tend to address only one of the challenges, ignoring the potential of aligning the two modules to effectively address catastrophic forgetting and knowledge transfer simultaneously. To this end, we propose a novel Shared Attention Framework (SAPT), to align the PET learning and selection via the Shared Attentive Learning \& Selection module. Extensive Experiments on two CL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SAPT. Moreover, SAPT consistently demonstrates its superiority when we scale it to different model sizes (from 770M to 13B), different model architectures (T5 and LLaMA-2) and unseen tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08295v3,2024-01
Inferflow: an Efficient and Highly Configurable Inference Engine for Large Language Models,"Shuming Shi, Enbo Zhao, Deng Cai, Leyang Cui, Xinting Huang, Huayang Li","We present Inferflow, an efficient and highly configurable inference engine for large language models (LLMs). With Inferflow, users can serve most of the common transformer models by simply modifying some lines in corresponding configuration files, without writing a single line of source code. Compared with most existing inference engines, Inferflow has some key features. First, by implementing a modular framework of atomic build-blocks and technologies, Inferflow is compositionally generalizable to new models. Second, 3.5-bit quantization is introduced in Inferflow as a tradeoff between 3-bit and 4-bit quantization. Third, hybrid model partitioning for multi-GPU inference is introduced in Inferflow to better balance inference speed and throughput than the existing partition-by-layer and partition-by-tensor strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08294v1,2024-01
AesBench: An Expert Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models on Image Aesthetics Perception,"Yipo Huang, Quan Yuan, Xiangfei Sheng, Zhichao Yang, Haoning Wu, Pengfei Chen, Yuzhe Yang, Leida Li, Weisi Lin","With collective endeavors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are undergoing a flourishing development. However, their performances on image aesthetics perception remain indeterminate, which is highly desired in real-world applications. An obvious obstacle lies in the absence of a specific benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs on aesthetic perception. This blind groping may impede the further development of more advanced MLLMs with aesthetic perception capacity. To address this dilemma, we propose AesBench, an expert benchmark aiming to comprehensively evaluate the aesthetic perception capacities of MLLMs through elaborate design across dual facets. (1) We construct an Expert-labeled Aesthetics Perception Database (EAPD), which features diversified image contents and high-quality annotations provided by professional aesthetic experts. (2) We propose a set of integrative criteria to measure the aesthetic perception abilities of MLLMs from four perspectives, including Perception (AesP), Empathy (AesE), Assessment (AesA) and Interpretation (AesI). Extensive experimental results underscore that the current MLLMs only possess rudimentary aesthetic perception ability, and there is still a significant gap between MLLMs and humans. We hope this work can inspire the community to engage in deeper explorations on the aesthetic potentials of MLLMs. Source data will be available at https://github.com/yipoh/AesBench.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08276v1,2024-01
Large Language Models are Null-Shot Learners,"Pittawat Taveekitworachai, Febri Abdullah, Ruck Thawonmas","This paper presents null-shot prompting. Null-shot prompting exploits hallucination in large language models (LLMs) by instructing LLMs to utilize information from the ""Examples"" section that never exists within the provided context to perform a task. While reducing hallucination is crucial and non-negligible for daily and critical uses of LLMs, we propose that in the current landscape in which these LLMs still hallucinate, it is possible, in fact, to exploit hallucination to increase performance in performing tasks compared to standard zero-shot prompting. Experiments with eight LLMs show improvements in performance across the majority of eight datasets, including reading comprehension, arithmetic reasoning, and closed-book question answering. The observed inconsistency in increased relative performance across the LLMs also potentially indicates a different degree of inherent hallucination in each model. These differences show that it is possible to utilize null-shot prompting as a way to detect degrees of hallucination in LLMs using existing benchmarking datasets. We also perform ablation studies, including experimenting with a modified version of null-shot prompting that incorporates ideas from zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which shows different trends of results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08273v3,2024-01
A Generative Adversarial Attack for Multilingual Text Classifiers,"Tom Roth, Inigo Jauregi Unanue, Alsharif Abuadbba, Massimo Piccardi","Current adversarial attack algorithms, where an adversary changes a text to fool a victim model, have been repeatedly shown to be effective against text classifiers. These attacks, however, generally assume that the victim model is monolingual and cannot be used to target multilingual victim models, a significant limitation given the increased use of these models. For this reason, in this work we propose an approach to fine-tune a multilingual paraphrase model with an adversarial objective so that it becomes able to generate effective adversarial examples against multilingual classifiers. The training objective incorporates a set of pre-trained models to ensure text quality and language consistency of the generated text. In addition, all the models are suitably connected to the generator by vocabulary-mapping matrices, allowing for full end-to-end differentiability of the overall training pipeline. The experimental validation over two multilingual datasets and five languages has shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to existing baselines, particularly in terms of query efficiency. We also provide a detailed analysis of the generated attacks and discuss limitations and opportunities for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08255v1,2024-01
LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention,"Yumeng Wang, Zhenyang Xiao","Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to the high demand on GPU memory and computational resources when handling long contexts. While sparsify the Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to alleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09486v2,2024-01
Generative Multi-Modal Knowledge Retrieval with Large Language Models,"Xinwei Long, Jiali Zeng, Fandong Meng, Zhiyuan Ma, Kaiyan Zhang, Bowen Zhou, Jie Zhou","Knowledge retrieval with multi-modal queries plays a crucial role in supporting knowledge-intensive multi-modal applications. However, existing methods face challenges in terms of their effectiveness and training efficiency, especially when it comes to training and integrating multiple retrievers to handle multi-modal queries. In this paper, we propose an innovative end-to-end generative framework for multi-modal knowledge retrieval. Our framework takes advantage of the fact that large language models (LLMs) can effectively serve as virtual knowledge bases, even when trained with limited data. We retrieve knowledge via a two-step process: 1) generating knowledge clues related to the queries, and 2) obtaining the relevant document by searching databases using the knowledge clue. In particular, we first introduce an object-aware prefix-tuning technique to guide multi-grained visual learning. Then, we align multi-grained visual features into the textual feature space of the LLM, employing the LLM to capture cross-modal interactions. Subsequently, we construct instruction data with a unified format for model training. Finally, we propose the knowledge-guided generation strategy to impose prior constraints in the decoding steps, thereby promoting the generation of distinctive knowledge clues. Through experiments conducted on three benchmarks, we demonstrate significant improvements ranging from 3.0% to 14.6% across all evaluation metrics when compared to strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08206v1,2024-01
MARIO: MAth Reasoning with code Interpreter Output -- A Reproducible Pipeline,"Minpeng Liao, Wei Luo, Chengxi Li, Jing Wu, Kai Fan","Large language models (LLMs) have seen considerable advancements in natural language understanding tasks, yet there remains a gap to bridge before attaining true artificial general intelligence, especially concerning shortcomings in mathematical reasoning capabilities. We postulate that the inherent nature of LLM training, which focuses on predicting probabilities of next token, presents challenges in effectively modeling mathematical reasoning that demands exact calculations, both from data-driven and theoretical standpoints. In this paper, we address this challenge by enriching the data landscape and introducing a novel math dataset, enhanced with a capability to utilize a Python code interpreter. This dataset is derived from GSM8K and MATH and has been further refined through a combination of GPT-4 annotations, human review, and self-training processes, where the errors in the original GSM8K training set have been fixed. Additionally, we propose a tentative, easily replicable protocol for the fine-tuning of math-specific LLMs, which has led to a significant improvement in the performance of a 7B-parameter LLM on the GSM8K and MATH datasets. We are committed to advancing the field of mathematical reasoning in LLMs and, to that end, we have made source code for data generation / training / inference, and the model checkpoints publicly available at \url{https://github.com/MARIO-Math-Reasoning/MARIO}. We hope this will facilitate further research and development within the community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08190v3,2024-01
PRewrite: Prompt Rewriting with Reinforcement Learning,"Weize Kong, Spurthi Amba Hombaiah, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Michael Bendersky","Prompt engineering is critical for the development of LLM-based applications. However, it is usually done manually in a ""trial and error"" fashion that can be time consuming, ineffective, and sub-optimal. Even for the prompts which seemingly work well, there is always a lingering question: can the prompts be made better with further modifications?   To address these problems, we investigate automated prompt engineering in this paper. Specifically, we propose PRewrite, an automated method to rewrite an under-optimized prompt to a more effective prompt. We instantiate the prompt rewriter using a LLM. The rewriter LLM is trained using reinforcement learning to optimize the performance on a given downstream task. We conduct experiments on diverse benchmark datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of PRewrite.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08189v4,2024-01
TelME: Teacher-leading Multimodal Fusion Network for Emotion Recognition in Conversation,"Taeyang Yun, Hyunkuk Lim, Jeonghwan Lee, Min Song","Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) plays a crucial role in enabling dialogue systems to effectively respond to user requests. The emotions in a conversation can be identified by the representations from various modalities, such as audio, visual, and text. However, due to the weak contribution of non-verbal modalities to recognize emotions, multimodal ERC has always been considered a challenging task. In this paper, we propose Teacher-leading Multimodal fusion network for ERC (TelME). TelME incorporates cross-modal knowledge distillation to transfer information from a language model acting as the teacher to the non-verbal students, thereby optimizing the efficacy of the weak modalities. We then combine multimodal features using a shifting fusion approach in which student networks support the teacher. TelME achieves state-of-the-art performance in MELD, a multi-speaker conversation dataset for ERC. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our components through additional experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12987v2,2024-01
Crowdsourced Adaptive Surveys,Yamil Velez,"Public opinion surveys are vital for informing democratic decision-making, but responding to rapidly evolving information environments and measuring beliefs within niche communities can be challenging for traditional survey methods. This paper introduces a crowdsourced adaptive survey methodology (CSAS) that unites advances in natural language processing and adaptive algorithms to generate question banks that evolve with user input. The CSAS method converts open-ended text provided by participants into survey items and applies a multi-armed bandit algorithm to determine which questions should be prioritized in the survey. The method's adaptive nature allows for the exploration of new survey questions, while imposing minimal costs in survey length. Applications in the domains of Latino information environments, national issue importance, and local politics showcase CSAS's ability to identify topics that might otherwise escape the notice of survey researchers. I conclude by highlighting CSAS's potential to bridge conceptual gaps between researchers and participants in survey research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12986v2,2024-01
A Study on Training and Developing Large Language Models for Behavior Tree Generation,"Fu Li, Xueying Wang, Bin Li, Yunlong Wu, Yanzhen Wang, Xiaodong Yi","This paper presents an innovative exploration of the application potential of large language models (LLM) in addressing the challenging task of automatically generating behavior trees (BTs) for complex tasks. The conventional manual BT generation method is inefficient and heavily reliant on domain expertise. On the other hand, existing automatic BT generation technologies encounter bottlenecks related to task complexity, model adaptability, and reliability. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose a novel methodology that leverages the robust representation and reasoning abilities of LLMs. The core contribution of this paper lies in the design of a BT generation framework based on LLM, which encompasses the entire process, from data synthesis and model training to application developing and data verification. Synthetic data is introduced to train the BT generation model (BTGen model), enhancing its understanding and adaptability to various complex tasks, thereby significantly improving its overall performance. In order to ensure the effectiveness and executability of the generated BTs, we emphasize the importance of data verification and introduce a multilevel verification strategy. Additionally, we explore a range of agent design and development schemes with LLM as the central element. We hope that the work in this paper may provide a reference for the researchers who are interested in BT generation based on LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08089v1,2024-01
Enhancing Document-level Translation of Large Language Model via Translation Mixed-instructions,"Yachao Li, Junhui Li, Jing Jiang, Min Zhang","Existing large language models (LLMs) for machine translation are typically fine-tuned on sentence-level translation instructions and achieve satisfactory performance at the sentence level. However, when applied to document-level translation, these models face a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with documents containing over 512 tokens. This challenge arises from the issue of sentence-level coverage, where subsequent sentences in the document remain untranslated. As a result, the document-level translation capability of LLMs fine-tuned on sentence-level translation instructions is significantly limited. We conjecture that the primary cause of LLMs' weak document-level translation performance is the absence of document-to-document mapping ability. To address the issue, we propose an approach that combines sentence-level and document-level translation instructions of varying lengths to fine-tune LLMs. Our proposed translation mixed-instructions enable LLMs (Llama-2~7B and 13B) to maintain consistent translation performance from the sentence level to documents containing as many as 2048 tokens. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the document-level translation capabilities of LLMs on 10 language pairs, effectively mitigating the sentence-level coverage issue in document-level translation. Experimentation on discourse phenomena has demonstrated that our document-level translation approach significantly improves translation quality, both in terms of BLEU score and discourse coherence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08088v1,2024-01

Incremental Extractive Opinion Summarization Using Cover Trees,"Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury, Nicholas Monath, Avinava Dubey, Manzil Zaheer, Andrew McCallum, Amr Ahmed, Snigdha Chaturvedi","Extractive opinion summarization involves automatically producing a summary of text about an entity (e.g., a product's reviews) by extracting representative sentences that capture prevalent opinions in the review set. Typically, in online marketplaces user reviews accumulate over time, and opinion summaries need to be updated periodically to provide customers with up-to-date information. In this work, we study the task of extractive opinion summarization in an incremental setting, where the underlying review set evolves over time. Many of the state-of-the-art extractive opinion summarization approaches are centrality-based, such as CentroidRank (Radev et al., 2004; Chowdhury et al., 2022). CentroidRank performs extractive summarization by selecting a subset of review sentences closest to the centroid in the representation space as the summary. However, these methods are not capable of operating efficiently in an incremental setting, where reviews arrive one at a time. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for accurately computing the CentroidRank summaries in an incremental setting. Our approach, CoverSumm, relies on indexing review representations in a cover tree and maintaining a reservoir of candidate summary review sentences. CoverSumm's efficacy is supported by a theoretical and empirical analysis of running time. Empirically, on a diverse collection of data (both real and synthetically created to illustrate scaling considerations), we demonstrate that CoverSumm is up to 36x faster than baseline methods, and capable of adapting to nuanced changes in data distribution. We also conduct human evaluations of the generated summaries and find that CoverSumm is capable of producing informative summaries consistent with the underlying review set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08047v2,2024-01
Enhancing Robustness of LLM-Synthetic Text Detectors for Academic Writing: A Comprehensive Analysis,"Zhicheng Dou, Yuchen Guo, Ching-Chun Chang, Huy H. Nguyen, Isao Echizen","The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) used by ChatGPT, has profoundly impacted the academic and broader community. While these models offer numerous advantages in terms of revolutionizing work and study methods, they have also garnered significant attention due to their potential negative consequences. One example is generating academic reports or papers with little to no human contribution. Consequently, researchers have focused on developing detectors to address the misuse of LLMs. However, most existing methods prioritize achieving higher accuracy on restricted datasets, neglecting the crucial aspect of generalizability. This limitation hinders their practical application in real-life scenarios where reliability is paramount. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the impact of prompts on the text generated by LLMs and highlight the potential lack of robustness in one of the current state-of-the-art GPT detectors. To mitigate these issues concerning the misuse of LLMs in academic writing, we propose a reference-based Siamese detector named Synthetic-Siamese which takes a pair of texts, one as the inquiry and the other as the reference. Our method effectively addresses the lack of robustness of previous detectors (OpenAI detector and DetectGPT) and significantly improves the baseline performances in realistic academic writing scenarios by approximately 67% to 95%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08046v1,2024-01
Calpric: Inclusive and Fine-grain Labeling of Privacy Policies with Crowdsourcing and Active Learning,"Wenjun Qiu, David Lie, Lisa Austin","A significant challenge to training accurate deep learning models on privacy policies is the cost and difficulty of obtaining a large and comprehensive set of training data. To address these challenges, we present Calpric , which combines automatic text selection and segmentation, active learning and the use of crowdsourced annotators to generate a large, balanced training set for privacy policies at low cost. Automated text selection and segmentation simplifies the labeling task, enabling untrained annotators from crowdsourcing platforms, like Amazon's Mechanical Turk, to be competitive with trained annotators, such as law students, and also reduces inter-annotator agreement, which decreases labeling cost. Having reliable labels for training enables the use of active learning, which uses fewer training samples to efficiently cover the input space, further reducing cost and improving class and data category balance in the data set. The combination of these techniques allows Calpric to produce models that are accurate over a wider range of data categories, and provide more detailed, fine-grain labels than previous work. Our crowdsourcing process enables Calpric to attain reliable labeled data at a cost of roughly $0.92-$1.71 per labeled text segment. Calpric 's training process also generates a labeled data set of 16K privacy policy text segments across 9 Data categories with balanced positive and negative samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08038v1,2024-01

Resonating with humans' ability to solve complex text-based problems by (1) creating a visual diagram from the problem and (2) deducing what steps they need to take to solve it, we propose Self-Imagine. We leverage a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate a structured representation of the question using HTML, then render the HTML as an image, and finally use the same VLM to answer the question using both the question and the image. Our approach does not require any additional training data or training. We evaluate our approach on three mathematics tasks and nine general-purpose reasoning tasks using state-of-the-art (LLAVA-1.5 and GEMINI PRO) VLMs. Our approach boosts the performance of LLAVA-1.5 and GEMINI PRO on all math tasks (on average GSM8K: +3.1%; ASDIV: +3.2%; SVAMP: +6.9%) and the majority of the general-purpose reasoning tasks by 3.2% to 6.0% on average.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08025v2,2024-01
A Novel Approach for Automatic Program Repair using Round-Trip Translation with Large Language Models,"Fernando Vallecillos Ruiz, Anastasiia Grishina, Max Hort, Leon Moonen","Research shows that grammatical mistakes in a sentence can be corrected by translating it to another language and back using neural machine translation with language models. We investigate whether this correction capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) extends to Automatic Program Repair (APR). Current generative models for APR are pre-trained on source code and fine-tuned for repair. This paper proposes bypassing the fine-tuning step and using Round-Trip Translation (RTT): translation of code from one programming language to another programming or natural language, and back. We hypothesize that RTT with LLMs restores the most commonly seen patterns in code during pre-training, i.e., performs a regression toward the mean, which removes bugs as they are a form of noise w.r.t. the more frequent, natural, bug-free code in the training data. To test this hypothesis, we employ eight recent LLMs pre-trained on code, including the latest GPT versions, and four common program repair benchmarks in Java. We find that RTT with English as an intermediate language repaired 101 of 164 bugs with GPT-4 on the HumanEval-Java dataset. Moreover, 46 of these are unique bugs that are not repaired by other LLMs fine-tuned for APR. Our findings highlight the viability of round-trip translation with LLMs as a technique for automated program repair and its potential for research in software engineering.

Towards Efficient Methods in Medical Question Answering using Knowledge Graph Embeddings,"Saptarshi Sengupta, Connor Heaton, Suhan Cui, Soumalya Sarkar, Prasenjit Mitra","In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is the task of answering a question based on a given context. To handle questions in the medical domain, modern language models such as BioBERT, SciBERT and even ChatGPT are trained on vast amounts of in-domain medical corpora. However, in-domain pre-training is expensive in terms of time and resources. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient approach for injecting domain knowledge into a model without relying on such domain-specific pre-training.   Knowledge graphs are powerful resources for accessing medical information. Building on existing work, we introduce a method using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for aligning and integrating embeddings extracted from medical knowledge graphs with the embedding spaces of pre-trained language models (LMs). The aligned embeddings are fused with open-domain LMs BERT and RoBERTa that are fine-tuned for two MRC tasks, span detection (COVID-QA) and multiple-choice questions (PubMedQA). We compare our method to prior techniques that rely on a vocabulary overlap for embedding alignment and show how our method circumvents this requirement to deliver better performance. On both datasets, our method allows BERT/RoBERTa to either perform on par (occasionally exceeding) with stronger domain-specific models or show improvements in general over prior techniques. With the proposed approach, we signal an alternative method to in-domain pre-training to achieve domain proficiency. Our code is available here.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07977v3,2024-01

In other words, I suggest that AI is one of the best tools we have for exploring intelligence space, namely the space of possible intelligent systems. I illustrate the value of AI-as-exploration by focusing on a specific case study, i.e., recent work on the capacity to combine novel and invented concepts in humans and Large Language Models.

In this study, we tackle one of the most widely used tasks - answering Multiple Choice Question (MCQ). We analyze 26 small open-source models and find that 65% of the models do not understand the task, only 4 models properly select an answer from the given choices, and only 5 of these models are choice order independent.

However, such applications are currently limited by LLMs' deficiencies in understanding intricate scientific concepts, deriving symbolic equations, and solving advanced numerical calculations. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SciInstruct, a suite of scientific instructions for training scientific language models capable of college-level scientific reasoning. Central to our approach is a novel self-reflective instruction annotation framework to address the data scarcity challenge in the science domain.

Applying this framework, we curated a diverse and high-quality dataset encompassing physics, chemistry, math, and formal proofs. We analyze the curated SciInstruct from multiple interesting perspectives (e.g., domain, scale, source, question type, answer length, etc.). To verify the effectiveness of SciInstruct, we fine-tuned different language models with SciInstruct, i.e., ChatGLM3 (6B and 32B), Llama3-8B-Instruct, and Mistral-7B: MetaMath, enhancing their scientific and mathematical reasoning capabilities, without sacrificing the language understanding capabilities of the base model.

Are self-explanations from Large Language Models faithful?,"Andreas Madsen, Sarath Chandar, Siva Reddy","Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks and will even explain their reasoning, so-called self-explanations. However, convincing and wrong self-explanations can lead to unsupported confidence in LLMs, thus increasing risk. Therefore, it's important to measure if self-explanations truly reflect the model's behavior. Such a measure is called interpretability-faithfulness and is challenging to perform since the ground truth is inaccessible, and many LLMs only have an inference API. To address this, we propose employing self-consistency checks to measure faithfulness. For example, if an LLM says a set of words is important for making a prediction, then it should not be able to make its prediction without these words. While self-consistency checks are a common approach to faithfulness, they have not previously been successfully applied to LLM self-explanations for counterfactual, feature attribution, and redaction explanations. Our results demonstrate that faithfulness is explanation, model, and task-dependent, showing self-explanations should not be trusted in general. For example, with sentiment classification, counterfactuals are more faithful for Llama2, feature attribution for Mistral, and redaction for Falcon 40B.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07927v4,2024-01
Word Boundary Information Isn't Useful for Encoder Language Models,"Edward Gow-Smith, Dylan Phelps, Harish Tayyar Madabushi, Carolina Scarton, Aline Villavicencio","All existing transformer-based approaches to NLP using subword tokenisation algorithms encode whitespace (word boundary information) through the use of special space symbols (such as \#\# or \_) forming part of tokens. These symbols have been shown to a) lead to reduced morphological validity of tokenisations, and b) give substantial vocabulary redundancy. As such, removing these symbols has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the processing of morphologically complex words for transformer encoders in the pretrain-finetune paradigm. In this work, we explore whether word boundary information is at all useful to such models. In particular, we train transformer encoders across four different training scales, and investigate several alternative approaches to including word boundary information, evaluating on a range of tasks across different domains and problem set-ups: GLUE (for sentence-level classification), NER (for token-level classification), and two classification datasets involving complex words (Superbizarre and FLOTA). Overall, through an extensive experimental setup that includes the pre-training of 29 models, we find no substantial improvements from our alternative approaches, suggesting that modifying tokenisers to remove word boundary information isn't leading to a loss of useful information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07923v1,2024-01
The Pitfalls of Defining Hallucination,Kees van Deemter,"Despite impressive advances in Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers are still unclear about important aspects of NLG evaluation.

I conclude by highlighting some remaining limitations of all current thinking about hallucination and by discussing implications for LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07897v1,2024-01
Learned Best-Effort LLM Serving,"Siddharth Jha, Coleman Hooper, Xiaoxuan Liu, Sehoon Kim, Kurt Keutzer","Many applications must provide low-latency LLM service to users or risk unacceptable user experience. However, over-provisioning resources to serve fluctuating request patterns is often prohibitively expensive. In this work, we present a best-effort serving system that employs deep reinforcement learning to adjust service quality based on the task distribution and system load. Our best-effort system can maintain availability with over 10x higher client request rates, serves above 96% of peak performance 4.1x more often, and serves above 98% of peak performance 2.3x more often than static serving on unpredictable workloads. Our learned router is robust to shifts in both the arrival and task distribution. Compared to static serving, learned best-effort serving allows for cost-efficient serving through increased hardware utility. Additionally, we argue that learned best-effort LLM serving is applicable in wide variety of settings and provides application developers great flexibility to meet their specific needs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07886v2,2024-01
"The Chronicles of RAG: The Retriever, the Chunk and the Generator","Paulo Finardi, Leonardo Avila, Rodrigo Castaldoni, Pedro Gengo, Celio Larcher, Marcos Piau, Pablo Costa, Vinicius Caridá","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the most popular paradigms for enabling LLMs to access external data, and also as a mechanism for grounding to mitigate against hallucinations. When implementing RAG you can face several challenges like effective integration of retrieval models, efficient representation learning, data diversity, computational efficiency optimization, evaluation, and quality of text generation. Given all these challenges, every day a new technique to improve RAG appears, making it unfeasible to experiment with all combinations for your problem. In this context, this paper presents good practices to implement, optimize, and evaluate RAG for the Brazilian Portuguese language, focusing on the establishment of a simple pipeline for inference and experiments. We explored a diverse set of methods to answer questions about the first Harry Potter book. To generate the answers we used the OpenAI's gpt-4, gpt-4-1106-preview, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, and Google's Gemini Pro. Focusing on the quality of the retriever, our approach achieved an improvement of MRR@10 by 35.4% compared to the baseline. When optimizing the input size in the application, we observed that it is possible to further enhance it by 2.4%. Finally, we present the complete architecture of the RAG with our recommendations. As result, we moved from a baseline of 57.88% to a maximum relative score of 98.61%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07883v1,2024-01
EMBRE: Entity-aware Masking for Biomedical Relation Extraction,"Mingjie Li, Karin Verspoor","Information extraction techniques, including named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE), are crucial in many domains to support making sense of vast amounts of unstructured text data by identifying and connecting relevant information. Such techniques can assist researchers in extracting valuable insights. In this paper, we introduce the Entity-aware Masking for Biomedical Relation Extraction (EMBRE) method for biomedical relation extraction, as applied in the context of the BioRED challenge Task 1, in which human-annotated entities are provided as input. Specifically, we integrate entity knowledge into a deep neural network by pretraining the backbone model with an entity masking objective. We randomly mask named entities for each instance and let the model identify the masked entity along with its type. In this way, the model is capable of learning more specific knowledge and more robust representations. Then, we utilize the pre-trained model as our backbone to encode language representations and feed these representations into two multilayer perceptron (MLPs) to predict the logits for relation and novelty, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can improve the performances of entity pair, relation and novelty extraction over our baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07877v1,2024-01

M Towhidul Islam Tonmoy, S M Mehedi Zaman, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha, Amitava Das","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a notable breakthrough in Natural Language Processing (NLP), contributing to substantial progress in both text comprehension and generation. However, amidst these advancements, it is noteworthy that LLMs often face a limitation in terms of context length extrapolation. Understanding and extending the context length for LLMs is crucial in enhancing their performance across various NLP applications. In this survey paper, we delve into the multifaceted aspects of exploring why it is essential, and the potential transformations that superior techniques could bring to NLP applications. We study the inherent challenges associated with extending context length and present an organized overview of the existing strategies employed by researchers. Additionally, we discuss the intricacies of evaluating context extension techniques and highlight the open challenges that researchers face in this domain. Furthermore, we explore whether there is a consensus within the research community regarding evaluation standards and identify areas where further agreement is needed.

JumpCoder: Go Beyond Autoregressive Coder via Online Modification,"Mouxiang Chen, Hao Tian, Zhongxin Liu, Xiaoxue Ren, Jianling Sun","While existing code large language models (code LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities in code generation, their autoregressive sequential generation inherently lacks reversibility. This limitation hinders them from timely correcting previous missing statements during coding as humans do, often leading to error propagation and suboptimal performance. We introduce JumpCoder, a novel model-agnostic framework that enables human-like online modification and non-sequential generation to augment code LLMs. The key idea behind JumpCoder is to insert new code into the currently generated code when necessary during generation, which is achieved through an auxiliary infilling model that works in tandem with the code LLM. Since identifying the best infill position beforehand is intractable, we adopt an \textit{infill-first, judge-later} strategy, which experiments with filling at the $k$ most critical positions following the generation of each line, and uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser alongside the Generation Model Scoring to effectively judge the validity of each potential infill. Extensive experiments using six state-of-the-art code LLMs across multiple and multilingual benchmarks consistently indicate significant improvements over all baselines. Our code is public at https://github.com/Keytoyze/JumpCoder.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07870v2,2024-01
Consolidating Trees of Robotic Plans Generated Using Large Language Models to Improve Reliability,"Md Sadman Sakib, Yu Sun","The inherent probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs) introduces an element of unpredictability, raising concerns about potential discrepancies in their output. This paper introduces an innovative approach aims to generate correct and optimal robotic task plans for diverse real-world demands and scenarios. LLMs have been used to generate task plans, but they are unreliable and may contain wrong, questionable, or high-cost steps. The proposed approach uses LLM to generate a number of task plans as trees and amalgamates them into a graph by removing questionable paths. Then an optimal task tree can be retrieved to circumvent questionable and high-cost nodes, thereby improving planning accuracy and execution efficiency. The approach is further improved by incorporating a large knowledge network. Leveraging GPT-4 further, the high-level task plan is converted into a low-level Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) plan executable by a robot. Evaluation results highlight the superior accuracy and efficiency of our approach compared to previous methodologies in the field of task planning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07868v1,2024-01
Authorship Obfuscation in Multilingual Machine-Generated Text Detection,"Dominik Macko, Robert Moro, Adaku Uchendu, Ivan Srba, Jason Samuel Lucas, Michiharu Yamashita, Nafis Irtiza Tripto, Dongwon Lee, Jakub Simko, Maria Bielikova","High-quality text generation capability of recent Large Language Models (LLMs) causes concerns about their misuse (e.g., in massive generation/spread of disinformation). Machine-generated text (MGT) detection is important to cope with such threats. However, it is susceptible to authorship obfuscation (AO) methods, such as paraphrasing, which can cause MGTs to evade detection. So far, this was evaluated only in monolingual settings. Thus, the susceptibility of recently proposed multilingual detectors is still unknown. We fill this gap by comprehensively benchmarking the performance of 10 well-known AO methods, attacking 37 MGT detection methods against MGTs in 11 languages (i.e., 10 $\times$ 37 $\times$ 11 = 4,070 combinations). We also evaluate the effect of data augmentation on adversarial robustness using obfuscated texts. The results indicate that all tested AO methods can cause evasion of automated detection in all tested languages, where homoglyph attacks are especially successful. However, some of the AO methods severely damaged the text, making it no longer readable or easily recognizable by humans (e.g., changed language, weird characters).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07867v3,2024-01
Unlocking Efficiency in Large Language Model Inference: A Comprehensive Survey of Speculative Decoding,"Heming Xia, Zhe Yang, Qingxiu Dong, Peiyi Wang, Yongqi Li, Tao Ge, Tianyu Liu, Wenjie Li, Zhifang Sui","To mitigate the high inference latency stemming from autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs), Speculative Decoding has emerged as a novel decoding paradigm for LLM inference. In each decoding step, this method first drafts several future tokens efficiently and then verifies them in parallel. Unlike autoregressive decoding, Speculative Decoding facilitates the simultaneous decoding of multiple tokens per step, thereby accelerating inference. This paper presents a comprehensive overview and analysis of this promising decoding paradigm. We begin by providing a formal definition and formulation of Speculative Decoding. Then, we organize in-depth discussions on its key facets, such as drafter selection and verification strategies.

"Milestones in Bengali Sentiment Analysis leveraging Transformer-models: Fundamentals, Challenges and Future Directions","Saptarshi Sengupta, Shreya Ghosh, Prasenjit Mitra, Tarikul Islam Tamiti","Sentiment Analysis (SA) refers to the task of associating a view polarity (usually, positive, negative, or neutral; or even fine-grained such as slightly angry, sad, etc.) to a given text, essentially breaking it down to a supervised (since we have the view labels apriori) classification task. Although heavily studied in resource-rich languages such as English thus pushing the SOTA by leaps and bounds, owing to the arrival of the Transformer architecture, the same cannot be said for resource-poor languages such as Bengali (BN). For a language spoken by roughly 300 million people, the technology enabling them to run trials on their favored tongue is severely lacking. In this paper, we analyze the SOTA for SA in Bengali, particularly, Transformer-based models. We discuss available datasets, their drawbacks, the nuances associated with Bengali i.e. what makes this a challenging language to apply SA on, and finally provide insights for future direction to mitigate the limitations in the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07847v1,2024-01
Question Translation Training for Better Multilingual Reasoning,"Wenhao Zhu, Shujian Huang, Fei Yuan, Shuaijie She, Jiajun Chen, Alexandra Birch","Large language models show compelling performance on reasoning tasks but they tend to perform much worse in languages other than English. This is unsurprising given that their training data largely consists of English text and instructions. A typical solution is to translate instruction data into all languages of interest, and then train on the resulting multilingual data, which is called translate-training. This approach not only incurs high cost, but also results in poorly translated data due to the non-standard formatting of mathematical chain-of-thought. In this paper, we explore the benefits of question alignment, where we train the model to translate reasoning questions into English by finetuning on X-English parallel question data. In this way we perform targeted, in-domain language alignment which makes best use of English instruction data to unlock the LLMs' multilingual reasoning abilities. Experimental results on LLaMA2-13B show that question alignment leads to consistent improvements over the translate-training approach: an average improvement of 11.3% and 16.1% accuracy across ten languages on the MGSM and MSVAMP multilingual reasoning benchmarks.

Wikidata as a seed for Web Extraction,"Kunpeng Guo, Dennis Diefenbach, Antoine Gourru, Christophe Gravier","Wikidata has grown to a knowledge graph with an impressive size. To date, it contains more than 17 billion triples collecting information about people, places, films, stars, publications, proteins, and many more. On the other side, most of the information on the Web is not published in highly structured data repositories like Wikidata, but rather as unstructured and semi-structured content, more concretely in HTML pages containing text and tables. Finding, monitoring, and organizing this data in a knowledge graph is requiring considerable work from human editors. The volume and complexity of the data make this task difficult and time-consuming. In this work, we present a framework that is able to identify and extract new facts that are published under multiple Web domains so that they can be proposed for validation by Wikidata editors. The framework is relying on question-answering technologies. We take inspiration from ideas that are used to extract facts from textual collections and adapt them to extract facts from Web pages. For achieving this, we demonstrate that language models can be adapted to extract facts not only from textual collections but also from Web pages. By exploiting the information already contained in Wikidata the proposed framework can be trained without the need for any additional learning signals and can extract new facts for a wide range of properties and domains. Following this path, Wikidata can be used as a seed to extract facts on the Web. Our experiments show that we can achieve a mean performance of 84.07 at F1-score. Moreover, our estimations show that we can potentially extract millions of facts that can be proposed for human validation. The goal is to help editors in their daily tasks and contribute to the completion of the Wikidata knowledge graph.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07812v1,2024-01
Consolidating Strategies for Countering Hate Speech Using Persuasive Dialogues,"Sougata Saha, Rohini Srihari","Hateful comments are prevalent on social media platforms. Although tools for automatically detecting, flagging, and blocking such false, offensive, and harmful content online have lately matured, such reactive and brute force methods alone provide short-term and superficial remedies while the perpetrators persist. With the public availability of large language models which can generate articulate synthetic and engaging content at scale, there are concerns about the rapid growth of dissemination of such malicious content on the web. There is now a need to focus on deeper, long-term solutions that involve engaging with the human perpetrator behind the source of the content to change their viewpoint or at least bring down the rhetoric using persuasive means. To do that, we propose defining and experimenting with controllable strategies for generating counter-arguments to hateful comments in online conversations. We experiment with controlling response generation using features based on (i) argument structure and reasoning-based Walton argument schemes, (ii) counter-argument speech acts, and (iii) human characteristics-based qualities such as Big-5 personality traits and human values. Using automatic and human evaluations, we determine the best combination of features that generate fluent, argumentative, and logically sound arguments for countering hate. We further share the developed computational models for automatically annotating text with such features, and a silver-standard annotated version of an existing hate speech dialog corpora.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07810v1,2024-01
Flexibly Scaling Large Language Models Contexts Through Extensible Tokenization,"Ninglu Shao, Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) are in need of sufficient contexts to handle many critical applications, such as retrieval augmented generation and few-shot learning. However, due to the constrained window size, the LLMs can only access to the information within a limited context. Although the size of context window can be extended by fine-tuning, it will result in a substantial cost in both training and inference stage. In this paper, we present Extensible Tokenization as an alternative method which realizes the flexible scaling of LLMs' context. Extensible Tokenization stands as a midware in between of the tokenized context and the LLM, which transforms the raw token embeddings into the extensible embeddings. Such embeddings provide a more compact representation for the long context, on top of which the LLM is able to perceive more information with the same context window. Extensible Tokenization is also featured by its flexibility: the scaling factor can be flexibly determined within a feasible scope, leading to the extension of an arbitrary context length at the inference time. Besides, Extensible Tokenization is introduced as a drop-in component, which can be seamlessly plugged into not only the LLM itself and but also its fine-tuned derivatives, bringing in the extended contextual information while fully preserving the LLM's existing capabilities. We perform comprehensive experiments on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks, which verify Extensible Tokenization as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend LLM's context. Our model and source code will be made publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07793v1,2024-01
Quantum Transfer Learning for Acceptability Judgements,"Giuseppe Buonaiuto, Raffaele Guarasci, Aniello Minutolo, Giuseppe De Pietro, Massimo Esposito","Hybrid quantum-classical classifiers promise to positively impact critical aspects of natural language processing tasks, particularly classification-related ones. Among the possibilities currently investigated, quantum transfer learning, i.e., using a quantum circuit for fine-tuning pre-trained classical models for a specific task, is attracting significant attention as a potential platform for proving quantum advantage.   This work shows potential advantages, both in terms of performance and expressiveness, of quantum transfer learning algorithms trained on embedding vectors extracted from a large language model to perform classification on a classical Linguistics task: acceptability judgments. Acceptability judgment is the ability to determine whether a sentence is considered natural and well-formed by a native speaker. The approach has been tested on sentences extracted from ItaCoLa, a corpus that collects Italian sentences labeled with their acceptability judgment. The evaluation phase shows results for the quantum transfer learning pipeline comparable to state-of-the-art classical transfer learning algorithms, proving current quantum computers' capabilities to tackle NLP tasks for ready-to-use applications. Furthermore, a qualitative linguistic analysis, aided by explainable AI methods, reveals the capabilities of quantum transfer learning algorithms to correctly classify complex and more structured sentences, compared to their classical counterpart. This finding sets the ground for a quantifiable quantum advantage in NLP in the near future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07777v1,2024-01
The Effect of Human v/s Synthetic Test Data and Round-tripping on Assessment of Sentiment Analysis Systems for Bias,"Kausik Lakkaraju, Aniket Gupta, Biplav Srivastava, Marco Valtorta, Dezhi Wu","Sentiment Analysis Systems (SASs) are data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that output polarity and emotional intensity when given a piece of text as input. Like other AIs, SASs are also known to have unstable behavior when subjected to changes in data which can make it problematic to trust out of concerns like bias when AI works with humans and data has protected attributes like gender, race, and age. Recently, an approach was introduced to assess SASs in a blackbox setting without training data or code, and rating them for bias using synthetic English data. We augment it by introducing two human-generated chatbot datasets and also consider a round-trip setting of translating the data from one language to the same through an intermediate language. We find that these settings show SASs performance in a more realistic light. Specifically, we find that rating SASs on the chatbot data showed more bias compared to the synthetic data, and round-tripping using Spanish and Danish as intermediate languages reduces the bias (up to 68% reduction) in human-generated data while, in synthetic data, it takes a surprising turn by increasing the bias! Our findings will help researchers and practitioners refine their SAS testing strategies and foster trust as SASs are considered part of more mission-critical applications for global use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12985v1,2024-01
On the importance of Data Scale in Pretraining Arabic Language Models,"Abbas Ghaddar, Philippe Langlais, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Boxing Chen","Pretraining monolingual language models have been proven to be vital for performance in Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

More precisely, we reassess the performance of a suite of state-of-the-art Arabic PLMs by retraining them on massive-scale, high-quality Arabic corpora. We have significantly improved the performance of the leading Arabic encoder-only BERT-base and encoder-decoder T5-base models on the ALUE and ORCA leaderboards, thereby reporting state-of-the-art results in their respective model categories.

Prompting open-source and commercial language models for grammatical error correction of English learner text,"Christopher Davis, Andrew Caines, Øistein Andersen, Shiva Taslimipoor, Helen Yannakoudakis, Zheng Yuan, Christopher Bryant, Marek Rei, Paula Buttery","Thanks to recent advances in generative AI, we are able to prompt large language models (LLMs) to produce texts which are fluent and grammatical. In addition, it has been shown that we can elicit attempts at grammatical error correction (GEC) from LLMs when prompted with ungrammatical input sentences. We evaluate how well LLMs can perform at GEC by measuring their performance on established benchmark datasets. We go beyond previous studies, which only examined GPT* models on a selection of English GEC datasets, by evaluating seven open-source and three commercial LLMs on four established GEC benchmarks. We investigate model performance and report results against individual error types. Our results indicate that LLMs do not always outperform supervised English GEC models except in specific contexts -- namely commercial LLMs on benchmarks annotated with fluency corrections as opposed to minimal edits. We find that several open-source models outperform commercial ones on minimal edit benchmarks, and that in some settings zero-shot prompting is just as competitive as few-shot prompting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07702v1,2024-01

MAPLE: Multilingual Evaluation of Parameter Efficient Finetuning of Large Language Models,"Divyanshu Aggarwal, Ashutosh Sathe, Ishaan Watts, Sunayana Sitaram","Parameter Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) has emerged as a viable solution for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without requiring massive resources and compute. Prior work on multilingual evaluation has shown that there is a large gap between the performance of LLMs on English and other languages. Further, there is also a large gap between the performance of smaller open-source models and larger LLMs. Finetuning can be an effective way to bridge this gap and make language models more equitable. In this work, we finetune the LLama-2-7B and Mistral-7B models on two synthetic multilingual instruction tuning datasets to determine its effect on model performance on six downstream tasks covering forty languages in all. Additionally, we experiment with various parameters, such as rank for low-rank adaptation and values of quantisation to determine their effects on downstream performance and find that higher rank and higher quantisation values benefit low-resource languages. We find that PEFT of smaller open-source models sometimes bridges the gap between the performance of these models and the larger ones, however, English performance can take a hit. We also find that finetuning sometimes improves performance on low-resource languages, while degrading performance on high-resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07598v3,2024-01
Cascaded Cross-Modal Transformer for Audio-Textual Classification,"Nicolae-Catalin Ristea, Andrei Anghel, Radu Tudor Ionescu","Speech classification tasks often require powerful language understanding models to grasp useful features, which becomes problematic when limited training data is available. To attain superior classification performance, we propose to harness the inherent value of multimodal representations by transcribing speech using automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and translating the transcripts into different languages via pretrained translation models. We thus obtain an audio-textual (multimodal) representation for each data sample. Subsequently, we combine language-specific Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with Wav2Vec2.0 audio features via a novel cascaded cross-modal transformer (CCMT). Our model is based on two cascaded transformer blocks. The first one combines text-specific features from distinct languages, while the second one combines acoustic features with multilingual features previously learned by the first transformer block. We employed our system in the Requests Sub-Challenge of the ACM Multimedia 2023 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge. CCMT was declared the winning solution, obtaining an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 65.41% and 85.87% for complaint and request detection, respectively.

We adapt the application of GPT-4V to process complex 3D data, enabling it to achieve zero-shot recognition capabilities without altering the underlying model architecture. Our methodology also includes a systematic strategy for point cloud image visualization, mitigating domain gap and enhancing GPT-4V's efficiency.

Safe Reinforcement Learning with Free-form Natural Language Constraints and Pre-Trained Language Models,"Xingzhou Lou, Junge Zhang, Ziyan Wang, Kaiqi Huang, Yali Du","Safe reinforcement learning (RL) agents accomplish given tasks while adhering to specific constraints. Employing constraints expressed via easily-understandable human language offers considerable potential for real-world applications due to its accessibility and non-reliance on domain expertise. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically adopt a recurrent neural network, which leads to limited capabilities when dealing with various forms of human language input. Furthermore, these methods often require a ground-truth cost function, necessitating domain expertise for the conversion of language constraints into a well-defined cost function that determines constraint violation. To address these issues, we proposes to use pre-trained language models (LM) to facilitate RL agents' comprehension of natural language constraints and allow them to infer costs for safe policy learning. Through the use of pre-trained LMs and the elimination of the need for a ground-truth cost, our method enhances safe policy learning under a diverse set of human-derived free-form natural language constraints. Experiments on grid-world navigation and robot control show that the proposed method can achieve strong performance while adhering to given constraints. The usage of pre-trained LMs allows our method to comprehend complicated constraints and learn safe policies without the need for ground-truth cost at any stage of training or evaluation. Extensive ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of each part of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07553v3,2024-01
See the Unseen: Better Context-Consistent Knowledge-Editing by Noises,"Youcheng Huang, Wenqiang Lei, Zheng Zhang, Jiancheng Lv, Shuicheng Yan","Knowledge-editing updates knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and contributes to the interpretability and application of LLMs. However, knowledge applying is context-consistent: LLMs can recall the same knowledge in different contexts. Existing works ignore this property and the editing lacks generalization. In this paper, we empirically find that the effects of different contexts upon LLMs in recalling the same knowledge follow a Gaussian-like distribution. We then sample Gaussian noises to simulate the effects of different contexts when updating LLMs. By such, we can make LLMs see the unseen contexts where the edited knowledge will be applied, therefore improving the editing generalization. Experimental results on three LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and also distinguish our methods from the others of fine-tuning LLMs by noises.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07544v2,2024-01
MM-SAP: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Assessing Self-Awareness of Multimodal Large Language Models in Perception,"Yuhao Wang, Yusheng Liao, Heyang Liu, Hongcheng Liu, Yu Wang, Yanfeng Wang","Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in visual perception and understanding. However, these models also suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability as AI systems. We believe that these hallucinations are partially due to the models' struggle with understanding what they can and cannot perceive from images, a capability we refer to as self-awareness in perception. Despite its importance, this aspect of MLLMs has been overlooked in prior studies. In this paper, we aim to define and evaluate the self-awareness of MLLMs in perception. To do this, we first introduce the knowledge quadrant in perception, which helps define what MLLMs know and do not know about images. Using this framework, we propose a novel benchmark, the Self-Awareness in Perception for MLLMs (MM-SAP), specifically designed to assess this capability. We apply MM-SAP to a variety of popular MLLMs, offering a comprehensive analysis of their self-awareness and providing detailed insights. The experiment results reveal that current MLLMs possess limited self-awareness capabilities, pointing to a crucial area for future advancement in the development of trustworthy MLLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/YHWmz/MM-SAP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07529v3,2024-01
Editing Arbitrary Propositions in LLMs without Subject Labels,"Itai Feigenbaum, Devansh Arpit, Huan Wang, Shelby Heinecke, Juan Carlos Niebles, Weiran Yao, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese","Large Language Model (LLM) editing modifies factual information in LLMs. Locate-and-Edit (L\&E) methods accomplish this by finding where relevant information is stored within the neural network, and editing the weights at that location. The goal of editing is to modify the response of an LLM to a proposition independently of its phrasing, while not modifying its response to other related propositions. Existing methods are limited to binary propositions, which represent straightforward binary relations between a subject and an object. Furthermore, existing methods rely on semantic subject labels, which may not be available or even be well-defined in practice. In this paper, we show that both of these issues can be effectively skirted with a simple and fast localization method called Gradient Tracing (GT). This localization method allows editing arbitrary propositions instead of just binary ones, and does so without the need for subject labels. As propositions always have a truth value, our experiments prompt an LLM as a boolean classifier, and edit its T/F response to propositions. Our method applies GT for location tracing, and then edit the model at that location using a mild variant of Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). On datasets of binary propositions derived from the CounterFact dataset, we show that our method -- without access to subject labels -- performs close to state-of-the-art L\&E methods which has access subject labels. We then introduce a new dataset, Factual Accuracy Classification Test (FACT), which includes non-binary propositions and for which subject labels are not generally applicable, and therefore is beyond the scope of existing L\&E methods. Nevertheless, we show that with our method editing is possible on FACT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07526v1,2024-01
TAROT: A Hierarchical Framework with Multitask Co-Pretraining on Semi-Structured Data towards Effective Person-Job Fit,"Yihan Cao, Xu Chen, Lun Du, Hao Chen, Qiang Fu, Shi Han, Yushu Du, Yanbin Kang, Guangming Lu, Zi Li","Person-job fit is an essential part of online recruitment platforms in serving various downstream applications like Job Search and Candidate Recommendation. Recently, pretrained large language models have further enhanced the effectiveness by leveraging richer textual information in user profiles and job descriptions apart from user behavior features and job metadata. However, the general domain-oriented design struggles to capture the unique structural information within user profiles and job descriptions, leading to a loss of latent semantic correlations. We propose TAROT, a hierarchical multitask co-pretraining framework, to better utilize structural and semantic information for informative text embeddings. TAROT targets semi-structured text in profiles and jobs, and it is co-pretained with multi-grained pretraining tasks to constrain the acquired semantic information at each level. Experiments on a real-world LinkedIn dataset show significant performance improvements, proving its effectiveness in person-job fit tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07525v2,2024-01

Developing ChatGPT for Biology and Medicine: A Complete Review of Biomedical Question Answering,"Qing Li, Lei Li, Yu Li","ChatGPT explores a strategic blueprint of question answering (QA) in delivering medical diagnosis, treatment recommendations, and other healthcare support. This is achieved through the increasing incorporation of medical domain data via natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal paradigms. By transitioning the distribution of text, images, videos, and other modalities from the general domain to the medical domain, these techniques have expedited the progress of medical domain question answering (MDQA). They bridge the gap between human natural language and sophisticated medical domain knowledge or expert manual annotations, handling large-scale, diverse, unbalanced, or even unlabeled data analysis scenarios in medical contexts. Central to our focus is the utilizing of language models and multimodal paradigms for medical question answering, aiming to guide the research community in selecting appropriate mechanisms for their specific medical research requirements. Specialized tasks such as unimodal-related question answering, reading comprehension, reasoning, diagnosis, relation extraction, probability modeling, and others, as well as multimodal-related tasks like vision question answering, image caption, cross-modal retrieval, report summarization, and generation, are discussed in detail. Each section delves into the intricate specifics of the respective method under consideration.

GWPT: A Green Word-Embedding-based POS Tagger,"Chengwei Wei, Runqi Pang, C. -C. Jay Kuo","As a fundamental tool for natural language processing (NLP), the part-of-speech (POS) tagger assigns the POS label to each word in a sentence. A novel lightweight POS tagger based on word embeddings is proposed and named GWPT (green word-embedding-based POS tagger) in this work. Following the green learning (GL) methodology, GWPT contains three modules in cascade: 1) representation learning, 2) feature learning, and 3) decision learning modules. The main novelty of GWPT lies in representation learning. It uses non-contextual or contextual word embeddings, partitions embedding dimension indices into low-, medium-, and high-frequency sets, and represents them with different N-grams. It is shown by experimental results that GWPT offers state-of-the-art accuracies with fewer model parameters and significantly lower computational complexity in both training and inference as compared with deep-learning-based methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07475v1,2024-01

Only Send What You Need: Learning to Communicate Efficiently in Federated Multilingual Machine Translation,"Yun-Wei Chu, Dong-Jun Han, Christopher G. Brinton","Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for solving multilingual tasks, potentially enabling clients with their own language-specific data to collaboratively construct a high-quality neural machine translation (NMT) model. However, communication constraints in practical network systems present challenges for exchanging large-scale NMT engines between FL parties. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning-based adaptive parameter selection methodology, MetaSend, that improves the communication efficiency of model transmissions from clients during FL-based multilingual NMT training. Our approach learns a dynamic threshold for filtering parameters prior to transmission without compromising the NMT model quality, based on the tensor deviations of clients between different FL rounds. Through experiments on two NMT datasets with different language distributions, we demonstrate that MetaSend obtains substantial improvements over baselines in translation quality in the presence of a limited communication budget.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07456v1,2024-01
Model Editing at Scale leads to Gradual and Catastrophic Forgetting,"Akshat Gupta, Anurag Rao, Gopala Anumanchipalli","Editing knowledge in large language models is an attractive capability to have which allows us to correct incorrectly learnt facts during pre-training, as well as update the model with an ever-growing list of new facts. While existing model editing techniques have shown promise, they are usually evaluated using metrics for reliability, specificity and generalization over one or few edits. We argue that for model editing to have practical utility, we must be able to make multiple edits to the same model. With this in mind, we evaluate the current model editing methods at scale, focusing on two state of the art methods: ROME and MEMIT. We find that as the model is edited sequentially with multiple facts, it continually forgets previously edited facts and the ability to perform downstream tasks. This forgetting happens in two phases -- an initial gradual but progressive forgetting phase followed by abrupt or catastrophic forgetting phase. Both gradual and catastrophic forgetting limit the usefulness of model editing methods at scale -- the former making model editing less effective as multiple edits are made to the model while the latter caps the scalability of such model editing methods. Our analysis also highlights other key limitations of ROME and MEMIT at scale. With our work, we push for the development and evaluation of model editing methods keeping scalability in mind.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07453v4,2024-01
Taec: a Manually annotated text dataset for trait and phenotype extraction and entity linking in wheat breeding literature,"Claire Nédellec, Clara Sauvion, Robert Bossy, Mariya Borovikova, Louise Deléger","Wheat varieties show a large diversity of traits and phenotypes. Linking them to genetic variability is essential for shorter and more efficient wheat breeding programs. Newly desirable wheat variety traits include disease resistance to reduce pesticide use, adaptation to climate change, resistance to heat and drought stresses, or low gluten content of grains. Wheat breeding experiments are documented by a large body of scientific literature and observational data obtained in-field and under controlled conditions. The cross-referencing of complementary information from the literature and observational data is essential to the study of the genotype-phenotype relationship and to the improvement of wheat selection. The scientific literature on genetic marker-assisted selection describes much information about the genotype-phenotype relationship. However, the variety of expressions used to refer to traits and phenotype values in scientific articles is a hinder to finding information and cross-referencing it. When trained adequately by annotated examples, recent text mining methods perform highly in named entity recognition and linking in the scientific domain. While several corpora contain annotations of human and animal phenotypes, currently, no corpus is available for training and evaluating named entity recognition and entity-linking methods in plant phenotype literature. The Triticum aestivum trait Corpus is a new gold standard for traits and phenotypes of wheat. It consists of 540 PubMed references fully annotated for trait, phenotype, and species named entities using the Wheat Trait and Phenotype Ontology and the species taxonomy of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. A study of the performance of tools trained on the Triticum aestivum trait Corpus shows that the corpus is suitable for the training and evaluation of named entity recognition and linking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07447v1,2024-01

However, the specific emotion of guilt has received limited attention in this field. In this research, we explore the applicability of three transformer-based language models for detecting guilt in text and compare their performance for general emotion detection and guilt detection. Our proposed model outformed BERT and RoBERTa models by two and one points respectively.

Beyond Sparse Rewards: Enhancing Reinforcement Learning with Language Model Critique in Text Generation,"Meng Cao, Lei Shu, Lei Yu, Yun Zhu, Nevan Wichers, Yinxiao Liu, Lei Meng","Reinforcement learning (RL) can align language models with non-differentiable reward signals, such as human preferences. However, a major challenge arises from the sparsity of these reward signals - typically, there is only a single reward for an entire output. This sparsity of rewards can lead to inefficient and unstable learning. To address this challenge, our paper introduces an novel framework that utilizes the critique capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce intermediate-step rewards during RL training. Our method involves coupling a policy model with a critic language model, which is responsible for providing comprehensive feedback of each part of the output. This feedback is then translated into token or span-level rewards that can be used to guide the RL training process. We investigate this approach under two different settings: one where the policy model is smaller and is paired with a more powerful critic model, and another where a single language model fulfills both roles. We assess our approach on three text generation tasks: sentiment control, language model detoxification, and summarization. Experimental results show that incorporating artificial intrinsic rewards significantly improve both sample efficiency and the overall performance of the policy model, supported by both automatic and human evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07382v2,2024-01
Active Learning for NLP with Large Language Models,Xuesong Wang,"Human annotation of training samples is expensive, laborious, and sometimes challenging, especially for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. To reduce the labeling cost and enhance the sample efficiency, Active Learning (AL) technique can be used to label as few samples as possible to reach a reasonable or similar results. To reduce even more costs and with the significant advances of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLMs can be a good candidate to annotate samples. This work investigates the accuracy and cost of using LLMs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) to label samples on 3 different datasets. A consistency-based strategy is proposed to select samples that are potentially incorrectly labeled so that human annotations can be used for those samples in AL settings, and we call it mixed annotation strategy. Then we test performance of AL under two different settings: (1) using human annotations only; (2) using the proposed mixed annotation strategy. The accuracy of AL models under 3 AL query strategies are reported on 3 text classification datasets, i.e., AG's News, TREC-6, and Rotten Tomatoes. On AG's News and Rotten Tomatoes, the models trained with the mixed annotation strategy achieves similar or better results compared to that with human annotations. The method reveals great potentials of LLMs as annotators in terms of accuracy and cost efficiency in active learning settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07367v1,2024-01
PersonalityChat: Conversation Distillation for Personalized Dialog Modeling with Facts and Traits,"Ehsan Lotfi, Maxime De Bruyn, Jeska Buhmann, Walter Daelemans","The new wave of Large Language Models (LLM) has offered an efficient tool to curate sizeable conversational datasets. So far studies have mainly focused on task-oriented or generic open-domain dialogs, and have not fully explored the ability of LLMs in following complicated prompts. In this work, we focus on personalization, and employ LLMs to curate a dataset which is difficult and costly to crowd-source: PersonalityChat is a synthetic conversational dataset based upon the popular PersonaChat dataset, but conditioned on both personas and (Big-5) personality traits. Evaluating models fine-tuned on this dataset, we show that the personality trait labels can be used for trait-based personalization of generative dialogue models. We also perform a head-to-head comparison between PersonalityChat and PersonaChat, and show that training on the distilled dataset results in more fluent and coherent dialog agents in the small-model regime.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07363v1,2024-01

In this article, we explore the extent to which we can make comparisons between the Shakespeare and Company and Goodreads communities. By quantifying similarities and differences, we can identify patterns in how works have risen or fallen in popularity across these datasets. We can also measure differences in how works are received by measuring similarities and differences in co-reading patterns.

ELLA-V: Stable Neural Codec Language Modeling with Alignment-guided Sequence Reordering,"Yakun Song, Zhuo Chen, Xiaofei Wang, Ziyang Ma, Xie Chen","The language model (LM) approach based on acoustic and linguistic prompts, such as VALL-E, has achieved remarkable progress in the field of zero-shot audio generation. However, existing methods still have some limitations: 1) repetitions, transpositions, and omissions in the output synthesized speech due to limited alignment constraints between audio and phoneme tokens; 2) challenges of fine-grained control over the synthesized speech with autoregressive (AR) language model; 3) infinite silence generation due to the nature of AR-based decoding, especially under the greedy strategy. To alleviate these issues, we propose ELLA-V, a simple but efficient LM-based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) framework, which enables fine-grained control over synthesized audio at the phoneme level. The key to ELLA-V is interleaving sequences of acoustic and phoneme tokens, where phoneme tokens appear ahead of the corresponding acoustic tokens. The experimental findings reveal that our model outperforms VALL-E in terms of accuracy and delivers more stable results using both greedy and sampling-based decoding strategies. The code of ELLA-V will be open-sourced after cleanups. Audio samples are available at https://ereboas.github.io/ELLAV/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07333v1,2024-01
Small LLMs Are Weak Tool Learners: A Multi-LLM Agent,"Weizhou Shen, Chenliang Li, Hongzhan Chen, Ming Yan, Xiaojun Quan, Hehong Chen, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang","Large Language Model (LLM) agents significantly extend the capabilities of standalone LLMs, empowering them to interact with external tools (e.g., APIs, functions) and complete various tasks in a self-directed fashion. The challenge of tool use demands that LLMs not only understand user queries and generate answers accurately but also excel in task planning, tool invocation, and result summarization. While traditional works focus on training a single LLM with all these capabilities, performance limitations become apparent, particularly with smaller models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that decomposes the aforementioned capabilities into a planner, caller, and summarizer. Each component is implemented by a single LLM that focuses on a specific capability and collaborates with others to accomplish the task. This modular framework facilitates individual updates and the potential use of smaller LLMs for building each capability. To effectively train this framework, we introduce a two-stage training paradigm. First, we fine-tune a backbone LLM on the entire dataset without discriminating sub-tasks, providing the model with a comprehensive understanding of the task. Second, the fine-tuned LLM is used to instantiate the planner, caller, and summarizer respectively, which are continually fine-tuned on respective sub-tasks. Evaluation across various tool-use benchmarks illustrates that our proposed multi-LLM framework surpasses the traditional single-LLM approach, highlighting its efficacy and advantages in tool learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07324v3,2024-01

Shirajus Salekin Shafi, Tasin Ahmmad, Sifat Ahmed, Khan Md Hasib, Faisal Muhammad Shah","In an era where the silent struggle of underdiagnosed depression pervades globally, our research delves into the crucial link between mental health and social media. This work focuses on early detection of depression, particularly in extroverted social media users, using LLMs such as GPT 3.5, GPT 4 and our proposed GPT 3.5 fine-tuned model DepGPT, as well as advanced Deep learning models(LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, BiGRU) and Transformer models(BERT, BanglaBERT, SahajBERT, BanglaBERT-Base). The study categorized Reddit and X datasets into ""Depressive"" and ""Non-Depressive"" segments, translated into Bengali by native speakers with expertise in mental health, resulting in the creation of the Bengali Social Media Depressive Dataset (BSMDD).

Small Language Model Can Self-correct,"Haixia Han, Jiaqing Liang, Jie Shi, Qianyu He, Yanghua Xiao","Generative Language Models (LMs) such as ChatGPT have exhibited remarkable performance across various downstream tasks. Nevertheless, one of their most prominent drawbacks is generating inaccurate or false information with a confident tone. Previous studies have devised sophisticated pipelines and prompts to induce large LMs to exhibit the capability for self-correction. However, large LMs are explicitly prompted to verify and modify its answers separately rather than completing all steps spontaneously like humans. Moreover, these complex prompts are extremely challenging for small LMs to follow. In this paper, we introduce the \underline{I}ntrinsic \underline{S}elf-\underline{C}orrection (ISC) in generative language models, aiming to correct the initial output of LMs in a self-triggered manner, even for those small LMs with 6 billion parameters. Specifically, we devise a pipeline for constructing self-correction data and propose Partial Answer Masking (PAM), aiming to endow the model with the capability for intrinsic self-correction through fine-tuning. We conduct experiments using LMs with parameters sizes ranging from 6 billion to 13 billion in two tasks, including commonsense reasoning and factual knowledge reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that the outputs generated using ISC outperform those generated without self-correction. We believe that the output quality of even small LMs can be further improved by empowering them with the ability to intrinsic self-correct.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07301v2,2024-01
CANDLE: Iterative Conceptualization and Instantiation Distillation from Large Language Models for Commonsense Reasoning,"Weiqi Wang, Tianqing Fang, Chunyang Li, Haochen Shi, Wenxuan Ding, Baixuan Xu, Zhaowei Wang, Jiaxin Bai, Xin Liu, Jiayang Cheng, Chunkit Chan, Yangqiu Song","The sequential process of conceptualization and instantiation is essential to generalizable commonsense reasoning as it allows the application of existing knowledge to unfamiliar scenarios. However, existing works tend to undervalue the step of instantiation and heavily rely on pre-built concept taxonomies and human annotations to collect both types of knowledge, resulting in a lack of instantiated knowledge to complete reasoning, high cost, and limited scalability. To tackle these challenges, we introduce CANDLE, a distillation framework that iteratively performs contextualized conceptualization and instantiation over commonsense knowledge bases by instructing large language models to generate both types of knowledge with critic filtering. By applying CANDLE to ATOMIC, we construct a comprehensive knowledge base comprising six million conceptualizations and instantiated commonsense knowledge triples. Both types of knowledge are firmly rooted in the original ATOMIC dataset, and intrinsic evaluations demonstrate their exceptional quality and diversity. Empirical results indicate that distilling CANDLE on student models provides benefits across four downstream tasks.

Improving Domain Adaptation through Extended-Text Reading Comprehension,"Ting Jiang, Shaohan Huang, Shengyue Luo, Zihan Zhang, Haizhen Huang, Furu Wei, Weiwei Deng, Feng Sun, Qi Zhang, Deqing Wang, Fuzhen Zhuang","To enhance the domain-specific capabilities of large language models, continued pre-training on a domain-specific corpus is a prevalent method. Recent work demonstrates that adapting models using reading comprehension data formatted by regex-based patterns can significantly improve performance on domain-specific tasks. However, regex-based patterns are incapable of parsing raw corpora using domain-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the question and answer pairs are extracted directly from the corpus in predefined formats offers limited context. To address this limitation, we improve reading comprehension via LLM and clustering. LLM focuses on leveraging domain knowledge within the corpus to refine comprehension stage, while clustering supplies relevant knowledge by extending the context to enrich reading stage.

Distilling Event Sequence Knowledge From Large Language Models,"Somin Wadhwa, Oktie Hassanzadeh, Debarun Bhattacharjya, Ken Barker, Jian Ni","Event sequence models have been found to be highly effective in the analysis and prediction of events. Building such models requires availability of abundant high-quality event sequence data. In certain applications, however, clean structured event sequences are not available, and automated sequence extraction results in data that is too noisy and incomplete. In this work, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate event sequences that can effectively be used for probabilistic event model construction. This can be viewed as a mechanism of distilling event sequence knowledge from LLMs. Our approach relies on a Knowledge Graph (KG) of event concepts with partial causal relations to guide the generative language model for causal event sequence generation. We show that our approach can generate high-quality event sequences, filling a knowledge gap in the input KG. Furthermore, we explore how the generated sequences can be leveraged to discover useful and more complex structured knowledge from pattern mining and probabilistic event models. We release our sequence generation code and evaluation framework, as well as corpus of event sequence data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07237v3,2024-01
Inroads to a Structured Data Natural Language Bijection and the role of LLM annotation,Blake Vente,"This work finds limited evidence supporting the theory that using multiple tasks with sequence-to-sequence transformer language models can improve performance on some metrics. In particular, the multi-task generalist t5-small outperforms the specialist t5-small with a $F_1$ of $0.771$ up from $0.692$, which may point to underlying cross-task knowledge generalization. This further suggests that even with the same network, ""re-using"" the same data in a different way may lead to higher performance in some metrics. However, the inverse task alone is likely only an optimization strategy, since it does not yield a significant general improvement at the model sizes explored in this work. Also, adding $\approx 4500$ LLM annotated records (interlaced with the $12800$ WebNLG training records) does not substantially change automatic metric performance compared to the same t5-small model without the synthetic data. This may be due to a learning capacity bottleneck on account of model size, and decreases observed may be due to distributional differences in the corpora. Future research using larger models or human evaluation is required to more fully explain the mechanisms contributing to performance on these tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07190v1,2024-01

Three LLMs, including ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), ChatGPT (GPT-4), and Claude (Claude-2.1), were subjected to evaluation against engineering faculties and students with or without mechanical engineering background. The findings reveal GPT-4's superior performance over the other two LLMs and human cohorts in answering questions across various mechanics topics, except for Continuum Mechanics. This signals the potential future improvements for GPT models in handling symbolic calculations and tensor analyses. The performances of LLMs were all significantly improved with explanations prompted prior to direct responses, underscoring the crucial role of prompt engineering. Interestingly, GPT-3.5 demonstrates improved performance with prompts covering a broader domain, while GPT-4 excels with prompts focusing on specific subjects. Finally, GPT-4 exhibits notable advancements in mitigating input bias, as evidenced by guessing preferences for humans. This study unveils the substantial potential of LLMs as highly knowledgeable assistants in both mechanical pedagogy and scientific research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12983v1,2024-01
Tracing the Genealogies of Ideas with Large Language Model Embeddings,Lucian Li,"In this paper, I present a novel method to detect intellectual influence across a large corpus. Taking advantage of the unique affordances of large language models in encoding semantic and structural meaning while remaining robust to paraphrasing, we can search for substantively similar ideas and hints of intellectual influence in a computationally efficient manner. Such a method allows us to operationalize different levels of confidence: we can allow for direct quotation, paraphrase, or speculative similarity while remaining open about the limitations of each threshold. I apply an ensemble method combining General Text Embeddings, a state-of-the-art sentence embedding method optimized to capture semantic content and an Abstract Meaning Representation graph representation designed to capture structural similarities in argumentation style and the use of metaphor. I apply this method to vectorize sentences from a corpus of roughly 400,000 nonfiction books and academic publications from the 19th century for instances of ideas and arguments appearing in Darwin's publications. This functions as an initial evaluation and proof of concept; the method is not limited to detecting Darwinian ideas but is capable of detecting similarities on a large scale in a wide range of corpora and contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01661v1,2024-01
EHRAgent: Code Empowers Large Language Models for Few-shot Complex Tabular Reasoning on Electronic Health Records,"Wenqi Shi, Ran Xu, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Jieyu Zhang, Hang Wu, Yuanda Zhu, Joyce Ho, Carl Yang, May D. Wang","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in planning and tool utilization as autonomous agents, but few have been developed for medical problem-solving. We propose EHRAgent, an LLM agent empowered with a code interface, to autonomously generate and execute code for multi-tabular reasoning within electronic health records (EHRs). First, we formulate an EHR question-answering task into a tool-use planning process, efficiently decomposing a complicated task into a sequence of manageable actions. By integrating interactive coding and execution feedback, EHRAgent learns from error messages and improves the originally generated code through iterations. Furthermore, we enhance the LLM agent by incorporating long-term memory, which allows EHRAgent to effectively select and build upon the most relevant successful cases from past experiences. Experiments on three real-world multi-tabular EHR datasets show that EHRAgent outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 29.6% in success rate. EHRAgent leverages the emerging few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs, enabling autonomous code generation and execution to tackle complex clinical tasks with minimal demonstrations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07128v3,2024-01
One Agent Too Many: User Perspectives on Approaches to Multi-agent Conversational AI,"Christopher Clarke, Karthik Krishnamurthy, Walter Talamonti, Yiping Kang, Lingjia Tang, Jason Mars","Conversational agents have been gaining increasing popularity in recent years. Influenced by the widespread adoption of task-oriented agents such as Apple Siri and Amazon Alexa, these agents are being deployed into various applications to enhance user experience. Although these agents promote ""ask me anything"" functionality, they are typically built to focus on a single or finite set of expertise. Given that complex tasks often require more than one expertise, this results in the users needing to learn and adopt multiple agents. One approach to alleviate this is to abstract the orchestration of agents in the background. However, this removes the option of choice and flexibility, potentially harming the ability to complete tasks. In this paper, we explore these different interaction experiences (one agent for all) vs (user choice of agents) for conversational AI. We design prototypes for each, systematically evaluating their ability to facilitate task completion. Through a series of conducted user studies, we show that users have a significant preference for abstracting agent orchestration in both system usability and system performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that this mode of interaction is able to provide quality responses that are rated within 1% of human-selected answers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07123v1,2024-01
"Open Models, Closed Minds? On Agents Capabilities in Mimicking Human Personalities through Open Large Language Models","Lucio La Cava, Andrea Tagarelli","The emergence of unveiling human-like behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a closer connection between NLP and human psychology. Scholars have been studying the inherent personalities exhibited by LLMs and attempting to incorporate human traits and behaviors into them. However, these efforts have primarily focused on commercially-licensed LLMs, neglecting the widespread use and notable advancements seen in Open LLMs. This work aims to address this gap by employing a set of 12 LLM Agents based on the most representative Open models and subject them to a series of assessments concerning the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) test. Our approach involves evaluating the intrinsic personality traits of Open LLM agents and determining the extent to which these agents can mimic human personalities when conditioned by specific personalities and roles. Our findings unveil that $(i)$ each Open LLM agent showcases distinct human personalities; $(ii)$ personality-conditioned prompting produces varying effects on the agents, with only few successfully mirroring the imposed personality, while most of them being ``closed-minded'' (i.e., they retain their intrinsic traits); and $(iii)$ combining role and personality conditioning can enhance the agents' ability to mimic human personalities. Our work represents a step up in understanding the dense relationship between NLP and human psychology through the lens of Open LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07115v2,2024-01
Combining Confidence Elicitation and Sample-based Methods for Uncertainty Quantification in Misinformation Mitigation,"Mauricio Rivera, Jean-François Godbout, Reihaneh Rabbany, Kellin Pelrine","Large Language Models have emerged as prime candidates to tackle misinformation mitigation. However, existing approaches struggle with hallucinations and overconfident predictions. We propose an uncertainty quantification framework that leverages both direct confidence elicitation and sampled-based consistency methods to provide better calibration for NLP misinformation mitigation solutions. We first investigate the calibration of sample-based consistency methods that exploit distinct features of consistency across sample sizes and stochastic levels. Next, we evaluate the performance and distributional shift of a robust numeric verbalization prompt across single vs. two-step confidence elicitation procedure. We also compare the performance of the same prompt with different versions of GPT and different numerical scales. Finally, we combine the sample-based consistency and verbalized methods to propose a hybrid framework that yields a better uncertainty estimation for GPT models. Overall, our work proposes novel uncertainty quantification methods that will improve the reliability of Large Language Models in misinformation mitigation applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08694v2,2024-01
Directed Regular and Context-Free Languages,"Moses Ganardi, Irmak Saglam, Georg Zetzsche","We study the problem of deciding whether a given language is directed. A language $L$ is \emph{directed} if every pair of words in $L$ have a common (scattered) superword in $L$. Deciding directedness is a fundamental problem in connection with ideal decompositions of downward closed sets. Another motivation is that deciding whether two \emph{directed} context-free languages have the same downward closures can be decided in polynomial time, whereas for general context-free languages, this problem is known to be coNEXP-complete.   We show that the directedness problem for regular languages, given as NFAs, belongs to $AC^1$, and thus polynomial time. Moreover, it is NL-complete for fixed alphabet sizes. Furthermore, we show that for context-free languages, the directedness problem is PSPACE-complete.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07106v2,2024-01
Graph Language Models,"Moritz Plenz, Anette Frank","While Language Models (LMs) are the workhorses of NLP, their interplay with structured knowledge graphs (KGs) is still actively researched. Current methods for encoding such graphs typically either (i) linearize them for embedding with LMs -- which underutilize structural information, or (ii) use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to preserve the graph structure -- but GNNs cannot represent text features as well as pretrained LMs. In our work we introduce a novel LM type, the Graph Language Model (GLM), that integrates the strengths of both approaches and mitigates their weaknesses. The GLM parameters are initialized from a pretrained LM to enhance understanding of individual graph concepts and triplets. Simultaneously, we design the GLM's architecture to incorporate graph biases, thereby promoting effective knowledge distribution within the graph. This enables GLMs to process graphs, texts, and interleaved inputs of both. Empirical evaluations on relation classification tasks show that GLM embeddings surpass both LM- and GNN-based baselines in supervised and zero-shot setting, demonstrating their versatility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07105v3,2024-01
Leveraging Large Language Models for NLG Evaluation: Advances and Challenges,"Zhen Li, Xiaohan Xu, Tao Shen, Can Xu, Jia-Chen Gu, Yuxuan Lai, Chongyang Tao, Shuai Ma","In the rapidly evolving domain of Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation, introducing Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for assessing generated content quality, e.g., coherence, creativity, and context relevance. This paper aims to provide a thorough overview of leveraging LLMs for NLG evaluation, a burgeoning area that lacks a systematic analysis. We propose a coherent taxonomy for organizing existing LLM-based evaluation metrics, offering a structured framework to understand and compare these methods. Our detailed exploration includes critically assessing various LLM-based methodologies, as well as comparing their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLG outputs. By discussing unresolved challenges, including bias, robustness, domain-specificity, and unified evaluation, this paper seeks to offer insights to researchers and advocate for fairer and more advanced NLG evaluation techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07103v2,2024-01
A Novel Multi-Stage Prompting Approach for Language Agnostic MCQ Generation using GPT,"Subhankar Maity, Aniket Deroy, Sudeshna Sarkar","We introduce a multi-stage prompting approach (MSP) for the generation of multiple choice questions (MCQs), harnessing the capabilities of GPT models such as text-davinci-003 and GPT-4, renowned for their excellence across various NLP tasks. Our approach incorporates the innovative concept of chain-of-thought prompting, a progressive technique in which the GPT model is provided with a series of interconnected cues to guide the MCQ generation process. Automated evaluations consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MSP method over the traditional single-stage prompting (SSP) baseline, resulting in the production of high-quality distractors. Furthermore, the one-shot MSP technique enhances automatic evaluation results, contributing to improved distractor generation in multiple languages, including English, German, Bengali, and Hindi. In human evaluations, questions generated using our approach exhibit superior levels of grammaticality, answerability, and difficulty, highlighting its efficacy in various languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07098v1,2024-01
PUB: A Pragmatics Understanding Benchmark for Assessing LLMs' Pragmatics Capabilities,"Settaluri Lakshmi Sravanthi, Meet Doshi, Tankala Pavan Kalyan, Rudra Murthy, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Raj Dabre","LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capability for understanding semantics, but they often struggle with understanding pragmatics. To demonstrate this fact, we release a Pragmatics Understanding Benchmark (PUB) dataset consisting of fourteen tasks in four pragmatics phenomena, namely, Implicature, Presupposition, Reference, and Deixis. We curated high-quality test sets for each task, consisting of Multiple Choice Question Answers (MCQA). PUB includes a total of 28k data points, 6.1k of which have been created by us, and the rest are adapted from existing datasets. We evaluated nine models varying in the number of parameters and type of training. Our study indicates that fine-tuning for instruction-following and chat significantly enhances the pragmatics capabilities of smaller language models. However, for larger models, the base versions perform comparably with their chat-adapted counterparts. Additionally, there is a noticeable performance gap between human capabilities and model capabilities. Furthermore, unlike the consistent performance of humans across various tasks, the models demonstrate variability in their proficiency, with performance levels fluctuating due to different hints and the complexities of tasks within the same dataset. Overall, the benchmark aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of LLM's ability to handle real-world language tasks that require pragmatic reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07078v1,2024-01
xCoT: Cross-lingual Instruction Tuning for Cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,"Linzheng Chai, Jian Yang, Tao Sun, Hongcheng Guo, Jiaheng Liu, Bing Wang, Xiannian Liang, Jiaqi Bai, Tongliang Li, Qiyao Peng, Zhoujun Li","Chain-of-thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique to elicit reasoning in large language models and improve a variety of downstream tasks. CoT mainly demonstrates excellent performance in English, but its usage in low-resource languages is constrained due to poor language generalization. To bridge the gap among different languages, we propose a cross-lingual instruction fine-tuning framework (xCOT) to transfer knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. Specifically, the multilingual instruction training data (xCOT-INSTRUCT) is created to encourage the semantic alignment of multiple languages. We introduce cross-lingual in-context few-shot learning (xICL)) to accelerate multilingual agreement in instruction tuning, where some fragments of source languages in examples are randomly substituted by their counterpart translations of target languages. During multilingual instruction tuning, we adopt the randomly online CoT strategy to enhance the multilingual reasoning ability of the large language model by first translating the query to another language and then answering in English. To further facilitate the language transfer, we leverage the high-resource CoT to supervise the training of low-resource languages with cross-lingual distillation. Experimental results on previous benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of xCoT in reducing the gap among different languages, highlighting its potential to reduce the cross-lingual gap.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07037v1,2024-01
Edge-Enabled Anomaly Detection and Information Completion for Social Network Knowledge Graphs,"Fan Lu, Quan Qi, Huaibin Qin","In the rapidly advancing information era, various human behaviors are being precisely recorded in the form of data, including identity information, criminal records, and communication data. Law enforcement agencies can effectively maintain social security and precisely combat criminal activities by analyzing the aforementioned data. In comparison to traditional data analysis methods, deep learning models, relying on the robust computational power in cloud centers, exhibit higher accuracy in extracting data features and inferring data. However, within the architecture of cloud centers, the transmission of data from end devices introduces significant latency, hindering real-time inference of data. Furthermore, low-latency edge computing architectures face limitations in direct deployment due to relatively weak computing and storage capacities of nodes. To address these challenges, a lightweight distributed knowledge graph completion architecture is proposed. Firstly, we introduce a lightweight distributed knowledge graph completion architecture that utilizes knowledge graph embedding for data analysis. Subsequently, to filter out substandard data, a personnel data quality assessment method named PDQA is proposed. Lastly, we present a model pruning algorithm that significantly reduces the model size while maximizing performance, enabling lightweight deployment. In experiments, we compare the effects of 11 advanced models on completing the knowledge graph of public security personnel information. The results indicate that the RotatE model outperforms other models significantly in knowledge graph completion, with the pruned model size reduced by 70\%, and hits@10 reaching 86.97\%.}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07022v1,2024-01
Knowledge Distillation of Black-Box Large Language Models,"Hongzhan Chen, Ruijun Chen, Yuqi Yi, Xiaojun Quan, Chenliang Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang","Given the exceptional performance of proprietary large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, recent research has increasingly focused on boosting the capabilities of smaller models through knowledge distillation (KD) from these powerful yet black-box teachers. While leveraging the high-quality outputs of these teachers is advantageous, the inaccessibility of their internal states often limits effective knowledge transfer. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Proxy-KD, a novel method that uses a proxy model to facilitate the efficient transfer of knowledge from black-box LLMs to smaller models. Our experiments show that Proxy-KD not only enhances the performance of KD from black-box teacher models but also surpasses traditional white-box KD techniques.~This approach presents a compelling new avenue for distilling knowledge from advanced LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07013v2,2024-01
Joint Extraction of Uyghur Medicine Knowledge with Edge Computing,"Fan Lu, Quan Qi, Huaibin Qin","Medical knowledge extraction methods based on edge computing deploy deep learning models on edge devices to achieve localized entity and relation extraction. This approach avoids transferring substantial sensitive data to cloud data centers, effectively safeguarding the privacy of healthcare services. However, existing relation extraction methods mainly employ a sequential pipeline approach, which classifies relations between determined entities after entity recognition. This mode faces challenges such as error propagation between tasks, insufficient consideration of dependencies between the two subtasks, and the neglect of interrelations between different relations within a sentence. To address these challenges, a joint extraction model with parameter sharing in edge computing is proposed, named CoEx-Bert. This model leverages shared parameterization between two models to jointly extract entities and relations. Specifically, CoEx-Bert employs two models, each separately sharing hidden layer parameters, and combines these two loss functions for joint backpropagation to optimize the model parameters. Additionally, it effectively resolves the issue of entity overlapping when extracting knowledge from unstructured Uyghur medical texts by considering contextual relations. Finally, this model is deployed on edge devices for real-time extraction and inference of Uyghur medical knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that CoEx-Bert outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy, recall, and F1 scores of 90.65\%, 92.45\%, and 91.54\%, respectively, in the Uyghur traditional medical literature dataset. These improvements represent a 6.45\% increase in accuracy, a 9.45\% increase in recall, and a 7.95\% increase in F1 score compared to the baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07009v1,2024-01
Extending LLMs' Context Window with 100 Samples,"Yikai Zhang, Junlong Li, Pengfei Liu","Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to have limited extrapolation ability beyond their pre-trained context window, constraining their application in downstream tasks with lengthy inputs. Recent studies have sought to extend LLMs' context window by modifying rotary position embedding (RoPE), a popular position encoding method adopted by well-known LLMs such as LLaMA, PaLM, and GPT-NeoX. However, prior works like Position Interpolation (PI) and YaRN are resource-intensive and lack comparative experiments to assess their applicability. In this work, we identify the inherent need for LLMs' attention entropy (i.e. the information entropy of attention scores) to maintain stability and introduce a novel extension to RoPE which combines adjusting RoPE's base frequency and scaling the attention logits to help LLMs efficiently adapt to a larger context window. We validate the superiority of our method in both fine-tuning performance and robustness across different context window sizes on various context-demanding tasks. Notably, our method extends the context window of LLaMA-2-7B-Chat to 16,384 with only 100 samples and 6 training steps, showcasing extraordinary efficiency. Finally, we also explore how data compositions and training curricula affect context window extension for specific downstream tasks, suggesting fine-tuning LLMs with lengthy conversations as a good starting point.

CHAMP: A Competition-level Dataset for Fine-Grained Analyses of LLMs' Mathematical Reasoning Capabilities,"Yujun Mao, Yoon Kim, Yilun Zhou","Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown indications of mathematical reasoning ability on challenging competition-level problems, especially with self-generated verbalizations of intermediate reasoning steps (i.e., chain-of-thought prompting). However, current evaluations mainly focus on the end-to-end final answer correctness, and it is unclear whether LLMs can make use of helpful side information such as problem-specific hints. In this paper, we propose a challenging benchmark dataset for enabling such analyses. The Concept and Hint-Annotated Math Problems (CHAMP) consists of high school math competition problems, annotated with concepts, or general math facts, and hints, or problem-specific tricks. These annotations allow us to explore the effects of additional information, such as relevant hints, misleading concepts, or related problems. This benchmark is difficult, with the best model only scoring 58.1% in standard settings. With concepts and hints, performance sometimes improves, indicating that some models can make use of such side information. Furthermore, we annotate model-generated solutions for their correctness. Using this corpus, we find that models often arrive at the correct final answer through wrong reasoning steps. In addition, we test whether models are able to verify these solutions, and find that most models struggle.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06961v2,2024-01
Bridging the Preference Gap between Retrievers and LLMs,"Zixuan Ke, Weize Kong, Cheng Li, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Michael Bendersky","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior results across a wide range of tasks, and Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective way to enhance the performance by locating relevant information and placing it into the context window of the LLM. However, the relationship between retrievers and LLMs in a RAG is still under-investigated. Most existing work treats the retriever and the LLM as independent components and leaves a gap between retrieving human-""friendly"" information and assembling a LLM-""friendly"" context. In this work, we examine a novel bridge mechanism. We validate the ranking and selection assumptions of retrievers in the context of RAG and propose a framework that chains together supervised and reinforcement learning to train a bridge model that optimizes the connection between the retriever and the LLM. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both question-answering and personalized generation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06954v2,2024-01
E^2-LLM: Efficient and Extreme Length Extension of Large Language Models,"Jiaheng Liu, Zhiqi Bai, Yuanxing Zhang, Chenchen Zhang, Yu Zhang, Ge Zhang, Jiakai Wang, Haoran Que, Yukang Chen, Wenbo Su, Tiezheng Ge, Jie Fu, Wenhu Chen, Bo Zheng","Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. Existing long-context extension methods usually need additional training procedures to support corresponding long-context windows, where the long-context training data (e.g., 32k) is needed, and high GPU training costs are assumed. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an Efficient and Extreme length extension method for Large Language Models, called E 2 -LLM, with only one training procedure and dramatically reduced computation cost, which also removes the need to collect long-context data. Concretely, first, the training data of our E 2 -LLM only requires a short length (e.g., 4k), which reduces the tuning cost greatly. Second, the training procedure on the short training context window is performed only once time, and we can support different evaluation context windows at inference. Third, in E 2 - LLM, based on RoPE position embeddings, we introduce two different augmentation methods on the scale and position index parameters for different samples in training. It aims to make the model more robust to the different relative differences when directly interpolating the arbitrary context length at inference. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our E 2 -LLM on challenging long-context tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06951v3,2024-01
Parameter-Efficient Detoxification with Contrastive Decoding,"Tong Niu, Caiming Xiong, Semih Yavuz, Yingbo Zhou","The field of natural language generation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, including the development of controllable text generation techniques. However, controlling the attributes of the generated text remains a challenge, especially when aiming to avoid undesirable behavior such as toxicity. In this work, we introduce Detoxification Generator (DETOXIGEN), an inference-time algorithm that steers the generation away from unwanted styles. DETOXIGEN is an ensemble of a pre-trained language model (generator) and a detoxifier. The detoxifier is trained intentionally on the toxic data representative of the undesirable attribute, encouraging it to generate text in that style exclusively. During the actual generation, we use the trained detoxifier to produce undesirable tokens for the generator to contrast against at each decoding step. This approach directly informs the generator to avoid generating tokens that the detoxifier considers highly likely. We evaluate DETOXIGEN on the commonly used REALTOXICITYPROMPTS benchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) with various language models as generators. We find that it significantly outperforms previous approaches in detoxification metrics while not compromising on the generation quality. Moreover, the detoxifier is obtained by soft prompt-tuning using the same backbone language model as the generator. Hence, DETOXIGEN requires only a tiny amount of extra weights from the virtual tokens of the detoxifier to be loaded into GPU memory while decoding, making it a promising lightweight, practical, and parameter-efficient detoxification strategy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06947v1,2024-01
Knowledge-Centric Templatic Views of Documents,"Isabel Cachola, Silviu Cucerzan, Allen Herring, Vuksan Mijovic, Erik Oveson, Sujay Kumar Jauhar","Authors seeking to communicate with broader audiences often share their ideas in various document formats, such as slide decks, newsletters, reports, and posters. Prior work on document generation has generally tackled the creation of each separate format to be a different task, leading to fragmented learning processes, redundancy in models and methods, and disjointed evaluation. We consider each of these documents as templatic views of the same underlying knowledge/content, and we aim to unify the generation and evaluation of these templatic views. We begin by showing that current LLMs are capable of generating various document formats with little to no supervision. Further, a simple augmentation involving a structured intermediate representation can improve performance, especially for smaller models. We then introduce a novel unified evaluation framework that can be adapted to measuring the quality of document generators for heterogeneous downstream applications. This evaluation is adaptable to a range of user defined criteria and application scenarios, obviating the need for task specific evaluation metrics. Finally, we conduct a human evaluation, which shows that people prefer 82% of the documents generated with our method, while correlating more highly with our unified evaluation framework than prior metrics in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06945v2,2024-01
MiTTenS: A Dataset for Evaluating Gender Mistranslation,"Kevin Robinson, Sneha Kudugunta, Romina Stella, Sunipa Dev, Jasmijn Bastings","Translation systems, including foundation models capable of translation, can produce errors that result in gender mistranslation, and such errors can be especially harmful. To measure the extent of such potential harms when translating into and out of English, we introduce a dataset, MiTTenS, covering 26 languages from a variety of language families and scripts, including several traditionally under-represented in digital resources. The dataset is constructed with handcrafted passages that target known failure patterns, longer synthetically generated passages, and natural passages sourced from multiple domains. We demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset by evaluating both neural machine translation systems and foundation models, and show that all systems exhibit gender mistranslation and potential harm, even in high resource languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06935v3,2024-01
PizzaCommonSense: Learning to Model Commonsense Reasoning about Intermediate Steps in Cooking Recipes,"Aissatou Diallo, Antonis Bikakis, Luke Dickens, Anthony Hunter, Rob Miller","Understanding procedural texts, such as cooking recipes, is essential for enabling machines to follow instructions and reason about tasks, a key aspect of intelligent reasoning. In cooking, these instructions can be interpreted as a series of modifications to a food preparation. For a model to effectively reason about cooking recipes, it must accurately discern and understand the inputs and outputs of intermediate steps within the recipe. We present a new corpus of cooking recipes enriched with descriptions of intermediate steps that describe the input and output for each step. PizzaCommonsense serves as a benchmark for the reasoning capabilities of LLMs because it demands rigorous explicit input-output descriptions to demonstrate the acquisition of implicit commonsense knowledge, which is unlikely to be easily memorized. GPT-4 achieves only 26\% human-evaluated preference for generations, leaving room for future improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06930v2,2024-01
Comparing GPT-4 and Open-Source Language Models in Misinformation Mitigation,"Tyler Vergho, Jean-Francois Godbout, Reihaneh Rabbany, Kellin Pelrine","Recent large language models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective for misinformation detection. However, the choice of LLMs for experiments varies widely, leading to uncertain conclusions. In particular, GPT-4 is known to be strong in this domain, but it is closed source, potentially expensive, and can show instability between different versions. Meanwhile, alternative LLMs have given mixed results. In this work, we show that Zephyr-7b presents a consistently viable alternative, overcoming key limitations of commonly used approaches like Llama-2 and GPT-3.5. This provides the research community with a solid open-source option and shows open-source models are gradually catching up on this task. We then highlight how GPT-3.5 exhibits unstable performance, such that this very widely used model could provide misleading results in misinformation detection. Finally, we validate new tools including approaches to structured output and the latest version of GPT-4 (Turbo), showing they do not compromise performance, thus unlocking them for future research and potentially enabling more complex pipelines for misinformation mitigation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06920v1,2024-01
DocFinQA: A Long-Context Financial Reasoning Dataset,"Varshini Reddy, Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Viet Dac Lai, Michael Krumdick, Charles Lovering, Chris Tanner","For large language models (LLMs) to be effective in the financial domain -- where each decision can have a significant impact -- it is necessary to investigate realistic tasks and data. Financial professionals often interact with documents that are hundreds of pages long, but most financial research datasets only deal with short excerpts from these documents. To address this, we introduce a long-document financial QA task. We augment 7,437 questions from the existing FinQA dataset with the full-document context, extending the average context length from under 700 words in FinQA to 123k words in DocFinQA. We conduct extensive experiments over retrieval-based QA pipelines and long-context language models. DocFinQA proves a significant challenge for even state-of-the-art systems. We also provide a case-study on the longest documents in DocFinQA and find that models particularly struggle on these documents.

Many NLP tasks are naturally structured: that is, their outputs consist of multiple labels which constrain each other. Annotating data for such tasks can be cumbersome. Can the promise of the prompt-based paradigm be extended to such structured outputs? In this paper, we present a framework for constructing zero- and few-shot linguistic structure predictors. Our key insight is that we can use structural constraints -- and combinatorial inference derived from them -- to filter out inconsistent structures predicted by large language models. We instantiated this framework on two structured prediction tasks, and five datasets. Across all cases, our results show that enforcing consistency not only constructs structurally valid outputs, but also improves performance over the unconstrained variants.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06877v3,2024-01
Health-LLM: Large Language Models for Health Prediction via Wearable Sensor Data,"Yubin Kim, Xuhai Xu, Daniel McDuff, Cynthia Breazeal, Hae Won Park","Large language models (LLMs) are capable of many natural language tasks, yet they are far from perfect. In health applications, grounding and interpreting domain-specific and non-linguistic data is crucial. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs to make inferences about health based on contextual information (e.g. user demographics, health knowledge) and physiological data (e.g. resting heart rate, sleep minutes). We present a comprehensive evaluation of 12 state-of-the-art LLMs with prompting and fine-tuning techniques on four public health datasets (PMData, LifeSnaps, GLOBEM and AW_FB). Our experiments cover 10 consumer health prediction tasks in mental health, activity, metabolic, and sleep assessment. Our fine-tuned model, HealthAlpaca exhibits comparable performance to much larger models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro), achieving the best performance in 8 out of 10 tasks. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of context enhancement strategies. Notably, we observe that our context enhancement can yield up to 23.8% improvement in performance. While constructing contextually rich prompts (combining user context, health knowledge and temporal information) exhibits synergistic improvement, the inclusion of health knowledge context in prompts significantly enhances overall performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06866v2,2024-01
Fine-grained Hallucination Detection and Editing for Language Models,"Abhika Mishra, Akari Asai, Vidhisha Balachandran, Yizhong Wang, Graham Neubig, Yulia Tsvetkov, Hannaneh Hajishirzi","Large language models (LMs) are prone to generate factual errors, which are often called hallucinations. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of hallucinations and argue that hallucinations manifest in diverse forms, each requiring varying degrees of careful assessments to verify factuality. We propose a novel task of automatic fine-grained hallucination detection and construct a new evaluation benchmark, FavaBench, that includes about one thousand fine-grained human judgments on three LM outputs across various domains. Our analysis reveals that ChatGPT and Llama2-Chat (70B, 7B) exhibit diverse types of hallucinations in the majority of their outputs in information-seeking scenarios. We train FAVA, a retrieval-augmented LM by carefully creating synthetic data to detect and correct fine-grained hallucinations. On our benchmark, our automatic and human evaluations show that FAVA significantly outperforms ChatGPT and GPT-4 on fine-grained hallucination detection, and edits suggested by FAVA improve the factuality of LM-generated text.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06855v4,2024-01
Large Language Models Can Learn Temporal Reasoning,"Siheng Xiong, Ali Payani, Ramana Kompella, Faramarz Fekri","While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they are not without their flaws and inaccuracies. Recent studies have introduced various methods to mitigate these limitations. Temporal reasoning (TR), in particular, presents a significant challenge for LLMs due to its reliance on diverse temporal concepts and intricate temporal logic. In this paper, we propose TG-LLM, a novel framework towards language-based TR. Instead of reasoning over the original context, we adopt a latent representation, temporal graph (TG) that enhances the learning of TR. A synthetic dataset (TGQA), which is fully controllable and requires minimal supervision, is constructed for fine-tuning LLMs on this text-to-TG translation task. We confirmed in experiments that the capability of TG translation learned on our dataset can be transferred to other TR tasks and benchmarks. On top of that, we teach LLM to perform deliberate reasoning over the TGs via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) bootstrapping and graph data augmentation. We observed that those strategies, which maintain a balance between usefulness and diversity, bring more reliable CoTs and final results than the vanilla CoT distillation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06853v6,2024-01
Machine Translation Models are Zero-Shot Detectors of Translation Direction,"Michelle Wastl, Jannis Vamvas, Rico Sennrich","Detecting the translation direction of parallel text has applications for machine translation training and evaluation, but also has forensic applications such as resolving plagiarism or forgery allegations. In this work, we explore an unsupervised approach to translation direction detection based on the simple hypothesis that $p(\text{translation}|\text{original})>p(\text{original}|\text{translation})$, motivated by the well-known simplification effect in translationese or machine-translationese. In experiments with massively multilingual machine translation models across 20 translation directions, we confirm the effectiveness of the approach for high-resource language pairs, achieving document-level accuracies of 82--96% for NMT-produced translations, and 60--81% for human translations, depending on the model used.

Mind Your Format: Towards Consistent Evaluation of In-Context Learning Improvements,"Anton Voronov, Lena Wolf, Max Ryabinin","Large language models demonstrate a remarkable capability for learning to solve new tasks from a few examples. The prompt template, or the way the input examples are formatted to obtain the prompt, is an important yet often overlooked aspect of in-context learning. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of the template format's influence on the in-context learning performance. We evaluate the impact of the prompt template across 21 models (from 770M to 70B parameters) and 4 standard classification datasets. We show that a poor choice of the template can reduce the performance of the strongest models and inference methods to a random guess level. More importantly, the best templates do not transfer between different setups and even between models of the same family. Our findings show that the currently prevalent approach to evaluation, which ignores template selection, may give misleading results due to different templates in different works. As a first step towards mitigating this issue, we propose Template Ensembles that aggregate model predictions across several templates. This simple test-time augmentation boosts average performance while being robust to the choice of random set of templates.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06766v3,2024-01
APAR: LLMs Can Do Auto-Parallel Auto-Regressive Decoding,"Mingdao Liu, Aohan Zeng, Bowen Wang, Peng Zhang, Jie Tang, Yuxiao Dong","The massive adoption of large language models (LLMs) demands efficient deployment strategies. However, the auto-regressive decoding process, which is fundamental to how most LLMs generate text, poses challenges to achieve efficient serving. In this work, we introduce a parallel auto-regressive generation method. By instruct-tuning on general domain data that contains hierarchical structures, we enable LLMs to independently plan their generation process and perform auto-parallel auto-regressive (APAR) generation, significantly reducing the number of generation steps. APAR alone can achieve up to 2x speed-up, and when combined with speculative decoding, the speed-up can reach up to 4x. In addition, APAR reduces the key-value cache consumption and attention computation during generation. This leads to a throughput increase of 20-70% and a latency reduce of 20-35% in high-throughput scenarios, compared to state-of-the-art serving frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06761v1,2024-01
Navigating the Metrics Maze: Reconciling Score Magnitudes and Accuracies,"Tom Kocmi, Vilém Zouhar, Christian Federmann, Matt Post","Ten years ago a single metric, BLEU, governed progress in machine translation research. For better or worse, there is no such consensus today, and consequently it is difficult for researchers to develop and retain the kinds of heuristic intuitions about metric deltas that drove earlier research and deployment decisions. This paper investigates the ""dynamic range"" of a number of modern metrics in an effort to provide a collective understanding of the meaning of differences in scores both within and among metrics; in other words, we ask what point difference X in metric Y is required between two systems for humans to notice? We conduct our evaluation on a new large dataset, ToShip23, using it to discover deltas at which metrics achieve system-level differences that are meaningful to humans, which we measure by pairwise system accuracy. We additionally show that this method of establishing delta-accuracy is more stable than the standard use of statistical p-values in regards to testset size. Where data size permits, we also explore the effect of metric deltas and accuracy across finer-grained features such as translation direction, domain, and system closeness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06760v2,2024-01
Stylometry Analysis of Multi-authored Documents for Authorship and Author Style Change Detection,"Muhammad Tayyab Zamir, Muhammad Asif Ayub, Asma Gul, Nasir Ahmad, Kashif Ahmad","In recent years, the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence based text generation tools has posed new challenges in document provenance, authentication, and authorship detection. However, advancements in stylometry have provided opportunities for automatic authorship and author change detection in multi-authored documents using style analysis techniques. Style analysis can serve as a primary step toward document provenance and authentication through authorship detection. This paper investigates three key tasks of style analysis: (i) classification of single and multi-authored documents, (ii) single change detection, which involves identifying the point where the author switches, and (iii) multiple author-switching detection in multi-authored documents. We formulate all three tasks as classification problems and propose a merit-based fusion framework that integrates several state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and weight optimization techniques. We also explore the potential of special characters, which are typically removed during pre-processing in NLP applications, on the performance of the proposed methods for these tasks by conducting extensive experiments on both cleaned and raw datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing solutions for all three tasks on a benchmark dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06752v1,2024-01
The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Easy Training Data for Hard Tasks,"Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal, Peter Clark, Sarah Wiegreffe","How can we train models to perform well on hard test data when hard training data is by definition difficult to label correctly? This question has been termed the scalable oversight problem and has drawn increasing attention as language models have continually improved. In this paper, we present the surprising conclusion that current pretrained language models often generalize relatively well from easy to hard data, even performing as well as oracle models finetuned on hard data. We demonstrate this kind of easy-to-hard generalization using simple finetuning methods like in-context learning, linear classifier heads, and QLoRA for seven different measures of datapoint hardness, including six empirically diverse human hardness measures (like grade level) and one model-based measure (loss-based). Furthermore, we show that even if one cares most about model performance on hard data, it can be better to collect easy data rather than hard data for finetuning, since hard data is generally noisier and costlier to collect. Our experiments use open models up to 70b in size and four publicly available question-answering datasets with questions ranging in difficulty from 3rd grade science questions to college level STEM questions and general-knowledge trivia. We conclude that easy-to-hard generalization in LMs is surprisingly strong for the tasks studied.

Using Natural Language Inference to Improve Persona Extraction from Dialogue in a New Domain,"Alexandra DeLucia, Mengjie Zhao, Yoshinori Maeda, Makoto Yoda, Keiichi Yamada, Hiromi Wakaki","While valuable datasets such as PersonaChat provide a foundation for training persona-grounded dialogue agents, they lack diversity in conversational and narrative settings, primarily existing in the ""real"" world. To develop dialogue agents with unique personas, models are trained to converse given a specific persona, but hand-crafting these persona can be time-consuming, thus methods exist to automatically extract persona information from existing character-specific dialogue. However, these persona-extraction models are also trained on datasets derived from PersonaChat and struggle to provide high-quality persona information from conversational settings that do not take place in the real world, such as the fantasy-focused dataset, LIGHT. Creating new data to train models on a specific setting is human-intensive, thus prohibitively expensive. To address both these issues, we introduce a natural language inference method for post-hoc adapting a trained persona extraction model to a new setting. We draw inspiration from the literature of dialog natural language inference (NLI), and devise NLI-reranking methods to extract structured persona information from dialogue. Compared to existing persona extraction models, our method returns higher-quality extracted persona and requires less human annotation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06742v1,2024-01
MAPO: Advancing Multilingual Reasoning through Multilingual Alignment-as-Preference Optimization,"Shuaijie She, Wei Zou, Shujian Huang, Wenhao Zhu, Xiang Liu, Xiang Geng, Jiajun Chen","Though reasoning abilities are considered language-agnostic, existing LLMs exhibit inconsistent reasoning abilities across different languages, e.g., reasoning in the dominant language like English is superior to other languages due to the imbalance of multilingual training data. To enhance reasoning abilities in non-dominant languages, we propose a Multilingual-Alignment-as-Preference Optimization framework (MAPO), aiming to align the reasoning processes in other languages with the dominant language. Specifically, we harness an off-the-shelf translation model for the consistency between answers in non-dominant and dominant languages, which we adopt as the preference for optimization, e.g., Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Experiments show that MAPO stably achieves significant improvements in the multilingual reasoning of various models on all three benchmarks (MSVAMP +16.2%, MGSM +6.1%, and MNumGLUESub +13.3%), with improved reasoning consistency across languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06838v3,2024-01
Relying on the Unreliable: The Impact of Language Models' Reluctance to Express Uncertainty,"Kaitlyn Zhou, Jena D. Hwang, Xiang Ren, Maarten Sap","As natural language becomes the default interface for human-AI interaction, there is a need for LMs to appropriately communicate uncertainties in downstream applications. In this work, we investigate how LMs incorporate confidence in responses via natural language and how downstream users behave in response to LM-articulated uncertainties. We examine publicly deployed models and find that LMs are reluctant to express uncertainties when answering questions even when they produce incorrect responses. LMs can be explicitly prompted to express confidences, but tend to be overconfident, resulting in high error rates (an average of 47%) among confident responses. We test the risks of LM overconfidence by conducting human experiments and show that users rely heavily on LM generations, whether or not they are marked by certainty. Lastly, we investigate the preference-annotated datasets used in post training alignment and find that humans are biased against texts with uncertainty. Our work highlights new safety harms facing human-LM interactions and proposes design recommendations and mitigating strategies moving forward.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06730v2,2024-01
LLM-Assisted Crisis Management: Building Advanced LLM Platforms for Effective Emergency Response and Public Collaboration,"Hakan T. Otal, M. Abdullah Canbaz","Emergencies and critical incidents often unfold rapidly, necessitating a swift and effective response. In this research, we introduce a novel approach to identify and classify emergency situations from social media posts and direct emergency messages using an open source Large Language Model, LLAMA2. The goal is to harness the power of natural language processing and machine learning to assist public safety telecommunicators and huge crowds during countrywide emergencies. Our research focuses on developing a language model that can understand users describe their situation in the 911 call, enabling LLAMA2 to analyze the content and offer relevant instructions to the telecommunicator, while also creating workflows to notify government agencies with the caller's information when necessary. Another benefit this language model provides is its ability to assist people during a significant emergency incident when the 911 system is overwhelmed, by assisting the users with simple instructions and informing authorities with their location and emergency information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10908v1,2024-01
Structsum Generation for Faster Text Comprehension,"Parag Jain, Andreea Marzoca, Francesco Piccinno","We consider the task of generating structured representations of text using large language models (LLMs). We focus on tables and mind maps as representative modalities. Tables are more organized way of representing data, while mind maps provide a visually dynamic and flexible approach, particularly suitable for sparse content. Despite the effectiveness of LLMs on different tasks, we show that current models struggle with generating structured outputs. In response, we present effective prompting strategies for both of these tasks. We introduce a taxonomy of problems around factuality, global and local structure, common to both modalities and propose a set of critiques to tackle these issues resulting in an absolute improvement in accuracy of +37pp (79%) for mind maps and +15pp (78%) for tables. To evaluate semantic coverage of generated structured representations we propose Auto-QA, and we verify the adequacy of Auto-QA using SQuAD dataset. We further evaluate the usefulness of structured representations via a text comprehension user study. The results show a significant reduction in comprehension time compared to text when using table (42.9%) and mind map (31.9%), without loss in accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06837v2,2024-01
Reframing Tax Law Entailment as Analogical Reasoning,"Xinrui Zou, Ming Zhang, Nathaniel Weir, Benjamin Van Durme, Nils Holzenberger","Statutory reasoning refers to the application of legislative provisions to a series of case facts described in natural language. We re-frame statutory reasoning as an analogy task, where each instance of the analogy task involves a combination of two instances of statutory reasoning. This increases the dataset size by two orders of magnitude, and introduces an element of interpretability. We show that this task is roughly as difficult to Natural Language Processing models as the original task. Finally, we come back to statutory reasoning, solving it with a combination of a retrieval mechanism and analogy models, and showing some progress on prior comparable work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06715v1,2024-01
Few-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text using Style Representations,"Rafael Rivera Soto, Kailin Koch, Aleem Khan, Barry Chen, Marcus Bishop, Nicholas Andrews","The advent of instruction-tuned language models that convincingly mimic human writing poses a significant risk of abuse. However, such abuse may be counteracted with the ability to detect whether a piece of text was composed by a language model rather than a human author. Some previous approaches to this problem have relied on supervised methods by training on corpora of confirmed human- and machine- written documents. Unfortunately, model under-specification poses an unavoidable challenge for neural network-based detectors, making them brittle in the face of data shifts, such as the release of newer language models producing still more fluent text than the models used to train the detectors. Other approaches require access to the models that may have generated a document in question, which is often impractical. In light of these challenges, we pursue a fundamentally different approach not relying on samples from language models of concern at training time. Instead, we propose to leverage representations of writing style estimated from human-authored text. Indeed, we find that features effective at distinguishing among human authors are also effective at distinguishing human from machine authors, including state-of-the-art large language models like Llama-2, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Furthermore, given a handful of examples composed by each of several specific language models of interest, our approach affords the ability to predict which model generated a given document. The code and data to reproduce our experiments are available at https://github.com/LLNL/LUAR/tree/main/fewshot_iclr2024.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06712v3,2024-01
Reliability Analysis of Psychological Concept Extraction and Classification in User-penned Text,"Muskan Garg, MSVPJ Sathvik, Amrit Chadha, Shaina Raza, Sunghwan Sohn","The social NLP research community witness a recent surge in the computational advancements of mental health analysis to build responsible AI models for a complex interplay between language use and self-perception. Such responsible AI models aid in quantifying the psychological concepts from user-penned texts on social media. On thinking beyond the low-level (classification) task, we advance the existing binary classification dataset, towards a higher-level task of reliability analysis through the lens of explanations, posing it as one of the safety measures. We annotate the LoST dataset to capture nuanced textual cues that suggest the presence of low self-esteem in the posts of Reddit users. We further state that the NLP models developed for determining the presence of low self-esteem, focus more on three types of textual cues: (i) Trigger: words that triggers mental disturbance, (ii) LoST indicators: text indicators emphasizing low self-esteem, and (iii) Consequences: words describing the consequences of mental disturbance. We implement existing classifiers to examine the attention mechanism in pre-trained language models (PLMs) for a domain-specific psychology-grounded task. Our findings suggest the need of shifting the focus of PLMs from Trigger and Consequences to a more comprehensive explanation, emphasizing LoST indicators while determining low self-esteem in Reddit posts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06709v1,2024-01
Multi-Candidate Speculative Decoding,"Sen Yang, Shujian Huang, Xinyu Dai, Jiajun Chen","Large language models have shown impressive capabilities across a variety of NLP tasks, yet their generating text autoregressively is time-consuming. One way to speed them up is speculative decoding, which generates candidate segments (a sequence of tokens) from a fast draft model that is then verified in parallel by the target model. However, the acceptance rate of candidate tokens receives limitations from several factors, such as the model, the dataset, and the decoding setup. This paper proposes sampling multiple candidates from a draft model and then organising them in batches for verification. We design algorithms for efficient multi-candidate verification while maintaining the distribution of the target model. Our approach shows significant improvements in acceptance rates on multiple datasets and models, consistently outperforming standard speculative decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06706v1,2024-01
An Experimental Design Framework for Label-Efficient Supervised Finetuning of Large Language Models,"Gantavya Bhatt, Yifang Chen, Arnav M. Das, Jifan Zhang, Sang T. Truong, Stephen Mussmann, Yinglun Zhu, Jeffrey Bilmes, Simon S. Du, Kevin Jamieson, Jordan T. Ash, Robert D. Nowak","Supervised finetuning (SFT) on instruction datasets has played a crucial role in achieving the remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities observed in modern large language models (LLMs). However, the annotation efforts required to produce high quality responses for instructions are becoming prohibitively expensive, especially as the number of tasks spanned by instruction datasets continues to increase. Active learning is effective in identifying useful subsets of samples to annotate from an unlabeled pool, but its high computational cost remains a barrier to its widespread applicability in the context of LLMs. To mitigate the annotation cost of SFT and circumvent the computational bottlenecks of active learning, we propose using experimental design. Experimental design techniques select the most informative samples to label, and typically maximize some notion of uncertainty and/or diversity. In our work, we implement a framework that evaluates several existing and novel experimental design techniques and find that these methods consistently yield significant gains in label efficiency with little computational overhead. On generative tasks, our methods achieve the same generalization performance with only $50\%$ of annotation cost required by random sampling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06692v3,2024-01
"Don't Rank, Combine! Combining Machine Translation Hypotheses Using Quality Estimation","Giorgos Vernikos, Andrei Popescu-Belis","Neural machine translation systems estimate probabilities of target sentences given source sentences, yet these estimates may not align with human preferences. This work introduces QE-fusion, a method that synthesizes translations using a quality estimation metric (QE), which correlates better with human judgments. QE-fusion leverages a pool of candidates sampled from a model, combining spans from different candidates using a QE metric such as CometKiwi. We compare QE-fusion against beam search and recent reranking techniques, such as Minimum Bayes Risk decoding or QE-reranking. Our method consistently improves translation quality in terms of COMET and BLEURT scores when applied to large language models (LLMs) used for translation (PolyLM, XGLM, Llama2, Mistral, ALMA, and Tower) and to multilingual translation models (NLLB), over five language pairs. Notably, QE-fusion exhibits larger improvements for LLMs due to their ability to generate diverse outputs. We demonstrate that our approach generates novel translations in over half of the cases and consistently outperforms other methods across varying numbers of candidates (5-200). Furthermore, we empirically establish that QE-fusion scales linearly with the number of candidates in the pool.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06688v2,2024-01
Proximal Causal Inference With Text Data,"Jacob M. Chen, Rohit Bhattacharya, Katherine A. Keith","Recent text-based causal methods attempt to mitigate confounding bias by estimating proxies of confounding variables that are partially or imperfectly measured from unstructured text data. These approaches, however, assume analysts have supervised labels of the confounders given text for a subset of instances, a constraint that is sometimes infeasible due to data privacy or annotation costs. In this work, we address settings in which an important confounding variable is completely unobserved. We propose a new causal inference method that uses two instances of pre-treatment text data, infers two proxies using two zero-shot models on the separate instances, and applies these proxies in the proximal g-formula. We prove, under certain assumptions about the instances of text and accuracy of the zero-shot predictions, that our method of inferring text-based proxies satisfies identification conditions of the proximal g-formula while other seemingly reasonable proposals do not. To address untestable assumptions associated with our method and the proximal g-formula, we further propose an odds ratio falsification heuristic that flags when to proceed with downstream effect estimation using the inferred proxies. We evaluate our method in synthetic and semi-synthetic settings -- the latter with real-world clinical notes from MIMIC-III and open large language models for zero-shot prediction -- and find that our method produces estimates with low bias. We believe that this text-based design of proxies allows for the use of proximal causal inference in a wider range of scenarios, particularly those for which obtaining suitable proxies from structured data is difficult.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06687v3,2024-01
DQNC2S: DQN-based Cross-stream Crisis event Summarizer,"Daniele Rege Cambrin, Luca Cagliero, Paolo Garza",Summarizing multiple disaster-relevant data streams simultaneously is particularly challenging as existing Retrieve&Re-ranking strategies suffer from the inherent redundancy of multi-stream data and limited scalability in a multi-query setting. This work proposes an online approach to crisis timeline generation based on weak annotation with Deep Q-Networks. It selects on-the-fly the relevant pieces of text without requiring neither human annotations nor content re-ranking. This makes the inference time independent of the number of input queries. The proposed approach also incorporates a redundancy filter into the reward function to effectively handle cross-stream content overlaps.

Enhancing Emotional Generation Capability of Large Language Models via Emotional Chain-of-Thought,"Zaijing Li, Gongwei Chen, Rui Shao, Yuquan Xie, Dongmei Jiang, Liqiang Nie","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various emotion recognition tasks, thereby piquing the research community's curiosity for exploring their potential in emotional intelligence. However, several issues in the field of emotional generation tasks remain unresolved, including human preference alignment and emotional generation assessment. In this paper, we propose the Emotional Chain-of-Thought (ECoT), a plug-and-play prompting method that enhances the performance of LLMs on various emotional generation tasks by aligning with human emotional intelligence guidelines. To assess the reliability of ECoT, we propose an automated model-based evaluation method called Emotional Generation Score (EGS). EGS incorporates Goleman's Emotional Intelligence Theory as a consensus of human experts, providing a new perspective on the evaluation of emotional generation tasks.

How Johnny Can Persuade LLMs to Jailbreak Them: Rethinking Persuasion to Challenge AI Safety by Humanizing LLMs,"Yi Zeng, Hongpeng Lin, Jingwen Zhang, Diyi Yang, Ruoxi Jia, Weiyan Shi","Most traditional AI safety research has approached AI models as machines and centered on algorithm-focused attacks developed by security experts. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common and competent, non-expert users can also impose risks during daily interactions. This paper introduces a new perspective to jailbreak LLMs as human-like communicators, to explore this overlooked intersection between everyday language interaction and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. First, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research. Then, we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate interpretable persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. Results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak performance across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over $92\%$ on Llama 2-7b Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in $10$ trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. On the defense side, we explore various mechanisms against PAP and, found a significant gap in existing defenses, and advocate for more fundamental mitigation for highly interactive LLMs",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06373v2,2024-01
PolyTOPS: Reconfigurable and Flexible Polyhedral Scheduler,"Gianpietro Consolaro, Zhen Zhang, Harenome Razanajato, Nelson Lossing, Nassim Tchoulak, Adilla Susungi, Artur Cesar Araujo Alves, Renwei Zhang, Denis Barthou, Corinne Ancourt, Cedric Bastoul","Polyhedral techniques have been widely used for automatic code optimization in low-level compilers and higher-level processes. Loop optimization is central to this technique, and several polyhedral schedulers like Feautrier, Pluto, isl and Tensor Scheduler have been proposed, each of them targeting a different architecture, parallelism model, or application scenario. The need for scenario-specific optimization is growing due to the heterogeneity of architectures. One of the most critical cases is represented by NPUs (Neural Processing Units) used for AI, which may require loop optimization with different objectives. Another factor to be considered is the framework or compiler in which polyhedral optimization takes place. Different scenarios, depending on the target architecture, compilation environment, and application domain, may require different kinds of optimization to best exploit the architecture feature set.   We introduce a new configurable polyhedral scheduler, PolyTOPS, that can be adjusted to various scenarios with straightforward, high-level configurations. This scheduler allows the creation of diverse scheduling strategies that can be both scenario-specific (like state-of-the-art schedulers) and kernel-specific, breaking the concept of a one-size-fits-all scheduler approach. PolyTOPS has been used with isl and CLooG as code generators and has been integrated in MindSpore AKG deep learning compiler. Experimental results in different scenarios show good performance: a geomean speedup of 7.66x on MindSpore (for the NPU Ascend architecture) hybrid custom operators over isl scheduling, a geomean speedup up to 1.80x on PolyBench on different multicore architectures over Pluto scheduling.

WisdoM: Improving Multimodal Sentiment Analysis by Fusing Contextual World Knowledge,"Wenbin Wang, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Yong Luo, Han Hu, Dacheng Tao","Sentiment analysis is rapidly advancing by utilizing various data modalities (e.g., text, image). However, most previous works relied on superficial information, neglecting the incorporation of contextual world knowledge (e.g., background information derived from but beyond the given image and text pairs) and thereby restricting their ability to achieve better multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA). In this paper, we proposed a plug-in framework named WisdoM, to leverage the contextual world knowledge induced from the large vision-language models (LVLMs) for enhanced MSA. WisdoM utilizes LVLMs to comprehensively analyze both images and corresponding texts, simultaneously generating pertinent context. To reduce the noise in the context, we also introduce a training-free contextual fusion mechanism. Experiments across diverse granularities of MSA tasks consistently demonstrate that our approach has substantial improvements (brings an average +1.96% F1 score among five advanced methods) over several state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06659v2,2024-01
Effects of diversity incentives on sample diversity and downstream model performance in LLM-based text augmentation,"Jan Cegin, Branislav Pecher, Jakub Simko, Ivan Srba, Maria Bielikova, Peter Brusilovsky","The latest generative large language models (LLMs) have found their application in data augmentation tasks, where small numbers of text samples are LLM-paraphrased and then used to fine-tune downstream models. However, more research is needed to assess how different prompts, seed data selection strategies, filtering methods, or model settings affect the quality of paraphrased data (and downstream models). In this study, we investigate three text diversity incentive methods well established in crowdsourcing: taboo words, hints by previous outlier solutions, and chaining on previous outlier solutions. Using these incentive methods as part of instructions to LLMs augmenting text datasets, we measure their effects on generated texts lexical diversity and downstream model performance. We compare the effects over 5 different LLMs, 6 datasets and 2 downstream models. We show that diversity is most increased by taboo words, but downstream model performance is highest with hints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06643v3,2024-01
"Experimental Contexts Can Facilitate Robust Semantic Property Inference in Language Models, but Inconsistently","Kanishka Misra, Allyson Ettinger, Kyle Mahowald","Recent zero-shot evaluations have highlighted important limitations in the abilities of language models (LMs) to perform meaning extraction. However, it is now well known that LMs can demonstrate radical improvements in the presence of experimental contexts such as in-context examples and instructions. How well does this translate to previously studied meaning-sensitive tasks? We present a case-study on the extent to which experimental contexts can improve LMs' robustness in performing property inheritance -- predicting semantic properties of novel concepts, a task that they have been previously shown to fail on. Upon carefully controlling the nature of the in-context examples and the instructions, our work reveals that they can indeed lead to non-trivial property inheritance behavior in LMs. However, this ability is inconsistent: with a minimal reformulation of the task, some LMs were found to pick up on shallow, non-semantic heuristics from their inputs, suggesting that the computational principles of semantic property inference are yet to be mastered by LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06640v2,2024-01
OOP: Object-Oriented Programming Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models,"Shuai Wang, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Yong Luo, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao","Advancing automated programming necessitates robust and comprehensive code generation benchmarks, yet current evaluation frameworks largely neglect object-oriented programming (OOP) in favor of functional programming (FP), e.g., HumanEval and MBPP. To address this, our study introduces a pioneering OOP-focused benchmark, featuring 431 Python programs that encompass essential OOP concepts and features like classes and encapsulation methods. We propose a novel evaluation metric, pass@o, tailored for OOP, enhancing traditional pass@k measures. Our evaluation of 23 leading large language models (LLMs), including both general and code-specialized models, reveals three key insights: 1) pass@o offers a more relevant and comprehensive assessment for OOP code generation; 2) Despite excelling in FP, code-specialized LLMs like WizardCoder lag in OOP compared to models like ChatGPT; 3) The poor performance of all advanced LLMs on our OOP benchmark highlights a critical need for improvements in this field. Our benchmark and scripts are publicly released at: https://github.com/alphadl/OOP-eval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06628v2,2024-01
TransliCo: A Contrastive Learning Framework to Address the Script Barrier in Multilingual Pretrained Language Models,"Yihong Liu, Chunlan Ma, Haotian Ye, Hinrich Schütze","The world's more than 7000 languages are written in at least 293 scripts. Due to various reasons, many closely related languages use different scripts, which poses a difficulty for multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) in learning crosslingual knowledge through lexical overlap. As a consequence, mPLMs are faced with a script barrier: representations from different scripts are located in different subspaces, which can result in crosslingual transfer involving languages of different scripts performing suboptimally. To address this problem, we propose TransliCo, a framework that optimizes the Transliteration Contrastive Modeling (TCM) objective to fine-tune an mPLM by contrasting sentences in its training data and their transliterations in a unified script (in our case Latin), which enhances uniformity in the representation space for different scripts. Using Glot500-m, an mPLM pretrained on over 500 languages, as our source model, we fine-tune it on a small portion (5%) of its training data, and refer to the resulting model as Furina. We show that Furina not only better aligns representations from distinct scripts but also outperforms the original Glot500-m on various zero-shot crosslingual transfer tasks. Additionally, we achieve consistent improvement in a case study on the Indic group where the languages exhibit areal features but use different scripts. We make our code and models publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06620v2,2024-01
Mutual Enhancement of Large Language and Reinforcement Learning Models through Bi-Directional Feedback Mechanisms: A Case Study,Shangding Gu,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) models, such as planning and reasoning capabilities. However, the problems of LLMs and RL model collaboration still need to be solved. In this study, we employ a teacher-student learning framework to tackle these problems, specifically by offering feedback for LLMs using RL models and providing high-level information for RL models with LLMs in a cooperative multi-agent setting. Within this framework, the LLM acts as a teacher, while the RL model acts as a student. The two agents cooperatively assist each other through a process of recursive help, such as ""I help you help I help."" The LLM agent supplies abstract information to the RL agent, enabling efficient exploration and policy improvement. In turn, the RL agent offers feedback to the LLM agent, providing valuable, real-time information that helps generate more useful tokens. This bi-directional feedback loop promotes optimization, exploration, and mutual improvement for both agents, enabling them to accomplish increasingly challenging tasks. Remarkably, we propose a practical algorithm to address the problem and conduct empirical experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06603v1,2024-01
Prometheus-Vision: Vision-Language Model as a Judge for Fine-Grained Evaluation,"Seongyun Lee, Seungone Kim, Sue Hyun Park, Geewook Kim, Minjoon Seo","Assessing long-form responses generated by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is challenging. It not only requires checking whether the VLM follows the given instruction but also verifying whether the text output is properly grounded on the given image. Inspired by the recent approach of evaluating LMs with LMs, in this work, we propose to evaluate VLMs with VLMs. For this purpose, we present a new feedback dataset called the Perception Collection, encompassing 15K customized score rubrics that users might care about during assessment. Using the Perception Collection, we train Prometheus-Vision, the first open-source VLM evaluator model that can understand the user-defined score criteria during evaluation. Prometheus-Vision shows the highest Pearson correlation with human evaluators and GPT-4V among open-source models, showing its effectiveness for transparent and accessible evaluation of VLMs. We open-source our code, dataset, and model at https://github.com/kaistAI/prometheus-vision",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06591v1,2024-01
Mapping Transformer Leveraged Embeddings for Cross-Lingual Document Representation,"Tsegaye Misikir Tashu, Eduard-Raul Kontos, Matthia Sabatelli, Matias Valdenegro-Toro","Recommendation systems, for documents, have become tools to find relevant content on the Web. However, these systems have limitations when it comes to recommending documents in languages different from the query language, which means they might overlook resources in non-native languages. This research focuses on representing documents across languages by using Transformer Leveraged Document Representations (TLDRs) that are mapped to a cross-lingual domain. Four multilingual pre-trained transformer models (mBERT, mT5 XLM RoBERTa, ErnieM) were evaluated using three mapping methods across 20 language pairs representing combinations of five selected languages of the European Union. Metrics like Mate Retrieval Rate and Reciprocal Rank were used to measure the effectiveness of mapped TLDRs compared to non-mapped ones. The results highlight the power of cross-lingual representations achieved through pre-trained transformers and mapping approaches suggesting a promising direction for expanding beyond language connections, between two specific languages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06583v1,2024-01
"XLS-R Deep Learning Model for Multilingual ASR on Low- Resource Languages: Indonesian, Javanese, and Sundanese","Panji Arisaputra, Alif Tri Handoyo, Amalia Zahra","This research paper focuses on the development and evaluation of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology using the XLS-R 300m model. The study aims to improve ASR performance in converting spoken language into written text, specifically for Indonesian, Javanese, and Sundanese languages. The paper discusses the testing procedures, datasets used, and methodology employed in training and evaluating the ASR systems. The results show that the XLS-R 300m model achieves competitive Word Error Rate (WER) measurements, with a slight compromise in performance for Javanese and Sundanese languages. The integration of a 5-gram KenLM language model significantly reduces WER and enhances ASR accuracy. The research contributes to the advancement of ASR technology by addressing linguistic diversity and improving performance across various languages. The findings provide insights into optimizing ASR accuracy and applicability for diverse linguistic contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06832v1,2024-01
Lost in the Source Language: How Large Language Models Evaluate the Quality of Machine Translation,"Xu Huang, Zhirui Zhang, Xiang Geng, Yichao Du, Jiajun Chen, Shujian Huang","This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage source and reference data in machine translation evaluation task, aiming to better understand the mechanisms behind their remarkable performance in this task. We design the controlled experiments across various input modes and model types, and employ both coarse-grained and fine-grained prompts to discern the utility of source versus reference information. We find that reference information significantly enhances the evaluation accuracy, while surprisingly, source information sometimes is counterproductive, indicating LLMs' inability to fully leverage the cross-lingual capability when evaluating translations. Further analysis of the fine-grained evaluation and fine-tuning experiments show similar results. These findings also suggest a potential research direction for LLMs that fully exploits the cross-lingual capability of LLMs to achieve better performance in machine translation evaluation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06568v2,2024-01
Intention Analysis Makes LLMs A Good Jailbreak Defender,"Yuqi Zhang, Liang Ding, Lefei Zhang, Dacheng Tao","Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, particularly when facing complex and stealthy jailbreak attacks, presents a formidable challenge. Unfortunately, existing methods often overlook this intrinsic nature of jailbreaks, which limits their effectiveness in such complex scenarios. In this study, we present a simple yet highly effective defense strategy, i.e., Intention Analysis ($\mathbb{IA}$). $\mathbb{IA}$ works by triggering LLMs' inherent self-correct and improve ability through a two-stage process: 1) analyzing the essential intention of the user input, and 2) providing final policy-aligned responses based on the first round conversation. Notably, $\mathbb{IA}$ is an inference-only method, thus could enhance LLM safety without compromising their helpfulness. Extensive experiments on varying jailbreak benchmarks across a wide range of LLMs show that $\mathbb{IA}$ could consistently and significantly reduce the harmfulness in responses (averagely -48.2% attack success rate). Encouragingly, with our $\mathbb{IA}$, Vicuna-7B even outperforms GPT-3.5 regarding attack success rate. We empirically demonstrate that, to some extent, $\mathbb{IA}$ is robust to errors in generated intentions. Further analyses reveal the underlying principle of $\mathbb{IA}$: suppressing LLM's tendency to follow jailbreak prompts, thereby enhancing safety.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06561v4,2024-01
A systematic review of geospatial location embedding approaches in large language models: A path to spatial AI systems,Sean Tucker,"Geospatial Location Embedding (GLE) helps a Large Language Model (LLM) assimilate and analyze spatial data. GLE emergence in Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) is precipitated by the need for deeper geospatial awareness in our complex contemporary spaces and the success of LLMs in extracting deep meaning in Generative AI. We searched Google Scholar, Science Direct, and arXiv for papers on geospatial location embedding and LLM and reviewed articles focused on gaining deeper spatial ""knowing"" through LLMs. We screened 304 titles, 30 abstracts, and 18 full-text papers that reveal four GLE themes - Entity Location Embedding (ELE), Document Location Embedding (DLE), Sequence Location Embedding (SLE), and Token Location Embedding (TLE). Synthesis is tabular and narrative, including a dialogic conversation between ""Space"" and ""LLM."" Though GLEs aid spatial understanding by superimposing spatial data, they emphasize the need to advance in the intricacies of spatial modalities and generalized reasoning. GLEs signal the need for a Spatial Foundation/Language Model (SLM) that embeds spatial knowing within the model architecture. The SLM framework advances Spatial Artificial Intelligence Systems (SPAIS), establishing a Spatial Vector Space (SVS) that maps to physical space. The resulting spatially imbued Language Model is unique. It simultaneously represents actual space and an AI-capable space, paving the way for AI native geo storage, analysis, and multi-modality as the basis for Spatial Artificial Intelligence Systems (SPAIS).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10279v1,2024-01
Medical Dialogue Generation via Intuitive-then-Analytical Differential Diagnosis,"Kaishuai Xu, Wenjun Hou, Yi Cheng, Jian Wang, Wenjie Li","Medical dialogue systems have attracted growing research attention as they have the potential to provide rapid diagnoses, treatment plans, and health consultations. In medical dialogues, a proper diagnosis is crucial as it establishes the foundation for future consultations. Clinicians typically employ both intuitive and analytic reasoning to formulate a differential diagnosis. This reasoning process hypothesizes and verifies a variety of possible diseases and strives to generate a comprehensive and rigorous diagnosis. However, recent studies on medical dialogue generation have overlooked the significance of modeling a differential diagnosis, which hinders the practical application of these systems. To address the above issue, we propose a medical dialogue generation framework with the Intuitive-then-Analytic Differential Diagnosis (IADDx). Our method starts with a differential diagnosis via retrieval-based intuitive association and subsequently refines it through a graph-enhanced analytic procedure. The resulting differential diagnosis is then used to retrieve medical knowledge and guide response generation. Experimental results on two datasets validate the efficacy of our method. Besides, we demonstrate how our framework assists both clinicians and patients in understanding the diagnostic process, for instance, by producing intermediate results and graph-based diagnosis paths.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06541v1,2024-01
INTERS: Unlocking the Power of Large Language Models in Search with Instruction Tuning,"Yutao Zhu, Peitian Zhang, Chenghao Zhang, Yifei Chen, Binyu Xie, Zheng Liu, Ji-Rong Wen, Zhicheng Dou","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various natural language processing tasks. Despite this, their application to information retrieval (IR) tasks is still challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of many IR-specific concepts in natural language. While prompt-based methods can provide task descriptions to LLMs, they often fall short in facilitating a comprehensive understanding and execution of IR tasks, thereby limiting LLMs' applicability. To address this gap, in this work, we explore the potential of instruction tuning to enhance LLMs' proficiency in IR tasks. We introduce a novel instruction tuning dataset, INTERS, encompassing 20 tasks across three fundamental IR categories: query understanding, document understanding, and query-document relationship understanding. The data are derived from 43 distinct datasets with manually written templates. Our empirical results reveal that INTERS significantly boosts the performance of various publicly available LLMs, such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Phi, in IR tasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of instruction design, template diversity, few-shot demonstrations, and the volume of instructions on performance. We make our dataset and the fine-tuned models publicly accessible at https://github.com/DaoD/INTERS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06532v3,2024-01
MetaHate: A Dataset for Unifying Efforts on Hate Speech Detection,"Paloma Piot, Patricia Martín-Rodilla, Javier Parapar","Hate speech represents a pervasive and detrimental form of online discourse, often manifested through an array of slurs, from hateful tweets to defamatory posts. As such speech proliferates, it connects people globally and poses significant social, psychological, and occasionally physical threats to targeted individuals and communities. Current computational linguistic approaches for tackling this phenomenon rely on labelled social media datasets for training. For unifying efforts, our study advances in the critical need for a comprehensive meta-collection, advocating for an extensive dataset to help counteract this problem effectively. We scrutinized over 60 datasets, selectively integrating those pertinent into MetaHate. This paper offers a detailed examination of existing collections, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the existing datasets, paving the way for training more robust and adaptable models. These enhanced models are essential for effectively combating the dynamic and complex nature of hate speech in the digital realm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06526v1,2024-01
AntEval: Evaluation of Social Interaction Competencies in LLM-Driven Agents,"Yuanzhi Liang, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to replicate human behaviors across a wide range of scenarios. However, their capability in handling complex, multi-character social interactions has yet to be fully explored, primarily due to the absence of robust, quantitative evaluation methods. This gap has slowed the development of agents proficient in more nuanced interactions beyond simple exchanges, for example, small talk. To address this challenge, we introduce the Multi-Agent Interaction Evaluation Framework (AntEval), encompassing a novel interaction framework and evaluation methods. The interaction framework aims to foster an complex interaction environment that bolsters information exchange and intention expression within social interactions. Furthermore, we introduce evaluation methods, including two metrics: Information Exchanging Precision (IEP) and Interaction Expressiveness Gap (IEG), designed for the quantitative and objective assessment of agents' interaction competencies. Our findings highlight the utility of these evaluative methods and show significant potential for improving LLMs' ability to construct agents that interact in a more natural manner with human-like intricacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06509v3,2024-01
An investigation of structures responsible for gender bias in BERT and DistilBERT,"Thibaud Leteno, Antoine Gourru, Charlotte Laclau, Christophe Gravier","In recent years, large Transformer-based Pre-trained Language Models (PLM) have changed the Natural Language Processing (NLP) landscape, by pushing the performance boundaries of the state-of-the-art on a wide variety of tasks. However, this performance gain goes along with an increase in complexity, and as a result, the size of such models (up to billions of parameters) represents a constraint for their deployment on embedded devices or short-inference time tasks. To cope with this situation, compressed models emerged (e.g. DistilBERT), democratizing their usage in a growing number of applications that impact our daily lives. A crucial issue is the fairness of the predictions made by both PLMs and their distilled counterparts. In this paper, we propose an empirical exploration of this problem by formalizing two questions: (1) Can we identify the neural mechanism(s) responsible for gender bias in BERT (and by extension DistilBERT)? (2) Does distillation tend to accentuate or mitigate gender bias (e.g. is DistilBERT more prone to gender bias than its uncompressed version, BERT)? Our findings are the following: (I) one cannot identify a specific layer that produces bias; (II) every attention head uniformly encodes bias; except in the context of underrepresented classes with a high imbalance of the sensitive attribute; (III) this subset of heads is different as we re-fine tune the network; (IV) bias is more homogeneously produced by the heads in the distilled model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06495v1,2024-01

Frontier AI refers to the forefront of AI technology, encompassing the latest advancements, innovations, and experimental techniques in the field, especially AI foundation models and LLMs. Foundation models, like GPT-4, are large, general-purpose AI models that provide a base for a wide range of applications. They are characterized by their versatility and scalability. LLMs are obtained from finetuning foundation models with a specific focus on processing and generating natural language. They excel in tasks like language understanding, text generation, translation, and summarization. By leveraging vast textual data, including traffic reports and social media interactions, LLMs extract critical insights, fostering the evolution of ITS. The survey navigates the dynamic synergy between LLMs and ITS, delving into applications in traffic management, integration into autonomous vehicles, and their role in shaping smart cities. It provides insights into ongoing research, innovations, and emerging trends, aiming to inspire collaboration at the intersection of language, intelligence, and mobility for safer, more efficient, and sustainable transportation systems.

Kun: Answer Polishment for Chinese Self-Alignment with Instruction Back-Translation,"Tianyu Zheng, Shuyue Guo, Xingwei Qu, Jiawei Guo, Xinrun Du, Qi Jia, Chenghua Lin, Wenhao Huang, Jie Fu, Ge Zhang","In this paper, we introduce Kun, a novel approach for creating high-quality instruction-tuning datasets for large language models (LLMs) without relying on manual annotations. Adapting a self-training algorithm based on instruction back-translation and answer polishment, Kun leverages unlabelled data from diverse sources such as Wudao, Wanjuan, and SkyPile to generate a substantial dataset of over a million Chinese instructional data points. This approach significantly deviates from traditional methods by using a self-curation process to refine and select the most effective instruction-output pairs. Our experiments with the 6B-parameter Yi model across various benchmarks demonstrate Kun's robustness and scalability. Our method's core contributions lie in its algorithmic advancement, which enhances data retention and clarity, and its innovative data generation approach that substantially reduces the reliance on costly and time-consuming manual annotations. This methodology presents a scalable and efficient solution for improving the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs, with significant implications for their application across diverse fields.

Cross-Attention Watermarking of Large Language Models,"Folco Bertini Baldassini, Huy H. Nguyen, Ching-Chung Chang, Isao Echizen",A new approach to linguistic watermarking of language models is presented in which information is imperceptibly inserted into the output text while preserving its readability and original meaning. A cross-attention mechanism is used to embed watermarks in the text during inference. Two methods using cross-attention are presented that minimize the effect of watermarking on the performance of a pretrained model. Exploration of different training strategies for optimizing the watermarking and of the challenges and implications of applying this approach in real-world scenarios clarified the tradeoff between watermark robustness and text quality. Watermark selection substantially affects the generated output for high entropy sentences.

"Batch-ICL: Effective, Efficient, and Order-Agnostic In-Context Learning","Kaiyi Zhang, Ang Lv, Yuhan Chen, Hansen Ha, Tao Xu, Rui Yan","In this paper, by treating in-context learning (ICL) as a meta-optimization process, we explain why LLMs are sensitive to the order of ICL examples. This understanding leads us to the development of Batch-ICL, an effective, efficient, and order-agnostic inference algorithm for ICL. Differing from the standard N-shot learning approach, Batch-ICL employs $N$ separate 1-shot forward computations and aggregates the resulting meta-gradients. These aggregated meta-gradients are then applied to the forward computation of a zero-shot query to generate the final prediction. This batch processing approach renders the LLM agnostic to the order of ICL examples. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Batch-ICL consistently outperforms most permutations of ICL examples. In some cases, it even exceeds the performance of the best order for standard ICL, all while reducing the computational resources required. Furthermore, we develop a novel variant of Batch-ICL featuring multiple ""epochs"" of meta-optimization. This variant implicitly explores permutations of ICL examples, further enhancing ICL performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06469v3,2024-01
Adapting Large Language Models for Document-Level Machine Translation,"Minghao Wu, Thuy-Trang Vu, Lizhen Qu, George Foster, Gholamreza Haffari","Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Recent research indicates that moderately-sized LLMs often outperform larger ones after task-specific fine-tuning. This study focuses on adapting LLMs for document-level machine translation (DocMT) for specific language pairs. We first investigate the impact of prompt strategies on translation performance and then conduct extensive experiments using two fine-tuning methods, three LLM backbones, and 18 translation tasks across nine language pairs. Our results show that specialized models can sometimes surpass GPT-4 in translation performance but still face issues like off-target translation due to error propagation in decoding. We provide an in-depth analysis of these LLMs tailored for DocMT, examining translation errors, discourse phenomena, strategies for training and inference, the data efficiency of parallel documents, recent test set evaluations, and zero-shot crosslingual transfer. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLM-based DocMT models and provide a foundation for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06468v4,2024-01

Between Lines of Code: Unraveling the Distinct Patterns of Machine and Human Programmers,"Yuling Shi, Hongyu Zhang, Chengcheng Wan, Xiaodong Gu","Large language models have catalyzed an unprecedented wave in code generation. While achieving significant advances, they blur the distinctions between machine- and human-authored source code, causing integrity and authenticity issues of software artifacts. Previous methods such as DetectGPT have proven effective in discerning machine-generated texts, but they do not identify and harness the unique patterns of machine-generated code. Thus, its applicability falters when applied to code. In this paper, we carefully study the specific patterns that characterize machine- and human-authored code. Through a rigorous analysis of code attributes such as lexical diversity, conciseness, and naturalness, we expose unique patterns inherent to each source. We particularly notice that the syntactic segmentation of code is a critical factor in identifying its provenance. Based on our findings, we propose DetectCodeGPT, a novel method for detecting machine-generated code, which improves DetectGPT by capturing the distinct stylized patterns of code. Diverging from conventional techniques that depend on external LLMs for perturbations, DetectCodeGPT perturbs the code corpus by strategically inserting spaces and newlines, ensuring both efficacy and efficiency. Experiment results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detecting machine-generated code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06461v5,2024-01

Accordingly, we propose a bilingual outside-knowledge VQA (BOK-VQA) dataset in this study that can be extended to multilingualism. The proposed data include 17K images, 17K question-answer pairs for both Korean and English and 280K instances of knowledge information related to question-answer content. We also present a framework that can effectively inject knowledge information into a VQA system by pretraining the knowledge information of BOK-VQA data in the form of graph embeddings.

Human-AI Collaborative Essay Scoring: A Dual-Process Framework with LLMs,"Changrong Xiao, Wenxing Ma, Qingping Song, Sean Xin Xu, Kunpeng Zhang, Yufang Wang, Qi Fu","Receiving timely and personalized feedback is essential for second-language learners, especially when human instructors are unavailable. This study explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), including both proprietary and open-source models, for Automated Essay Scoring (AES). Through extensive experiments with public and private datasets, we find that while LLMs do not surpass conventional state-of-the-art (SOTA) grading models in performance, they exhibit notable consistency, generalizability, and explainability. We propose an open-source LLM-based AES system, inspired by the dual-process theory. Our system offers accurate grading and high-quality feedback, at least comparable to that of fine-tuned proprietary LLMs, in addition to its ability to alleviate misgrading. Furthermore, we conduct human-AI co-grading experiments with both novice and expert graders. We find that our system not only automates the grading process but also enhances the performance and efficiency of human graders, particularly for essays where the model has lower confidence. These results highlight the potential of LLMs to facilitate effective human-AI collaboration in the educational context, potentially transforming learning experiences through AI-generated feedback.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06431v2,2024-01
Mission: Impossible Language Models,"Julie Kallini, Isabel Papadimitriou, Richard Futrell, Kyle Mahowald, Christopher Potts","Chomsky and others have very directly claimed that large language models (LLMs) are equally capable of learning languages that are possible and impossible for humans to learn. However, there is very little published experimental evidence to support such a claim. Here, we develop a set of synthetic impossible languages of differing complexity, each designed by systematically altering English data with unnatural word orders and grammar rules. These languages lie on an impossibility continuum: at one end are languages that are inherently impossible, such as random and irreversible shuffles of English words, and on the other, languages that may not be intuitively impossible but are often considered so in linguistics, particularly those with rules based on counting word positions. We report on a wide range of evaluations to assess the capacity of GPT-2 small models to learn these uncontroversially impossible languages, and crucially, we perform these assessments at various stages throughout training to compare the learning process for each language. Our core finding is that GPT-2 struggles to learn impossible languages when compared to English as a control, challenging the core claim. More importantly, we hope our approach opens up a productive line of inquiry in which different LLM architectures are tested on a variety of impossible languages in an effort to learn more about how LLMs can be used as tools for these cognitive and typological investigations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06416v2,2024-01
AboutMe: Using Self-Descriptions in Webpages to Document the Effects of English Pretraining Data Filters,"Li Lucy, Suchin Gururangan, Luca Soldaini, Emma Strubell, David Bamman, Lauren F. Klein, Jesse Dodge","Large language models' (LLMs) abilities are drawn from their pretraining data, and model development begins with data curation. However, decisions around what data is retained or removed during this initial stage are under-scrutinized. In our work, we ground web text, which is a popular pretraining data source, to its social and geographic contexts. We create a new dataset of 10.3 million self-descriptions of website creators, and extract information about who they are and where they are from: their topical interests, social roles, and geographic affiliations. Then, we conduct the first study investigating how ten ""quality"" and English language identification (langID) filters affect webpages that vary along these social dimensions. Our experiments illuminate a range of implicit preferences in data curation: we show that some quality classifiers act like topical domain filters, and langID can overlook English content from some regions of the world. Overall, we hope that our work will encourage a new line of research on pretraining data curation practices and its social implications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06408v3,2024-01
DevEval: Evaluating Code Generation in Practical Software Projects,"Jia Li, Ge Li, Yunfei Zhao, Yongmin Li, Zhi Jin, Hao Zhu, Huanyu Liu, Kaibo Liu, Lecheng Wang, Zheng Fang, Lanshen Wang, Jiazheng Ding, Xuanming Zhang, Yihong Dong, Yuqi Zhu, Bin Gu, Mengfei Yang","How to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation is an open question. Many benchmarks have been proposed but are inconsistent with practical software projects, e.g., unreal program distributions, insufficient dependencies, and small-scale project contexts. Thus, the capabilities of LLMs in practical projects are still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark named DevEval, aligned with Developers' experiences in practical projects. DevEval is collected through a rigorous pipeline, containing 2,690 samples from 119 practical projects and covering 10 domains. Compared to previous benchmarks, DevEval aligns to practical projects in multiple dimensions, e.g., real program distributions, sufficient dependencies, and enough-scale project contexts. We assess five popular LLMs on DevEval (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, CodeLLaMa, and StarCoder) and reveal their actual abilities in code generation. For instance, the highest Pass@1 of gpt-3.5-turbo only is 42 in our experiments. We also discuss the challenges and future directions of code generation in practical projects. We open-source DevEval and hope it can facilitate the development of code generation in practical projects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06401v4,2024-01
Generalizing Visual Question Answering from Synthetic to Human-Written Questions via a Chain of QA with a Large Language Model,"Taehee Kim, Yeongjae Cho, Heejun Shin, Yohan Jo, Dongmyung Shin","Visual question answering (VQA) is a task where an image is given, and a series of questions are asked about the image. To build an efficient VQA algorithm, a large amount of QA data is required which is very expensive. Generating synthetic QA pairs based on templates is a practical way to obtain data. However, VQA models trained on those data do not perform well on complex, human-written questions. To address this issue, we propose a new method called {\it chain of QA for human-written questions} (CoQAH). CoQAH utilizes a sequence of QA interactions between a large language model and a VQA model trained on synthetic data to reason and derive logical answers for human-written questions. We tested the effectiveness of CoQAH on two types of human-written VQA datasets for 3D-rendered and chest X-ray images and found that it achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in both types of data. Notably, CoQAH outperformed general vision-language models, VQA models, and medical foundation models with no finetuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06400v3,2024-01
An approach for mistranslation removal from popular dataset for Indic MT Task,"Sudhansu Bala Das, Leo Raphael Rodrigues, Tapas Kumar Mishra, Bidyut Kr. Patra","The conversion of content from one language to another utilizing a computer system is known as Machine Translation (MT). Various techniques have come up to ensure effective translations that retain the contextual and lexical interpretation of the source language. End-to-end Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a popular technique and it is now widely used in real-world MT systems. Massive amounts of parallel datasets (sentences in one language alongside translations in another) are required for MT systems. These datasets are crucial for an MT system to learn linguistic structures and patterns of both languages during the training phase. One such dataset is Samanantar, the largest publicly accessible parallel dataset for Indian languages (ILs). Since the corpus has been gathered from various sources, it contains many incorrect translations. Hence, the MT systems built using this dataset cannot perform to their usual potential. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to remove mistranslations from the training corpus and evaluate its performance and efficiency. Two Indic languages (ILs), namely, Hindi (HIN) and Odia (ODI) are chosen for the experiment. A baseline NMT system is built for these two ILs, and the effect of different dataset sizes is also investigated. The quality of the translations in the experiment is evaluated using standard metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and RIBES. From the results, it is observed that removing the incorrect translation from the dataset makes the translation quality better. It is also noticed that, despite the fact that the ILs-English and English-ILs systems are trained using the same corpus, ILs-English works more effectively across all the evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06398v1,2024-01
Adaptive Data Augmentation for Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction,"Wenyuan Zhang, Xinghua Zhang, Shiyao Cui, Kun Huang, Xuebin Wang, Tingwen Liu","Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) aims to predict the quad sentiment elements for a given sentence, which is a critical task in the field of aspect-based sentiment analysis. However, the data imbalance issue has not received sufficient attention in ASQP task. In this paper, we divide the issue into two-folds, quad-pattern imbalance and aspect-category imbalance, and propose an Adaptive Data Augmentation (ADA) framework to tackle the imbalance issue. Specifically, a data augmentation process with a condition function adaptively enhances the tail quad patterns and aspect categories, alleviating the data imbalance in ASQP. Following previous studies, we also further explore the generative framework for extracting complete quads by introducing the category prior knowledge and syntax-guided decoding target. Experimental results demonstrate that data augmentation for imbalance in ASQP task can improve the performance, and the proposed ADA method is superior to naive data oversampling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06394v1,2024-01
What should I say? -- Interacting with AI and Natural Language Interfaces,Mark Adkins,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology becomes more and more prevalent, it becomes increasingly important to explore how we as humans interact with AI. The Human-AI Interaction (HAI) sub-field has emerged from the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field and aims to examine this very notion. Many interaction patterns have been implemented without fully understanding the changes in required cognition as well as the cognitive science implications of using these alternative interfaces that aim to be more human-like in nature. Prior research suggests that theory of mind representations are crucial to successful and effortless communication, however very little is understood when it comes to how theory of mind representations are established when interacting with AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06382v1,2024-01
APLe: Token-Wise Adaptive for Multi-Modal Prompt Learning,"Guiming Cao, Kaize Shi, Hong Fu, Huaiwen Zhang, Guandong Xu","Pre-trained Vision-Language (V-L) models set the benchmark for generalization to downstream tasks among the noteworthy contenders. Many characteristics of the V-L model have been explored in existing research including the challenge of the sensitivity to text input and the tuning process across multi-modal prompts. With the advanced utilization of the V-L model like CLIP, recent approaches deploy learnable prompts instead of hand-craft prompts to boost the generalization performance and address the aforementioned challenges. Inspired by layer-wise training, which is wildly used in image fusion, we note that using a sequential training process to adapt different modalities branches of CLIP efficiently facilitates the improvement of generalization. In the context of addressing the multi-modal prompting challenge, we propose Token-wise Adaptive for Multi-modal Prompt Learning (APLe) for tuning both modalities prompts, vision and language, as tokens in a sequential manner. APLe addresses the challenges in V-L models to promote prompt learning across both modalities, which indicates a competitive generalization performance in line with the state-of-the-art. Preeminently, APLe shows robustness and favourable performance in prompt-length experiments with an absolute advantage in adopting the V-L models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06827v2,2024-01
Learning from Semi-Factuals: A Debiased and Semantic-Aware Framework for Generalized Relation Discovery,"Jiaxin Wang, Lingling Zhang, Jun Liu, Tianlin Guo, Wenjun Wu","We introduce a novel task, called Generalized Relation Discovery (GRD), for open-world relation extraction. GRD aims to identify unlabeled instances in existing pre-defined relations or discover novel relations by assigning instances to clusters as well as providing specific meanings for these clusters. The key challenges of GRD are how to mitigate the serious model biases caused by labeled pre-defined relations to learn effective relational representations and how to determine the specific semantics of novel relations during classifying or clustering unlabeled instances. We then propose a novel framework, SFGRD, for this task to solve the above issues by learning from semi-factuals in two stages. The first stage is semi-factual generation implemented by a tri-view debiased relation representation module, in which we take each original sentence as the main view and design two debiased views to generate semi-factual examples for this sentence. The second stage is semi-factual thinking executed by a dual-space tri-view collaborative relation learning module, where we design a cluster-semantic space and a class-index space to learn relational semantics and relation label indices, respectively. In addition, we devise alignment and selection strategies to integrate two spaces and establish a self-supervised learning loop for unlabeled data by doing semi-factual thinking across three views. Extensive experimental results show that SFGRD surpasses state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy by 2.36\% $\sim$5.78\% and cosine similarity by 32.19\%$\sim$ 84.45\% for relation label index and relation semantic quality, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit the efficacy of semi-factuals in relation extraction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06327v1,2024-01
Multi-Task Learning for Front-End Text Processing in TTS,"Wonjune Kang, Yun Wang, Shun Zhang, Arthur Hinsvark, Qing He","We propose a multi-task learning (MTL) model for jointly performing three tasks that are commonly solved in a text-to-speech (TTS) front-end: text normalization (TN), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and homograph disambiguation (HD). Our framework utilizes a tree-like structure with a trunk that learns shared representations, followed by separate task-specific heads. We further incorporate a pre-trained language model to utilize its built-in lexical and contextual knowledge, and study how to best use its embeddings so as to most effectively benefit our multi-task model. Through task-wise ablations, we show that our full model trained on all three tasks achieves the strongest overall performance compared to models trained on individual or sub-combinations of tasks, confirming the advantages of our MTL framework. Finally, we introduce a new HD dataset containing a balanced number of sentences in diverse contexts for a variety of homographs and their pronunciations. We demonstrate that incorporating this dataset into training significantly improves HD performance over only using a commonly used, but imbalanced, pre-existing dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06321v1,2024-01
Zero-shot Generative Large Language Models for Systematic Review Screening Automation,"Shuai Wang, Harrisen Scells, Shengyao Zhuang, Martin Potthast, Bevan Koopman, Guido Zuccon","Systematic reviews are crucial for evidence-based medicine as they comprehensively analyse published research findings on specific questions. Conducting such reviews is often resource- and time-intensive, especially in the screening phase, where abstracts of publications are assessed for inclusion in a review. This study investigates the effectiveness of using zero-shot large language models~(LLMs) for automatic screening. We evaluate the effectiveness of eight different LLMs and investigate a calibration technique that uses a predefined recall threshold to determine whether a publication should be included in a systematic review. Our comprehensive evaluation using five standard test collections shows that instruction fine-tuning plays an important role in screening, that calibration renders LLMs practical for achieving a targeted recall, and that combining both with an ensemble of zero-shot models saves significant screening time compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06320v2,2024-01
Revisiting Jailbreaking for Large Language Models: A Representation Engineering Perspective,"Tianlong Li, Zhenghua Wang, Wenhao Liu, Muling Wu, Shihan Dou, Changze Lv, Xiaohua Wang, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang","The recent surge in jailbreaking attacks has revealed significant vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) when exposed to malicious inputs. While various defense strategies have been proposed to mitigate these threats, there has been limited research into the underlying mechanisms that make LLMs vulnerable to such attacks. In this study, we suggest that the self-safeguarding capability of LLMs is linked to specific activity patterns within their representation space. Although these patterns have little impact on the semantic content of the generated text, they play a crucial role in shaping LLM behavior under jailbreaking attacks. Our findings demonstrate that these patterns can be detected with just a few pairs of contrastive queries. Extensive experimentation shows that the robustness of LLMs against jailbreaking can be manipulated by weakening or strengthening these patterns. Further visual analysis provides additional evidence for our conclusions, providing new insights into the jailbreaking phenomenon. These findings highlight the importance of addressing the potential misuse of open-source LLMs within the community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06824v4,2024-01
ViSAGe: A Global-Scale Analysis of Visual Stereotypes in Text-to-Image Generation,"Akshita Jha, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran, Remi Denton, Sarah Laszlo, Shachi Dave, Rida Qadri, Chandan K. Reddy, Sunipa Dev","Recent studies have shown that Text-to-Image (T2I) model generations can reflect social stereotypes present in the real world. However, existing approaches for evaluating stereotypes have a noticeable lack of coverage of global identity groups and their associated stereotypes. To address this gap, we introduce the ViSAGe (Visual Stereotypes Around the Globe) dataset to enable the evaluation of known nationality-based stereotypes in T2I models, across 135 nationalities. We enrich an existing textual stereotype resource by distinguishing between stereotypical associations that are more likely to have visual depictions, such as `sombrero', from those that are less visually concrete, such as 'attractive'. We demonstrate ViSAGe's utility through a multi-faceted evaluation of T2I generations. First, we show that stereotypical attributes in ViSAGe are thrice as likely to be present in generated images of corresponding identities as compared to other attributes, and that the offensiveness of these depictions is especially higher for identities from Africa, South America, and South East Asia. Second, we assess the stereotypical pull of visual depictions of identity groups, which reveals how the 'default' representations of all identity groups in ViSAGe have a pull towards stereotypical depictions, and that this pull is even more prominent for identity groups from the Global South. CONTENT WARNING: Some examples contain offensive stereotypes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06310v3,2024-01
Misconfidence-based Demonstration Selection for LLM In-Context Learning,"Shangqing Xu, Chao Zhang","In-context learning with large language models (LLMs) excels at adapting to various tasks rapidly. However, its success hinges on carefully selecting demonstrations, which remains an obstacle in practice. Current approaches to this problem either rely on hard-to-acquire external supervision or require frequent interactions with LLMs, resulting in high costs. We propose a new method called In-Context Reflection (ICR) to overcome these challenges. ICR strategically selects demonstrations to reduce the discrepancy between the LLM's outputs and the actual input-output mappings. Specifically, ICR starts with a random set of initial demonstrations, then iteratively refines it. In each step, it analyzes a pool of candidate examples and identifies the ones most likely to challenge the LLM's current understanding, measured by a new metric called misconfidence. These most confusing examples are then selected to replace the less informative demonstrations in the current set. Our comprehensive evaluation across five diverse datasets encompassing 13 subtasks shows the efficacy of ICR. Compared to existing methods, ICR achieves an average performance boost of 4%, while demonstrating remarkable cross-task generalization capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06301v1,2024-01
Uncertainty Awareness of Large Language Models Under Code Distribution Shifts: A Benchmark Study,"Yufei Li, Simin Chen, Yanghong Guo, Wei Yang, Yue Dong, Cong Liu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in programming language analysis to enhance human productivity. Yet, their reliability can be compromised by various code distribution shifts, leading to inconsistent outputs. While probabilistic methods are known to mitigate such impact through uncertainty calibration and estimation, their efficacy in the language domain remains underexplored compared to their application in image-based tasks. In this work, we first introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset, incorporating three realistic patterns of code distribution shifts at varying intensities. Then we thoroughly investigate state-of-the-art probabilistic methods applied to CodeLlama using these shifted code snippets. We observe that these methods generally improve the uncertainty awareness of CodeLlama, with increased calibration quality and higher uncertainty estimation~(UE) precision. However, our study further reveals varied performance dynamics across different criteria (e.g., calibration error vs misclassification detection) and trade-off between efficacy and efficiency, highlighting necessary methodological selection tailored to specific contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05939v1,2024-01

Learning Unsupervised Semantic Document Representation for Fine-grained Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Hao-Ming Fu, Pu-Jen Cheng","Document representation is the core of many NLP tasks on machine understanding. A general representation learned in an unsupervised manner reserves generality and can be used for various applications. In practice, sentiment analysis (SA) has been a challenging task that is regarded to be deeply semantic-related and is often used to assess general representations. Existing methods on unsupervised document representation learning can be separated into two families: sequential ones, which explicitly take the ordering of words into consideration, and non-sequential ones, which do not explicitly do so. However, both of them suffer from their own weaknesses. In this paper, we propose a model that overcomes difficulties encountered by both families of methods. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular SA datasets and a fine-grained aspect-based SA by a large margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06210v1,2024-01
TOFU: A Task of Fictitious Unlearning for LLMs,"Pratyush Maini, Zhili Feng, Avi Schwarzschild, Zachary C. Lipton, J. Zico Kolter","Large language models trained on massive corpora of data from the web can memorize and reproduce sensitive or private data raising both legal and ethical concerns. Unlearning, or tuning models to forget information present in their training data, provides us with a way to protect private data after training. Although several methods exist for such unlearning, it is unclear to what extent they result in models equivalent to those where the data to be forgotten was never learned in the first place. To address this challenge, we present TOFU, a Task of Fictitious Unlearning, as a benchmark aimed at helping deepen our understanding of unlearning. We offer a dataset of 200 diverse synthetic author profiles, each consisting of 20 question-answer pairs, and a subset of these profiles called the forget set that serves as the target for unlearning. We compile a suite of metrics that work together to provide a holistic picture of unlearning efficacy. Finally, we provide a set of baseline results from existing unlearning algorithms. Importantly, none of the baselines we consider show effective unlearning motivating continued efforts to develop approaches for unlearning that effectively tune models so that they truly behave as if they were never trained on the forget data at all.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06121v1,2024-01
Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization,"Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh","The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of ""extreme"" LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06118v4,2024-01
Axis Tour: Word Tour Determines the Order of Axes in ICA-transformed Embeddings,"Hiroaki Yamagiwa, Yusuke Takase, Hidetoshi Shimodaira","Word embedding is one of the most important components in natural language processing, but interpreting high-dimensional embeddings remains a challenging problem. To address this problem, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is identified as an effective solution. ICA-transformed word embeddings reveal interpretable semantic axes; however, the order of these axes are arbitrary. In this study, we focus on this property and propose a novel method, Axis Tour, which optimizes the order of the axes.

PALP: Prompt Aligned Personalization of Text-to-Image Models,"Moab Arar, Andrey Voynov, Amir Hertz, Omri Avrahami, Shlomi Fruchter, Yael Pritch, Daniel Cohen-Or, Ariel Shamir","Content creators often aim to create personalized images using personal subjects that go beyond the capabilities of conventional text-to-image models. Additionally, they may want the resulting image to encompass a specific location, style, ambiance, and more. Existing personalization methods may compromise personalization ability or the alignment to complex textual prompts. This trade-off can impede the fulfillment of user prompts and subject fidelity. We propose a new approach focusing on personalization methods for a \emph{single} prompt to address this issue. We term our approach prompt-aligned personalization. While this may seem restrictive, our method excels in improving text alignment, enabling the creation of images with complex and intricate prompts, which may pose a challenge for current techniques. In particular, our method keeps the personalized model aligned with a target prompt using an additional score distillation sampling term. We demonstrate the versatility of our method in multi- and single-shot settings and further show that it can compose multiple subjects or use inspiration from reference images, such as artworks. We compare our approach quantitatively and qualitatively with existing baselines and state-of-the-art techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06105v1,2024-01
Transformers are Multi-State RNNs,"Matanel Oren, Michael Hassid, Nir Yarden, Yossi Adi, Roy Schwartz","Transformers are considered conceptually different from the previous generation of state-of-the-art NLP models - recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this work, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers can in fact be conceptualized as unbounded multi-state RNNs - an RNN variant with unlimited hidden state size. We further show that transformers can be converted into $\textit{bounded}$ multi-state RNNs by fixing the size of their hidden state, effectively compressing their key-value cache. We introduce a novel, training-free compression policy - $\textbf{T}$oken $\textbf{O}$mission $\textbf{V}$ia $\textbf{A}$ttention (TOVA). Our experiments with four long range tasks and several LLMs show that TOVA outperforms several baseline compression policies. Particularly, our results are nearly on par with the full model, using in some cases only $\frac{1}{8}$ of the original cache size, which translates to 4.8X higher throughput. Our results shed light on the connection between transformers and RNNs, and help mitigate one of LLMs' most painful computational bottlenecks - the size of their key-value cache.

Patchscopes: A Unifying Framework for Inspecting Hidden Representations of Language Models,"Asma Ghandeharioun, Avi Caciularu, Adam Pearce, Lucas Dixon, Mor Geva","Understanding the internal representations of large language models (LLMs) can help explain models' behavior and verify their alignment with human values. Given the capabilities of LLMs in generating human-understandable text, we propose leveraging the model itself to explain its internal representations in natural language. We introduce a framework called Patchscopes and show how it can be used to answer a wide range of questions about an LLM's computation. We show that many prior interpretability methods based on projecting representations into the vocabulary space and intervening on the LLM computation can be viewed as instances of this framework. Moreover, several of their shortcomings such as failure in inspecting early layers or lack of expressivity can be mitigated by Patchscopes. Beyond unifying prior inspection techniques, Patchscopes also opens up new possibilities such as using a more capable model to explain the representations of a smaller model, and multihop reasoning error correction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06102v4,2024-01
Autocompletion of Chief Complaints in the Electronic Health Records using Large Language Models,"K M Sajjadul Islam, Ayesha Siddika Nipu, Praveen Madiraju, Priya Deshpande","The Chief Complaint (CC) is a crucial component of a patient's medical record as it describes the main reason or concern for seeking medical care. It provides critical information for healthcare providers to make informed decisions about patient care. However, documenting CCs can be time-consuming for healthcare providers, especially in busy emergency departments. To address this issue, an autocompletion tool that suggests accurate and well-formatted phrases or sentences for clinical notes can be a valuable resource for triage nurses. In this study, we utilized text generation techniques to develop machine learning models using CC data. In our proposed work, we train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and fine-tune three different variants of Biomedical Generative Pretrained Transformers (BioGPT), namely microsoft/biogpt, microsoft/BioGPT-Large, and microsoft/BioGPT-Large-PubMedQA. Additionally, we tune a prompt by incorporating exemplar CC sentences, utilizing the OpenAI API of GPT-4. We evaluate the models' performance based on the perplexity score, modified BERTScore, and cosine similarity score. The results show that BioGPT-Large exhibits superior performance compared to the other models. It consistently achieves a remarkably low perplexity score of 1.65 when generating CC, whereas the baseline LSTM model achieves the best perplexity score of 170. Further, we evaluate and assess the proposed models' performance and the outcome of GPT-4.0. Our study demonstrates that utilizing LLMs such as BioGPT, leads to the development of an effective autocompletion tool for generating CC documentation in healthcare settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06088v1,2024-01
Improving Large Language Models via Fine-grained Reinforcement Learning with Minimum Editing Constraint,"Zhipeng Chen, Kun Zhou, Wayne Xin Zhao, Junchen Wan, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen","Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in training large language models (LLMs) for preventing unexpected outputs, eg reducing harmfulness and errors. However, existing RL methods mostly adopt the instance-level reward, which is unable to provide fine-grained supervision for complex reasoning tasks, and can not focus on the few key tokens that lead to the incorrectness. To address it, we propose a new RL method named RLMEC that incorporates a generative model as the reward model, which is trained by the erroneous solution rewriting task under the minimum editing constraint, and can produce token-level rewards for RL training. Based on the generative reward model, we design the token-level RL objective for training and an imitation-based regularization for stabilizing RL process. And the both objectives focus on the learning of the key tokens for the erroneous solution, reducing the effect of other unimportant tokens.

In terms of graph modality, we underscore the LLMs' prowess in discerning the structural information of pivotal nodes within the historical chain. As for the generation mode of the LLMs utilized for inference, we conduct an exhaustive exploration into the variances induced by a range of inherent factors in LLMs, with particular attention to the challenges in comprehending reverse logic. We adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy to harmonize the LLMs with the task requirements, facilitating the learning of the key knowledge highlighted earlier. Comprehensive experiments are undertaken on several widely recognized datasets, revealing that our framework exceeds or parallels existing methods across numerous popular metrics.

GroundingGPT:Language Enhanced Multi-modal Grounding Model,"Zhaowei Li, Qi Xu, Dong Zhang, Hang Song, Yiqing Cai, Qi Qi, Ran Zhou, Junting Pan, Zefeng Li, Van Tu Vu, Zhida Huang, Tao Wang","Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks in different modalities. However, existing multi-modal models primarily emphasize capturing global information within each modality while neglecting the importance of perceiving local information across modalities. Consequently, these models lack the ability to effectively understand the fine-grained details of input data, limiting their performance in tasks that require a more nuanced understanding. To address this limitation, there is a compelling need to develop models that enable fine-grained understanding across multiple modalities, thereby enhancing their applicability to a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose GroundingGPT, a language enhanced multi-modal grounding model. Beyond capturing global information like other multi-modal models, our proposed model excels at tasks demanding a detailed understanding of local information within the input.

To achieve this objective, we design a diversified dataset construction pipeline, resulting in a multi-modal, multi-granularity dataset for model training.

DeepSeekMoE: Towards Ultimate Expert Specialization in Mixture-of-Experts Language Models,"Damai Dai, Chengqi Deng, Chenggang Zhao, R. X. Xu, Huazuo Gao, Deli Chen, Jiashi Li, Wangding Zeng, Xingkai Yu, Y. Wu, Zhenda Xie, Y. K. Li, Panpan Huang, Fuli Luo, Chong Ruan, Zhifang Sui, Wenfeng Liang","In the era of large language models, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a promising architecture for managing computational costs when scaling up model parameters. However, conventional MoE architectures like GShard, which activate the top-$K$ out of $N$ experts, face challenges in ensuring expert specialization, i.e. each expert acquires non-overlapping and focused knowledge. In response, we propose the DeepSeekMoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It involves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into $mN$ ones and activating $mK$ from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of activated experts; (2) isolating $K_s$ experts as shared ones, aiming at capturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts. Starting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that DeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5 times the expert parameters and computation. In addition, DeepSeekMoE 2B nearly approaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of total parameters, which set the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we scale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40% of computations. Further, our preliminary efforts to scale up DeepSeekMoE to 145B parameters consistently validate its substantial advantages over the GShard architecture, and show its performance comparable with DeepSeek 67B, using only 28.5% (maybe even 18.2%) of computations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06066v1,2024-01
Investigating Data Contamination for Pre-training Language Models,"Minhao Jiang, Ken Ziyu Liu, Ming Zhong, Rylan Schaeffer, Siru Ouyang, Jiawei Han, Sanmi Koyejo","Language models pre-trained on web-scale corpora demonstrate impressive capabilities on diverse downstream tasks. However, there is increasing concern whether such capabilities might arise from evaluation datasets being included in the pre-training corpus -- a phenomenon known as \textit{data contamination} -- in a manner that artificially increases performance. There has been little understanding of how this potential contamination might influence LMs' performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the impact of data contamination at the pre-training stage by pre-training a series of GPT-2 models \textit{from scratch}. We highlight the effect of both text contamination (\textit{i.e.}\ input text of the evaluation samples) and ground-truth contamination (\textit{i.e.}\ the prompts asked on the input and the desired outputs) from evaluation data. We also investigate the effects of repeating contamination for various downstream tasks. Additionally, we examine the prevailing n-gram-based definitions of contamination within current LLM reports, pinpointing their limitations and inadequacy. Our findings offer new insights into data contamination's effects on language model capabilities and underscore the need for independent, comprehensive contamination assessments in LLM studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06059v1,2024-01
LinguAlchemy: Fusing Typological and Geographical Elements for Unseen Language Generalization,"Muhammad Farid Adilazuarda, Samuel Cahyawijaya, Alham Fikri Aji, Genta Indra Winata, Ayu Purwarianti","Pretrained language models (PLMs) have become remarkably adept at task and language generalization. Nonetheless, they often fail when faced with unseen languages. In this work, we present LinguAlchemy, a regularization method that incorporates various linguistic information covering typological, geographical, and phylogenetic features to align PLMs representation to the corresponding linguistic information on each language. Our LinguAlchemy significantly improves the performance of mBERT and XLM-R on low-resource languages in multiple downstream tasks such as intent classification, news classification, and semantic relatedness compared to fully finetuned models and displaying a high degree of unseen language generalization. We further introduce AlchemyScale and AlchemyTune, extension of LinguAlchemy which adjusts the linguistic regularization weights automatically, alleviating the need for hyperparameter search.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06034v6,2024-01
Analyzing Regional Impacts of Climate Change using Natural Language Processing Techniques,"Tanwi Mallick, John Murphy, Joshua David Bergerson, Duane R. Verner, John K Hutchison, Leslie-Anne Levy","Understanding the multifaceted effects of climate change across diverse geographic locations is crucial for timely adaptation and the development of effective mitigation strategies. As the volume of scientific literature on this topic continues to grow exponentially, manually reviewing these documents has become an immensely challenging task. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze this wealth of information presents an efficient and scalable solution. By gathering extensive amounts of peer-reviewed articles and studies, we can extract and process critical information about the effects of climate change in specific regions. We employ BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for Named Entity Recognition (NER), which enables us to efficiently identify specific geographies within the climate literature. This, in turn, facilitates location-specific analyses. We conduct region-specific climate trend analyses to pinpoint the predominant themes or concerns related to climate change within a particular area, trace the temporal progression of these identified issues, and evaluate their frequency, severity, and potential development over time. These in-depth examinations of location-specific climate data enable the creation of more customized policy-making, adaptation, and mitigation strategies, addressing each region's unique challenges and providing more effective solutions rooted in data-driven insights. This approach, founded on a thorough exploration of scientific texts, offers actionable insights to a wide range of stakeholders, from policymakers to engineers to environmentalists. By proactively understanding these impacts, societies are better positioned to prepare, allocate resources wisely, and design tailored strategies to cope with future climate conditions, ensuring a more resilient future for all.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06817v1,2024-01
When ChatGPT is gone: Creativity reverts and homogeneity persists,"Qinghan Liu, Yiyong Zhou, Jihao Huang, Guiquan Li","ChatGPT has been evidenced to enhance human performance in creative tasks. Yet, it is still unclear if this boosting effect sustains with and without ChatGPT. In a pre-registered seven-day lab experiment and a follow-up survey after 30 days of experiment completion, we examined the impacts of ChatGPT presence and absence on sustained creativity using a text dataset of 3302 creative ideas and 427 creative solutions from 61 college students. Participants in the treatment group used ChatGPT in creative tasks, while those in the control group completed the tasks by themselves. The findings show that although the boosting effect of ChatGPT was consistently observed over a five-day creative journey, human creative performance reverted to baseline when ChatGPT was down on the 7th and the 30th day. More critically, the use of ChatGPT in creative tasks resulted in increasingly homogenized contents, and this homogenization effect persisted even when ChatGPT was absence. These findings pose a challenge to the prevailing argument that ChatGPT can enhance human creativity. In fact, generative AI like ChatGPT lends to human with a temporary rise in creative performance but boxes human creative capability in the long run, highlighting the imperative for cautious generative AI integration in creative endeavors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06816v1,2024-01
Combating Adversarial Attacks with Multi-Agent Debate,"Steffi Chern, Zhen Fan, Andy Liu","While state-of-the-art language models have achieved impressive results, they remain susceptible to inference-time adversarial attacks, such as adversarial prompts generated by red teams arXiv:2209.07858. One approach proposed to improve the general quality of language model generations is multi-agent debate, where language models self-evaluate through discussion and feedback arXiv:2305.14325. We implement multi-agent debate between current state-of-the-art language models and evaluate models' susceptibility to red team attacks in both single- and multi-agent settings. We find that multi-agent debate can reduce model toxicity when jailbroken or less capable models are forced to debate with non-jailbroken or more capable models. We also find marginal improvements through the general usage of multi-agent interactions. We further perform adversarial prompt content classification via embedding clustering, and analyze the susceptibility of different models to different types of attack topics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05998v1,2024-01
EASYTOOL: Enhancing LLM-based Agents with Concise Tool Instruction,"Siyu Yuan, Kaitao Song, Jiangjie Chen, Xu Tan, Yongliang Shen, Ren Kan, Dongsheng Li, Deqing Yang","To address intricate real-world tasks, there has been a rising interest in tool utilization in applications of large language models (LLMs). To develop LLM-based agents, it usually requires LLMs to understand many tool functions from different tool documentation. But these documentations could be diverse, redundant or incomplete, which immensely affects the capability of LLMs in using tools. To solve this, we introduce EASYTOOL, a framework transforming diverse and lengthy tool documentation into a unified and concise tool instruction for easier tool usage. EasyTool purifies essential information from extensive tool documentation of different sources, and elaborates a unified interface (i.e., tool instruction) to offer standardized tool descriptions and functionalities for LLM-based agents. Extensive experiments on multiple different tasks demonstrate that EasyTool can significantly reduce token consumption and improve the performance of tool utilization in real-world scenarios.

Block-Diagonal Orthogonal Relation and Matrix Entity for Knowledge Graph Embedding,"Yihua Zhu, Hidetoshi Shimodaira","The primary aim of Knowledge Graph embeddings (KGE) is to learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations for predicting missing facts. While rotation-based methods like RotatE and QuatE perform well in KGE, they face two challenges: limited model flexibility requiring proportional increases in relation size with entity dimension, and difficulties in generalizing the model for higher-dimensional rotations. To address these issues, we introduce OrthogonalE, a novel KGE model employing matrices for entities and block-diagonal orthogonal matrices with Riemannian optimization for relations. This approach enhances the generality and flexibility of KGE models. The experimental results indicate that our new KGE model, OrthogonalE, is both general and flexible, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art KGE models while substantially reducing the number of relation parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05967v3,2024-01
LLM-as-a-Coauthor: Can Mixed Human-Written and Machine-Generated Text Be Detected?,"Qihui Zhang, Chujie Gao, Dongping Chen, Yue Huang, Yixin Huang, Zhenyang Sun, Shilin Zhang, Weiye Li, Zhengyan Fu, Yao Wan, Lichao Sun","With the rapid development and widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs), the use of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) has become increasingly common, bringing with it potential risks, especially in terms of quality and integrity in fields like news, education, and science. Current research mainly focuses on purely MGT detection without adequately addressing mixed scenarios, including AI-revised Human-Written Text (HWT) or human-revised MGT. To tackle this challenge, we define mixtext, a form of mixed text involving both AI and human-generated content. Then, we introduce MixSet, the first dataset dedicated to studying these mixtext scenarios. Leveraging MixSet, we executed comprehensive experiments to assess the efficacy of prevalent MGT detectors in handling mixtext situations, evaluating their performance in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and generalization. Our findings reveal that existing detectors struggle to identify mixtext, particularly in dealing with subtle modifications and style adaptability. This research underscores the urgent need for more fine-grain detectors tailored for mixtext, offering valuable insights for future research.

Universal Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models: Backdoor Attacks for In-context Learning,"Shuai Zhao, Meihuizi Jia, Luu Anh Tuan, Fengjun Pan, Jinming Wen","In-context learning, a paradigm bridging the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning, has demonstrated high efficacy in several NLP tasks, especially in few-shot settings. Despite being widely applied, in-context learning is vulnerable to malicious attacks. In this work, we raise security concerns regarding this paradigm. Our studies demonstrate that an attacker can manipulate the behavior of large language models by poisoning the demonstration context, without the need for fine-tuning the model. Specifically, we design a new backdoor attack method, named ICLAttack, to target large language models based on in-context learning. Our method encompasses two types of attacks: poisoning demonstration examples and poisoning demonstration prompts, which can make models behave in alignment with predefined intentions. ICLAttack does not require additional fine-tuning to implant a backdoor, thus preserving the model's generality. Furthermore, the poisoned examples are correctly labeled, enhancing the natural stealth of our attack method. Extensive experimental results across several language models, ranging in size from 1.3B to 180B parameters, demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method, exemplified by a high average attack success rate of 95.0% across the three datasets on OPT models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05949v6,2024-01
SH2: Self-Highlighted Hesitation Helps You Decode More Truthfully,"Jushi Kai, Tianhang Zhang, Hai Hu, Zhouhan Lin","Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate great performance in text generation. However, LLMs are still suffering from hallucinations. In this work, we propose an inference-time method, Self-Highlighted Hesitation (SH2), to help LLMs decode more truthfully. SH2 is based on a simple fact rooted in information theory that for an LLM, the tokens predicted with lower probabilities are prone to be more informative than others. Our analysis shows that the tokens assigned with lower probabilities by an LLM are more likely to be closely related to factual information, such as nouns, proper nouns, and adjectives. Therefore, we propose to ''highlight'' the factual information by selecting the tokens with the lowest probabilities and concatenating them to the original context, thus forcing the model to repeatedly read and hesitate on these tokens before generation. During decoding, we also adopt contrastive decoding to emphasize the difference in the output probabilities brought by the hesitation. Experimental results demonstrate that our SH2, requiring no additional data or models, can effectively help LLMs elicit factual knowledge and distinguish hallucinated contexts. Significant and consistent improvements are achieved by SH2 for LLaMA-7b, LLaMA2-7b and Mistral-7b on multiple hallucination tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05930v4,2024-01
Mitigating Unhelpfulness in Emotional Support Conversations with Multifaceted AI Feedback,"Jiashuo Wang, Chunpu Xu, Chak Tou Leong, Wenjie Li, Jing Li","An emotional support conversation system aims to alleviate users' emotional distress and assist them in addressing their challenges. To generate supportive responses, it is critical to consider multiple factors such as empathy, support strategies, and response coherence, as established in prior methods. Nonetheless, previous models occasionally generate unhelpful responses, which intend to provide support but display counterproductive effects. According to psychology and communication theories, poor performance in just one contributing factor might cause a response to be unhelpful. From the model training perspective, since these models have not been exposed to unhelpful responses during their training phase, they are unable to distinguish if the tokens they generate might result in unhelpful responses during inference. To address this issue, we introduce a novel model-agnostic framework named mitigating unhelpfulness with multifaceted AI feedback for emotional support (Muffin). Specifically, Muffin employs a multifaceted AI feedback module to assess the helpfulness of responses generated by a specific model with consideration of multiple factors. Using contrastive learning, it then reduces the likelihood of the model generating unhelpful responses compared to the helpful ones. Experimental results demonstrate that Muffin effectively mitigates the generation of unhelpful responses while slightly increasing response fluency and relevance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05928v3,2024-01
How Teachers Can Use Large Language Models and Bloom's Taxonomy to Create Educational Quizzes,"Sabina Elkins, Ekaterina Kochmar, Jackie C. K. Cheung, Iulian Serban","Question generation (QG) is a natural language processing task with an abundance of potential benefits and use cases in the educational domain. In order for this potential to be realized, QG systems must be designed and validated with pedagogical needs in mind. However, little research has assessed or designed QG approaches with the input from real teachers or students. This paper applies a large language model-based QG approach where questions are generated with learning goals derived from Bloom's taxonomy. The automatically generated questions are used in multiple experiments designed to assess how teachers use them in practice. The results demonstrate that teachers prefer to write quizzes with automatically generated questions, and that such quizzes have no loss in quality compared to handwritten versions. Further, several metrics indicate that automatically generated questions can even improve the quality of the quizzes created, showing the promise for large scale use of QG in the classroom setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05914v1,2024-01

EpilepsyLLM: Domain-Specific Large Language Model Fine-tuned with Epilepsy Medical Knowledge,"Xuyang Zhao, Qibin Zhao, Toshihisa Tanaka","With large training datasets and massive amounts of computing sources, large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in comprehensive and generative ability. Based on those powerful LLMs, the model fine-tuned with domain-specific datasets posseses more specialized knowledge and thus is more practical like medical LLMs. However, the existing fine-tuned medical LLMs are limited to general medical knowledge with English language. For disease-specific problems, the model's response is inaccurate and sometimes even completely irrelevant, especially when using a language other than English. In this work, we focus on the particular disease of Epilepsy with Japanese language and introduce a customized LLM termed as EpilepsyLLM. Our model is trained from the pre-trained LLM by fine-tuning technique using datasets from the epilepsy domain. The datasets contain knowledge of basic information about disease, common treatment methods and drugs, and important notes in life and work. The experimental results demonstrate that EpilepsyLLM can provide more reliable and specialized medical knowledge responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05908v1,2024-01
CrisisKAN: Knowledge-infused and Explainable Multimodal Attention Network for Crisis Event Classification,"Shubham Gupta, Nandini Saini, Suman Kundu, Debasis Das","Pervasive use of social media has become the emerging source for real-time information (like images, text, or both) to identify various events. Despite the rapid growth of image and text-based event classification, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models find it challenging to bridge the semantic gap between features of image and text modalities due to inconsistent encoding. Also, the black-box nature of models fails to explain the model's outcomes for building trust in high-stakes situations such as disasters, pandemic. Additionally, the word limit imposed on social media posts can potentially introduce bias towards specific events. To address these issues, we proposed CrisisKAN, a novel Knowledge-infused and Explainable Multimodal Attention Network that entails images and texts in conjunction with external knowledge from Wikipedia to classify crisis events. To enrich the context-specific understanding of textual information, we integrated Wikipedia knowledge using proposed wiki extraction algorithm. Along with this, a guided cross-attention module is implemented to fill the semantic gap in integrating visual and textual data. In order to ensure reliability, we employ a model-specific approach called Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) that provides a robust explanation of the predictions of the proposed model. The comprehensive experiments conducted on the CrisisMMD dataset yield in-depth analysis across various crisis-specific tasks and settings. As a result, CrisisKAN outperforms existing SOTA methodologies and provides a novel view in the domain of explainable multimodal event classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06194v1,2024-01
Generative Deduplication For Socia Media Data Selection,"Xianming Li, Jing Li","Social media data exhibits severe redundancy caused by its noisy nature. It leads to increased training time and model bias in its processing. To address this issue, we propose a novel Generative Deduplication framework for social media data selection by removing semantically duplicate data. While related work involves data selection in task-specific training, our model acts as an efficient pre-processing method to universally enhance social media NLP pipelines. Specifically, we train a generative model via self-supervised learning to predict a keyword to capture the semantics of noisy social media text for deduplication. Meanwhile, time-dimensional Gaussian noise is added to improve training complexity and avoid learning trivial features. Extensive experiments suggest that our model can better reduce training samples while improving performance than baselines. The results show our model's potential to broadly advance social media language understanding in effectiveness and efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05883v3,2024-01
Enhancing Personality Recognition in Dialogue by Data Augmentation and Heterogeneous Conversational Graph Networks,"Yahui Fu, Haiyue Song, Tianyu Zhao, Tatsuya Kawahara","Personality recognition is useful for enhancing robots' ability to tailor user-adaptive responses, thus fostering rich human-robot interactions. One of the challenges in this task is a limited number of speakers in existing dialogue corpora, which hampers the development of robust, speaker-independent personality recognition models. Additionally, accurately modeling both the interdependencies among interlocutors and the intra-dependencies within the speaker in dialogues remains a significant issue. To address the first challenge, we introduce personality trait interpolation for speaker data augmentation. For the second, we propose heterogeneous conversational graph networks to independently capture both contextual influences and inherent personality traits. Evaluations on the RealPersonaChat corpus demonstrate our method's significant improvements over existing baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05871v2,2024-01
Towards Boosting Many-to-Many Multilingual Machine Translation with Large Language Models,"Pengzhi Gao, Zhongjun He, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang","The training paradigm for machine translation has gradually shifted, from learning neural machine translation (NMT) models with extensive parallel corpora to instruction finetuning on multilingual large language models (LLMs) with high-quality translation pairs. In this paper, we focus on boosting many-to-many multilingual translation of LLMs with an emphasis on zero-shot translation directions. We demonstrate that prompt strategies adopted during finetuning are crucial to zero-shot translation and introduce a cross-lingual consistency regularization, XConST, to bridge the representation gap among different languages and improve zero-shot translation performance. XConST is not a new method, but a version of CrossConST (Gao et al., 2023a) adapted for translation instruction finetuning with LLMs. Experimental results on ALMA (Xu et al., 2023), Tower (Team, 2024), and LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023) show that our approach consistently improves translation performance.

Inferring Intentions to Speak Using Accelerometer Data In-the-Wild,"Litian Li, Jord Molhoek, Jing Zhou","Humans have good natural intuition to recognize when another person has something to say. It would be interesting if an AI can also recognize intentions to speak. Especially in scenarios when an AI is guiding a group discussion, this can be a useful skill. This work studies the inference of successful and unsuccessful intentions to speak from accelerometer data. This is chosen because it is privacy-preserving and feasible for in-the-wild settings since it can be placed in a smart badge. Data from a real-life social networking event is used to train a machine-learning model that aims to infer intentions to speak. A subset of unsuccessful intention-to-speak cases in the data is annotated. The model is trained on the successful intentions to speak and evaluated on both the successful and unsuccessful cases. In conclusion, there is useful information in accelerometer data, but not enough to reliably capture intentions to speak. For example, posture shifts are correlated with intentions to speak, but people also often shift posture without having an intention to speak, or have an intention to speak without shifting their posture. More modalities are likely needed to reliably infer intentions to speak.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05849v1,2024-01

"Tuning LLMs with Contrastive Alignment Instructions for Machine Translation in Unseen, Low-resource Languages","Zhuoyuan Mao, Yen Yu","This article introduces contrastive alignment instructions (AlignInstruct) to address two challenges in machine translation (MT) on large language models (LLMs). One is the expansion of supported languages to previously unseen ones. The second relates to the lack of data in low-resource languages. Model fine-tuning through MT instructions (MTInstruct) is a straightforward approach to the first challenge. However, MTInstruct is limited by weak cross-lingual signals inherent in the second challenge. AlignInstruct emphasizes cross-lingual supervision via a cross-lingual discriminator built using statistical word alignments. Our results based on fine-tuning the BLOOMZ models (1b1, 3b, and 7b1) in up to 24 unseen languages showed that: (1) LLMs can effectively translate unseen languages using MTInstruct; (2) AlignInstruct led to consistent improvements in translation quality across 48 translation directions involving English; (3) Discriminator-based instructions outperformed their generative counterparts as cross-lingual instructions; (4) AlignInstruct improved performance in 30 zero-shot directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05811v2,2024-01
Designing Heterogeneous LLM Agents for Financial Sentiment Analysis,Frank Xing,"Large language models (LLMs) have drastically changed the possible ways to design intelligent systems, shifting the focuses from massive data acquisition and new modeling training to human alignment and strategical elicitation of the full potential of existing pre-trained models. This paradigm shift, however, is not fully realized in financial sentiment analysis (FSA), due to the discriminative nature of this task and a lack of prescriptive knowledge of how to leverage generative models in such a context. This study investigates the effectiveness of the new paradigm, i.e., using LLMs without fine-tuning for FSA. Rooted in Minsky's theory of mind and emotions, a design framework with heterogeneous LLM agents is proposed. The framework instantiates specialized agents using prior domain knowledge of the types of FSA errors and reasons on the aggregated agent discussions. Comprehensive evaluation on FSA datasets show that the framework yields better accuracies, especially when the discussions are substantial. This study contributes to the design foundations and paves new avenues for LLMs-based FSA. Implications on business and management are also discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05799v1,2024-01
Discovering Low-rank Subspaces for Language-agnostic Multilingual Representations,"Zhihui Xie, Handong Zhao, Tong Yu, Shuai Li","Large pretrained multilingual language models (ML-LMs) have shown remarkable capabilities of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, without direct cross-lingual supervision. While these results are promising, follow-up works found that, within the multilingual embedding spaces, there exists strong language identity information which hinders the expression of linguistic factors shared across languages. For semantic tasks like cross-lingual sentence retrieval, it is desired to remove such language identity signals to fully leverage semantic information. In this work, we provide a novel view of projecting away language-specific factors from a multilingual embedding space. Specifically, we discover that there exists a low-rank subspace that primarily encodes information irrelevant to semantics (e.g., syntactic information). To identify this subspace, we present a simple but effective unsupervised method based on singular value decomposition with multiple monolingual corpora as input. Once the subspace is found, we can directly project the original embeddings into the null space to boost language agnosticism without finetuning. We systematically evaluate our method on various tasks including the challenging language-agnostic QA retrieval task. Empirical results show that applying our method consistently leads to improvements over commonly used ML-LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05792v1,2024-01
Evidence to Generate (E2G): A Single-agent Two-step Prompting for Context Grounded and Retrieval Augmented Reasoning,Md Rizwan Parvez,"While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has revolutionized how LLMs perform reasoning tasks, its current methods and variations (e.g, Self-consistency, ReACT, Reflexion, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), Cumulative Reasoning (CR)) suffer from limitations like slowness, limited context grounding, hallucination and inconsistent outputs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Evidence to Generate (E2G), a novel single-agent, two-step prompting framework. Instead of unverified reasoning claims, this innovative approach leverages the power of ""evidence for decision making"" by first focusing exclusively on the thought sequences (the series of intermediate steps) explicitly mentioned in the context which then serve as extracted evidence, guiding the LLM's output generation process with greater precision and efficiency. This simple yet powerful approach unlocks the true potential of chain-of-thought like prompting, paving the way for faster, more reliable, and more contextually aware reasoning in LLMs. \tool achieves remarkable results robustly across a wide range of knowledge-intensive reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing baseline approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs. For example, (i) on LogiQA benchmark using GPT-4 as backbone model, \tool achieves a new state-of-the Accuracy of 53.8% exceeding CoT by 18%, ToT by 11%, CR by 9% (ii) a variant of E2G with PaLM2 outperforms the variable-shot performance of Gemini Ultra by 0.9 F1 points, reaching an F1 score of 83.3 on a subset of DROP.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05787v1,2024-01

In this paper, we delve into four essential modules of an LLM system, including an input module for receiving prompts, a language model trained on extensive corpora, a toolchain module for development and deployment, and an output module for exporting LLM-generated content. Based on this, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy, which systematically analyzes potential risks associated with each module of an LLM system and discusses the corresponding mitigation strategies.

An In-Depth Insight for Knowledge Base Question Answering,"Jinxin Liu, Shulin Cao, Jiaxin Shi, Tingjian Zhang, Lunyiu Nie, Linmei Hu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li","Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions based on facts in knowledge bases. A typical approach to KBQA is semantic parsing, which translates a question into an executable logical form in a formal language. Recent works leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for logical form generation to improve performance. However, although it is validated that LLMs are capable of solving some KBQA problems, there has been little discussion on the differences in LLMs' proficiency in formal languages used in semantic parsing. In this work, we propose to evaluate the understanding and generation ability of LLMs to deal with differently structured logical forms by examining the inter-conversion of natural and formal language through in-context learning of LLMs. Extensive experiments with models of different sizes show that state-of-the-art LLMs can understand formal languages as well as humans, but generating correct logical forms given a few examples remains a challenge. Most importantly, our results also indicate that LLMs exhibit considerable sensitivity. In general, the formal language with a lower formalization level, i.e., the more similar it is to natural language, is more friendly to LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05777v2,2024-01
A Shocking Amount of the Web is Machine Translated: Insights from Multi-Way Parallelism,"Brian Thompson, Mehak Preet Dhaliwal, Peter Frisch, Tobias Domhan, Marcello Federico","We show that content on the web is often translated into many languages, and the low quality of these multi-way translations indicates they were likely created using Machine Translation (MT). Multi-way parallel, machine generated content not only dominates the translations in lower resource languages; it also constitutes a large fraction of the total web content in those languages. We also find evidence of a selection bias in the type of content which is translated into many languages, consistent with low quality English content being translated en masse into many lower resource languages, via MT. Our work raises serious concerns about training models such as multilingual large language models on both monolingual and bilingual data scraped from the web.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05749v2,2024-01
Cross-modal Retrieval for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering,"Paul Lerner, Olivier Ferret, Camille Guinaudeau","Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering about Named Entities is a challenging task that requires retrieving information from a multimodal Knowledge Base. Named entities have diverse visual representations and are therefore difficult to recognize. We argue that cross-modal retrieval may help bridge the semantic gap between an entity and its depictions, and is foremost complementary with mono-modal retrieval. We provide empirical evidence through experiments with a multimodal dual encoder, namely CLIP, on the recent ViQuAE, InfoSeek, and Encyclopedic-VQA datasets. Additionally, we study three different strategies to fine-tune such a model: mono-modal, cross-modal, or joint training. Our method, which combines mono-and cross-modal retrieval, is competitive with billion-parameter models on the three datasets, while being conceptually simpler and computationally cheaper.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05736v1,2024-01
A Comprehensive Survey of Text Classification Techniques and Their Research Applications: Observational and Experimental Insights,"Kamal Taha, Paul D. Yoo, Chan Yeun, Aya Taha","The exponential growth of textual data presents substantial challenges in management and analysis, notably due to high storage and processing costs. Text classification, a vital aspect of text mining, provides robust solutions by enabling efficient categorization and organization of text data. These techniques allow individuals, researchers, and businesses to derive meaningful patterns and insights from large volumes of text. This survey paper introduces a comprehensive taxonomy specifically designed for text classification based on research fields. The taxonomy is structured into hierarchical levels: research field-based category, research field-based sub-category, methodology-based technique, methodology sub-technique, and research field applications. We employ a dual evaluation approach: empirical and experimental. Empirically, we assess text classification techniques across four critical criteria. Experimentally, we compare and rank the methodology sub-techniques within the same methodology technique and within the same overall research field sub-category. This structured taxonomy, coupled with thorough evaluations, provides a detailed and nuanced understanding of text classification algorithms and their applications, empowering researchers to make informed decisions based on precise, field-specific insights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12982v2,2024-01
Zero Resource Cross-Lingual Part Of Speech Tagging,Sahil Chopra,"Part of speech tagging in zero-resource settings can be an effective approach for low-resource languages when no labeled training data is available. Existing systems use two main techniques for POS tagging i.e. pretrained multilingual large language models(LLM) or project the source language labels into the zero resource target language and train a sequence labeling model on it. We explore the latter approach using the off-the-shelf alignment module and train a hidden Markov model(HMM) to predict the POS tags. We evaluate transfer learning setup with English as a source language and French, German, and Spanish as target languages for part-of-speech tagging. Our conclusion is that projected alignment data in zero-resource language can be beneficial to predict POS tags.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05727v1,2024-01
CAT-LLM: Prompting Large Language Models with Text Style Definition for Chinese Article-style Transfer,"Zhen Tao, Dinghao Xi, Zhiyu Li, Liumin Tang, Wei Xu","Text style transfer is increasingly prominent in online entertainment and social media. However, existing research mainly concentrates on style transfer within individual English sentences, while ignoring the complexity of long Chinese texts, which limits the wider applicability of style transfer in digital media realm. To bridge this gap, we propose a Chinese Article-style Transfer framework (CAT-LLM), leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). CAT-LLM incorporates a bespoke, pluggable Text Style Definition (TSD) module aimed at comprehensively analyzing text features in articles, prompting LLMs to efficiently transfer Chinese article-style. The TSD module integrates a series of machine learning algorithms to analyze article-style from both words and sentences levels, thereby aiding LLMs thoroughly grasp the target style without compromising the integrity of the original text. In addition, this module supports dynamic expansion of internal style trees, showcasing robust compatibility and allowing flexible optimization in subsequent research. Moreover, we select five Chinese articles with distinct styles and create five parallel datasets using ChatGPT, enhancing the models' performance evaluation accuracy and establishing a novel paradigm for evaluating subsequent research on article-style transfer. Extensive experimental results affirm that CAT-LLM outperforms current research in terms of transfer accuracy and content preservation, and has remarkable applicability to various types of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05707v1,2024-01
R-BI: Regularized Batched Inputs enhance Incremental Decoding Framework for Low-Latency Simultaneous Speech Translation,"Jiaxin Guo, Zhanglin Wu, Zongyao Li, Hengchao Shang, Daimeng Wei, Xiaoyu Chen, Zhiqiang Rao, Shaojun Li, Hao Yang","Incremental Decoding is an effective framework that enables the use of an offline model in a simultaneous setting without modifying the original model, making it suitable for Low-Latency Simultaneous Speech Translation. However, this framework may introduce errors when the system outputs from incomplete input. To reduce these output errors, several strategies such as Hold-$n$, LA-$n$, and SP-$n$ can be employed, but the hyper-parameter $n$ needs to be carefully selected for optimal performance. Moreover, these strategies are more suitable for end-to-end systems than cascade systems. In our paper, we propose a new adaptable and efficient policy named ""Regularized Batched Inputs"". Our method stands out by enhancing input diversity to mitigate output errors. We suggest particular regularization techniques for both end-to-end and cascade systems. We conducted experiments on IWSLT Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) tasks, which demonstrate that our approach achieves low latency while maintaining no more than 2 BLEU points loss compared to offline systems. Furthermore, our SimulST systems attained several new state-of-the-art results in various language directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05700v1,2024-01
Integrating Physician Diagnostic Logic into Large Language Models: Preference Learning from Process Feedback,"Chengfeng Dou, Zhi Jin, Wenpin Jiao, Haiyan Zhao, Yongqiang Zhao, Zhenwei Tao","The use of large language models in medical dialogue generation has garnered significant attention, with a focus on improving response quality and fluency. While previous studies have made progress in optimizing model performance for single-round medical Q&A tasks, there is a need to enhance the model's capability for multi-round conversations to avoid logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose an approach called preference learning from process feedback~(PLPF), which integrates the doctor's diagnostic logic into LLMs. PLPF involves rule modeling, preference data generation, and preference alignment to train the model to adhere to the diagnostic process. Experimental results using Standardized Patient Testing show that PLPF enhances the diagnostic accuracy of the baseline model in medical conversations by 17.6%, outperforming traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback. Additionally, PLPF demonstrates effectiveness in both multi-round and single-round dialogue tasks, showcasing its potential for improving medical dialogue generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05695v2,2024-01
UCorrect: An Unsupervised Framework for Automatic Speech Recognition Error Correction,"Jiaxin Guo, Minghan Wang, Xiaosong Qiao, Daimeng Wei, Hengchao Shang, Zongyao Li, Zhengzhe Yu, Yinglu Li, Chang Su, Min Zhang, Shimin Tao, Hao Yang","Error correction techniques have been used to refine the output sentences from automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and achieve a lower word error rate (WER). Previous works usually adopt end-to-end models and has strong dependency on Pseudo Paired Data and Original Paired Data. But when only pre-training on Pseudo Paired Data, previous models have negative effect on correction. While fine-tuning on Original Paired Data, the source side data must be transcribed by a well-trained ASR model, which takes a lot of time and not universal. In this paper, we propose UCorrect, an unsupervised Detector-Generator-Selector framework for ASR Error Correction. UCorrect has no dependency on the training data mentioned before. The whole procedure is first to detect whether the character is erroneous, then to generate some candidate characters and finally to select the most confident one to replace the error character. Experiments on the public AISHELL-1 dataset and WenetSpeech dataset show the effectiveness of UCorrect for ASR error correction: 1) it achieves significant WER reduction, achieves 6.83\% even without fine-tuning and 14.29\% after fine-tuning; 2) it outperforms the popular NAR correction models by a large margin with a competitive low latency; and 3) it is an universal method, as it reduces all WERs of the ASR model with different decoding strategies and reduces all WERs of ASR models trained on different scale datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05689v1,2024-01
"UniRQR: A Unified Model for Retrieval Decision, Query, and Response Generation in Internet-Based Knowledge Dialogue Systems","Zhongtian Hu, Yangqi Chen, Meng Zhao, Ronghan Li, Lifang Wang","Knowledge-based dialogue systems with internet retrieval have recently attracted considerable attention from researchers. The dialogue systems overcome a major limitation of traditional knowledge dialogue systems, where the timeliness of knowledge cannot be assured, hence providing greater practical application value. Knowledge-based dialogue systems with internet retrieval can be typically segmented into three tasks: Retrieval Decision, Query Generation, and Response Generation. However, many of studies assumed that all conversations require external knowledge to continue, neglecting the critical step of determining when retrieval is necessary. This assumption often leads to an over-dependence on external knowledge, even when it may not be required. Our work addresses this oversight by employing a single unified model facilitated by prompt and multi-task learning approaches. This model not only decides whether retrieval is necessary but also generates retrieval queries and responses. By integrating these functions, our system leverages the full potential of pre-trained models and reduces the complexity and costs associated with deploying multiple models. We conducted extensive experiments to investigate the mutual enhancement among the three tasks in our system. What is more, the experiment results on the Wizint and Dusinc datasets not only demonstrate that our unified model surpasses the baseline performance for individual tasks, but also reveal that it achieves comparable results when contrasted with SOTA systems that deploy separate, specialized models for each task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06811v1,2024-01
ConcEPT: Concept-Enhanced Pre-Training for Language Models,"Xintao Wang, Zhouhong Gu, Jiaqing Liang, Dakuan Lu, Yanghua Xiao, Wei Wang","Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been prevailing in state-of-the-art methods for natural language processing, and knowledge-enhanced PLMs are further proposed to promote model performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, conceptual knowledge, one essential kind of knowledge for human cognition, still remains understudied in this line of research. This limits PLMs' performance in scenarios requiring human-like cognition, such as understanding long-tail entities with concepts. In this paper, we propose ConcEPT, which stands for Concept-Enhanced Pre-Training for language models, to infuse conceptual knowledge into PLMs. ConcEPT exploits external taxonomies with entity concept prediction, a novel pre-training objective to predict the concepts of entities mentioned in the pre-training contexts. Unlike previous concept-enhanced methods, ConcEPT can be readily adapted to various downstream applications without entity linking or concept mapping. Results of extensive experiments show the effectiveness of ConcEPT in four tasks such as entity typing, which validates that our model gains improved conceptual knowledge with concept-enhanced pre-training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05669v1,2024-01
"Unveiling the Tapestry of Automated Essay Scoring: A Comprehensive Investigation of Accuracy, Fairness, and Generalizability","Kaixun Yang, Mladen Raković, Yuyang Li, Quanlong Guan, Dragan Gašević, Guanliang Chen","Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) is a well-established educational pursuit that employs machine learning to evaluate student-authored essays. While much effort has been made in this area, current research primarily focuses on either (i) boosting the predictive accuracy of an AES model for a specific prompt (i.e., developing prompt-specific models), which often heavily relies on the use of the labeled data from the same target prompt; or (ii) assessing the applicability of AES models developed on non-target prompts to the intended target prompt (i.e., developing the AES models in a cross-prompt setting). Given the inherent bias in machine learning and its potential impact on marginalized groups, it is imperative to investigate whether such bias exists in current AES methods and, if identified, how it intervenes with an AES model's accuracy and generalizability. Thus, our study aimed to uncover the intricate relationship between an AES model's accuracy, fairness, and generalizability, contributing practical insights for developing effective AES models in real-world education. To this end, we meticulously selected nine prominent AES methods and evaluated their performance using seven metrics on an open-sourced dataset, which contains over 25,000 essays and various demographic information about students such as gender, English language learner status, and economic status. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrated that: (1) prompt-specific models tend to outperform their cross-prompt counterparts in terms of predictive accuracy; (2) prompt-specific models frequently exhibit a greater bias towards students of different economic statuses compared to cross-prompt models; (3) in the pursuit of generalizability, traditional machine learning models coupled with carefully engineered features hold greater potential for achieving both high accuracy and fairness than complex neural network models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05655v1,2024-01

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility, consistency, and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians' expertise is an outstanding grand challenge. Here, we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a Large Language Model (LLM) based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue.   AMIE uses a novel self-play based simulated environment with automated feedback mechanisms for scaling learning across diverse disease conditions, specialties, and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically-meaningful axes of performance including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management reasoning, communication skills, and empathy. We compared AMIE's performance to that of primary care physicians (PCPs) in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient actors in the style of an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). The study included 149 case scenarios from clinical providers in Canada, the UK, and India, 20 PCPs for comparison with AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 28 of 32 axes according to specialist physicians and 24 of 26 axes according to patient actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with appropriate caution. Clinicians were limited to unfamiliar synchronous text-chat which permits large-scale LLM-patient interactions but is not representative of usual clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05654v1,2024-01
On Context-aware Detection of Cherry-picking in News Reporting,"Israa Jaradat, Haiqi Zhang, Chengkai Li","Cherry-picking refers to the deliberate selection of evidence or facts that favor a particular viewpoint while ignoring or distorting evidence that supports an opposing perspective. Manually identifying cherry-picked statements in news stories can be challenging. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to detecting cherry-picked statements by identifying missing important statements in a target news story using language models and contextual information from other news sources. Furthermore, this research introduces a novel dataset specifically designed for training and evaluating cherry-picking detection models. Our best performing model achieves an F-1 score of about 89% in detecting important statements.

Natural Language Processing for Dialects of a Language: A Survey,"Aditya Joshi, Raj Dabre, Diptesh Kanojia, Zhuang Li, Haolan Zhan, Gholamreza Haffari, Doris Dippold","State-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models are trained on massive training corpora, and report a superlative performance on evaluation datasets. This survey delves into an important attribute of these datasets: the dialect of a language. Motivated by the performance degradation of NLP models for dialectal datasets and its implications for the equity of language technologies, we survey past research in NLP for dialects in terms of datasets, and approaches. We describe a wide range of NLP tasks in terms of two categories: natural language understanding (NLU) (for tasks such as dialect classification, sentiment analysis, parsing, and NLU benchmarks) and natural language generation (NLG) (for summarisation, machine translation, and dialogue systems). The survey is also broad in its coverage of languages which include English, Arabic, German, among others. We observe that past work in NLP concerning dialects goes deeper than mere dialect classification, and extends to several NLU and NLG tasks. For these tasks, we describe classical machine learning using statistical models, along with the recent deep learning-based approaches based on pre-trained language models. We expect that this survey will be useful to NLP researchers interested in building equitable language technologies by rethinking LLM benchmarks and model architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05632v4,2024-01

The Benefits of a Concise Chain of Thought on Problem-Solving in Large Language Models,"Matthew Renze, Erhan Guven","In this paper, we introduce Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) prompting. We compared standard CoT and CCoT prompts to see how conciseness impacts response length and correct-answer accuracy. We evaluated this using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with a multiple-choice question-and-answer (MCQA) benchmark. CCoT reduced average response length by 48.70% for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 while having a negligible impact on problem-solving performance. However, on math problems, GPT-3.5 with CCoT incurs a performance penalty of 27.69%. Overall, CCoT leads to an average per-token cost reduction of 22.67%.

Scaling Laws for Forgetting When Fine-Tuning Large Language Models,Damjan Kalajdzievski,"We study and quantify the problem of forgetting when fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) on a downstream task. We find that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA), still suffer from catastrophic forgetting. In particular, we identify a strong inverse linear relationship between the fine-tuning performance and the amount of forgetting when fine-tuning LLMs with LoRA. We further obtain precise scaling laws that show forgetting increases as a shifted power law in the number of parameters fine-tuned and the number of update steps. We also examine the impact of forgetting on knowledge, reasoning, and the safety guardrails trained into Llama 2 7B chat. Our study suggests that forgetting cannot be avoided through early stopping or by varying the number of parameters fine-tuned. We believe this opens up an important safety-critical direction for future research to evaluate and develop fine-tuning schemes which mitigate forgetting",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05605v1,2024-01
REBUS: A Robust Evaluation Benchmark of Understanding Symbols,"Andrew Gritsevskiy, Arjun Panickssery, Aaron Kirtland, Derik Kauffman, Hans Gundlach, Irina Gritsevskaya, Joe Cavanagh, Jonathan Chiang, Lydia La Roux, Michelle Hung","We propose a new benchmark evaluating the performance of multimodal large language models on rebus puzzles. The dataset covers 333 original examples of image-based wordplay, cluing 13 categories such as movies, composers, major cities, and food. To achieve good performance on the benchmark of identifying the clued word or phrase, models must combine image recognition and string manipulation with hypothesis testing, multi-step reasoning, and an understanding of human cognition, making for a complex, multimodal evaluation of capabilities. We find that GPT-4o significantly outperforms all other models, followed by proprietary models outperforming all other evaluated models. However, even the best model has a final accuracy of only 42\%, which goes down to just 7\% on hard puzzles, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning. Further, models rarely understand all parts of a puzzle, and are almost always incapable of retroactively explaining the correct answer. Our benchmark can therefore be used to identify major shortcomings in the knowledge and reasoning of multimodal large language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05604v2,2024-01
POMP: Probability-driven Meta-graph Prompter for LLMs in Low-resource Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation,"Shilong Pan, Zhiliang Tian, Liang Ding, Zhen Huang, Zhihua Wen, Dongsheng Li","Low-resource languages (LRLs) face challenges in supervised neural machine translation due to limited parallel data, prompting research into unsupervised methods. Unsupervised neural machine translation (UNMT) methods, including back-translation, transfer learning, and pivot-based translation, offer practical solutions for LRL translation, but they are hindered by issues like synthetic data noise, language bias, and error propagation, which can potentially be mitigated by Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs have advanced NMT with in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning methods, but insufficient training data results in poor performance in LRLs. We argue that LLMs can mitigate the linguistic noise with auxiliary languages to improve translations in LRLs. In this paper, we propose Probability-driven Meta-graph Prompter (POMP), a novel approach employing a dynamic, sampling-based graph of multiple auxiliary languages to enhance LLMs' translation capabilities for LRLs. POMP involves constructing a directed acyclic meta-graph for each source language, from which we dynamically sample multiple paths to prompt LLMs to mitigate the linguistic noise and improve translations during training. We use the BLEURT metric to evaluate the translations and back-propagate rewards, estimated by scores, to update the probabilities of auxiliary languages in the paths. Our experiments show significant improvements in the translation quality of three LRLs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05596v2,2024-01

If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05566v3,2024-01
Grounded learning for compositional vector semantics,Martha Lewis,"Categorical compositional distributional semantics is an approach to modelling language that combines the success of vector-based models of meaning with the compositional power of formal semantics.

Nonetheless, these LLMs present many challenges, particularly in the realm of trustworthiness. Therefore, ensuring the trustworthiness of LLMs emerges as an important topic. This paper introduces TrustLLM, a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in LLMs, including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions. Specifically, we first propose a set of principles for trustworthy LLMs that span eight different dimensions. Based on these principles, we further establish a benchmark across six dimensions including truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics. We then present a study evaluating 16 mainstream LLMs in TrustLLM, consisting of over 30 datasets. Our findings firstly show that in general trustworthiness and utility (i.e., functional effectiveness) are positively related. Secondly, our observations reveal that proprietary LLMs generally outperform most open-source counterparts in terms of trustworthiness, raising concerns about the potential risks of widely accessible open-source LLMs. However, a few open-source LLMs come very close to proprietary ones. Thirdly, it is important to note that some LLMs may be overly calibrated towards exhibiting trustworthiness, to the extent that they compromise their utility by mistakenly treating benign prompts as harmful and consequently not responding. Finally, we emphasize the importance of ensuring transparency not only in the models themselves but also in the technologies that underpin trustworthiness. Knowing the specific trustworthy technologies that have been employed is crucial for analyzing their effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05561v6,2024-01
Useful Blunders: Can Automated Speech Recognition Errors Improve Downstream Dementia Classification?,"Changye Li, Weizhe Xu, Trevor Cohen, Serguei Pakhomov","\textbf{Objectives}: We aimed to investigate how errors from automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems affect dementia classification accuracy, specifically in the ``Cookie Theft'' picture description task. We aimed to assess whether imperfect ASR-generated transcripts could provide valuable information for distinguishing between language samples from cognitively healthy individuals and those with Alzheimer's disease (AD).   \textbf{Methods}: We conducted experiments using various ASR models, refining their transcripts with post-editing techniques. Both these imperfect ASR transcripts and manually transcribed ones were used as inputs for the downstream dementia classification. We conducted comprehensive error analysis to compare model performance and assess ASR-generated transcript effectiveness in dementia classification.   \textbf{Results}: Imperfect ASR-generated transcripts surprisingly outperformed manual transcription for distinguishing between individuals with AD and those without in the ``Cookie Theft'' task. These ASR-based models surpassed the previous state-of-the-art approach, indicating that ASR errors may contain valuable cues related to dementia. The synergy between ASR and classification models improved overall accuracy in dementia classification.   \textbf{Conclusion}: Imperfect ASR transcripts effectively capture linguistic anomalies linked to dementia, improving accuracy in classification tasks. This synergy between ASR and classification models underscores ASR's potential as a valuable tool in assessing cognitive impairment and related clinical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05551v1,2024-01
Enhancing Source Code Classification Effectiveness via Prompt Learning Incorporating Knowledge Features,"Yong Ma, Senlin Luo, Yu-Ming Shang, Yifei Zhang, Zhengjun Li","Researchers have investigated the potential of leveraging pre-trained language models, such as CodeBERT, to enhance source code-related tasks. Previous methodologies have relied on CodeBERT's '[CLS]' token as the embedding representation of input sequences for task performance, necessitating additional neural network layers to enhance feature representation, which in turn increases computational expenses. These approaches have also failed to fully leverage the comprehensive knowledge inherent within the source code and its associated text, potentially limiting classification efficacy. We propose CodeClassPrompt, a text classification technique that harnesses prompt learning to extract rich knowledge associated with input sequences from pre-trained models, thereby eliminating the need for additional layers and lowering computational costs. By applying an attention mechanism, we synthesize multi-layered knowledge into task-specific features, enhancing classification accuracy. Our comprehensive experimentation across four distinct source code-related tasks reveals that CodeClassPrompt achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05544v4,2024-01
From Pampas to Pixels: Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models for Gaúcho Heritage,"Marcellus Amadeus, William Alberto Cruz Castañeda, André Felipe Zanella, Felipe Rodrigues Perche Mahlow","Generative AI has become pervasive in society, witnessing significant advancements in various domains. Particularly in the realm of Text-to-Image (TTI) models, Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), showcase remarkable capabilities in generating visual content based on textual prompts. This paper addresses the potential of LDMs in representing local cultural concepts, historical figures, and endangered species. In this study, we use the cultural heritage of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), Brazil, as an illustrative case. Our objective is to contribute to the broader understanding of how generative models can help to capture and preserve the cultural and historical identity of regions. The paper outlines the methodology, including subject selection, dataset creation, and the fine-tuning process.

An EcoSage Assistant: Towards Building A Multimodal Plant Care Dialogue Assistant,"Mohit Tomar, Abhisek Tiwari, Tulika Saha, Prince Jha, Sriparna Saha","In recent times, there has been an increasing awareness about imminent environmental challenges, resulting in people showing a stronger dedication to taking care of the environment and nurturing green life. The current $19.6 billion indoor gardening industry, reflective of this growing sentiment, not only signifies a monetary value but also speaks of a profound human desire to reconnect with the natural world. However, several recent surveys cast a revealing light on the fate of plants within our care, with more than half succumbing primarily due to the silent menace of improper care. Thus, the need for accessible expertise capable of assisting and guiding individuals through the intricacies of plant care has become paramount more than ever. In this work, we make the very first attempt at building a plant care assistant, which aims to assist people with plant(-ing) concerns through conversations. We propose a plant care conversational dataset named Plantational, which contains around 1K dialogues between users and plant care experts. Our end-to-end proposed approach is two-fold : (i) We first benchmark the dataset with the help of various large language models (LLMs) and visual language model (VLM) by studying the impact of instruction tuning (zero-shot and few-shot prompting) and fine-tuning techniques on this task; (ii) finally, we build EcoSage, a multi-modal plant care assisting dialogue generation framework, incorporating an adapter-based modality infusion using a gated mechanism. We performed an extensive examination (both automated and manual evaluation) of the performance exhibited by various LLMs and VLM in the generation of the domain-specific dialogue responses to underscore the respective strengths and weaknesses of these diverse models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06807v1,2024-01
InfiAgent-DABench: Evaluating Agents on Data Analysis Tasks,"Xueyu Hu, Ziyu Zhao, Shuang Wei, Ziwei Chai, Qianli Ma, Guoyin Wang, Xuwu Wang, Jing Su, Jingjing Xu, Ming Zhu, Yao Cheng, Jianbo Yuan, Jiwei Li, Kun Kuang, Yang Yang, Hongxia Yang, Fei Wu","In this paper, we introduce InfiAgent-DABench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM-based agents on data analysis tasks. These tasks require agents to end-to-end solving complex tasks by interacting with an execution environment. This benchmark contains DAEval, a dataset consisting of 257 data analysis questions derived from 52 CSV files, and an agent framework which incorporates LLMs to serve as data analysis agents for both serving and evaluation. Since data analysis questions are often open-ended and hard to evaluate without human supervision, we adopt a format-prompting technique to convert each question into a closed-form format so that they can be automatically evaluated. Our extensive benchmarking of 34 LLMs uncovers the current challenges encountered in data analysis tasks. In addition, building on top of our agent framework, we develop a specialized agent, DAAgent, which surpasses GPT-3.5 by 3.9% on DABench.

AugSumm: towards generalizable speech summarization using synthetic labels from large language model,"Jee-weon Jung, Roshan Sharma, William Chen, Bhiksha Raj, Shinji Watanabe","Abstractive speech summarization (SSUM) aims to generate human-like summaries from speech. Given variations in information captured and phrasing, recordings can be summarized in multiple ways. Therefore, it is more reasonable to consider a probabilistic distribution of all potential summaries rather than a single summary. However, conventional SSUM models are mostly trained and evaluated with a single ground-truth (GT) human-annotated deterministic summary for every recording. Generating multiple human references would be ideal to better represent the distribution statistically, but is impractical because annotation is expensive. We tackle this challenge by proposing AugSumm, a method to leverage large language models (LLMs) as a proxy for human annotators to generate augmented summaries for training and evaluation. First, we explore prompting strategies to generate synthetic summaries from ChatGPT. We validate the quality of synthetic summaries using multiple metrics including human evaluation, where we find that summaries generated using AugSumm are perceived as more valid to humans. Second, we develop methods to utilize synthetic summaries in training and evaluation. Experiments on How2 demonstrate that pre-training on synthetic summaries and fine-tuning on GT summaries improves ROUGE-L by 1 point on both GT and AugSumm-based test sets. AugSumm summaries are available at https://github.com/Jungjee/AugSumm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06806v1,2024-01
Leveraging Print Debugging to Improve Code Generation in Large Language Models,"Xueyu Hu, Kun Kuang, Jiankai Sun, Hongxia Yang, Fei Wu","Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation tasks, but their performance in tackling programming problems with complex data structures and algorithms remains suboptimal. To address this issue, we propose an in-context learning approach that guides LLMs to debug by using a ""print debugging"" method, which involves inserting print statements to trace and analysing logs for fixing the bug. We collect a Leetcode problem dataset and evaluate our method using the Leetcode online judging system. Experiments with GPT-4 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming rubber duck debugging in easy and medium-level Leetcode problems by 1.5% and 17.9%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05319v1,2024-01
ANIM-400K: A Large-Scale Dataset for Automated End-To-End Dubbing of Video,"Kevin Cai, Chonghua Liu, David M. Chan","The Internet's wealth of content, with up to 60% published in English, starkly contrasts the global population, where only 18.8% are English speakers, and just 5.1% consider it their native language, leading to disparities in online information access. Unfortunately, automated processes for dubbing of video - replacing the audio track of a video with a translated alternative - remains a complex and challenging task due to pipelines, necessitating precise timing, facial movement synchronization, and prosody matching. While end-to-end dubbing offers a solution, data scarcity continues to impede the progress of both end-to-end and pipeline-based methods. In this work, we introduce Anim-400K, a comprehensive dataset of over 425K aligned animated video segments in Japanese and English supporting various video-related tasks, including automated dubbing, simultaneous translation, guided video summarization, and genre/theme/style classification.

I am a Strange Dataset: Metalinguistic Tests for Language Models,"Tristan Thrush, Jared Moore, Miguel Monares, Christopher Potts, Douwe Kiela","Statements involving metalinguistic self-reference (""This paper has six sections."") are prevalent in many domains. Can current large language models (LLMs) handle such language? In this paper, we present ""I am a Strange Dataset"", a new dataset for addressing this question. There are two subtasks: generation and verification. In generation, models continue statements like ""The penultimate word in this sentence is"" (where a correct continuation is ""is""). In verification, models judge the truth of statements like ""The penultimate word in this sentence is sentence."" (false). We also provide minimally different metalinguistic non-self-reference examples to complement the main dataset by probing for whether models can handle metalinguistic language at all. The dataset is hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators. We test a variety of open-source LLMs (7B to 70B parameters) as well as closed-source LLMs through APIs. All models perform close to chance across both subtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data, though we find some steady improvement with model scale. GPT 4 is the only model to consistently do significantly better than chance, and it is still only in the 60% range, while our untrained human annotators score well in the 89-93% range. The dataset and evaluation toolkit are available at https://github.com/TristanThrush/i-am-a-strange-dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05300v2,2024-01

The system automates various stages of case analysis, including basic information extraction, admissibility examination, Periculum in mora and Fumus boni iuris analyses, and recommendations generation. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate INACIA's potential in extracting relevant information from case documents, evaluating its legal plausibility, and formulating propositions for judicial decision-making. Utilizing a validation dataset alongside LLMs, our evaluation methodology presents a novel approach to assessing system performance, correlating highly with human judgment. These results underscore INACIA's potential in complex legal task handling while also acknowledging the current limitations. This study discusses possible improvements and the broader implications of applying AI in legal contexts, suggesting that INACIA represents a significant step towards integrating AI in legal systems globally, albeit with cautious optimism grounded in the empirical findings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05273v3,2024-01
AutoAct: Automatic Agent Learning from Scratch for QA via Self-Planning,"Shuofei Qiao, Ningyu Zhang, Runnan Fang, Yujie Luo, Wangchunshu Zhou, Yuchen Eleanor Jiang, Chengfei Lv, Huajun Chen","Language agents have achieved considerable performance on various complex question-answering tasks by planning with external tools. Despite the incessant exploration in this field, existing language agent systems still struggle with costly, non-reproducible data reliance and face the challenge of compelling a single model for multiple functions. To this end, we introduce AutoAct, an automatic agent learning framework for QA that does not rely on large-scale annotated data and synthetic planning trajectories from closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4). Given limited data with a tool library, AutoAct first automatically synthesizes planning trajectories without any assistance from humans or strong closed-source models. Then, AutoAct leverages a division-of-labor strategy to automatically differentiate based on the target task information and synthesized trajectories, producing a sub-agent group to complete the task. We conduct comprehensive experiments with different LLMs, which demonstrates that AutoAct yields better or parallel performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the division-of-labor strategy, with the trajectory quality generated by AutoAct generally outperforming that of others.

Language-based Valence and Arousal Expressions between the United States and China: a Cross-Cultural Examination,"Young-Min Cho, Dandan Pang, Stuti Thapa, Garrick Sherman, Lyle Ungar, Louis Tay, Sharath Chandra Guntuku","While affective expressions on social media have been extensively studied, most research has focused on the Western context. This paper explores cultural differences in affective expressions by comparing valence and arousal on Twitter/X (geolocated to the US) and Sina Weibo (in Mainland China). Using the NRC-VAD lexicon to measure valence and arousal, we identify distinct patterns of emotional expression across both platforms. Our analysis reveals a functional representation between valence and arousal, showing a negative offset in contrast to traditional lab-based findings which suggest a positive offset. Furthermore, we uncover significant cross-cultural differences in arousal, with US users displaying higher emotional intensity than Chinese users, regardless of the valence of the content. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive language analysis correlating n-grams and LDA topics with affective dimensions to deepen our understanding of how language and culture shape emotional expression. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of affective communication across cultural and linguistic contexts on social media.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05254v4,2024-01
CASA: Causality-driven Argument Sufficiency Assessment,"Xiao Liu, Yansong Feng, Kai-Wei Chang","The argument sufficiency assessment task aims to determine if the premises of a given argument support its conclusion. To tackle this task, existing works often train a classifier on data annotated by humans. However, annotating data is laborious, and annotations are often inconsistent due to subjective criteria. Motivated by the definition of probability of sufficiency (PS) in the causal literature, we proposeCASA, a zero-shot causality-driven argument sufficiency assessment framework. PS measures how likely introducing the premise event would lead to the conclusion when both the premise and conclusion events are absent. To estimate this probability, we propose to use large language models (LLMs) to generate contexts that are inconsistent with the premise and conclusion and revise them by injecting the premise event. Experiments on two logical fallacy detection datasets demonstrate that CASA accurately identifies insufficient arguments. We further deploy CASA in a writing assistance application, and find that suggestions generated by CASA enhance the sufficiency of student-written arguments.

Do Vision and Language Encoders Represent the World Similarly?,"Mayug Maniparambil, Raiymbek Akshulakov, Yasser Abdelaziz Dahou Djilali, Sanath Narayan, Mohamed El Amine Seddik, Karttikeya Mangalam, Noel E. O'Connor","Aligned text-image encoders such as CLIP have become the de facto model for vision-language tasks. Furthermore, modality-specific encoders achieve impressive performances in their respective domains. This raises a central question: does an alignment exist between uni-modal vision and language encoders since they fundamentally represent the same physical world? Analyzing the latent spaces structure of vision and language models on image-caption benchmarks using the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), we find that the representation spaces of unaligned and aligned encoders are semantically similar. In the absence of statistical similarity in aligned encoders like CLIP, we show that a possible matching of unaligned encoders exists without any training. We frame this as a seeded graph-matching problem exploiting the semantic similarity between graphs and propose two methods - a Fast Quadratic Assignment Problem optimization, and a novel localized CKA metric-based matching/retrieval. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this on several downstream tasks including cross-lingual, cross-domain caption matching and image classification.

Particularly, various MLLMs, each with distinct model architectures, training data, and training stages, have been evaluated across a broad range of MLLM benchmarks. These studies have, to varying degrees, revealed different aspects of the current capabilities of MLLMs. However, the reasoning abilities of MLLMs have not been systematically investigated. In this survey, we comprehensively review the existing evaluation protocols of multimodal reasoning, categorize and illustrate the frontiers of MLLMs, introduce recent trends in applications of MLLMs on reasoning-intensive tasks, and finally discuss current practices and future directions.

Pre-trained Large Language Models for Financial Sentiment Analysis,"Wei Luo, Dihong Gong","Financial sentiment analysis refers to classifying financial text contents into sentiment categories (e.g. positive, negative, and neutral). In this paper, we focus on the classification of financial news title, which is a challenging task due to a lack of large amount of training samples. To overcome this difficulty, we propose to adapt the pretrained large language models (LLMs) [1, 2, 3] to solve this problem. The LLMs, which are trained from huge amount of text corpora,have an advantage in text understanding and can be effectively adapted to domain-specific task while requiring very few amount of training samples. In particular, we adapt the open-source Llama2-7B model (2023) with the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) technique [4]. Experimental evaluation shows that even with the 7B model (which is relatively small for LLMs), our approach significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05215v1,2024-01
A Novel Prompt-tuning Method: Incorporating Scenario-specific Concepts into a Verbalizer,"Yong Ma, Senlin Luo, Yu-Ming Shang, Zhengjun Li, Yong Liu","The verbalizer, which serves to map label words to class labels, is an essential component of prompt-tuning. In this paper, we present a novel approach to constructing verbalizers. While existing methods for verbalizer construction mainly rely on augmenting and refining sets of synonyms or related words based on class names, this paradigm suffers from a narrow perspective and lack of abstraction, resulting in limited coverage and high bias in the label-word space. To address this issue, we propose a label-word construction process that incorporates scenario-specific concepts. Specifically, we extract rich concepts from task-specific scenarios as label-word candidates and then develop a novel cascade calibration module to refine the candidates into a set of label words for each class. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through extensive experiments on {five} widely used datasets for zero-shot text classification. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05204v1,2024-01
Monte Carlo Tree Search for Recipe Generation using GPT-2,"Karan Taneja, Richard Segal, Richard Goodwin","Automatic food recipe generation methods provide a creative tool for chefs to explore and to create new, and interesting culinary delights. Given the recent success of large language models (LLMs), they have the potential to create new recipes that can meet individual preferences, dietary constraints, and adapt to what is in your refrigerator. Existing research on using LLMs to generate recipes has shown that LLMs can be finetuned to generate realistic-sounding recipes. However, on close examination, these generated recipes often fail to meet basic requirements like including chicken as an ingredient in chicken dishes. In this paper, we propose RecipeMC, a text generation method using GPT-2 that relies on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). RecipeMC allows us to define reward functions to put soft constraints on text generation and thus improve the credibility of the generated recipes. Our results show that human evaluators prefer recipes generated with RecipeMC more often than recipes generated with other baseline methods when compared with real recipes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05199v1,2024-01
DCR: Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning for Multi-choice Question Answering with LLMs,"Zijie Meng, Yan Zhang, Zhaopeng Feng, Zuozhu Liu","Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in reasoning benchmarks with the emergence of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), particularly in multi-choice question (MCQ). However, current works equally resolve questions regardless of the problem-solving difficulty, leading to an excessive focus on simple items while insufficient attention on intricate ones. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy, Divide and Conquer Reasoning (DCR), to enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs for MCQs, as inspired by human beings using heuristics to first categorize tasks and then handle them separately. In particular, we first categorize questions into two subsets based on confidence score ($\mathcal{CS}$), which is estimated by statistical frequency of generated answers. Subsequently, we propose Filter Choices based Reasoning (FCR) to improve model performance on MCQs with low ($\mathcal{CS}$). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy only costs 85% of SOTA, while still achieves average accuracy improvement of 1.56% across nine datasets including arithmetic, commonsense, and logic reasoning tasks.

Convergences and Divergences between Automatic Assessment and Human Evaluation: Insights from Comparing ChatGPT-Generated Translation and Neural Machine Translation,"Zhaokun Jiang, Qianxi Lv, Ziyin Zhang, Lei Lei","Large language models have demonstrated parallel and even superior translation performance compared to neural machine translation (NMT) systems. However, existing comparative studies between them mainly rely on automated metrics, raising questions into the feasibility of these metrics and their alignment with human judgment. The present study investigates the convergences and divergences between automated metrics and human evaluation in assessing the quality of machine translation from ChatGPT and three NMT systems. To perform automatic assessment, four automated metrics are employed, while human evaluation incorporates the DQF-MQM error typology and six rubrics. Notably, automatic assessment and human evaluation converge in measuring formal fidelity (e.g., error rates), but diverge when evaluating semantic and pragmatic fidelity, with automated metrics failing to capture the improvement of ChatGPT's translation brought by prompt engineering.

"Yes, this is what I was looking for! Towards Multi-modal Medical Consultation Concern Summary Generation","Abhisek Tiwari, Shreyangshu Bera, Sriparna Saha, Pushpak Bhattacharyya, Samrat Ghosh","Over the past few years, the use of the Internet for healthcare-related tasks has grown by leaps and bounds, posing a challenge in effectively managing and processing information to ensure its efficient utilization. During moments of emotional turmoil and psychological challenges, we frequently turn to the internet as our initial source of support, choosing this over discussing our feelings with others due to the associated social stigma. In this paper, we propose a new task of multi-modal medical concern summary (MMCS) generation, which provides a short and precise summary of patients' major concerns brought up during the consultation. Nonverbal cues, such as patients' gestures and facial expressions, aid in accurately identifying patients' concerns. Doctors also consider patients' personal information, such as age and gender, in order to describe the medical condition appropriately. Motivated by the potential efficacy of patients' personal context and visual gestures, we propose a transformer-based multi-task, multi-modal intent-recognition, and medical concern summary generation (IR-MMCSG) system. Furthermore, we propose a multitasking framework for intent recognition and medical concern summary generation for doctor-patient consultations. We construct the first multi-modal medical concern summary generation (MM-MediConSummation) corpus, which includes patient-doctor consultations annotated with medical concern summaries, intents, patient personal information, doctor's recommendations, and keywords. Our experiments and analysis demonstrate (a) the significant role of patients' expressions/gestures and their personal information in intent identification and medical concern summary generation, and (b) the strong correlation between intent recognition and patients' medical concern summary generation   The dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/MMCSG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05134v1,2024-01
BELHD: Improving Biomedical Entity Linking with Homonoym Disambiguation,"Samuele Garda, Ulf Leser","Biomedical entity linking (BEL) is the task of grounding entity mentions to a knowledge base (KB). A popular approach to the task are name-based methods, i.e. those identifying the most appropriate name in the KB for a given mention, either via dense retrieval or autoregressive modeling. However, as these methods directly return KB names, they cannot cope with homonyms, i.e. different KB entities sharing the exact same name. This significantly affects their performance, especially for KBs where homonyms account for a large amount of entity mentions (e.g. UMLS and NCBI Gene). We therefore present BELHD (Biomedical Entity Linking with Homonym Disambiguation), a new name-based method that copes with this challenge. Specifically, BELHD builds upon the BioSyn (Sung et al.,2020) model introducing two crucial extensions. First, it performs a preprocessing of the KB in which it expands homonyms with an automatically chosen disambiguating string, thus enforcing unique linking decisions. Second, we introduce candidate sharing, a novel strategy to select candidates for contrastive learning that enhances the overall training signal. Experiments with 10 corpora and five entity types show that BELHD improves upon state-of-the-art approaches, achieving the best results in 6 out 10 corpora with an average improvement of 4.55pp recall@1. Furthermore, the KB preprocessing is orthogonal to the core prediction model and thus can also improve other methods, which we exemplify for GenBioEL (Yuan et al, 2022), a generative name-based BEL approach.

Noise-robust zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis conditioned on self-supervised speech-representation model with adapters,"Kenichi Fujita, Hiroshi Sato, Takanori Ashihara, Hiroki Kanagawa, Marc Delcroix, Takafumi Moriya, Yusuke Ijima","The zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) method, based on speaker embeddings extracted from reference speech using self-supervised learning (SSL) speech representations, can reproduce speaker characteristics very accurately. However, this approach suffers from degradation in speech synthesis quality when the reference speech contains noise. In this paper, we propose a noise-robust zero-shot TTS method. We incorporated adapters into the SSL model, which we fine-tuned with the TTS model using noisy reference speech. In addition, to further improve performance, we adopted a speech enhancement (SE) front-end. With these improvements, our proposed SSL-based zero-shot TTS achieved high-quality speech synthesis with noisy reference speech. Through the objective and subjective evaluations, we confirmed that the proposed method is highly robust to noise in reference speech, and effectively works in combination with SE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05111v1,2024-01
Hierarchical Classification of Transversal Skills in Job Ads Based on Sentence Embeddings,"Florin Leon, Marius Gavrilescu, Sabina-Adriana Floria, Alina-Adriana Minea","This paper proposes a classification framework aimed at identifying correlations between job ad requirements and transversal skill sets, with a focus on predicting the necessary skills for individual job descriptions using a deep learning model. The approach involves data collection, preprocessing, and labeling using ESCO (European Skills, Competences, and Occupations) taxonomy. Hierarchical classification and multi-label strategies are used for skill identification, while augmentation techniques address data imbalance, enhancing model robustness. A comparison between results obtained with English-specific and multi-language sentence embedding models reveals close accuracy. The experimental case studies detail neural network configurations, hyperparameters, and cross-validation results, highlighting the efficacy of the hierarchical approach and the suitability of the multi-language model for the diverse European job market.

Aligning Translation-Specific Understanding to General Understanding in Large Language Models,"Yichong Huang, Baohang Li, Xiaocheng Feng, Chengpeng Fu, Wenshuai Huo, Ting Liu, Bing Qin","Large Language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable abilities in understanding complex texts, offering a promising path towards human-like translation performance. However, this study reveals the misalignment between the translation-specific understanding and the general understanding inside LLMs. This understanding misalignment leads to LLMs mistakenly or literally translating some complicated concepts that they accurately comprehend in the general scenarios (e.g., QA). To align the translation-specific understanding to the general one, we propose a novel translation process, DUAT (Difficult words Understanding Aligned Translation), explicitly incorporating the general understanding on the complicated content incurring inconsistent understanding to guide the translation. Specifically, DUAT performs cross-lingual interpretation for the difficult-to-translate words and enhances the translation with the generated interpretations. Furthermore, we reframe the external tools to improve DUAT in detecting difficult words and generating helpful interpretations. We conduct experiments on the self-constructed benchmark Challenge-WMT, consisting of samples that are prone to mistranslation. Human evaluation results on high-resource and low-resource language pairs indicate that DUAT significantly facilitates the understanding alignment, which improves the translation quality (up to +3.85 COMET) and reduces the literality of the translation by -25% to -51%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05072v2,2024-01

Generating Diverse and High-Quality Texts by Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding,"Yuu Jinnai, Ukyo Honda, Tetsuro Morimura, Peinan Zhang","One of the most important challenges in text generation systems is to produce outputs that are not only correct but also diverse. Recently, Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding has gained prominence for generating sentences of the highest quality among the decoding algorithms. However, existing algorithms proposed for generating diverse outputs are predominantly based on beam search or random sampling, thus their output quality is capped by these underlying methods. In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach -- we develop diversity-promoting decoding algorithms by enforcing diversity objectives to MBR decoding. We propose two variants of MBR, Diverse MBR (DMBR) and $k$-medoids MBR (KMBR), methods to generate a set of sentences with high quality and diversity.

Generative AI Meets Semantic Communication: Evolution and Revolution of Communication Tasks,"Eleonora Grassucci, Jihong Park, Sergio Barbarossa, Seong-Lyun Kim, Jinho Choi, Danilo Comminiello","While deep generative models are showing exciting abilities in computer vision and natural language processing, their adoption in communication frameworks is still far underestimated. These methods are demonstrated to evolve solutions to classic communication problems such as denoising, restoration, or compression. Nevertheless, generative models can unveil their real potential in semantic communication frameworks, in which the receiver is not asked to recover the sequence of bits used to encode the transmitted (semantic) message, but only to regenerate content that is semantically consistent with the transmitted message. Disclosing generative models capabilities in semantic communication paves the way for a paradigm shift with respect to conventional communication systems, which has great potential to reduce the amount of data traffic and offers a revolutionary versatility to novel tasks and applications that were not even conceivable a few years ago. In this paper, we present a unified perspective of deep generative models in semantic communication and we unveil their revolutionary role in future communication frameworks, enabling emerging applications and tasks. Finally, we analyze the challenges and opportunities to face to develop generative models specifically tailored for communication systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06803v1,2024-01
Bootstrapping LLM-based Task-Oriented Dialogue Agents via Self-Talk,"Dennis Ulmer, Elman Mansimov, Kaixiang Lin, Justin Sun, Xibin Gao, Yi Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) are powerful dialogue agents, but specializing them towards fulfilling a specific function can be challenging. Instructing tuning, i.e. tuning models on instruction and sample responses generated by humans (Ouyang et al., 2022), has proven as an effective method to do so, yet requires a number of data samples that a) might not be available or b) costly to generate. Furthermore, this cost increases when the goal is to make the LLM follow a specific workflow within a dialogue instead of single instructions. Inspired by the self-play technique in reinforcement learning and the use of LLMs to simulate human agents, we propose a more effective method for data collection through LLMs engaging in a conversation in various roles. This approach generates a training data via ""self-talk"" of LLMs that can be refined and utilized for supervised fine-tuning. We introduce an automated way to measure the (partial) success of a dialogue. This metric is used to filter the generated conversational data that is fed back in LLM for training. Based on our automated and human evaluations of conversation quality, we demonstrate that such self-talk data improves results. In addition, we examine the various characteristics that showcase the quality of generated dialogues and how they can be connected to their potential utility as training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05033v1,2024-01
Whose wife is it anyway? Assessing bias against same-gender relationships in machine translation,"Ian Stewart, Rada Mihalcea","Machine translation often suffers from biased data and algorithms that can lead to unacceptable errors in system output. While bias in gender norms has been investigated, less is known about whether MT systems encode bias about social relationships, e.g., ""the lawyer kissed her wife."" We investigate the degree of bias against same-gender relationships in MT systems, using generated template sentences drawn from several noun-gender languages (e.g., Spanish) and comprised of popular occupation nouns. We find that three popular MT services consistently fail to accurately translate sentences concerning relationships between entities of the same gender. The error rate varies considerably based on the context, and same-gender sentences referencing high female-representation occupations are translated with lower accuracy. We provide this work as a case study in the evaluation of intrinsic bias in NLP systems with respect to social relationships.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04972v2,2024-01
Can AI Write Classical Chinese Poetry like Humans? An Empirical Study Inspired by Turing Test,"Zekun Deng, Hao Yang, Jun Wang","Some argue that the essence of humanity, such as creativity and sentiment, can never be mimicked by machines. This paper casts doubt on this belief by studying a vital question: Can AI compose poetry as well as humans? To answer the question, we propose ProFTAP, a novel evaluation framework inspired by Turing test to assess AI's poetry writing capability. We apply it on current large language models (LLMs) and find that recent LLMs do indeed possess the ability to write classical Chinese poems nearly indistinguishable from those of humans. We also reveal that various open-source LLMs can outperform GPT-4 on this task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04952v1,2024-01
Hierarchical Knowledge Distillation on Text Graph for Data-limited Attribute Inference,"Quan Li, Shixiong Jing, Lingwei Chen","The popularization of social media increases user engagements and generates a large amount of user-oriented data. Among them, text data (e.g., tweets, blogs) significantly attracts researchers and speculators to infer user attributes (e.g., age, gender, location) for fulfilling their intents. Generally, this line of work casts attribute inference as a text classification problem, and starts to leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to utilize higher-level representations of source texts. However, these text graphs are constructed over words, suffering from high memory consumption and ineffectiveness on few labeled texts. To address this challenge, we design a text-graph-based few-shot learning model for attribute inferences on social media text data. Our model first constructs and refines a text graph using manifold learning and message passing, which offers a better trade-off between expressiveness and complexity. Afterwards, to further use cross-domain texts and unlabeled texts to improve few-shot performance, a hierarchical knowledge distillation is devised over text graph to optimize the problem, which derives better text representations, and advances model generalization ability. Experiments on social media datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our model on attribute inferences with considerably fewer labeled texts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06802v1,2024-01
Learning Audio Concepts from Counterfactual Natural Language,"Ali Vosoughi, Luca Bondi, Ho-Hsiang Wu, Chenliang Xu","Conventional audio classification relied on predefined classes, lacking the ability to learn from free-form text. Recent methods unlock learning joint audio-text embeddings from raw audio-text pairs describing audio in natural language. Despite recent advancements, there is little exploration of systematic methods to train models for recognizing sound events and sources in alternative scenarios, such as distinguishing fireworks from gunshots at outdoor events in similar situations. This study introduces causal reasoning and counterfactual analysis in the audio domain. We use counterfactual instances and include them in our model across different aspects. Our model considers acoustic characteristics and sound source information from human-annotated reference texts. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we conducted pre-training utilizing multiple audio captioning datasets. We then evaluate with several common downstream tasks, demonstrating the merits of the proposed method as one of the first works leveraging counterfactual information in audio domain. Specifically, the top-1 accuracy in open-ended language-based audio retrieval task increased by more than 43%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04935v1,2024-01
The Impact of Reasoning Step Length on Large Language Models,"Mingyu Jin, Qinkai Yu, Dong Shu, Haiyan Zhao, Wenyue Hua, Yanda Meng, Yongfeng Zhang, Mengnan Du","Chain of Thought (CoT) is significant in improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the correlation between the effectiveness of CoT and the length of reasoning steps in prompts remains largely unknown. To shed light on this, we have conducted several empirical experiments to explore the relations. Specifically, we design experiments that expand and compress the rationale reasoning steps within CoT demonstrations while keeping all other factors constant. We have the following key findings. First, the results indicate that lengthening the reasoning steps in prompts, even without adding new information into the prompt, considerably enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities across multiple datasets. Alternatively, shortening the reasoning steps, even while preserving the key information, significantly diminishes the reasoning abilities of models. This finding highlights the importance of the number of steps in CoT prompts and provides practical guidance to make better use of LLMs' potential in complex problem-solving scenarios. Second, we also investigated the relationship between the performance of CoT and the rationales used in demonstrations. Surprisingly, the result shows that even incorrect rationales can yield favorable outcomes if they maintain the requisite length of inference. Third, we observed that the advantages of increasing reasoning steps are task-dependent: simpler tasks require fewer steps, whereas complex tasks gain significantly from longer inference sequences. The code is available at https://github.com/MingyuJ666/The-Impact-of-Reasoning-Step-Length-on-Large-Language-Models",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04925v4,2024-01
A General-purpose AI Avatar in Healthcare,"Nicholas Yan, Gil Alterovitz","Recent advancements in machine learning and natural language processing have led to the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) as a valuable tool in the healthcare industry. Using large language models (LLMs) as conversational agents or chatbots has the potential to assist doctors in diagnosing patients, detecting early symptoms of diseases, and providing health advice to patients. This paper focuses on the role of chatbots in healthcare and explores the use of avatars to make AI interactions more appealing to patients. A framework of a general-purpose AI avatar application is demonstrated by using a three-category prompt dictionary and prompt improvement mechanism. A two-phase approach is suggested to fine-tune a general-purpose AI language model and create different AI avatars to discuss medical issues with users. Prompt engineering enhances the chatbot's conversational abilities and personality traits, fostering a more human-like interaction with patients. Ultimately, the injection of personality into the chatbot could potentially increase patient engagement. Future directions for research include investigating ways to improve chatbots' understanding of context and ensuring the accuracy of their outputs through fine-tuning with specialized medical data sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12981v1,2024-01
ANGO: A Next-Level Evaluation Benchmark For Generation-Oriented Language Models In Chinese Domain,Bingchao Wang,"Recently, various Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluation datasets have emerged, but most of them have issues with distorted rankings and difficulty in model capabilities analysis. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces ANGO, a Chinese multi-choice question evaluation benchmark. ANGO proposes Keypoint categorization standard for the first time, each question in ANGO can correspond to multiple keypoints, effectively enhancing interpretability of evaluation results. Base on performance of real humans, we build a quantifiable question difficulty standard and divide ANGO questions into 9 difficulty levels, which provide more precise guidance for model training. To minimize data leakage impact and fully leverage ANGO's innovative features, we have engineered exclusive sampling strategies and a new evaluation framework that support swift testset iteration. Our experiments demonstrate that ANGO poses a stronger challenge to models and reveals more details in evaluation result compared to existing benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04898v2,2024-01
Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing RAG for Domain Chatbots,"Mandar Kulkarni, Praveen Tangarajan, Kyung Kim, Anusua Trivedi","With the advent of Large Language Models (LLM), conversational assistants have become prevalent for domain use cases. LLMs acquire the ability to contextual question answering through training, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) further enables the bot to answer domain-specific questions. This paper describes a RAG-based approach for building a chatbot that answers user's queries using Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) data. We train an in-house retrieval embedding model using infoNCE loss, and experimental results demonstrate that the in-house model works significantly better than the well-known general-purpose public embedding model, both in terms of retrieval accuracy and Out-of-Domain (OOD) query detection. As an LLM, we use an open API-based paid ChatGPT model. We noticed that a previously retrieved-context could be used to generate an answer for specific patterns/sequences of queries (e.g., follow-up queries). Hence, there is a scope to optimize the number of LLM tokens and cost. Assuming a fixed retrieval model and an LLM, we optimize the number of LLM tokens using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, we propose a policy-based model external to the RAG, which interacts with the RAG pipeline through policy actions and updates the policy to optimize the cost. The policy model can perform two actions: to fetch FAQ context or skip retrieval. We use the open API-based GPT-4 as the reward model. We then train a policy model using policy gradient on multiple training chat sessions. As a policy model, we experimented with a public gpt-2 model and an in-house BERT model. With the proposed RL-based optimization combined with similarity threshold, we are able to achieve significant cost savings while getting a slightly improved accuracy. Though we demonstrate results for the FAQ chatbot, the proposed RL approach is generic and can be experimented with any existing RAG pipeline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06800v1,2024-01
Multi-User Chat Assistant (MUCA): a Framework Using LLMs to Facilitate Group Conversations,"Manqing Mao, Paishun Ting, Yijian Xiang, Mingyang Xu, Julia Chen, Jianzhe Lin","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have provided a new avenue for chatbot development. Most existing research, however, has primarily centered on single-user chatbots that determine ""What"" to answer. This paper highlights the complexity of multi-user chatbots, introducing the 3W design dimensions: ""What"" to say, ""When"" to respond, and ""Who"" to answer. Additionally, we proposed Multi-User Chat Assistant (MUCA), an LLM-based framework tailored for group discussions. MUCA consists of three main modules: Sub-topic Generator, Dialog Analyzer, and Conversational Strategies Arbitrator. These modules jointly determine suitable response contents, timings, and appropriate addressees. This paper further proposes an LLM-based Multi-User Simulator (MUS) to ease MUCA's optimization, enabling faster simulation of conversations between the chatbot and simulated users, and speeding up MUCA's early development. In goal-oriented conversations with a small to medium number of participants, MUCA demonstrates effectiveness in tasks like chiming in at appropriate timings, generating relevant content, and improving user engagement, as shown by case studies and user studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04883v4,2024-01
Attendre: Wait To Attend By Retrieval With Evicted Queries in Memory-Based Transformers for Long Context Processing,"Zi Yang, Nan Hua","As LLMs have become capable of processing more complex types of inputs, researchers have recently studied how to efficiently and affordably process possibly arbitrarily long sequences. One effective approach is to use a FIFO memory to store keys and values of an attention sublayer from past chunks to allow subsequent queries to attend. However, this approach requires a large memory and/or takes into the consideration the specific LM architecture. Moreover, due to the causal nature between the key-values in prior context and the queries at present, this approach cannot be extended to bidirectional attention such as in an encoder-decoder or PrefixLM decoder-only architecture. In this paper, we propose to use eviction policies, such as LRA and LFA, to reduce the memory size and adapt to various architectures, and we also propose the Attendre layer, a wait-to-attend mechanism by retrieving the key-value memory (K/V memory) with evicted queries in the query memory (Q memory). As a first step, we evaluate this method in the context length extension setup using the TriviaQA reading comprehension task, and show the effectiveness of the approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04881v1,2024-01

An Analysis of User Behaviors for Objectively Evaluating Spoken Dialogue Systems,"Koji Inoue, Divesh Lala, Keiko Ochi, Tatsuya Kawahara, Gabriel Skantze","Establishing evaluation schemes for spoken dialogue systems is important, but it can also be challenging. While subjective evaluations are commonly used in user experiments, objective evaluations are necessary for research comparison and reproducibility. To address this issue, we propose a framework for indirectly but objectively evaluating systems based on users' behaviors. In this paper, to this end, we investigate the relationship between user behaviors and subjective evaluation scores in social dialogue tasks: attentive listening, job interview, and first-meeting conversation. The results reveal that in dialogue tasks where user utterances are primary, such as attentive listening and job interview, indicators like the number of utterances and words play a significant role in evaluation. Observing disfluency also can indicate the effectiveness of formal tasks, such as job interview. On the other hand, in dialogue tasks with high interactivity, such as first-meeting conversation, behaviors related to turn-taking, like average switch pause length, become more important. These findings suggest that selecting appropriate user behaviors can provide valuable insights for objective evaluation in each social dialogue task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04867v2,2024-01

In this study we tackle the challenges of modeling long user histories for preference understanding in natural language. Specifically, we introduce a new User Embedding Module (UEM) that efficiently processes user history in free-form text by compressing and representing them as embeddings, to use them as soft prompts to a LM. Our experiments demonstrate the superior capability of this approach in handling significantly longer histories compared to conventional text based prompting methods, yielding substantial improvements in predictive performance. The main contribution of this research is to demonstrate the ability to bias language models with user signals represented as embeddings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04858v1,2024-01
"Are Language Models More Like Libraries or Like Librarians? Bibliotechnism, the Novel Reference Problem, and the Attitudes of LLMs","Harvey Lederman, Kyle Mahowald","Are LLMs cultural technologies like photocopiers or printing presses, which transmit information but cannot create new content? A challenge for this idea, which we call bibliotechnism, is that LLMs generate novel text. We begin with a defense of bibliotechnism, showing how even novel text may inherit its meaning from original human-generated text. We then argue that bibliotechnism faces an independent challenge from examples in which LLMs generate novel reference, using new names to refer to new entities. Such examples could be explained if LLMs were not cultural technologies but had beliefs, desires, and intentions. According to interpretationism in the philosophy of mind, a system has such attitudes if and only if its behavior is well explained by the hypothesis that it does. Interpretationists may hold that LLMs have attitudes, and thus have a simple solution to the novel reference problem. We emphasize, however, that interpretationism is compatible with very simple creatures having attitudes and differs sharply from views that presuppose these attitudes require consciousness, sentience, or intelligence (topics about which we make no claims).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04854v3,2024-01
Entity Recognition from Colloquial Text,"Tamara Babaian, Jennifer Xu","Extraction of concepts and entities of interest from non-formal texts such as social media posts and informal communication is an important capability for decision support systems in many domains, including healthcare, customer relationship management, and others. Despite the recent advances in training large language models for a variety of natural language processing tasks, the developed models and techniques have mainly focused on formal texts and do not perform as well on colloquial data, which is characterized by a number of distinct challenges. In our research, we focus on the healthcare domain and investigate the problem of symptom recognition from colloquial texts by designing and evaluating several training strategies for BERT-based model fine-tuning. These strategies are distinguished by the choice of the base model, the training corpora, and application of term perturbations in the training data. The best-performing models trained using these strategies outperform the state-of-the-art specialized symptom recognizer by a large margin. Through a series of experiments, we have found specific patterns of model behavior associated with the training strategies we designed. We present design principles for training strategies for effective entity recognition in colloquial texts based on our findings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04853v1,2024-01

MoSECroT: Model Stitching with Static Word Embeddings for Crosslingual Zero-shot Transfer,"Haotian Ye, Yihong Liu, Chunlan Ma, Hinrich Schütze","Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, pre-training such models can take considerable resources that are almost only available to high-resource languages. On the contrary, static word embeddings are easier to train in terms of computing resources and the amount of data required. In this paper, we introduce MoSECroT Model Stitching with Static Word Embeddings for Crosslingual Zero-shot Transfer), a novel and challenging task that is especially relevant to low-resource languages for which static word embeddings are available. To tackle the task, we present the first framework that leverages relative representations to construct a common space for the embeddings of a source language PLM and the static word embeddings of a target language. In this way, we can train the PLM on source-language training data and perform zero-shot transfer to the target language by simply swapping the embedding layer. However, through extensive experiments on two classification datasets, we show that although our proposed framework is competitive with weak baselines when addressing MoSECroT, it fails to achieve competitive results compared with some strong baselines. In this paper, we attempt to explain this negative result and provide several thoughts on possible improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04821v2,2024-01
Translate-Distill: Learning Cross-Language Dense Retrieval by Translation and Distillation,"Eugene Yang, Dawn Lawrie, James Mayfield, Douglas W. Oard, Scott Miller","Prior work on English monolingual retrieval has shown that a cross-encoder trained using a large number of relevance judgments for query-document pairs can be used as a teacher to train more efficient, but similarly effective, dual-encoder student models. Applying a similar knowledge distillation approach to training an efficient dual-encoder model for Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), where queries and documents are in different languages, is challenging due to the lack of a sufficiently large training collection when the query and document languages differ. The state of the art for CLIR thus relies on translating queries, documents, or both from the large English MS MARCO training set, an approach called Translate-Train. This paper proposes an alternative, Translate-Distill, in which knowledge distillation from either a monolingual cross-encoder or a CLIR cross-encoder is used to train a dual-encoder CLIR student model. This richer design space enables the teacher model to perform inference in an optimized setting, while training the student model directly for CLIR.

Model Editing Harms General Abilities of Large Language Models: Regularization to the Rescue,"Jia-Chen Gu, Hao-Xiang Xu, Jun-Yu Ma, Pan Lu, Zhen-Hua Ling, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng","Model editing is a technique that edits the large language models (LLMs) with updated knowledge to alleviate hallucinations without resource-intensive retraining. While current model editing methods can effectively modify a model's behavior within a specific area of interest, they often overlook the potential unintended side effects on the general abilities of LLMs such as reasoning, natural language inference, and question answering. In this paper, we raise concerns that model editing's improvements on factuality may come at the cost of a significant degradation of the model's general abilities. We systematically analyze the side effects by evaluating four popular editing methods on three LLMs across eight representative tasks. Our extensive empirical experiments show that it is challenging for current editing methods to simultaneously improve factuality of LLMs and maintain their general abilities. Our analysis reveals that the side effects are caused by model editing altering the original model weights excessively, leading to overfitting to the edited facts. To mitigate this, a method named RECT is proposed to regularize the edit update weights by imposing constraints on their complexity based on the RElative Change in weighT. Evaluation results show that RECT can significantly mitigate the side effects of editing while still maintaining over 94% editing performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04700v4,2024-01
Narrowing the Knowledge Evaluation Gap: Open-Domain Question Answering with Multi-Granularity Answers,"Gal Yona, Roee Aharoni, Mor Geva","Factual questions typically can be answered correctly at different levels of granularity. For example, both ``August 4, 1961'' and ``1961'' are correct answers to the question ``When was Barack Obama born?''. Standard question answering (QA) evaluation protocols, however, do not explicitly take this into account and compare a predicted answer against answers of a single granularity level. In this work, we propose GRANOLA QA, a novel evaluation setting where a predicted answer is evaluated in terms of accuracy and informativeness against a set of multi-granularity answers. We present a simple methodology for enriching existing datasets with multi-granularity answers, and create GRANOLA-EQ, a multi-granularity version of the EntityQuestions dataset. We evaluate a range of decoding methods on GRANOLA-EQ, including a new algorithm, called Decoding with Response Aggregation (DRAG), that is geared towards aligning the response granularity with the model's uncertainty. Our experiments show that large language models with standard decoding tend to generate specific answers, which are often incorrect. In contrast, when evaluated on multi-granularity answers, DRAG yields a nearly 20 point increase in accuracy on average, which further increases for rare entities. Overall, this reveals that standard evaluation and decoding schemes may significantly underestimate the knowledge encapsulated in LMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04695v2,2024-01

Across a series of challenging generative tasks such as grade-school math and SQL query generation, which require fine-tuning for good performance, we show that RoSA outperforms LoRA, pure sparse fine-tuning, and alternative hybrid methods at the same parameter budget, and can even recover the performance of FFT on some tasks. We provide system support for RoSA to complement the training algorithm, specifically in the form of sparse GPU kernels which enable memory- and computationally-efficient training, and show that it is also compatible with low-precision base weights, resulting in the first joint representation combining quantization, low-rank and sparse approximations.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models,"Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong","Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Particularly, the prevalence of negative emotional states has been correlated with negative outcomes for mental health, necessitating a comprehensive analysis of their occurrence and impact on individuals. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset named DepressionEmo designed to detect 8 emotions associated with depression by 6037 examples of long Reddit user posts. This dataset was created through a majority vote over inputs by zero-shot classifications from pre-trained models and validating the quality by annotators and ChatGPT, exhibiting an acceptable level of interrater reliability between annotators.

DebugBench: Evaluating Debugging Capability of Large Language Models,"Runchu Tian, Yining Ye, Yujia Qin, Xin Cong, Yankai Lin, Yinxu Pan, Yesai Wu, Haotian Hui, Weichuan Liu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional coding capability. However, as another critical component of programming proficiency, the debugging capability of LLMs remains relatively unexplored. Previous evaluations of LLMs' debugging ability are significantly limited by the risk of data leakage, the scale of the dataset, and the variety of tested bugs. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce `DebugBench', an LLM debugging benchmark consisting of 4,253 instances. It covers four major bug categories and 18 minor types in C++, Java, and Python. To construct DebugBench, we collect code snippets from the LeetCode community, implant bugs into source data with GPT-4, and assure rigorous quality checks. We evaluate two commercial and four open-source models in a zero-shot scenario. We find that (1) while closed-source models exhibit inferior debugging performance compared to humans, open-source models relatively lower pass rate scores; (2) the complexity of debugging notably fluctuates depending on the bug category; (3) incorporating runtime feedback has a clear impact on debugging performance which is not always helpful. As an extension, we also compare LLM debugging and code generation, revealing a strong correlation between them for closed-source models. These findings will benefit the development of LLMs in debugging.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04621v3,2024-01
Agent Alignment in Evolving Social Norms,"Shimin Li, Tianxiang Sun, Qinyuan Cheng, Xipeng Qiu","Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly permeating various domains of human production and life, highlighting the importance of aligning them with human values. The current alignment of AI systems primarily focuses on passively aligning LLMs through human intervention. However, agents possess characteristics like receiving environmental feedback and self-evolution, rendering the LLM alignment methods inadequate. In response, we propose an evolutionary framework for agent evolution and alignment, named EvolutionaryAgent, which transforms agent alignment into a process of evolution and selection under the principle of survival of the fittest. In an environment where social norms continuously evolve, agents better adapted to the current social norms will have a higher probability of survival and proliferation, while those inadequately aligned dwindle over time. Experimental results assessing the agents from multiple perspectives in aligning with social norms demonstrate that EvolutionaryAgent can align progressively better with the evolving social norms while maintaining its proficiency in general tasks. Effectiveness tests conducted on various open and closed-source LLMs as the foundation for agents also prove the applicability of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04620v4,2024-01
Language Detection for Transliterated Content,"Selva Kumar S, Afifah Khan Mohammed Ajmal Khan, Chirag Manjeshwar, Imadh Ajaz Banday","In the contemporary digital era, the Internet functions as an unparalleled catalyst, dismantling geographical and linguistic barriers particularly evident in texting.

An Assessment on Comprehending Mental Health through Large Language Models,"Mihael Arcan, David-Paul Niland, Fionn Delahunty","Mental health challenges pose considerable global burdens on individuals and communities. Recent data indicates that more than 20% of adults may encounter at least one mental disorder in their lifetime. On the one hand, the advancements in large language models have facilitated diverse applications, yet a significant research gap persists in understanding and enhancing the potential of large language models within the domain of mental health. On the other hand, across various applications, an outstanding question involves the capacity of large language models to comprehend expressions of human mental health conditions in natural language. This study presents an initial evaluation of large language models in addressing this gap.

Evaluating Language Model Agency through Negotiations,"Tim R. Davidson, Veniamin Veselovsky, Martin Josifoski, Maxime Peyrard, Antoine Bosselut, Michal Kosinski, Robert West","We introduce an approach to evaluate language model (LM) agency using negotiation games. This approach better reflects real-world use cases and addresses some of the shortcomings of alternative LM benchmarks. Negotiation games enable us to study multi-turn, and cross-model interactions, modulate complexity, and side-step accidental evaluation data leakage. We use our approach to test six widely used and publicly accessible LMs, evaluating performance and alignment in both self-play and cross-play settings. Noteworthy findings include: (i) only closed-source models tested here were able to complete these tasks; (ii) cooperative bargaining games proved to be most challenging to the models; and (iii) even the most powerful models sometimes ""lose"" to weaker opponents",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04536v2,2024-01

As the models' size increases, LMs demonstrate enhancements in measurable aspects and the development of new qualitative features. However, despite researchers' attention and the rapid growth in LM application, the capabilities, limitations, and associated risks still need to be better understood. To address these issues, we introduce an open Multimodal Evaluation of Russian-language Architectures (MERA), a new instruction benchmark for evaluating foundation models oriented towards the Russian language. The benchmark encompasses 21 evaluation tasks for generative models in 11 skill domains and is designed as a black-box test to ensure the exclusion of data leakage. The paper introduces a methodology to evaluate FMs and LMs in zero- and few-shot fixed instruction settings that can be extended to other modalities. We propose an evaluation methodology, an open-source code base for the MERA assessment, and a leaderboard with a submission system. We evaluate open LMs as baselines and find that they are still far behind the human level. We publicly release MERA to guide forthcoming research, anticipate groundbreaking model features, standardize the evaluation procedure, and address potential societal drawbacks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04531v3,2024-01

The Critique of Critique,"Shichao Sun, Junlong Li, Weizhe Yuan, Ruifeng Yuan, Wenjie Li, Pengfei Liu","Critique, as a natural language description for assessing the quality of model-generated content, has played a vital role in the training, evaluation, and refinement of LLMs. However, a systematic method to evaluate the quality of critique is lacking. In this paper, we pioneer the critique of critique, termed MetaCritique, which builds specific quantification criteria. To achieve a reliable evaluation outcome, we propose Atomic Information Units (AIUs), which describe the critique in a more fine-grained manner. MetaCritique aggregates each AIU's judgment for the overall score. Moreover, MetaCritique delivers a natural language rationale for the intricate reasoning within each judgment. Lastly, we construct a meta-evaluation dataset covering 4 tasks across 16 public datasets involving human-written and LLM-generated critiques. Experiments demonstrate that MetaCritique can achieve near-human performance. Our study can facilitate future research in LLM critiques based on our following observations and released resources: (1) superior critiques judged by MetaCritique can lead to better refinements, indicating that it can potentially enhance the alignment of existing LLMs; (2) the leaderboard of critique models reveals that open-source critique models commonly suffer from factuality issues; (3) relevant code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/MetaCritique to support deeper exploration; (4) an API at PyPI with the usage documentation in Appendix C allows users to assess the critique conveniently.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04518v2,2024-01

The study employs a method based on text probability calculation, applying it to various generated prompts. The experiments demonstrate a strong correlation between the effectiveness of language model prompts and classic patterns, indicating that preliminary prompt selection can be carried out using smaller models before moving to larger ones. We also explore prompts for predicting co-hyponyms and improving hypernymy predictions by augmenting prompts with additional information through automatically identified co-hyponyms.

Rewriting the Code: A Simple Method for Large Language Model Augmented Code Search,"Haochen Li, Xin Zhou, Zhiqi Shen","In code search, the Generation-Augmented Retrieval (GAR) framework, which generates exemplar code snippets to augment queries, has emerged as a promising strategy to address the principal challenge of modality misalignment between code snippets and natural language queries, particularly with the demonstrated code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nevertheless, our preliminary investigations indicate that the improvements conferred by such an LLM-augmented framework are somewhat constrained. This limitation could potentially be ascribed to the fact that the generated codes, albeit functionally accurate, frequently display a pronounced stylistic deviation from the ground truth code in the codebase. In this paper, we extend the foundational GAR framework and propose a simple yet effective method that additionally Rewrites the Code (ReCo) within the codebase for style normalization. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCo significantly boosts retrieval accuracy across sparse (up to 35.7%), zero-shot dense (up to 27.6%), and fine-tuned dense (up to 23.6%) retrieval settings in diverse search scenarios. To further elucidate the advantages of ReCo and stimulate research in code style normalization, we introduce Code Style Similarity, the first metric tailored to quantify stylistic similarities in code. Notably, our empirical findings reveal the inadequacy of existing metrics in capturing stylistic nuances.

Continuously Learning New Words in Automatic Speech Recognition,"Christian Huber, Alexander Waibel","Despite recent advances, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are still far from perfect. Typical errors include acronyms, named entities, and domain-specific special words for which little or no labeled data is available. To address the problem of recognizing these words, we propose a self-supervised continual learning approach: Given the audio of a lecture talk with the corresponding slides, we bias the model towards decoding new words from the slides by using a memory-enhanced ASR model from the literature. Then, we perform inference on the talk, collecting utterances that contain detected new words into an adaptation data set. Continual learning is then performed by training adaptation weights added to the model on this data set. The whole procedure is iterated for many talks. We show that with this approach, we obtain increasing performance on the new words when they occur more frequently (more than 80% recall) while preserving the general performance of the model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04482v3,2024-01
Fighting Fire with Fire: Adversarial Prompting to Generate a Misinformation Detection Dataset,"Shrey Satapara, Parth Mehta, Debasis Ganguly, Sandip Modha","The recent success in language generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, Bard, Llama etc., can potentially lead to concerns about their possible misuse in inducing mass agitation and communal hatred via generating fake news and spreading misinformation. Traditional means of developing a misinformation ground-truth dataset does not scale well because of the extensive manual effort required to annotate the data. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based approach of creating silver-standard ground-truth datasets for identifying misinformation. Specifically speaking, given a trusted news article, our proposed approach involves prompting LLMs to automatically generate a summarised version of the original article. The prompts in our proposed approach act as a controlling mechanism to generate specific types of factual incorrectness in the generated summaries, e.g., incorrect quantities, false attributions etc. To investigate the usefulness of this dataset, we conduct a set of experiments where we train a range of supervised models for the task of misinformation detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04481v1,2024-01

TransportationGames: Benchmarking Transportation Knowledge of (Multimodal) Large Language Models,"Xue Zhang, Xiangyu Shi, Xinyue Lou, Rui Qi, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu, Wenjuan Han","Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown excellent general capabilities, even exhibiting adaptability in many professional domains such as law, economics, transportation, and medicine. Currently, many domain-specific benchmarks have been proposed to verify the performance of (M)LLMs in specific fields. Among various domains, transportation plays a crucial role in modern society as it impacts the economy, the environment, and the quality of life for billions of people. However, it is unclear how much traffic knowledge (M)LLMs possess and whether they can reliably perform transportation-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose TransportationGames, a carefully designed and thorough evaluation benchmark for assessing (M)LLMs in the transportation domain. By comprehensively considering the applications in real-world scenarios and referring to the first three levels in Bloom's Taxonomy, we test the performance of various (M)LLMs in memorizing, understanding, and applying transportation knowledge by the selected tasks.

Make Prompts Adaptable: Bayesian Modeling for Vision-Language Prompt Learning with Data-Dependent Prior,"Youngjae Cho, HeeSun Bae, Seungjae Shin, Yeo Dong Youn, Weonyoung Joo, Il-Chul Moon","Recent Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models have become the backbone for many downstream tasks, but they are utilized as frozen model without learning. Prompt learning is a method to improve the pre-trained VLP model by adding a learnable context vector to the inputs of the text encoder. In a few-shot learning scenario of the downstream task, MLE training can lead the context vector to over-fit dominant image features in the training data. This overfitting can potentially harm the generalization ability, especially in the presence of a distribution shift between the training and test dataset. This paper presents a Bayesian-based framework of prompt learning, which could alleviate the overfitting issues on few-shot learning application and increase the adaptability of prompts on unseen instances. Specifically, modeling data-dependent prior enhances the adaptability of text features for both seen and unseen image features without the trade-off of performance between them. Based on the Bayesian framework, we utilize the Wasserstein Gradient Flow in the estimation of our target posterior distribution, which enables our prompt to be flexible in capturing the complex modes of image features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark datasets for several experiments by showing statistically significant improvements on performance compared to existing methods.

Estimating Text Similarity based on Semantic Concept Embeddings,"Tim vor der Brück, Marc Pouly","Due to their ease of use and high accuracy, Word2Vec (W2V) word embeddings enjoy great success in the semantic representation of words, sentences, and whole documents as well as for semantic similarity estimation. However, they have the shortcoming that they are directly extracted from a surface representation, which does not adequately represent human thought processes and also performs poorly for highly ambiguous words. Therefore, we propose Semantic Concept Embeddings (CE) based on the MultiNet Semantic Network (SN) formalism, which addresses both shortcomings. The evaluation on a marketing target group distribution task showed that the accuracy of predicted target groups can be increased by combining traditional word embeddings with semantic CEs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04422v1,2024-01
Chain-of-Table: Evolving Tables in the Reasoning Chain for Table Understanding,"Zilong Wang, Hao Zhang, Chun-Liang Li, Julian Martin Eisenschlos, Vincent Perot, Zifeng Wang, Lesly Miculicich, Yasuhisa Fujii, Jingbo Shang, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister","Table-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction to tackle many table understanding tasks, such as table-based question answering and fact verification. Compared with generic reasoning, table-based reasoning requires the extraction of underlying semantics from both free-form questions and semi-structured tabular data. Chain-of-Thought and its similar approaches incorporate the reasoning chain in the form of textual context, but it is still an open question how to effectively leverage tabular data in the reasoning chain. We propose the Chain-of-Table framework, where tabular data is explicitly used in the reasoning chain as a proxy for intermediate thoughts. Specifically, we guide LLMs using in-context learning to iteratively generate operations and update the table to represent a tabular reasoning chain. LLMs can therefore dynamically plan the next operation based on the results of the previous ones. This continuous evolution of the table forms a chain, showing the reasoning process for a given tabular problem. The chain carries structured information of the intermediate results, enabling more accurate and reliable predictions. Chain-of-Table achieves new state-of-the-art performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and TabFact benchmarks across multiple LLM choices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04398v2,2024-01

Probabilistic emotion and sentiment modelling of patient-reported experiences,"Curtis Murray, Lewis Mitchell, Jonathan Tuke, Mark Mackay","This study introduces a novel methodology for modelling patient emotions from online patient experience narratives.

We develop a probabilistic, context-specific emotion recommender system capable of predicting both multilabel emotions and binary sentiments using a naive Bayes classifier using contextually meaningful topics as predictors. The superior performance of our predicted emotions under this model compared to baseline models was assessed using the information retrieval metrics nDCG and Q-measure, and our predicted sentiments achieved an F1 score of 0.921, significantly outperforming standard sentiment lexicons.

Improving the Robustness of Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue via Contrastive Learning,"Jiaan Wang, Jianfeng Qu, Kexin Wang, Zhixu Li, Wen Hua, Ximing Li, An Liu","Knowledge-grounded dialogue (KGD) learns to generate an informative response based on a given dialogue context and external knowledge (\emph{e.g.}, knowledge graphs; KGs). Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and pre-training techniques has brought great success to knowledge-grounded dialogue. However, when building KGD systems in real applications, there are various real-world noises that are inevitable to face. For example, the dialogue context might involve perturbations such as misspellings and abbreviations. In addition, KGs typically suffer from incompletion and also might contain erroneous and outdated facts. Such real-world noises pose a challenge to the robustness of KGD systems and hinder their applications in the real world. In this paper, we propose an entity-based contrastive learning framework for improving the robustness of KGD. Specifically, we make use of the entity information in a KGD sample to create both its positive and negative samples which involve semantic-irrelevant and semantic-relevant perturbations, respectively. The contrastive learning framework ensures the KGD model is aware of these two types of perturbations, thus generating informative responses with the potentially noisy inputs in real applications. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance in terms of automatic evaluation scores, verifying its effectiveness and potentiality. Furthermore, we show that our method can generate better responses than comparison models in both the noisy and the few-shot settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04361v1,2024-01
LAMPAT: Low-Rank Adaption for Multilingual Paraphrasing Using Adversarial Training,"Khoi M. Le, Trinh Pham, Tho Quan, Anh Tuan Luu","Paraphrases are texts that convey the same meaning while using different words or sentence structures. It can be used as an automatic data augmentation tool for many Natural Language Processing tasks, especially when dealing with low-resource languages, where data shortage is a significant problem. To generate a paraphrase in multilingual settings, previous studies have leveraged the knowledge from the machine translation field, i.e., forming a paraphrase through zero-shot machine translation in the same language. Despite good performance on human evaluation, those methods still require parallel translation datasets, thus making them inapplicable to languages that do not have parallel corpora. To mitigate that problem, we proposed the first unsupervised multilingual paraphrasing model, LAMPAT ($\textbf{L}$ow-rank $\textbf{A}$daptation for $\textbf{M}$ultilingual $\textbf{P}$araphrasing using $\textbf{A}$dversarial $\textbf{T}$raining), by which monolingual dataset is sufficient enough to generate a human-like and diverse sentence.

Private Fine-tuning of Large Language Models with Zeroth-order Optimization,"Xinyu Tang, Ashwinee Panda, Milad Nasr, Saeed Mahloujifar, Prateek Mittal","Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) allows models to be trained in a privacy-preserving manner, but has proven difficult to scale to the era of foundation models. We introduce DP-ZO, a private fine-tuning framework for large language models by privatizing zeroth order optimization methods. A key insight into the design of our method is that the direction of the gradient in the zeroth-order optimization we use is random and the only information from training data is the step size, i.e., a scalar. Therefore, we only need to privatize the scalar step size, which is memory-efficient. DP-ZO provides a strong privacy-utility trade-off across different tasks, and model sizes that are comparable to DP-SGD in $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP. Notably, DP-ZO possesses significant advantages over DP-SGD in memory efficiency, and obtains higher utility in $\varepsilon$-DP when using the Laplace mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04343v2,2024-01
Know Your Needs Better: Towards Structured Understanding of Marketer Demands with Analogical Reasoning Augmented LLMs,"Junjie Wang, Dan Yang, Binbin Hu, Yue Shen, Wen Zhang, Jinjie Gu","In this paper, we explore a new way for user targeting, where non-expert marketers could select their target users solely given demands in natural language form. The key to this issue is how to transform natural languages into practical structured logical languages, i.e., the structured understanding of marketer demands. In practical scenarios, the demands of non-expert marketers are often abstract and diverse. Considering the impressive natural language processing ability of large language models (LLMs), we try to leverage LLMs to solve this issue. To stimulate the LLMs' reasoning ability, the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method is widely used, but existing methods still have some limitations in our scenario: (1) Previous methods either use simple ""Let's think step by step"" spells or provide fixed examples in demonstrations without considering compatibility between prompts and concrete questions, making LLMs ineffective when the marketers' demands are abstract and diverse. (2) Previous methods are often implemented in closed-source models or excessively large models, which is not suitable in industrial practical scenarios. Based on these, we propose ARALLM (i.e., Analogical Reasoning Augmented Large Language Models) consisting of two modules: Analogical Reasoning based Prompting and Reasoning-Augmented Multi-Task Model Distillation.

We present and analyze definitions obtained across all databases, categorize them based on their applications, and extract key points within each category.

The pertinent issues primarily relate to the absence of execution guarantees for generated code, a lack of explainability, and suboptimal support for essential but niche programming languages. State-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4 and LLaMa2 fail to produce valid programs for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) operated by Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). We propose LLM4PLC, a user-guided iterative pipeline leveraging user feedback and external verification tools including grammar checkers, compilers and SMV verifiers to guide the LLM's generation. We further enhance the generation potential of LLM by employing Prompt Engineering and model fine-tuning through the creation and usage of LoRAs. We validate this system using a FischerTechnik Manufacturing TestBed (MFTB), illustrating how LLMs can evolve from generating structurally flawed code to producing verifiably correct programs for industrial applications. We run a complete test suite on GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama-7B, a fine-tuned Code Llama-7B model, Code Llama-34B, and a fine-tuned Code Llama-34B model.

MARG: Multi-Agent Review Generation for Scientific Papers,"Mike D'Arcy, Tom Hope, Larry Birnbaum, Doug Downey","We study the ability of LLMs to generate feedback for scientific papers and develop MARG, a feedback generation approach using multiple LLM instances that engage in internal discussion. By distributing paper text across agents, MARG can consume the full text of papers beyond the input length limitations of the base LLM, and by specializing agents and incorporating sub-tasks tailored to different comment types (experiments, clarity, impact) it improves the helpfulness and specificity of feedback. In a user study, baseline methods using GPT-4 were rated as producing generic or very generic comments more than half the time, and only 1.7 comments per paper were rated as good overall in the best baseline. Our system substantially improves the ability of GPT-4 to generate specific and helpful feedback, reducing the rate of generic comments from 60% to 29% and generating 3.7 good comments per paper (a 2.2x improvement).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04259v1,2024-01
High-precision Voice Search Query Correction via Retrievable Speech-text Embedings,"Christopher Li, Gary Wang, Kyle Kastner, Heng Su, Allen Chen, Andrew Rosenberg, Zhehuai Chen, Zelin Wu, Leonid Velikovich, Pat Rondon, Diamantino Caseiro, Petar Aleksic","Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems can suffer from poor recall for various reasons, such as noisy audio, lack of sufficient training data, etc.   Previous work has shown that recall can be improved by retrieving rewrite candidates from a large database of likely, contextually-relevant alternatives to the hypothesis text using nearest-neighbors search over embeddings of the ASR hypothesis text to correct and candidate corrections.   However, ASR-hypothesis-based retrieval can yield poor precision if the textual hypotheses are too phonetically dissimilar to the transcript truth. In this paper, we eliminate the hypothesis-audio mismatch problem by querying the correction database directly using embeddings derived from the utterance audio; the embeddings of the utterance audio and candidate corrections are produced by multimodal speech-text embedding networks trained to place the embedding of the audio of an utterance and the embedding of its corresponding textual transcript close together.   After locating an appropriate correction candidate using nearest-neighbor search, we score the candidate with its speech-text embedding distance before adding the candidate to the original n-best list.   We show a relative word error rate (WER) reduction of 6% on utterances whose transcripts appear in the candidate set, without increasing WER on general utterances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04235v1,2024-01
Distortions in Judged Spatial Relations in Large Language Models,"Nir Fulman, Abdulkadir Memduhoğlu, Alexander Zipf","We present a benchmark for assessing the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discern intercardinal directions between geographic locations and apply it to three prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2. This benchmark specifically evaluates whether LLMs exhibit a hierarchical spatial bias similar to humans, where judgments about individual locations' spatial relationships are influenced by the perceived relationships of the larger groups that contain them. To investigate this, we formulated 14 questions focusing on well-known American cities. Seven questions were designed to challenge the LLMs with scenarios potentially influenced by the orientation of larger geographical units, such as states or countries, while the remaining seven targeted locations were less susceptible to such hierarchical categorization. Among the tested models, GPT-4 exhibited superior performance with 55 percent accuracy, followed by GPT-3.5 at 47 percent, and Llama-2 at 45 percent. The models showed significantly reduced accuracy on tasks with suspected hierarchical bias. For example, GPT-4's accuracy dropped to 33 percent on these tasks, compared to 86 percent on others. However, the models identified the nearest cardinal direction in most cases, reflecting their associative learning mechanism, thereby embodying human-like misconceptions. We discuss avenues for improving the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04218v2,2024-01
FunnyNet-W: Multimodal Learning of Funny Moments in Videos in the Wild,"Zhi-Song Liu, Robin Courant, Vicky Kalogeiton","Automatically understanding funny moments (i.e., the moments that make people laugh) when watching comedy is challenging, as they relate to various features, such as body language, dialogues and culture. In this paper, we propose FunnyNet-W, a model that relies on cross- and self-attention for visual, audio and text data to predict funny moments in videos. Unlike most methods that rely on ground truth data in the form of subtitles, in this work we exploit modalities that come naturally with videos: (a) video frames as they contain visual information indispensable for scene understanding, (b) audio as it contains higher-level cues associated with funny moments, such as intonation, pitch and pauses and (c) text automatically extracted with a speech-to-text model as it can provide rich information when processed by a Large Language Model. To acquire labels for training, we propose an unsupervised approach that spots and labels funny audio moments. We provide experiments on five datasets: the sitcoms TBBT, MHD, MUStARD, Friends, and the TED talk UR-Funny. Extensive experiments and analysis show that FunnyNet-W successfully exploits visual, auditory and textual cues to identify funny moments, while our findings reveal FunnyNet-W's ability to predict funny moments in the wild. FunnyNet-W sets the new state of the art for funny moment detection with multimodal cues on all datasets with and without using ground truth information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04210v1,2024-01

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks.

AI and Generative AI for Research Discovery and Summarization,"Mark Glickman, Yi Zhang","AI and generative AI tools, including chatbots like ChatGPT that rely on large language models (LLMs), have burst onto the scene this year, creating incredible opportunities to increase work productivity and improve our lives. Statisticians and data scientists have begun experiencing the benefits from the availability of these tools in numerous ways, such as the generation of programming code from text prompts to analyze data or fit statistical models. One area that these tools can make a substantial impact is in research discovery and summarization. Standalone tools and plugins to chatbots are being developed that allow researchers to more quickly find relevant literature than pre-2023 search tools. Furthermore, generative AI tools have improved to the point where they can summarize and extract the key points from research articles in succinct language. Finally, chatbots based on highly parameterized LLMs can be used to simulate abductive reasoning, which provides researchers the ability to make connections among related technical topics, which can also be used for research discovery.

Empirical Analysis of Efficient Fine-Tuning Methods for Large Pre-Trained Language Models,"Nigel Doering, Cyril Gorlla, Trevor Tuttle, Adhvaith Vijay","Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models for downstream tasks remains a critical challenge in natural language processing. This paper presents an empirical analysis comparing two efficient fine-tuning methods - BitFit and adapter modules - to standard full model fine-tuning. Experiments conducted on GLUE benchmark datasets (MRPC, COLA, STS-B) reveal several key insights. The BitFit approach, which trains only bias terms and task heads, matches full fine-tuning performance across varying amounts of training data and time constraints. It demonstrates remarkable stability even with only 30\% of data, outperforming full fine-tuning at intermediate data levels. Adapter modules exhibit high variability, with inconsistent gains over default models. The findings indicate BitFit offers an attractive balance between performance and parameter efficiency. Our work provides valuable perspectives on model tuning, emphasizing robustness and highlighting BitFit as a promising alternative for resource-constrained or streaming task settings. The analysis offers actionable guidelines for efficient adaptation of large pre-trained models, while illustrating open challenges in stabilizing techniques like adapter modules.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04051v1,2024-01
FFSplit: Split Feed-Forward Network For Optimizing Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off in Language Model Inference,"Zirui Liu, Qingquan Song, Qiang Charles Xiao, Sathiya Keerthi Selvaraj, Rahul Mazumder, Aman Gupta, Xia Hu","The large number of parameters in Pretrained Language Models enhance their performance, but also make them resource-intensive, making it challenging to deploy them on commodity hardware like a single GPU. Due to the memory and power limitations of these devices, model compression techniques are often used to decrease both the model's size and its inference latency. This usually results in a trade-off between model accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, optimizing this balance is essential for effectively deploying LLMs on commodity hardware. A significant portion of the efficiency challenge is the Feed-forward network (FFN) component, which accounts for roughly $\frac{2}{3}$ total parameters and inference latency. In this paper, we first observe that only a few neurons of FFN module have large output norm for any input tokens, a.k.a. heavy hitters, while the others are sparsely triggered by different tokens. Based on this observation, we explicitly split the FFN into two parts according to the heavy hitters. We improve the efficiency-accuracy trade-off of existing compression methods by allocating more resource to FFN parts with heavy hitters. In practice, our method can reduce model size by 43.1\% and bring $1.25\sim1.56\times$ wall clock time speedup on different hardware with negligible accuracy drop.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04044v1,2024-01
Large language models in bioinformatics: applications and perspectives,"Jiajia Liu, Mengyuan Yang, Yankai Yu, Haixia Xu, Kang Li, Xiaobo Zhou","Large language models (LLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence models based on deep learning, which have great performance in various tasks, especially in natural language processing (NLP).

However, their potential for solving bioinformatics problems may even exceed their proficiency in modeling human language. In this review, we will present a summary of the prominent large language models used in natural language processing, such as BERT and GPT, and focus on exploring the applications of large language models at different omics levels in bioinformatics, mainly including applications of large language models in genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery and single cell analysis.

IDoFew: Intermediate Training Using Dual-Clustering in Language Models for Few Labels Text Classification,"Abdullah Alsuhaibani, Hamad Zogan, Imran Razzak, Shoaib Jameel, Guandong Xu","Language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have been very effective in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining tasks including text classification. However, some tasks still pose challenges for these models, including text classification with limited labels. This can result in a cold-start problem. Although some approaches have attempted to address this problem through single-stage clustering as an intermediate training step coupled with a pre-trained language model, which generates pseudo-labels to improve classification, these methods are often error-prone due to the limitations of the clustering algorithms. To overcome this, we have developed a novel two-stage intermediate clustering with subsequent fine-tuning that models the pseudo-labels reliably, resulting in reduced prediction errors. The key novelty in our model, IDoFew, is that the two-stage clustering coupled with two different clustering algorithms helps exploit the advantages of the complementary algorithms that reduce the errors in generating reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning. Our approach has shown significant improvements compared to strong comparative models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04025v1,2024-01
Cross-Speaker Encoding Network for Multi-Talker Speech Recognition,"Jiawen Kang, Lingwei Meng, Mingyu Cui, Haohan Guo, Xixin Wu, Xunying Liu, Helen Meng","End-to-end multi-talker speech recognition has garnered great interest as an effective approach to directly transcribe overlapped speech from multiple speakers. Current methods typically adopt either 1) single-input multiple-output (SIMO) models with a branched encoder, or 2) single-input single-output (SISO) models based on attention-based encoder-decoder architecture with serialized output training (SOT). In this work, we propose a Cross-Speaker Encoding (CSE) network to address the limitations of SIMO models by aggregating cross-speaker representations. Furthermore, the CSE model is integrated with SOT to leverage both the advantages of SIMO and SISO while mitigating their drawbacks. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents an early effort to integrate SIMO and SISO for multi-talker speech recognition. Experiments on the two-speaker LibrispeechMix dataset show that the CES model reduces word error rate (WER) by 8% over the SIMO baseline. The CSE-SOT model reduces WER by 10% overall and by 16% on high-overlap speech compared to the SOT model.

Advancing Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models: An In-Depth Evaluation and Enhancement Using the StepGame Benchmark,"Fangjun Li, David C. Hogg, Anthony G. Cohn","Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress across various domains, with large language models like ChatGPT gaining substantial attention for their human-like text-generation capabilities. Despite these achievements, spatial reasoning remains a significant challenge for these models. Benchmarks like StepGame evaluate AI spatial reasoning, where ChatGPT has shown unsatisfactory performance. However, the presence of template errors in the benchmark has an impact on the evaluation results. Thus there is potential for ChatGPT to perform better if these template errors are addressed, leading to more accurate assessments of its spatial reasoning capabilities. In this study, we refine the StepGame benchmark, providing a more accurate dataset for model evaluation. We analyze GPT's spatial reasoning performance on the rectified benchmark, identifying proficiency in mapping natural language text to spatial relations but limitations in multi-hop reasoning. We provide a flawless solution to the benchmark by combining template-to-relation mapping with logic-based reasoning. This combination demonstrates proficiency in performing qualitative reasoning on StepGame without encountering any errors. We then address the limitations of GPT models in spatial reasoning. We deploy Chain-of-thought and Tree-of-thoughts prompting strategies, offering insights into GPT's ``cognitive process"", and achieving remarkable improvements in accuracy. Our investigation not only sheds light on model deficiencies but also proposes enhancements, contributing to the advancement of AI with more robust spatial reasoning capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03991v1,2024-01

Similar strategies are used to compile these datasets, but no tool currently unifies them. In this scenario, we introduce TextMachina, a modular and extensible Python framework, designed to aid in the creation of high-quality, unbiased datasets to build robust models for MGT-related tasks such as detection, attribution, mixcase, or boundary detection. It provides a user-friendly pipeline that abstracts away the inherent intricacies of building MGT datasets, such as LLM integrations, prompt templating, and bias mitigation.

Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated promising performance in simulating human society. Can we leverage LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate human communication? However, current LLM-based multi-agent systems mainly rely on text as the primary medium. In this paper, we propose SpeechAgents, a multi-modal LLM based multi-agent system designed for simulating human communication. SpeechAgents utilizes multi-modal LLM as the control center for individual agent and employes multi-modal signals as the medium for exchanged messages among agents. Additionally, we propose Multi-Agent Tuning to enhance the multi-agent capabilities of LLM without compromising general abilities. To strengthen and evaluate the effectiveness of human communication simulation, we build the Human-Communication Simulation Benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SpeechAgents can simulate human communication dialogues with consistent content, authentic rhythm, and rich emotions and demonstrate excellent scalability even with up to 25 agents, which can apply to tasks such as drama creation and audio novels generation.

Chain of LoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models via Residual Learning,"Wenhan Xia, Chengwei Qin, Elad Hazan","Fine-tuning is the primary methodology for tailoring pre-trained large language models to specific tasks. As the model's scale and the diversity of tasks expand, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods are of paramount importance. One of the most widely used family of methods is low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants. LoRA encodes weight update as the product of two low-rank matrices. Despite its advantages, LoRA falls short of full-parameter fine-tuning in terms of generalization error for certain tasks.   We introduce Chain of LoRA (COLA), an iterative optimization framework inspired by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, to bridge the gap between LoRA and full parameter fine-tuning, without incurring additional computational costs or memory overheads. COLA employs a residual learning procedure where it merges learned LoRA modules into the pre-trained language model parameters and re-initilize optimization for new born LoRA modules. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees as well as empirical results to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm. Across various models (OPT and llama-2) and seven benchmarking tasks, we demonstrate that COLA can consistently outperform LoRA without additional computational or memory costs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04151v1,2024-01
A Philosophical Introduction to Language Models -- Part I: Continuity With Classic Debates,"Raphaël Millière, Cameron Buckner","Large language models like GPT-4 have achieved remarkable proficiency in a broad spectrum of language-based tasks, some of which are traditionally associated with hallmarks of human intelligence. This has prompted ongoing disagreements about the extent to which we can meaningfully ascribe any kind of linguistic or cognitive competence to language models. Such questions have deep philosophical roots, echoing longstanding debates about the status of artificial neural networks as cognitive models. This article -- the first part of two companion papers -- serves both as a primer on language models for philosophers, and as an opinionated survey of their significance in relation to classic debates in the philosophy cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. We cover topics such as compositionality, language acquisition, semantic competence, grounding, world models, and the transmission of cultural knowledge. We argue that the success of language models challenges several long-held assumptions about artificial neural networks. However, we also highlight the need for further empirical investigation to better understand their internal mechanisms. This sets the stage for the companion paper (Part II), which turns to novel empirical methods for probing the inner workings of language models, and new philosophical questions prompted by their latest developments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03910v1,2024-01

STAIR: Spatial-Temporal Reasoning with Auditable Intermediate Results for Video Question Answering,"Yueqian Wang, Yuxuan Wang, Kai Chen, Dongyan Zhao","Recently we have witnessed the rapid development of video question answering models. However, most models can only handle simple videos in terms of temporal reasoning, and their performance tends to drop when answering temporal-reasoning questions on long and informative videos. To tackle this problem we propose STAIR, a Spatial-Temporal Reasoning model with Auditable Intermediate Results for video question answering. STAIR is a neural module network, which contains a program generator to decompose a given question into a hierarchical combination of several sub-tasks, and a set of lightweight neural modules to complete each of these sub-tasks. Though neural module networks are already widely studied on image-text tasks, applying them to videos is a non-trivial task, as reasoning on videos requires different abilities. In this paper, we define a set of basic video-text sub-tasks for video question answering and design a set of lightweight modules to complete them. Different from most prior works, modules of STAIR return intermediate outputs specific to their intentions instead of always returning attention maps, which makes it easier to interpret and collaborate with pre-trained models. We also introduce intermediate supervision to make these intermediate outputs more accurate. We conduct extensive experiments on several video question answering datasets under various settings to show STAIR's performance, explainability, compatibility with pre-trained models, and applicability when program annotations are not available.

We Need to Talk About Classification Evaluation Metrics in NLP,"Peter Vickers, Loïc Barrault, Emilio Monti, Nikolaos Aletras","In Natural Language Processing (NLP) classification tasks such as topic categorisation and sentiment analysis, model generalizability is generally measured with standard metrics such as Accuracy, F-Measure, or AUC-ROC. The diversity of metrics, and the arbitrariness of their application suggest that there is no agreement within NLP on a single best metric to use. This lack suggests there has not been sufficient examination of the underlying heuristics which each metric encodes. To address this we compare several standard classification metrics with more 'exotic' metrics and demonstrate that a random-guess normalised Informedness metric is a parsimonious baseline for task performance. To show how important the choice of metric is, we perform extensive experiments on a wide range of NLP tasks including a synthetic scenario, natural language understanding, question answering and machine translation. Across these tasks we use a superset of metrics to rank models and find that Informedness best captures the ideal model characteristics.

Language Models Encode the Value of Numbers Linearly,"Fangwei Zhu, Damai Dai, Zhifang Sui","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive competence in various tasks, but their internal mechanisms on mathematical problems are still under-explored. In this paper, we study a fundamental question: how language models encode the value of numbers, a basic element in math. To study the question, we construct a synthetic dataset comprising addition problems and utilize linear probes to read out input numbers from the hidden states. Experimental results support the existence of encoded number values in LLMs on different layers, and these values can be extracted via linear probes. Further experiments show that LLMs store their calculation results in a similar manner, and we can intervene the output via simple vector additions, proving the causal connection between encoded numbers and language model outputs. Our research provides evidence that LLMs encode the value of numbers linearly, offering insights for better exploring, designing, and utilizing numeric information in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03735v4,2024-01
The Butterfly Effect of Altering Prompts: How Small Changes and Jailbreaks Affect Large Language Model Performance,"Abel Salinas, Fred Morstatter","Large Language Models (LLMs) are regularly being used to label data across many domains and for myriad tasks. By simply asking the LLM for an answer, or ``prompting,'' practitioners are able to use LLMs to quickly get a response for an arbitrary task. This prompting is done through a series of decisions by the practitioner, from simple wording of the prompt, to requesting the output in a certain data format, to jailbreaking in the case of prompts that address more sensitive topics. In this work, we ask: do variations in the way a prompt is constructed change the ultimate decision of the LLM? We answer this using a series of prompt variations across a variety of text classification tasks. We find that even the smallest of perturbations, such as adding a space at the end of a prompt, can cause the LLM to change its answer. Further, we find that requesting responses in XML and commonly used jailbreaks can have cataclysmic effects on the data labeled by LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03729v3,2024-01

LightHouse: A Survey of AGI Hallucination,Feng Wang,"With the development of artificial intelligence, large-scale models have become increasingly intelligent. However, numerous studies indicate that hallucinations within these large models are a bottleneck hindering the development of AI research. In the pursuit of achieving strong artificial intelligence, a significant volume of research effort is being invested in the AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) hallucination research. Previous explorations have been conducted in researching hallucinations within LLMs (Large Language Models). As for multimodal AGI, research on hallucinations is still in an early stage. To further the progress of research in the domain of hallucinatory phenomena, we present a bird's eye view of hallucinations in AGI, summarizing the current work on AGI hallucinations and proposing some directions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06792v2,2024-01
A Span-based Model for Extracting Overlapping PICO Entities from RCT Publications,"Gongbo Zhang, Yiliang Zhou, Yan Hu, Hua Xu, Chunhua Weng, Yifan Peng","Objectives Extraction of PICO (Populations, Interventions, Comparison, and Outcomes) entities is fundamental to evidence retrieval. We present a novel method PICOX to extract overlapping PICO entities.   Materials and Methods PICOX first identifies entities by assessing whether a word marks the beginning or conclusion of an entity. Then it uses a multi-label classifier to assign one or more PICO labels to a span candidate. PICOX was evaluated using one of the best-performing baselines, EBM-NLP, and three more datasets, i.e., PICO-Corpus, and RCT publications on Alzheimer's Disease or COVID-19, using entity-level precision, recall, and F1 scores.   Results PICOX achieved superior precision, recall, and F1 scores across the board, with the micro F1 score improving from 45.05 to 50.87 (p << 0.01). On the PICO-Corpus, PICOX obtained higher recall and F1 scores than the baseline and improved the micro recall score from 56.66 to 67.33. On the COVID-19 dataset, PICOX also outperformed the baseline and improved the micro F1 score from 77.10 to 80.32. On the AD dataset, PICOX demonstrated comparable F1 scores with higher precision when compared to the baseline.   Conclusion PICOX excels in identifying overlapping entities and consistently surpasses a leading baseline across multiple datasets. Ablation studies reveal that its data augmentation strategy effectively minimizes false positives and improves precision.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06791v1,2024-01
A Content-Based Novelty Measure for Scholarly Publications: A Proof of Concept,Haining Wang,"Novelty, akin to gene mutation in evolution, opens possibilities for scholarly advancement. Although peer review remains the gold standard for evaluating novelty in scholarly communication and resource allocation, the vast volume of submissions necessitates an automated measure of scholarly novelty. Adopting a perspective that views novelty as the atypical combination of existing knowledge, we introduce an information-theoretic measure of novelty in scholarly publications. This measure quantifies the degree of 'surprise' perceived by a language model that represents the word distribution of scholarly discourse. The proposed measure is accompanied by face and construct validity evidence; the former demonstrates correspondence to scientific common sense, and the latter is endorsed through alignment with novelty evaluations from a select panel of domain experts. Additionally, characterized by its interpretability, fine granularity, and accessibility, this measure addresses gaps prevalent in existing methods. We believe this measure holds great potential to benefit editors, stakeholders, and policymakers, and it provides a reliable lens for examining the relationship between novelty and academic dynamics such as creativity, interdisciplinarity, and scientific advances.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03642v2,2024-01
Bridging the Skills Gap: Evaluating an AI-Assisted Provider Platform to Support Care Providers with Empathetic Delivery of Protocolized Therapy,"William R. Kearns, Jessica Bertram, Myra Divina, Lauren Kemp, Yinzhou Wang, Alex Marin, Trevor Cohen, Weichao Yuwen","Despite the high prevalence and burden of mental health conditions, there is a global shortage of mental health providers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been proposed as a way to address this shortage, by supporting providers with less extensive training as they deliver care. To this end, we developed the AI-Assisted Provider Platform (A2P2), a text-based virtual therapy interface that includes a response suggestion feature, which supports providers in delivering protocolized therapies empathetically. We studied providers with and without expertise in mental health treatment delivering a therapy session using the platform with (intervention) and without (control) AI-assistance features. Upon evaluation, the AI-assisted system significantly decreased response times by 29.34% (p=0.002), tripled empathic response accuracy (p=0.0001), and increased goal recommendation accuracy by 66.67% (p=0.001) across both user groups compared to the control.

Why Solving Multi-agent Path Finding with Large Language Model has not Succeeded Yet,"Weizhe Chen, Sven Koenig, Bistra Dilkina","With the explosive influence caused by the success of large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT and GPT-4, there has been an extensive amount of recent work showing that foundation models can be used to solve a large variety of tasks. However, there is very limited work that shares insights on multi-agent planning. Multi-agent planning is different from other domains by combining the difficulty of multi-agent coordination and planning, and making it hard to leverage external tools to facilitate the reasoning needed. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multi-agent path finding (MAPF), which is also known as multi-robot route planning, and study the performance of solving MAPF with LLMs. We first show the motivating success on an empty room map without obstacles, then the failure to plan on the harder room map and maze map of the standard MAPF benchmark. We present our position on why directly solving MAPF with LLMs has not been successful yet, and we use various experiments to support our hypothesis. Based on our results, we discussed how researchers with different backgrounds could help with this problem from different perspectives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03630v2,2024-01

Rocha, Rennan Gaio, Rafael Miceli, Gabriela Tourinho, Marcos Rabaioli, Leandro Santos, Fellipe Marques, David Favaro","This work presents an unsupervised method for automatically constructing and expanding topic taxonomies using instruction-based fine-tuned LLMs (Large Language Models). We apply topic modeling and keyword extraction techniques to create initial topic taxonomies and LLMs to post-process the resulting terms and create a hierarchy. To expand an existing taxonomy with new terms, we use zero-shot prompting to find out where to add new nodes, which, to our knowledge, is the first work to present such an approach to taxonomy tasks. We use the resulting taxonomies to assign tags that characterize merchants from a retail bank dataset. To evaluate our work, we asked 12 volunteers to answer a two-part form in which we first assessed the quality of the taxonomies created and then the tags assigned to merchants based on that taxonomy. The evaluation revealed a coherence rate exceeding 90% for the chosen taxonomies. The taxonomies' expansion with LLMs also showed exciting results for parent node prediction, with an f1-score above 70% in our taxonomies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06790v2,2024-01
ChatGPT for Conversational Recommendation: Refining Recommendations by Reprompting with Feedback,"Kyle Dylan Spurlock, Cagla Acun, Esin Saka, Olfa Nasraoui","Recommendation algorithms have been pivotal in handling the overwhelming volume of online content. However, these algorithms seldom consider direct user input, resulting in superficial interaction between them. Efforts have been made to include the user directly in the recommendation process through conversation, but these systems too have had limited interactivity. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have gained popularity due to their ease of use and their ability to adapt dynamically to various tasks while responding to feedback. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT as a top-n conversational recommendation system. We build a rigorous pipeline around ChatGPT to simulate how a user might realistically probe the model for recommendations: by first instructing and then reprompting with feedback to refine a set of recommendations. We further explore the effect of popularity bias in ChatGPT's recommendations, and compare its performance to baseline models. We find that reprompting ChatGPT with feedback is an effective strategy to improve recommendation relevancy, and that popularity bias can be mitigated through prompt engineering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03605v1,2024-01
InFoBench: Evaluating Instruction Following Ability in Large Language Models,"Yiwei Qin, Kaiqiang Song, Yebowen Hu, Wenlin Yao, Sangwoo Cho, Xiaoyang Wang, Xuansheng Wu, Fei Liu, Pengfei Liu, Dong Yu","This paper introduces the Decomposed Requirements Following Ratio (DRFR), a new metric for evaluating Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to follow instructions. Addressing a gap in current methodologies, DRFR breaks down complex instructions into simpler criteria, facilitating a detailed analysis of LLMs' compliance with various aspects of tasks. Alongside this metric, we present InFoBench, a benchmark comprising 500 diverse instructions and 2,250 decomposed questions across multiple constraint categories. Our experiments compare DRFR with traditional scoring methods and explore annotation sources, including human experts, crowd-sourced workers, and GPT-4. The findings demonstrate DRFR's higher reliability and the effectiveness of using GPT-4 as a cost-efficient annotator. The evaluation of several advanced LLMs using this framework reveals their strengths and areas needing improvement, particularly in complex instruction-following. This study contributes a novel metric and benchmark, offering insights for future LLM development and evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03601v1,2024-01
Text Classification Based on Knowledge Graphs and Improved Attention Mechanism,"Siyu Li, Lu Chen, Chenwei Song, Xinyi Liu","To resolve the semantic ambiguity in texts, we propose a model, which innovatively combines a knowledge graph with an improved attention mechanism. An existing knowledge base is utilized to enrich the text with relevant contextual concepts. The model operates at both character and word levels to deepen its understanding by integrating the concepts. We first adopt information gain to select import words. Then an encoder-decoder framework is used to encode the text along with the related concepts. The local attention mechanism adjusts the weight of each concept, reducing the influence of irrelevant or noisy concepts during classification. We improve the calculation formula for attention scores in the local self-attention mechanism, ensuring that words with different frequencies of occurrence in the text receive higher attention scores. Finally, the model employs a Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), which is effective in feature extraction from texts for improved classification accuracy. Its performance is demonstrated on datasets such as AGNews, Ohsumed, and TagMyNews, achieving accuracy of 75.1%, 58.7%, and 68.5% respectively, showing its effectiveness in classifying tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03591v2,2024-01
Building Efficient and Effective OpenQA Systems for Low-Resource Languages,"Emrah Budur, Rıza Özçelik, Dilara Soylu, Omar Khattab, Tunga Güngör, Christopher Potts","Question answering (QA) is the task of answering questions posed in natural language with free-form natural language answers extracted from a given passage. In the OpenQA variant, only a question text is given, and the system must retrieve relevant passages from an unstructured knowledge source and use them to provide answers, which is the case in the mainstream QA systems on the Web. QA systems currently are mostly limited to the English language due to the lack of large-scale labeled QA datasets in non-English languages. In this paper, we show that effective, low-cost OpenQA systems can be developed for low-resource contexts. The key ingredients are (1) weak supervision using machine-translated labeled datasets and (2) a relevant unstructured knowledge source in the target language context. Furthermore, we show that only a few hundred gold assessment examples are needed to reliably evaluate these systems. We apply our method to Turkish as a challenging case study, since English and Turkish are typologically very distinct and Turkish has limited resources for QA. We present SQuAD-TR, a machine translation of SQuAD2.0, and we build our OpenQA system by adapting ColBERT-QA and retraining it over Turkish resources and SQuAD-TR using two versions of Wikipedia dumps spanning two years. We obtain a performance improvement of 24-32% in the Exact Match (EM) score and 22-29% in the F1 score compared to the BM25-based and DPR-based baseline QA reader models. Our results show that SQuAD-TR makes OpenQA feasible for Turkish, which we hope encourages researchers to build OpenQA systems in other low-resource languages.

Data-CUBE: Data Curriculum for Instruction-based Sentence Representation Learning,"Yingqian Min, Kun Zhou, Dawei Gao, Wayne Xin Zhao, He Hu, Yaliang Li","Recently, multi-task instruction tuning has been applied into sentence representation learning, which endows the capability of generating specific representations with the guidance of task instruction, exhibiting strong generalization ability on new tasks. However, these methods mostly neglect the potential interference problems across different tasks and instances, which may affect the training and convergence of the model. To address it, we propose a data curriculum method, namely Data-CUBE, that arranges the orders of all the multi-task data for training, to minimize the interference risks from the two views. In the task level, we aim to find the optimal task order to minimize the total cross-task interference risk, which is exactly the traveling salesman problem, hence we utilize a simulated annealing algorithm to find its solution. In the instance level, we measure the difficulty of all instances per task, then divide them into the easy-to-difficult mini-batches for training. Experiments on MTEB sentence representation evaluation tasks show that our approach can boost the performance of state-of-the-art methods. Our code and data are publicly available at the link: \url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Data-CUBE}.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03563v1,2024-01

Is there really a Citation Age Bias in NLP?,"Hoa Nguyen, Steffen Eger","Citations are a key ingredient of scientific research to relate a paper to others published in the community. Recently, it has been noted that there is a citation age bias in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community, one of the currently fastest growing AI subfields, in that the mean age of the bibliography of NLP papers has become ever younger in the last few years, leading to `citation amnesia' in which older knowledge is increasingly forgotten. In this work, we put such claims into perspective by analyzing the bibliography of $\sim$300k papers across 15 different scientific fields submitted to the popular preprint server Arxiv in the time period from 2013 to 2022. We find that all AI subfields (in particular: cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG) have similar trends of citation amnesia, in which the age of the bibliography has roughly halved in the last 10 years (from above 12 in 2013 to below 7 in 2022), on average. Rather than diagnosing this as a citation age bias in the NLP community, we believe this pattern is an artefact of the dynamics of these research fields, in which new knowledge is produced in ever shorter time intervals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03545v1,2024-01
Transfer the linguistic representations from TTS to accent conversion with non-parallel data,"Xi Chen, Jiakun Pei, Liumeng Xue, Mingyang Zhang","Accent conversion aims to convert the accent of a source speech to a target accent, meanwhile preserving the speaker's identity. This paper introduces a novel non-autoregressive framework for accent conversion that learns accent-agnostic linguistic representations and employs them to convert the accent in the source speech. Specifically, the proposed system aligns speech representations with linguistic representations obtained from Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, enabling training of the accent voice conversion model on non-parallel data. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of a pretraining strategy on native data and different acoustic features within our proposed framework. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using both subjective and objective metrics to assess the performance of our approach. The evaluation results highlight the benefits of the pretraining strategy and the incorporation of richer semantic features, resulting in significantly enhanced audio quality and intelligibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03538v1,2024-01
Information Retrieval and Classification of Real-Time Multi-Source Hurricane Evacuation Notices,"Tingting Zhao, Shubo Tian, Jordan Daly, Melissa Geiger, Minna Jia, Jinfeng Zhang","For an approaching disaster, the tracking of time-sensitive critical information such as hurricane evacuation notices is challenging in the United States. These notices are issued and distributed rapidly by numerous local authorities that may spread across multiple states. They often undergo frequent updates and are distributed through diverse online portals lacking standard formats. In this study, we developed an approach to timely detect and track the locally issued hurricane evacuation notices. The text data were collected mainly with a spatially targeted web scraping method. They were manually labeled and then classified using natural language processing techniques with deep learning models. The classification of mandatory evacuation notices achieved a high accuracy (recall = 96%). We used Hurricane Ian (2022) to illustrate how real-time evacuation notices extracted from local government sources could be redistributed with a Web GIS system. Our method applied to future hurricanes provides live data for situation awareness to higher-level government agencies and news media. The archived data helps scholars to study government responses toward weather warnings and individual behaviors influenced by evacuation history. The framework may be applied to other types of disasters for rapid and targeted retrieval, classification, redistribution, and archiving of real-time government orders and notifications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06789v1,2024-01

ROIC-DM: Robust Text Inference and Classification via Diffusion Model,"Shilong Yuan, Wei Yuan, Hongzhi Yin, Tieke He","While language models have made many milestones in text inference and classification tasks, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks that can lead to unforeseen outcomes. Existing works alleviate this problem by equipping language models with defense patches. However, these defense strategies often rely on impractical assumptions or entail substantial sacrifices in model performance. Consequently, enhancing the resilience of the target model using such defense mechanisms is a formidable challenge. This paper introduces an innovative model for robust text inference and classification, built upon diffusion models (ROIC-DM). Benefiting from its training involving denoising stages, ROIC-DM inherently exhibits greater robustness compared to conventional language models. Moreover, ROIC-DM can attain comparable, and in some cases, superior performance to language models, by effectively incorporating them as advisory components. Extensive experiments conducted with several strong textual adversarial attacks on three datasets demonstrate that (1) ROIC-DM outperforms traditional language models in robustness, even when the latter are fortified with advanced defense mechanisms; (2) ROIC-DM can achieve comparable and even better performance than traditional language models by using them as advisors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03514v2,2024-01
CharPoet: A Chinese Classical Poetry Generation System Based on Token-free LLM,"Chengyue Yu, Lei Zang, Jiaotuan Wang, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu","Automatic Chinese classical poetry generation has attracted much research interest, but achieving effective control over format and content simultaneously remains challenging. Traditional systems usually accept keywords as user inputs, resulting in limited control over content. Large language models (LLMs) improve content control by allowing unrestricted user instructions, but the token-by-token generation process frequently makes format errors. Motivated by this, we propose CharPoet, a Chinese classical poetry generation system based on token-free LLM, which provides effective control over both format and content. Our token-free architecture generates in a character-by-character manner, enabling precise control over the number of characters. Pruned from existing token-based LLMs, CharPoet inherits their pretrained capabilities and can generate poetry following instructions like ""Write me a poem for my mother's birthday."" CharPoet achieves format accuracy above 0.96, outperforming Jiuge-GPT-2 (0.91) and GPT-4 (0.38). In terms of content quality, CharPoet surpasses traditional systems including Jiuge, and is comparable to other LLMs. Our system is open source and available at https://modelscope.cn/models/CharPoet/CharPoet.

EAT: Self-Supervised Pre-Training with Efficient Audio Transformer,"Wenxi Chen, Yuzhe Liang, Ziyang Ma, Zhisheng Zheng, Xie Chen","Audio self-supervised learning (SSL) pre-training, which aims to learn good representations from unlabeled audio, has made remarkable progress. However, the extensive computational demands during pre-training pose a significant barrier to the potential application and optimization of audio SSL models. In this paper, inspired by the success of data2vec 2.0 in image modality and Audio-MAE in audio modality, we introduce Efficient Audio Transformer (EAT) to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency in audio SSL. The proposed EAT adopts the bootstrap self-supervised training paradigm to the audio domain. A novel Utterance-Frame Objective (UFO) is designed to enhance the modeling capability of acoustic events. Furthermore, we reveal that the masking strategy is critical in audio SSL pre-training, and superior audio representations can be obtained with large inverse block masks. Experiment results demonstrate that EAT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on a range of audio-related tasks, including AudioSet (AS-2M, AS-20K), ESC-50, and SPC-2, along with a significant pre-training speedup up to ~15x compared to existing audio SSL models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03497v1,2024-01
"PEneo: Unifying Line Extraction, Line Grouping, and Entity Linking for End-to-end Document Pair Extraction","Zening Lin, Jiapeng Wang, Teng Li, Wenhui Liao, Dayi Huang, Longfei Xiong, Lianwen Jin","Document pair extraction aims to identify key and value entities as well as their relationships from visually-rich documents. Most existing methods divide it into two separate tasks: semantic entity recognition (SER) and relation extraction (RE). However, simply concatenating SER and RE serially can lead to severe error propagation, and it fails to handle cases like multi-line entities in real scenarios. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel framework, PEneo (Pair Extraction new decoder option), which performs document pair extraction in a unified pipeline, incorporating three concurrent sub-tasks: line extraction, line grouping, and entity linking. This approach alleviates the error accumulation problem and can handle the case of multi-line entities. Furthermore, to better evaluate the model's performance and to facilitate future research on pair extraction, we introduce RFUND, a re-annotated version of the commonly used FUNSD and XFUND datasets, to make them more accurate and cover realistic situations. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate PEneo's superiority over previous pipelines, boosting the performance by a large margin (e.g., 19.89%-22.91% F1 score on RFUND-EN) when combined with various backbones like LiLT and LayoutLMv3, showing its effectiveness and generality.

Maintaining Journalistic Integrity in the Digital Age: A Comprehensive NLP Framework for Evaluating Online News Content,"Ljubisa Bojic, Nikola Prodanovic, Agariadne Dwinggo Samala","The rapid growth of online news platforms has led to an increased need for reliable methods to evaluate the quality and credibility of news articles. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to analyze online news texts using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, particularly a language model specifically trained for this purpose, alongside other well-established NLP methods. The framework incorporates ten journalism standards-objectivity, balance and fairness, readability and clarity, sensationalism and clickbait, ethical considerations, public interest and value, source credibility, relevance and timeliness, factual accuracy, and attribution and transparency-to assess the quality of news articles. By establishing these standards, researchers, media organizations, and readers can better evaluate and understand the content they consume and produce. The proposed method has some limitations, such as potential difficulty in detecting subtle biases and the need for continuous updating of the language model to keep pace with evolving language patterns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03467v1,2024-01
Long Context Compression with Activation Beacon,"Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Ninglu Shao, Qiwei Ye, Zhicheng Dou","Long context compression is a critical research problem due to its significance in reducing the high computational and memory costs associated with LLMs. In this paper, we propose Activation Beacon, a plug-in module for transformer-based LLMs that targets effective, efficient, and flexible compression of long contexts. To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios, achieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory costs for KV cache.

On Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhancing Entity Resolution: A Cost-efficient Approach,"Huahang Li, Longyu Feng, Shuangyin Li, Fei Hao, Chen Jason Zhang, Yuanfeng Song","Entity resolution, the task of identifying and merging records that refer to the same real-world entity, is crucial in sectors like e-commerce, healthcare, and law enforcement. Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce an innovative approach to this task, capitalizing on their advanced linguistic capabilities and a ``pay-as-you-go'' model that provides significant advantages to those without extensive data science expertise. However, current LLMs are costly due to per-API request billing. Existing methods often either lack quality or become prohibitively expensive at scale. To address these problems, we propose an uncertainty reduction framework using LLMs to improve entity resolution results. We first initialize possible partitions of the entity cluster, refer to the same entity, and define the uncertainty of the result. Then, we reduce the uncertainty by selecting a few valuable matching questions for LLM verification. Upon receiving the answers, we update the probability distribution of the possible partitions. To further reduce costs, we design an efficient algorithm to judiciously select the most valuable matching pairs to query. Additionally, we create error-tolerant techniques to handle LLM mistakes and a dynamic adjustment method to reach truly correct partitions. Experimental results show that our method is efficient and effective, offering promising applications in real-world tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03426v2,2024-01
GRAM: Global Reasoning for Multi-Page VQA,"Tsachi Blau, Sharon Fogel, Roi Ronen, Alona Golts, Roy Ganz, Elad Ben Avraham, Aviad Aberdam, Shahar Tsiper, Ron Litman","The increasing use of transformer-based large language models brings forward the challenge of processing long sequences. In document visual question answering (DocVQA), leading methods focus on the single-page setting, while documents can span hundreds of pages. We present GRAM, a method that seamlessly extends pre-trained single-page models to the multi-page setting, without requiring computationally-heavy pretraining. To do so, we leverage a single-page encoder for local page-level understanding, and enhance it with document-level designated layers and learnable tokens, facilitating the flow of information across pages for global reasoning. To enforce our model to utilize the newly introduced document tokens, we propose a tailored bias adaptation method. For additional computational savings during decoding, we introduce an optional compression stage using our compression-transformer (C-Former),reducing the encoded sequence length, thereby allowing a tradeoff between quality and latency. Extensive experiments showcase GRAM's state-of-the-art performance on the benchmarks for multi-page DocVQA, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03411v2,2024-01

Drawing on political science and international relations literature about escalation dynamics, we design a novel wargame simulation and scoring framework to assess the escalation risks of actions taken by these agents in different scenarios. Contrary to prior studies, our research provides both qualitative and quantitative insights and focuses on large language models (LLMs). We find that all five studied off-the-shelf LLMs show forms of escalation and difficult-to-predict escalation patterns. We observe that models tend to develop arms-race dynamics, leading to greater conflict, and in rare cases, even to the deployment of nuclear weapons. Qualitatively, we also collect the models' reported reasonings for chosen actions and observe worrying justifications based on deterrence and first-strike tactics. Given the high stakes of military and foreign-policy contexts, we recommend further examination and cautious consideration before deploying autonomous language model agents for strategic military or diplomatic decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03408v1,2024-01
Empirical Study of Large Language Models as Automated Essay Scoring Tools in English Composition__Taking TOEFL Independent Writing Task for Example,"Wei Xia, Shaoguang Mao, Chanjing Zheng","Large language models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in tasks involving natural language generation, reasoning, and comprehension. This study aims to construct prompts and comments grounded in the diverse scoring criteria delineated within the official TOEFL guide. The primary objective is to assess the capabilities and constraints of ChatGPT, a prominent representative of large language models, within the context of automated essay scoring. The prevailing methodologies for automated essay scoring involve the utilization of deep neural networks, statistical machine learning techniques, and fine-tuning pre-trained models. However, these techniques face challenges when applied to different contexts or subjects, primarily due to their substantial data requirements and limited adaptability to small sample sizes. In contrast, this study employs ChatGPT to conduct an automated evaluation of English essays, even with a small sample size, employing an experimental approach. The empirical findings indicate that ChatGPT can provide operational functionality for automated essay scoring, although the results exhibit a regression effect. It is imperative to underscore that the effective design and implementation of ChatGPT prompts necessitate a profound domain expertise and technical proficiency, as these prompts are subject to specific threshold criteria.

Deep Learning Based Cyberbullying Detection in Bangla Language,"Sristy Shidul Nath, Razuan Karim, Mahdi H. Miraz","The Internet is currently the largest platform for global communication including expressions of opinions, reviews, contents, images, videos and so forth. Moreover, social media has now become a very broad and highly engaging platform due to its immense popularity and swift adoption trend. Increased social networking, however, also has detrimental impacts on the society leading to a range of unwanted phenomena, such as online assault, intimidation, digital bullying, criminality and trolling. Hence, cyberbullying has become a pervasive and worrying problem that poses considerable psychological and emotional harm to the people, particularly amongst the teens and the young adults. In order to lessen its negative effects and provide victims with prompt support, a great deal of research to identify cyberbullying instances at various online platforms is emerging. In comparison to other languages, Bangla (also known as Bengali) has fewer research studies in this domain. This study demonstrates a deep learning strategy for identifying cyberbullying in Bengali, using a dataset of 12282 versatile comments from multiple social media sites. In this study, a two-layer bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model has been built to identify cyberbullying, using a variety of optimisers as well as 5-fold cross validation. To evaluate the functionality and efficacy of the proposed system, rigorous assessment and validation procedures have been employed throughout the project. The results of this study reveals that the proposed model's accuracy, using momentum-based stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimiser, is 94.46%. It also reflects a higher accuracy of 95.08% and a F1 score of 95.23% using Adam optimiser as well as a better accuracy of 94.31% in 5-fold cross validation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06787v1,2024-01
LLMs for Robotic Object Disambiguation,"Connie Jiang, Yiqing Xu, David Hsu","The advantages of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are apparent in a variety of language processing tasks. But can a language model's knowledge be further harnessed to effectively disambiguate objects and navigate decision-making challenges within the realm of robotics? Our study reveals the LLM's aptitude for solving complex decision making challenges that are often previously modeled by Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). A pivotal focus of our research is the object disambiguation capability of LLMs. We detail the integration of an LLM into a tabletop environment disambiguation task, a decision making problem where the robot's task is to discern and retrieve a user's desired object from an arbitrarily large and complex cluster of objects. Despite multiple query attempts with zero-shot prompt engineering (details can be found in the Appendix), the LLM struggled to inquire about features not explicitly provided in the scene description. In response, we have developed a few-shot prompt engineering system to improve the LLM's ability to pose disambiguating queries. The result is a model capable of both using given features when they are available and inferring new relevant features when necessary, to successfully generate and navigate down a precise decision tree to the correct object--even when faced with identical options.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03388v1,2024-01
Grimoire is All You Need for Enhancing Large Language Models,"Ding Chen, Shichao Song, Qingchen Yu, Zhiyu Li, Wenjin Wang, Feiyu Xiong, Bo Tang","In-context Learning (ICL) is one of the key methods for enhancing the performance of large language models on specific tasks by providing a set of few-shot examples. However, the ICL capability of different types of models shows significant variation due to factors such as model architecture, volume of learning data, and the size of parameters. Generally, the larger the model's parameter size and the more extensive the learning data, the stronger its ICL capability. In this paper, we propose a method SLEICL that involves learning from examples using strong language models and then summarizing and transferring these learned skills to weak language models for inference and application. This ensures the stability and effectiveness of ICL. Compared to directly enabling weak language models to learn from prompt examples, SLEICL reduces the difficulty of ICL for these models. Our experiments, conducted on up to eight datasets with five language models, demonstrate that weak language models achieve consistent improvement over their own zero-shot or few-shot capabilities using the SLEICL method. Some weak language models even surpass the performance of GPT4-1106-preview (zero-shot) with the aid of SLEICL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03385v2,2024-01
An Investigation of Large Language Models for Real-World Hate Speech Detection,"Keyan Guo, Alexander Hu, Jaden Mu, Ziheng Shi, Ziming Zhao, Nishant Vishwamitra, Hongxin Hu","Hate speech has emerged as a major problem plaguing our social spaces today. While there have been significant efforts to address this problem, existing methods are still significantly limited in effectively detecting hate speech online. A major limitation of existing methods is that hate speech detection is a highly contextual problem, and these methods cannot fully capture the context of hate speech to make accurate predictions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in several natural language tasks. LLMs have undergone extensive training using vast amounts of natural language data, enabling them to grasp intricate contextual details. Hence, they could be used as knowledge bases for context-aware hate speech detection. However, a fundamental problem with using LLMs to detect hate speech is that there are no studies on effectively prompting LLMs for context-aware hate speech detection. In this study, we conduct a large-scale study of hate speech detection, employing five established hate speech datasets. We discover that LLMs not only match but often surpass the performance of current benchmark machine learning models in identifying hate speech. By proposing four diverse prompting strategies that optimize the use of LLMs in detecting hate speech. Our study reveals that a meticulously crafted reasoning prompt can effectively capture the context of hate speech by fully utilizing the knowledge base in LLMs, significantly outperforming existing techniques. Furthermore, although LLMs can provide a rich knowledge base for the contextual detection of hate speech, suitable prompting strategies play a crucial role in effectively leveraging this knowledge base for efficient detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03346v1,2024-01
PIXAR: Auto-Regressive Language Modeling in Pixel Space,"Yintao Tai, Xiyang Liao, Alessandro Suglia, Antonio Vergari","Recent work showed the possibility of building open-vocabulary large language models (LLMs) that directly operate on pixel representations. These models are implemented as autoencoders that reconstruct masked patches of rendered text. However, these pixel-based LLMs are limited to discriminative tasks (e.g., classification) and, similar to BERT, cannot be used to generate text. Therefore, they cannot be used for generative tasks such as free-form question answering. In this work, we introduce PIXAR, the first pixel-based autoregressive LLM that performs text generation. Consisting of only a decoder, PIXAR can perform free-form generative tasks while keeping the number of parameters on par with previous encoder-decoder models. Furthermore, we highlight the challenges of generating text as non-noisy images and show this is due to using a maximum likelihood objective. To overcome this problem, we propose an adversarial pretraining stage that improves the readability and accuracy of PIXAR by 8.1 on LAMBADA and 8.5 on bAbI -- making it comparable to GPT-2 on text generation tasks. This paves the way to build open-vocabulary LLMs that operate on perceptual input only and calls into question the necessity of the usual symbolic input representation, i.e., text as (sub)tokens.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03321v2,2024-01
Enhancing Context Through Contrast,"Kshitij Ambilduke, Aneesh Shetye, Diksha Bagade, Rishika Bhagwatkar, Khurshed Fitter, Prasad Vagdargi, Shital Chiddarwar","Neural machine translation benefits from semantically rich representations. Considerable progress in learning such representations has been achieved by language modelling and mutual information maximization objectives using contrastive learning. The language-dependent nature of language modelling introduces a trade-off between the universality of the learned representations and the model's performance on the language modelling tasks. Although contrastive learning improves performance, its success cannot be attributed to mutual information alone. We propose a novel Context Enhancement step to improve performance on neural machine translation by maximizing mutual information using the Barlow Twins loss. Unlike other approaches, we do not explicitly augment the data but view languages as implicit augmentations, eradicating the risk of disrupting semantic information. Further, our method does not learn embeddings from scratch and can be generalised to any set of pre-trained embeddings. Finally, we evaluate the language-agnosticism of our embeddings through language classification and use them for neural machine translation to compare with state-of-the-art approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03314v1,2024-01
VLLaVO: Mitigating Visual Gap through LLMs,"Shuhao Chen, Yulong Zhang, Weisen Jiang, Jiangang Lu, Yu Zhang","Recent advances achieved by deep learning models rely on the independent and identically distributed assumption, hindering their applications in real-world scenarios with domain shifts. To tackle this issue, cross-domain learning aims at extracting domain-invariant knowledge to reduce the domain shift between training and testing data. However, in visual cross-domain learning, traditional methods concentrate solely on the image modality, disregarding the potential benefits of incorporating the text modality. In this work, we propose VLLaVO, combining Vision language models and Large Language models as Visual cross-dOmain learners. VLLaVO uses vision-language models to convert images into detailed textual descriptions. A large language model is then finetuned on textual descriptions of the source/target domain generated by a designed instruction template. Extensive experimental results under domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03253v2,2024-01
Reflections on Inductive Thematic Saturation as a potential metric for measuring the validity of an inductive Thematic Analysis with LLMs,"Stefano De Paoli, Walter Stan Mathis","This paper presents a set of reflections on saturation and the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for performing Thematic Analysis (TA). The paper suggests that initial thematic saturation (ITS) could be used as a metric to assess part of the transactional validity of TA with LLM, focusing on the initial coding. The paper presents the initial coding of two datasets of different sizes, and it reflects on how the LLM reaches some form of analytical saturation during the coding. The procedure proposed in this work leads to the creation of two codebooks, one comprising the total cumulative initial codes and the other the total unique codes. The paper proposes a metric to synthetically measure ITS using a simple mathematical calculation employing the ratio between slopes of cumulative codes and unique codes. The paper contributes to the initial body of work exploring how to perform qualitative analysis with LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03239v1,2024-01
Human-Instruction-Free LLM Self-Alignment with Limited Samples,"Hongyi Guo, Yuanshun Yao, Wei Shen, Jiaheng Wei, Xiaoying Zhang, Zhaoran Wang, Yang Liu","Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is a vital task for LLM practitioners. Current alignment techniques have several limitations: (1) requiring a large amount of annotated data; (2) demanding heavy human involvement; (3) lacking a systematic mechanism to continuously improve. In this work, we study aligning LLMs to a new domain with limited samples (e.g. < 100). We propose an algorithm that can self-align LLMs iteratively without active human involvement. Unlike existing works, our algorithm relies on neither human-crafted instructions nor labeled rewards, significantly reducing human involvement. In addition, our algorithm can self-improve the alignment continuously. The key idea is to first retrieve high-quality samples related to the target domain and use them as In-context Learning examples to generate more samples. Then we use the self-generated samples to finetune the LLM iteratively. We show that our method can unlock the LLMs' self-generalization ability to perform alignment with near-zero human supervision. We test our algorithm on three benchmarks in safety, truthfulness, and instruction-following, and show good performance in alignment, domain adaptability, and scalability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06785v1,2024-01
The Dawn After the Dark: An Empirical Study on Factuality Hallucination in Large Language Models,"Junyi Li, Jie Chen, Ruiyang Ren, Xiaoxue Cheng, Wayne Xin Zhao, Jian-Yun Nie, Ji-Rong Wen","In the era of large language models (LLMs), hallucination (i.e., the tendency to generate factually incorrect content) poses great challenge to trustworthy and reliable deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. To tackle the LLM hallucination, three key questions should be well studied: how to detect hallucinations (detection), why do LLMs hallucinate (source), and what can be done to mitigate them (mitigation). To address these challenges, this work presents a systematic empirical study on LLM hallucination, focused on the the three aspects of hallucination detection, source and mitigation. Specially, we construct a new hallucination benchmark HaluEval 2.0, and designs a simple yet effective detection method for LLM hallucination. Furthermore, we zoom into the different training or utilization stages of LLMs and extensively analyze the potential factors that lead to the LLM hallucination. Finally, we implement and examine a series of widely used techniques to mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our work has led to several important findings to understand the hallucination origin and mitigate the hallucinations in LLMs. Our code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/HaluEval-2.0.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03205v1,2024-01
MPN: Leveraging Multilingual Patch Neuron for Cross-lingual Model Editing,"Nianwen Si, Hao Zhang, Weiqiang Zhang","Large language models are known for encoding a vast amount of factual knowledge, but they often becomes outdated due to the ever-changing nature of external information. A promising solution to this challenge is the utilization of model editing methods to update the knowledge in an efficient manner. However, the majority of existing model editing techniques are limited to monolingual frameworks, thus failing to address the crucial issue of cross-lingual knowledge synchronization for multilingual models. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method that trains multilingual patch neuron to store cross-lingual knowledge. It can be easily adapted to existing approaches to enhance their cross-lingual editing capabilities. To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments using both the XNLI dataset and a self-constructed XFEVER dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves improved performance in cross-lingual editing tasks without requiring excessive modifications to the original methodology, thereby showcasing its user-friendly characteristics. Codes will be released soon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03190v1,2024-01
Exploring Defeasibility in Causal Reasoning,"Shaobo Cui, Lazar Milikic, Yiyang Feng, Mete Ismayilzada, Debjit Paul, Antoine Bosselut, Boi Faltings","Defeasibility in causal reasoning implies that the causal relationship between cause and effect can be strengthened or weakened. Namely, the causal strength between cause and effect should increase or decrease with the incorporation of strengthening arguments (supporters) or weakening arguments (defeaters), respectively. However, existing works ignore defeasibility in causal reasoning and fail to evaluate existing causal strength metrics in defeasible settings. In this work, we present $\delta$-CAUSAL, the first benchmark dataset for studying defeasibility in causal reasoning. $\delta$-CAUSAL includes around 11K events spanning ten domains, featuring defeasible causality pairs, i.e., cause-effect pairs accompanied by supporters and defeaters. We further show current causal strength metrics fail to reflect the change of causal strength with the incorporation of supporters or defeaters in $\delta$-CAUSAL. To this end, we propose CESAR (Causal Embedding aSsociation with Attention Rating), a metric that measures causal strength based on token-level causal relationships. CESAR achieves a significant 69.7% relative improvement over existing metrics, increasing from 47.2% to 80.1% in capturing the causal strength change brought by supporters and defeaters. We further demonstrate even Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 still lag 4.5 and 10.7 points behind humans in generating supporters and defeaters, emphasizing the challenge posed by $\delta$-CAUSAL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03183v2,2024-01
A Joint-Reasoning based Disease Q&A System,"Prakash Chandra Sukhwal, Vaibhav Rajan, Atreyi Kankanhalli","Medical question answer (QA) assistants respond to lay users' health-related queries by synthesizing information from multiple sources using natural language processing and related techniques. They can serve as vital tools to alleviate issues of misinformation, information overload, and complexity of medical language, thus addressing lay users' information needs while reducing the burden on healthcare professionals. QA systems, the engines of such assistants, have typically used either language models (LMs) or knowledge graphs (KG), though the approaches could be complementary. LM-based QA systems excel at understanding complex questions and providing well-formed answers, but are prone to factual mistakes. KG-based QA systems, which represent facts well, are mostly limited to answering short-answer questions with pre-created templates. While a few studies have jointly used LM and KG approaches for text-based QA, this was done to answer multiple-choice questions. Extant QA systems also have limitations in terms of automation and performance. We address these challenges by designing a novel, automated disease QA system which effectively utilizes both LM and KG techniques through a joint-reasoning approach to answer disease-related questions appropriate for lay users. Our evaluation of the system using a range of quality metrics demonstrates its efficacy over benchmark systems, including the popular ChatGPT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03181v2,2024-01
Text-Video Retrieval via Variational Multi-Modal Hypergraph Networks,"Qian Li, Lixin Su, Jiashu Zhao, Long Xia, Hengyi Cai, Suqi Cheng, Hengzhu Tang, Junfeng Wang, Dawei Yin","Text-video retrieval is a challenging task that aims to identify relevant videos given textual queries. Compared to conventional textual retrieval, the main obstacle for text-video retrieval is the semantic gap between the textual nature of queries and the visual richness of video content. Previous works primarily focus on aligning the query and the video by finely aggregating word-frame matching signals. Inspired by the human cognitive process of modularly judging the relevance between text and video, the judgment needs high-order matching signal due to the consecutive and complex nature of video contents. In this paper, we propose chunk-level text-video matching, where the query chunks are extracted to describe a specific retrieval unit, and the video chunks are segmented into distinct clips from videos. We formulate the chunk-level matching as n-ary correlations modeling between words of the query and frames of the video and introduce a multi-modal hypergraph for n-ary correlation modeling. By representing textual units and video frames as nodes and using hyperedges to depict their relationships, a multi-modal hypergraph is constructed. In this way, the query and the video can be aligned in a high-order semantic space. In addition, to enhance the model's generalization ability, the extracted features are fed into a variational inference component for computation, obtaining the variational representation under the Gaussian distribution. The incorporation of hypergraphs and variational inference allows our model to capture complex, n-ary interactions among textual and visual contents. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the text-video retrieval task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03177v1,2024-01
Part-of-Speech Tagger for Bodo Language using Deep Learning approach,"Dhrubajyoti Pathak, Sanjib Narzary, Sukumar Nandi, Bidisha Som","Language Processing systems such as Part-of-speech tagging, Named entity recognition, Machine translation, Speech recognition, and Language modeling (LM) are well-studied in high-resource languages. Nevertheless, research on these systems for several low-resource languages, including Bodo, Mizo, Nagamese, and others, is either yet to commence or is in its nascent stages. Language model plays a vital role in the downstream tasks of modern NLP. Extensive studies are carried out on LMs for high-resource languages. Nevertheless, languages such as Bodo, Rabha, and Mising continue to lack coverage. In this study, we first present BodoBERT, a language model for the Bodo language. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first such effort to develop a language model for Bodo. Secondly, we present an ensemble DL-based POS tagging model for Bodo. The POS tagging model is based on combinations of BiLSTM with CRF and stacked embedding of BodoBERT with BytePairEmbeddings. We cover several language models in the experiment to see how well they work in POS tagging tasks. The best-performing model achieves an F1 score of 0.8041. A comparative experiment was also conducted on Assamese POS taggers, considering that the language is spoken in the same region as Bodo.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03175v1,2024-01
MultiSiam: A Multiple Input Siamese Network For Social Media Text Classification And Duplicate Text Detection,"Sudhanshu Bhoi, Swapnil Markhedkar, Shruti Phadke, Prashant Agrawal","Social media accounts post increasingly similar content, creating a chaotic experience across platforms, which makes accessing desired information difficult. These posts can be organized by categorizing and grouping duplicates across social handles and accounts. There can be more than one duplicate of a post, however, a conventional Siamese neural network only considers a pair of inputs for duplicate text detection. In this paper, we first propose a multiple-input Siamese network, MultiSiam. This condensed network is then used to propose another model, SMCD (Social Media Classification and Duplication Model) to perform both duplicate text grouping and categorization. The MultiSiam network, just like the Siamese, can be used in multiple applications by changing the sub-network appropriately.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06783v1,2024-01
Quartet Logic: A Four-Step Reasoning (QLFR) framework for advancing Short Text Classification,"Hui Wu, Yuanben Zhang, Zhonghe Han, Yingyan Hou, Lei Wang, Siye Liu, Qihang Gong, Yunping Ge","Short Text Classification (STC) is crucial for processing and comprehending the brief but substantial content prevalent on contemporary digital platforms. The STC encounters difficulties in grasping semantic and syntactic intricacies, an issue that is apparent in traditional pre-trained language models. Although Graph Convolutional Networks enhance performance by integrating external knowledge bases, these methods are limited by the quality and extent of the knowledge applied. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has significantly improved the performance of complex reasoning tasks. However, some studies have highlighted the limitations of their application in fundamental NLP tasks. Consequently, this study sought to employ CoT to investigate the capabilities of LLMs in STC tasks. This study introduces Quartet Logic: A Four-Step Reasoning (QLFR) framework. This framework primarily incorporates Syntactic and Semantic Enrichment CoT, effectively decomposing the STC task into four distinct steps: (i) essential concept identification, (ii) common-sense knowledge retrieval, (iii) text rewriting, and (iv) classification. This elicits the inherent knowledge and abilities of LLMs to address the challenges in STC. Surprisingly, we found that QLFR can also improve the performance of smaller models. Therefore, we developed a CoT-Driven Multi-task learning (QLFR-CML) method to facilitate the knowledge transfer from LLMs to smaller models. Extensive experimentation across six short-text benchmarks validated the efficacy of the proposed methods. Notably, QLFR achieved state-of-the-art performance on all datasets, with significant improvements, particularly on the Ohsumed and TagMyNews datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03158v1,2024-01
Enhancing Essay Scoring with Adversarial Weights Perturbation and Metric-specific AttentionPooling,"Jiaxin Huang, Xinyu Zhao, Chang Che, Qunwei Lin, Bo Liu","The objective of this study is to improve automated feedback tools designed for English Language Learners (ELLs) through the utilization of data science techniques encompassing machine learning, natural language processing, and educational data analytics. Automated essay scoring (AES) research has made strides in evaluating written essays, but it often overlooks the specific needs of English Language Learners (ELLs) in language development. This study explores the application of BERT-related techniques to enhance the assessment of ELLs' writing proficiency within AES.   To address the specific needs of ELLs, we propose the use of DeBERTa, a state-of-the-art neural language model, for improving automated feedback tools. DeBERTa, pretrained on large text corpora using self-supervised learning, learns universal language representations adaptable to various natural language understanding tasks. The model incorporates several innovative techniques, including adversarial training through Adversarial Weights Perturbation (AWP) and Metric-specific AttentionPooling (6 kinds of AP) for each label in the competition.   The primary focus of this research is to investigate the impact of hyperparameters, particularly the adversarial learning rate, on the performance of the model. By fine-tuning the hyperparameter tuning process, including the influence of 6AP and AWP, the resulting models can provide more accurate evaluations of language proficiency and support tailored learning tasks for ELLs. This work has the potential to significantly benefit ELLs by improving their English language proficiency and facilitating their educational journey.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.05433v1,2024-01

Given the potent applications of LLMs in numerous fields, there has been a surge in LLM development. In developing LLMs, a common practice involves continual pre-training on previously fine-tuned models. However, this can lead to catastrophic forgetting. In our work, we investigate the phenomenon of forgetting that occurs during continual pre-training on an existing fine-tuned LLM. We evaluate the impact of continuous pre-training on the fine-tuned LLM across various dimensions, including output format, knowledge, and reliability. Experiment results highlight the non-trivial challenge of addressing catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training, especially the repetition issue.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03129v1,2024-01

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) reveal their potential for cognitive simulation. However, these LLM-based cognitive studies primarily focus on static modeling, overlooking the dynamic nature of cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of the cognitive dynamics of LLMs and present a corresponding task with the inspiration of longitudinal studies. Towards the task, we develop CogBench, a novel benchmark to assess the cognitive dynamics of LLMs and validate it through participant surveys. We also design two evaluation metrics for CogBench, including Authenticity and Rationality. Recognizing the inherent static nature of LLMs, we introduce CogGPT for the task, which features an innovative iterative cognitive mechanism aimed at enhancing lifelong cognitive dynamics. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of CogGPT over existing methods, particularly in its ability to facilitate role-specific cognitive dynamics under continuous information flows.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08438v2,2024-01

Exploring Gender Biases in Language Patterns of Human-Conversational Agent Conversations,Weizi Liu,"With the rise of human-machine communication, machines are increasingly designed with humanlike characteristics, such as gender, which can inadvertently trigger cognitive biases. Many conversational agents (CAs), such as voice assistants and chatbots, default to female personas, leading to concerns about perpetuating gender stereotypes and inequality. Critiques have emerged regarding the potential objectification of females and reinforcement of gender stereotypes by these technologies. This research, situated in conversational AI design, aims to delve deeper into the impacts of gender biases in human-CA interactions. From a behavioral and communication research standpoint, this program focuses not only on perceptions but also the linguistic styles of users when interacting with CAs, as previous research has rarely explored. It aims to understand how pre-existing gender biases might be triggered by CAs' gender designs. It further investigates how CAs' gender designs may reinforce gender biases and extend them to human-human communication. The findings aim to inform ethical design of conversational agents, addressing whether gender assignment in CAs is appropriate and how to promote gender equality in design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.03030v1,2024-01

To support the pre-training phase, we have developed a dataset that currently consists of 2 trillion tokens and is continuously expanding. We further conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on DeepSeek LLM Base models, resulting in the creation of DeepSeek Chat models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that DeepSeek LLM 67B surpasses LLaMA-2 70B on various benchmarks, particularly in the domains of code, mathematics, and reasoning. Furthermore, open-ended evaluations reveal that DeepSeek LLM 67B Chat exhibits superior performance compared to GPT-3.5.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02954v1,2024-01
Can Large Language Models Understand Molecules?,"Shaghayegh Sadeghi, Alan Bui, Ali Forooghi, Jianguo Lu, Alioune Ngom","Purpose: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) from OpenAI and LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) from Meta AI are increasingly recognized for their potential in the field of cheminformatics, particularly in understanding Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES), a standard method for representing chemical structures. These LLMs also have the ability to decode SMILES strings into vector representations.   Method: We investigate the performance of GPT and LLaMA compared to pre-trained models on SMILES in embedding SMILES strings on downstream tasks, focusing on two key applications: molecular property prediction and drug-drug interaction prediction.   Results: We find that SMILES embeddings generated using LLaMA outperform those from GPT in both molecular property and DDI prediction tasks. Notably, LLaMA-based SMILES embeddings show results comparable to pre-trained models on SMILES in molecular prediction tasks and outperform the pre-trained models for the DDI prediction tasks.   Conclusion: The performance of LLMs in generating SMILES embeddings shows great potential for further investigation of these models for molecular embedding. We hope our study bridges the gap between LLMs and molecular embedding, motivating additional research into the potential of LLMs in the molecular representation field.

Towards ASR Robust Spoken Language Understanding Through In-Context Learning With Word Confusion Networks,"Kevin Everson, Yile Gu, Huck Yang, Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar, Guan-Ting Lin, Jari Kolehmainen, Ivan Bulyko, Ankur Gandhe, Shalini Ghosh, Wael Hamza, Hung-yi Lee, Ariya Rastrow, Andreas Stolcke","In the realm of spoken language understanding (SLU), numerous natural language understanding (NLU) methodologies have been adapted by supplying large language models (LLMs) with transcribed speech instead of conventional written text. In real-world scenarios, prior to input into an LLM, an automated speech recognition (ASR) system generates an output transcript hypothesis, where inherent errors can degrade subsequent SLU tasks. Here we introduce a method that utilizes the ASR system's lattice output instead of relying solely on the top hypothesis, aiming to encapsulate speech ambiguities and enhance SLU outcomes. Our in-context learning experiments, covering spoken question answering and intent classification, underline the LLM's resilience to noisy speech transcripts with the help of word confusion networks from lattices, bridging the SLU performance gap between using the top ASR hypothesis and an oracle upper bound. Additionally, we delve into the LLM's robustness to varying ASR performance conditions and scrutinize the aspects of in-context learning which prove the most influential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02921v1,2024-01
Introducing Bode: A Fine-Tuned Large Language Model for Portuguese Prompt-Based Task,"Gabriel Lino Garcia, Pedro Henrique Paiola, Luis Henrique Morelli, Giovani Candido, Arnaldo Cândido Júnior, Danilo Samuel Jodas, Luis C. S. Afonso, Ivan Rizzo Guilherme, Bruno Elias Penteado, João Paulo Papa","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bringing advances to Natural Language Processing. However, low-resource languages, those lacking extensive prominence in datasets for various NLP tasks, or where existing datasets are not as substantial, such as Portuguese, already obtain several benefits from LLMs, but not to the same extent. LLMs trained on multilingual datasets normally struggle to respond to prompts in Portuguese satisfactorily, presenting, for example, code switching in their responses. This work proposes a fine-tuned LLaMA 2-based model for Portuguese prompts named Bode in two versions: 7B and 13B. We evaluate the performance of this model in classification tasks using the zero-shot approach with in-context learning, and compare it with other LLMs. Our main contribution is to bring an LLM with satisfactory results in the Portuguese language, as well as to provide a model that is free for research or commercial purposes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02909v1,2024-01
MLLM-Protector: Ensuring MLLM's Safety without Hurting Performance,"Renjie Pi, Tianyang Han, Jianshu Zhang, Yueqi Xie, Rui Pan, Qing Lian, Hanze Dong, Jipeng Zhang, Tong Zhang","The deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has brought forth a unique vulnerability: susceptibility to malicious attacks through visual inputs. This paper investigates the novel challenge of defending MLLMs against such attacks. Compared to large language models (LLMs), MLLMs include an additional image modality. We discover that images act as a ``foreign language"" that is not considered during safety alignment, making MLLMs more prone to producing harmful responses. Unfortunately, unlike the discrete tokens considered in text-based LLMs, the continuous nature of image signals presents significant alignment challenges, which poses difficulty to thoroughly cover all possible scenarios. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that most state-of-the-art MLLMs are fine-tuned on limited image-text pairs that are much fewer than the extensive text-based pretraining corpus, which makes the MLLMs more prone to catastrophic forgetting of their original abilities during safety fine-tuning. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MLLM-Protector, a plug-and-play strategy that solves two subtasks: 1) identifying harmful responses via a lightweight harm detector, and 2) transforming harmful responses into harmless ones via a detoxifier. This approach effectively mitigates the risks posed by malicious visual inputs without compromising the original performance of MLLMs. Our results demonstrate that MLLM-Protector offers a robust solution to a previously unaddressed aspect of MLLM security.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02906v3,2024-01
AFSPP: Agent Framework for Shaping Preference and Personality with Large Language Models,"Zihong He, Changwang Zhang","The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a new paradigm for investigating human behavior emulation. Recent research has employed LLM-based Agents to create a sociological research environment, in which agents exhibit behavior based on the unfiltered characteristics of large language models. However, these studies overlook the iterative development within a human-like setting - Human preferences and personalities are complex, shaped by various factors and subject to ongoing change as a result of environmental and subjective influences. In light of this observation, we propose Agent Framework for Shaping Preference and Personality (AFSPP), exploring the multifaceted impact of social networks and subjective consciousness on LLM-based Agents' preference and personality formation. With AFSPP, we have, for the first time, successfully replicated several key findings from human personality experiments. And other AFSPP-based experimental results indicate that plan making, sensory perceptions and social networking with subjective information, wield the most pronounced influence on preference shaping. AFSPP can significantly enhance the efficiency and scope of psychological experiments, while yielding valuable insights for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence research for strategies to prevent undesirable preference and personality development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02870v1,2024-01
Pheme: Efficient and Conversational Speech Generation,"Paweł Budzianowski, Taras Sereda, Tomasz Cichy, Ivan Vulić","In recent years, speech generation has seen remarkable progress, now achieving one-shot generation capability that is often virtually indistinguishable from real human voice. Integrating such advancements in speech generation with large language models might revolutionize a wide range of applications. However, certain applications, such as assistive conversational systems, require natural and conversational speech generation tools that also operate efficiently in real time. Current state-of-the-art models like VALL-E and SoundStorm, powered by hierarchical neural audio codecs, require large neural components and extensive training data to work well. In contrast, MQTTS aims to build more compact conversational TTS models while capitalizing on smaller-scale real-life conversational speech data. However, its autoregressive nature yields high inference latency and thus limits its real-time usage. In order to mitigate the current limitations of the state-of-the-art TTS models while capitalizing on their strengths, in this work we introduce the Pheme model series that 1) offers compact yet high-performing models, 2) allows for parallel speech generation of 3) natural conversational speech, and 4) it can be trained efficiently on smaller-scale conversational data, cutting data demands by more than 10x but still matching the quality of the autoregressive TTS models. We also show that through simple teacher-student distillation we can meet significant improvements in voice quality for single-speaker setups on top of pretrained Pheme checkpoints, relying solely on synthetic speech generated by much larger teacher models. Audio samples and pretrained models are available online.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02839v1,2024-01
DocGraphLM: Documental Graph Language Model for Information Extraction,"Dongsheng Wang, Zhiqiang Ma, Armineh Nourbakhsh, Kang Gu, Sameena Shah","Advances in Visually Rich Document Understanding (VrDU) have enabled information extraction and question answering over documents with complex layouts. Two tropes of architectures have emerged -- transformer-based models inspired by LLMs, and Graph Neural Networks. In this paper, we introduce DocGraphLM, a novel framework that combines pre-trained language models with graph semantics. To achieve this, we propose 1) a joint encoder architecture to represent documents, and 2) a novel link prediction approach to reconstruct document graphs. DocGraphLM predicts both directions and distances between nodes using a convergent joint loss function that prioritizes neighborhood restoration and downweighs distant node detection. Our experiments on three SotA datasets show consistent improvement on IE and QA tasks with the adoption of graph features. Moreover, we report that adopting the graph features accelerates convergence in the learning process during training, despite being solely constructed through link prediction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02823v1,2024-01
PeFoMed: Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models for Medical Imaging,"Gang Liu, Jinlong He, Pengfei Li, Genrong He, Zhaolin Chen, Shenjun Zhong","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent an evolutionary expansion in the capabilities of traditional large language models, enabling them to tackle challenges that surpass the scope of purely text-based applications. It leverages the knowledge previously encoded within these language models, thereby enhancing their applicability and functionality in the reign of multimodal contexts. Recent works investigate the adaptation of MLLMs as a universal solution to address medical multi-modal problems as a generative task. In this paper, we propose a parameter efficient framework for fine-tuning MLLMs, specifically validated on medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) and medical report generation (MRG) tasks, using public benchmark datasets. We also introduce an evaluation metric using the 5-point Likert scale and its weighted average value to measure the quality of the generated reports for MRG tasks, where the scale ratings are labelled by both humans manually and the GPT-4 model. We further assess the consistency of performance metrics across traditional measures, GPT-4, and human ratings for both VQA and MRG tasks. The results indicate that semantic similarity assessments using GPT-4 align closely with human annotators and provide greater stability, yet they reveal a discrepancy when compared to conventional lexical similarity measurements. This questions the reliability of lexical similarity metrics for evaluating the performance of generative models in Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Besides, our fine-tuned model significantly outperforms GPT-4v. This indicates that without additional fine-tuning, multi-modal models like GPT-4v do not perform effectively on medical imaging tasks. The code will be available here: https://github.com/jinlHe/PeFoMed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02797v2,2024-01
Large Language Models in Plant Biology,"Hilbert Yuen In Lam, Xing Er Ong, Marek Mutwil","Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have taken the world by storm and have passed certain forms of the Turing test. However, LLMs are not limited to human language and analyze sequential data, such as DNA, protein, and gene expression. The resulting foundation models can be repurposed to identify the complex patterns within the data, resulting in powerful, multi-purpose prediction tools able to explain cellular systems. This review outlines the different types of LLMs and showcases their recent uses in biology.

From LLM to Conversational Agent: A Memory Enhanced Architecture with Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models,"Na Liu, Liangyu Chen, Xiaoyu Tian, Wei Zou, Kaijiang Chen, Ming Cui","This paper introduces RAISE (Reasoning and Acting through Scratchpad and Examples), an advanced architecture enhancing the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 into conversational agents. RAISE, an enhancement of the ReAct framework, incorporates a dual-component memory system, mirroring human short-term and long-term memory, to maintain context and continuity in conversations. It entails a comprehensive agent construction scenario, including phases like Conversation Selection, Scene Extraction, CoT Completion, and Scene Augmentation, leading to the LLMs Training phase. This approach appears to enhance agent controllability and adaptability in complex, multi-turn dialogues. Our preliminary evaluations in a real estate sales context suggest that RAISE has some advantages over traditional agents, indicating its potential for broader applications. This work contributes to the AI field by providing a robust framework for developing more context-aware and versatile conversational agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02777v2,2024-01
Complex systems approach to natural language,"Tomasz Stanisz, Stanisław Drożdż, Jarosław Kwapień","The review summarizes the main methodological concepts used in studying natural language from the perspective of complexity science and documents their applicability in identifying both universal and system-specific features of language in its written representation. Three main complexity-related research trends in quantitative linguistics are covered. The first part addresses the issue of word frequencies in texts and demonstrates that taking punctuation into consideration restores scaling whose violation in the Zipf's law is often observed for the most frequent words. The second part introduces methods inspired by time series analysis, used in studying various kinds of correlations in written texts. The related time series are generated on the basis of text partition into sentences or into phrases between consecutive punctuation marks. It turns out that these series develop features often found in signals generated by complex systems, like long-range correlations or (multi)fractal structures. Moreover, it appears that the distances between punctuation marks comply with the discrete variant of the Weibull distribution. In the third part, the application of the network formalism to natural language is reviewed, particularly in the context of the so-called word-adjacency networks. Parameters characterizing topology of such networks can be used for classification of texts, for example, from a stylometric perspective. Network approach can also be applied to represent the organization of word associations. Structure of word-association networks turns out to be significantly different from that observed in random networks, revealing genuine properties of language. Finally, punctuation seems to have a significant impact not only on the language's information-carrying ability but also on its key statistical properties, hence it is recommended to consider punctuation marks on a par with words.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02772v1,2024-01
Hyperparameter-Free Approach for Faster Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding,"Yuu Jinnai, Kaito Ariu","Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding is shown to be a powerful alternative to beam search decoding for a wide range of text generation tasks. However, MBR requires a huge amount of time for inference to compute the MBR objective, which makes the method infeasible in many situations where response time is critical. Confidence-based pruning (CBP) (Cheng and Vlachos, 2023) has recently been proposed to reduce the inference time in machine translation tasks. Although it is shown to significantly reduce the amount of computation, it requires hyperparameter tuning using a development set to be effective. To this end, we propose Approximate Minimum Bayes-Risk (AMBR) decoding, a hyperparameter-free method to run MBR decoding approximately. AMBR is derived from the observation that the problem of computing the sample-based MBR objective is the medoid identification problem. AMBR uses the Correlated Sequential Halving (CSH) algorithm (Baharav and Tse, 2019), the best approximation algorithm to date for the medoid identification problem, to compute the sample-based MBR objective. We evaluate AMBR on machine translation, text summarization, and image captioning tasks. The results show that AMBR achieves on par with CBP, with CBP selecting hyperparameters through an Oracle for each given computation budget.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02749v2,2024-01
MAMI: Multi-Attentional Mutual-Information for Long Sequence Neuron Captioning,"Alfirsa Damasyifa Fauzulhaq, Wahyu Parwitayasa, Joseph Ananda Sugihdharma, M. Fadli Ridhani, Novanto Yudistira","Neuron labeling is an approach to visualize the behaviour and respond of a certain neuron to a certain pattern that activates the neuron. Neuron labeling extract information about the features captured by certain neurons in a deep neural network, one of which uses the encoder-decoder image captioning approach. The encoder used can be a pretrained CNN-based model and the decoder is an RNN-based model for text generation. Previous work, namely MILAN (Mutual Information-guided Linguistic Annotation of Neuron), has tried to visualize the neuron behaviour using modified Show, Attend, and Tell (SAT) model in the encoder, and LSTM added with Bahdanau attention in the decoder. MILAN can show great result on short sequence neuron captioning, but it does not show great result on long sequence neuron captioning, so in this work, we would like to improve the performance of MILAN even more by utilizing different kind of attention mechanism and additionally adding several attention result into one, in order to combine all the advantages from several attention mechanism. Using our compound dataset, we obtained higher BLEU and F1-Score on our proposed model, achieving 17.742 and 0.4811 respectively. At some point where the model converges at the peak, our model obtained BLEU of 21.2262 and BERTScore F1-Score of 0.4870.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02744v1,2024-01

We provide an initial analysis for a range of pre-trained mono- and multilingual models evaluated on the outcome of different clustering algorithms. Results include strong performing mono- and multilingual models. Reducing the dimensions of embeddings can further improve clustering. Additionally, we conduct experiments with continued pre-training for German BERT models to estimate the benefits of this additional training.

AST-T5: Structure-Aware Pretraining for Code Generation and Understanding,"Linyuan Gong, Mostafa Elhoushi, Alvin Cheung","Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in code-related tasks, yet many LLMs treat code as simple sequences, neglecting its structured nature. We introduce AST-T5, a novel pretraining paradigm that leverages the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for enhanced code generation, transpilation, and understanding. Using dynamic programming, our AST-Aware Segmentation retains code structure, while our AST-Aware Span Corruption objective equips the model to reconstruct various code structures. Unlike other models, AST-T5 avoids intricate program analyses or architectural changes, so it integrates seamlessly with any encoder-decoder Transformer. Evaluations show that AST-T5 consistently outperforms similar-sized LMs across various code-related tasks. Structure-awareness makes AST-T5 particularly powerful in code-to-code tasks, surpassing CodeT5 by 2 points in exact match score for the Bugs2Fix task and by 3 points in exact match score for Java-C# Transpilation in CodeXGLUE.

Unsupervised hard Negative Augmentation for contrastive learning,"Yuxuan Shu, Vasileios Lampos","We present Unsupervised hard Negative Augmentation (UNA), a method that generates synthetic negative instances based on the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) retrieval model. UNA uses TF-IDF scores to ascertain the perceived importance of terms in a sentence and then produces negative samples by replacing terms with respect to that. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with UNA improve the overall performance in semantic textual similarity tasks. Additional performance gains are obtained when combining UNA with the paraphrasing augmentation. Further results show that our method is compatible with different backbone models. Ablation studies also support the choice of having a TF-IDF-driven control on negative augmentation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02594v1,2024-01
Identifying Risk Patterns in Brazilian Police Reports Preceding Femicides: A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Based Analysis,"Vinicius Lima, Jaque Almeida de Oliveira","Femicide refers to the killing of a female victim, often perpetrated by an intimate partner or family member, and is also associated with gender-based violence. Studies have shown that there is a pattern of escalating violence leading up to these killings, highlighting the potential for prevention if the level of danger to the victim can be assessed. Machine learning offers a promising approach to address this challenge by predicting risk levels based on textual descriptions of the violence. In this study, we employed the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) technique to identify patterns of behavior in Brazilian police reports preceding femicides. Our first objective was to classify the content of these reports as indicating either a lower or higher risk of the victim being murdered, achieving an accuracy of 66%. In the second approach, we developed a model to predict the next action a victim might experience within a sequence of patterned events. Both approaches contribute to the understanding and assessment of the risks associated with domestic violence, providing authorities with valuable insights to protect women and prevent situations from escalating.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12980v1,2024-01
"Memory, Consciousness and Large Language Model","Jitang Li, Jinzheng Li","With the development in cognitive science and Large Language Models (LLMs), increasing connections have come to light between these two distinct fields. Building upon these connections, we propose a conjecture suggesting the existence of a duality between LLMs and Tulving's theory of memory. We identify a potential correspondence between Tulving's synergistic ecphory model (SEM) of retrieval and the emergent abilities observed in LLMs, serving as supporting evidence for our conjecture. Furthermore, we speculate that consciousness may be considered a form of emergent ability based on this duality. We also discuss how other theories of consciousness intersect with our research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02509v2,2024-01
Task Oriented Dialogue as a Catalyst for Self-Supervised Automatic Speech Recognition,"David M. Chan, Shalini Ghosh, Hitesh Tulsiani, Ariya Rastrow, Björn Hoffmeister","While word error rates of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have consistently fallen, natural language understanding (NLU) applications built on top of ASR systems still attribute significant numbers of failures to low-quality speech recognition results. Existing assistant systems collect large numbers of these unsuccessful interactions, but these systems usually fail to learn from these interactions, even in an offline fashion. In this work, we introduce CLC: Contrastive Learning for Conversations, a family of methods for contrastive fine-tuning of models in a self-supervised fashion, making use of easily detectable artifacts in unsuccessful conversations with assistants. We demonstrate that our CLC family of approaches can improve the performance of ASR models on OD3, a new public large-scale semi-synthetic meta-dataset of audio task-oriented dialogues, by up to 19.2%. These gains transfer to real-world systems as well, where we show that CLC can help to improve performance by up to 6.7% over baselines.

We tune the expanded blocks using only new corpus, efficiently and effectively improving the model's knowledge without catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we experiment on the corpus of code and math, yielding LLaMA Pro-8.3B, a versatile foundation model initialized from LLaMA2-7B, excelling in general tasks, programming, and mathematics.

LLM Augmented LLMs: Expanding Capabilities through Composition,"Rachit Bansal, Bidisha Samanta, Siddharth Dalmia, Nitish Gupta, Shikhar Vashishth, Sriram Ganapathy, Abhishek Bapna, Prateek Jain, Partha Talukdar","Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains. However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills. On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks. In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities. To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities. Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings. We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages. Similarly, when PaLM2-S is augmented with a code-specific model, we see a relative improvement of 40\% over the base model for code generation and explanation tasks -- on-par with fully fine-tuned counterparts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02412v1,2024-01

SPEER: Sentence-Level Planning of Long Clinical Summaries via Embedded Entity Retrieval,"Griffin Adams, Jason Zucker, Noémie Elhadad","Clinician must write a lengthy summary each time a patient is discharged from the hospital. This task is time-consuming due to the sheer number of unique clinical concepts covered in the admission. Identifying and covering salient entities is vital for the summary to be clinically useful. We fine-tune open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Zephyr-7B-beta) on the task and find that they generate incomplete and unfaithful summaries. To increase entity coverage, we train a smaller, encoder-only model to predict salient entities, which are treated as content-plans to guide the LLM. To encourage the LLM to focus on specific mentions in the source notes, we propose SPEER: Sentence-level Planning via Embedded Entity Retrieval. Specifically, we mark each salient entity span with special ""{{ }}"" boundary tags and instruct the LLM to retrieve marked spans before generating each sentence. Sentence-level planning acts as a form of state tracking in that the model is explicitly recording the entities it uses. We fine-tune Mistral and Zephyr variants on a large-scale, diverse dataset of ~167k in-patient hospital admissions and evaluate on 3 datasets.

Our methodology involves storing PDFs in the retrieval database and extracting tabular content separately. The extracted tables undergo a process of context enrichment, concatenating headers with corresponding values. To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the enriched data, we employ a fine-tuned version of the Llama-2-chat language model for summarisation within the RAG architecture. Furthermore, we augment the tabular data with contextual sense using the ChatGPT 3.5 API through a one-shot prompt. This enriched data is then fed into the retrieval database alongside other PDFs.

In this work, we have evaluated the performance of LLMs for spoken task-oriented dialogues on the DSTC11 test sets. Due to the lack of proper spoken dialogue datasets, we have automatically transcribed a development set of spoken dialogues with a state-of-the-art ASR engine. We have characterized the ASR-error types and their distributions and simulated these errors in a large dataset of dialogues. We report the intrinsic (perplexity) and extrinsic (human evaluation) performance of fine-tuned GPT-2 and T5 models in two subtasks of response generation and dialogue state tracking, respectively. The results show that LLMs are not robust to spoken noise by default, however, fine-tuning/training such models on a proper dataset of spoken TODs can result in a more robust performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02297v1,2024-01
PokerGPT: An End-to-End Lightweight Solver for Multi-Player Texas Hold'em via Large Language Model,"Chenghao Huang, Yanbo Cao, Yinlong Wen, Tao Zhou, Yanru Zhang","Poker, also known as Texas Hold'em, has always been a typical research target within imperfect information games (IIGs). IIGs have long served as a measure of artificial intelligence (AI) development. Representative prior works, such as DeepStack and Libratus heavily rely on counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) to tackle heads-up no-limit Poker. However, it is challenging for subsequent researchers to learn CFR from previous models and apply it to other real-world applications due to the expensive computational cost of CFR iterations. Additionally, CFR is difficult to apply to multi-player games due to the exponential growth of the game tree size. In this work, we introduce PokerGPT, an end-to-end solver for playing Texas Hold'em with arbitrary number of players and gaining high win rates, established on a lightweight large language model (LLM). PokerGPT only requires simple textual information of Poker games for generating decision-making advice, thus guaranteeing the convenient interaction between AI and humans. We mainly transform a set of textual records acquired from real games into prompts, and use them to fine-tune a lightweight pre-trained LLM using reinforcement learning human feedback technique. To improve fine-tuning performance, we conduct prompt engineering on raw data, including filtering useful information, selecting behaviors of players with high win rates, and further processing them into textual instruction using multiple prompt engineering techniques. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that PokerGPT outperforms previous approaches in terms of win rate, model size, training time, and response speed, indicating the great potential of LLMs in solving IIGs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06781v1,2024-01
Rethinking Response Evaluation from Interlocutor's Eye for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems,"Yuma Tsuta, Naoki Yoshinaga, Shoetsu Sato, Masashi Toyoda","Open-domain dialogue systems have started to engage in continuous conversations with humans. Those dialogue systems are required to be adjusted to the human interlocutor and evaluated in terms of their perspective. However, it is questionable whether the current automatic evaluation methods can approximate the interlocutor's judgments. In this study, we analyzed and examined what features are needed in an automatic response evaluator from the interlocutor's perspective. The first experiment on the Hazumi dataset revealed that interlocutor awareness plays a critical role in making automatic response evaluation correlate with the interlocutor's judgments. The second experiment using massive conversations on X (formerly Twitter) confirmed that dialogue continuity prediction can train an interlocutor-aware response evaluator without human feedback while revealing the difficulty in evaluating generated responses compared to human responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02256v1,2024-01
L3Cube-IndicNews: News-based Short Text and Long Document Classification Datasets in Indic Languages,"Aishwarya Mirashi, Srushti Sonavane, Purva Lingayat, Tejas Padhiyar, Raviraj Joshi","In this work, we introduce L3Cube-IndicNews, a multilingual text classification corpus aimed at curating a high-quality dataset for Indian regional languages, with a specific focus on news headlines and articles. We have centered our work on 10 prominent Indic languages, including Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada, Odia, Malayalam, and Punjabi. Each of these news datasets comprises 10 or more classes of news articles. L3Cube-IndicNews offers 3 distinct datasets tailored to handle different document lengths that are classified as: Short Headlines Classification (SHC) dataset containing the news headline and news category, Long Document Classification (LDC) dataset containing the whole news article and the news category, and Long Paragraph Classification (LPC) containing sub-articles of the news and the news category. We maintain consistent labeling across all 3 datasets for in-depth length-based analysis. We evaluate each of these Indic language datasets using 4 different models including monolingual BERT, multilingual Indic Sentence BERT (IndicSBERT), and IndicBERT. This research contributes significantly to expanding the pool of available text classification datasets and also makes it possible to develop topic classification models for Indian regional languages. This also serves as an excellent resource for cross-lingual analysis owing to the high overlap of labels among languages. The datasets and models are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02254v2,2024-01
CANAMRF: An Attention-Based Model for Multimodal Depression Detection,"Yuntao Wei, Yuzhe Zhang, Shuyang Zhang, Hong Zhang","Multimodal depression detection is an important research topic that aims to predict human mental states using multimodal data. Previous methods treat different modalities equally and fuse each modality by na\""ive mathematical operations without measuring the relative importance between them, which cannot obtain well-performed multimodal representations for downstream depression tasks. In order to tackle the aforementioned concern, we present a Cross-modal Attention Network with Adaptive Multi-modal Recurrent Fusion (CANAMRF) for multimodal depression detection.

Joint Multi-Facts Reasoning Network For Complex Temporal Question Answering Over Knowledge Graph,"Rikui Huang, Wei Wei, Xiaoye Qu, Wenfeng Xie, Xianling Mao, Dangyang Chen","Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an extension of regular knowledge graph by attaching the time scope. Existing temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) models solely approach simple questions, owing to the prior assumption that each question only contains a single temporal fact with explicit/implicit temporal constraints. Hence, they perform poorly on questions which own multiple temporal facts. In this paper, we propose \textbf{\underline{J}}oint \textbf{\underline{M}}ulti \textbf{\underline{F}}acts \textbf{\underline{R}}easoning \textbf{\underline{N}}etwork (JMFRN), to jointly reasoning multiple temporal facts for accurately answering \emph{complex} temporal questions. Specifically, JMFRN first retrieves question-related temporal facts from TKG for each entity of the given complex question. For joint reasoning, we design two different attention (\ie entity-aware and time-aware) modules, which are suitable for universal settings, to aggregate entities and timestamps information of retrieved facts. Moreover, to filter incorrect type answers, we introduce an additional answer type discrimination task. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-art on the well-known complex temporal question benchmark TimeQuestions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02212v1,2024-01
DIALIGHT: Lightweight Multilingual Development and Evaluation of Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems with Large Language Models,"Songbo Hu, Xiaobin Wang, Zhangdie Yuan, Anna Korhonen, Ivan Vulić","We present DIALIGHT, a toolkit for developing and evaluating multilingual Task-Oriented Dialogue (ToD) systems which facilitates systematic evaluations and comparisons between ToD systems using fine-tuning of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and those utilising the zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition to automatic evaluation, this toolkit features (i) a secure, user-friendly web interface for fine-grained human evaluation at both local utterance level and global dialogue level, and (ii) a microservice-based backend, improving efficiency and scalability. Our evaluations reveal that while PLM fine-tuning leads to higher accuracy and coherence, LLM-based systems excel in producing diverse and likeable responses. However, we also identify significant challenges of LLMs in adherence to task-specific instructions and generating outputs in multiple languages, highlighting areas for future research. We hope this open-sourced toolkit will serve as a valuable resource for researchers aiming to develop and properly evaluate multilingual ToD systems and will lower, currently still high, entry barriers in the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02208v1,2024-01
Location Aware Modular Biencoder for Tourism Question Answering,"Haonan Li, Martin Tomko, Timothy Baldwin","Answering real-world tourism questions that seek Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendations is challenging, as it requires both spatial and non-spatial reasoning, over a large candidate pool. The traditional method of encoding each pair of question and POI becomes inefficient when the number of candidates increases, making it infeasible for real-world applications. To overcome this, we propose treating the QA task as a dense vector retrieval problem, where we encode questions and POIs separately and retrieve the most relevant POIs for a question by utilizing embedding space similarity. We use pretrained language models (PLMs) to encode textual information, and train a location encoder to capture spatial information of POIs. Experiments on a real-world tourism QA dataset demonstrate that our approach is effective, efficient, and outperforms previous methods across all metrics. Enabled by the dense retrieval architecture, we further build a global evaluation baseline, expanding the search space by 20 times compared to previous work. We also explore several factors that impact on the model's performance through follow-up experiments. Our code and model are publicly available at https://github.com/haonan-li/LAMB.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02187v1,2024-01

Exploring Boundary of GPT-4V on Marine Analysis: A Preliminary Case Study,"Ziqiang Zheng, Yiwei Chen, Jipeng Zhang, Tuan-Anh Vu, Huimin Zeng, Yue Him Wong Tim, Sai-Kit Yeung","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a powerful ability to answer various queries as a general-purpose assistant. The continuous multi-modal large language models (MLLM) empower LLMs with the ability to perceive visual signals. The launch of GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) has generated significant interest in the research communities. GPT-4V(ison) has demonstrated significant power in both academia and industry fields, as a focal point in a new artificial intelligence generation. Though significant success was achieved by GPT-4V, exploring MLLMs in domain-specific analysis (e.g., marine analysis) that required domain-specific knowledge and expertise has gained less attention. In this study, we carry out the preliminary and comprehensive case study of utilizing GPT-4V for marine analysis. This report conducts a systematic evaluation of existing GPT-4V, assessing the performance of GPT-4V on marine research and also setting a new standard for future developments in MLLMs. The experimental results of GPT-4V show that the responses generated by GPT-4V are still far away from satisfying the domain-specific requirements of the marine professions.

DCR-Consistency: Divide-Conquer-Reasoning for Consistency Evaluation and Improvement of Large Language Models,"Wendi Cui, Jiaxin Zhang, Zhuohang Li, Lopez Damien, Kamalika Das, Bradley Malin, Sricharan Kumar","Evaluating the quality and variability of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant, yet unresolved research challenge. Traditional evaluation methods, such as ROUGE and BERTScore, which measure token similarity, often fail to capture the holistic semantic equivalence. This results in a low correlation with human judgments and intuition, which is especially problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance where reliability, safety, and robust decision-making are highly critical. This work proposes DCR, an automated framework for evaluating and improving the consistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach. Unlike existing LLM-based evaluators that operate at the paragraph level, our method employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator (DCE) that breaks down the paragraph-to-paragraph comparison between two generated responses into individual sentence-to-paragraph comparisons, each evaluated based on predefined criteria. To facilitate this approach, we introduce an automatic metric converter (AMC) that translates the output from DCE into an interpretable numeric score. Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further present a reason-assisted improver (RAI) that leverages the analytical reasons with explanations identified by DCE to generate new responses aimed at reducing these inconsistencies. Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +19.3% and +24.3% on the SummEval dataset) in evaluating the consistency of LLM generation across multiple benchmarks in semantic, factual, and summarization consistency tasks. Our approach also substantially reduces nearly 90% of output inconsistencies, showing promise for effective hallucination mitigation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02132v1,2024-01
"PEFT for Speech: Unveiling Optimal Placement, Merging Strategies, and Ensemble Techniques","Tzu-Han Lin, How-Shing Wang, Hao-Yung Weng, Kuang-Chen Peng, Zih-Ching Chen, Hung-yi Lee","Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is increasingly recognized as an effective method in speech processing. However, the optimal approach and the placement of PEFT methods remain inconclusive. Our study conducts extensive experiments to compare different PEFT methods and their layer-wise placement adapting Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS). We also explore the use of ensemble learning to leverage diverse PEFT strategies. The results reveal that DARTS does not outperform the baseline approach, which involves inserting the same PEFT method into all layers of a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model. In contrast, an ensemble learning approach, particularly one employing majority voting, demonstrates superior performance. Our statistical evidence indicates that different PEFT methods learn in varied ways. This variation might explain why the synergistic integration of various PEFT methods through ensemble learning can harness their unique learning capabilities more effectively compared to individual layer-wise optimization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02122v2,2024-01
Using LLM to select the right SQL Query from candidates,"Zhenwen Li, Tao Xie","Text-to-SQL models can generate a list of candidate SQL queries, and the best query is often in the candidate list, but not at the top of the list. An effective re-rank method can select the right SQL query from the candidate list and improve the model's performance. Previous studies on code generation automatically generate test cases and use them to re-rank candidate codes. However, automatic test case generation for text-to-SQL is an understudied field. We propose an automatic test case generation method that first generates a database and then uses LLMs to predict the ground truth, which is the expected execution results of the ground truth SQL query on this database. To reduce the difficulty for LLMs to predict, we conduct experiments to search for ways to generate easy databases for LLMs and design easy-to-understand prompts. Based on our test case generation method, we propose a re-rank method to select the right SQL query from the candidate list. Given a candidate list, our method can generate test cases and re-rank the candidate list according to their pass numbers on these test cases and their generation probabilities. The experiment results on the validation dataset of Spider show that the performance of some state-of-the-art models can get a 3.6\% improvement after applying our re-rank method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02115v1,2024-01
"Blending Is All You Need: Cheaper, Better Alternative to Trillion-Parameters LLM","Xiaoding Lu, Zongyi Liu, Adian Liusie, Vyas Raina, Vineet Mudupalli, Yuwen Zhang, William Beauchamp","In conversational AI research, there's a noticeable trend towards developing models with a larger number of parameters, exemplified by models like ChatGPT. While these expansive models tend to generate increasingly better chat responses, they demand significant computational resources and memory. This study explores a pertinent question: Can a combination of smaller models collaboratively achieve comparable or enhanced performance relative to a singular large model? We introduce an approach termed ""blending"", a straightforward yet effective method of integrating multiple chat AIs. Our empirical evidence suggests that when specific smaller models are synergistically blended, they can potentially outperform or match the capabilities of much larger counterparts. For instance, integrating just three models of moderate size (6B/13B paramaeters) can rival or even surpass the performance metrics of a substantially larger model like ChatGPT (175B+ paramaters). This hypothesis is rigorously tested using A/B testing methodologies with a large user base on the Chai research platform over a span of thirty days. The findings underscore the potential of the ""blending"" strategy as a viable approach for enhancing chat AI efficacy without a corresponding surge in computational demands.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02994v3,2024-01
ReFusion: Improving Natural Language Understanding with Computation-Efficient Retrieval Representation Fusion,"Shangyu Wu, Ying Xiong, Yufei Cui, Xue Liu, Buzhou Tang, Tei-Wei Kuo, Chun Jason Xue","Retrieval-based augmentations (RA) incorporating knowledge from an external database into language models have greatly succeeded in various knowledge-intensive (KI) tasks. However, integrating retrievals in non-knowledge-intensive (NKI) tasks is still challenging. Existing works focus on concatenating retrievals with inputs to improve model performance. Unfortunately, the use of retrieval concatenation-based augmentations causes an increase in the input length, substantially raising the computational demands of attention mechanisms. This paper proposes a new paradigm of RA named \textbf{ReFusion}, a computation-efficient Retrieval representation Fusion with bi-level optimization. Unlike previous works, ReFusion directly fuses the retrieval representations into the hidden states of models. Specifically, ReFusion leverages an adaptive retrieval integrator to seek the optimal combination of the proposed ranking schemes across different model layers. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ReFusion can achieve superior and robust performance in various NKI tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02993v2,2024-01

Text2MDT: Extracting Medical Decision Trees from Medical Texts,"Wei Zhu, Wenfeng Li, Xing Tian, Pengfei Wang, Xiaoling Wang, Jin Chen, Yuanbin Wu, Yuan Ni, Guotong Xie","Knowledge of the medical decision process, which can be modeled as medical decision trees (MDTs), is critical to build clinical decision support systems. However, the current MDT construction methods rely heavily on time-consuming and laborious manual annotation. In this work, we propose a novel task, Text2MDT, to explore the automatic extraction of MDTs from medical texts such as medical guidelines and textbooks. We normalize the form of the MDT and create an annotated Text-to-MDT dataset in Chinese with the participation of medical experts. We investigate two different methods for the Text2MDT tasks: (a) an end-to-end framework which only relies on a GPT style large language models (LLM) instruction tuning to generate all the node information and tree structures. (b) The pipeline framework which decomposes the Text2MDT task to three subtasks. Experiments on our Text2MDT dataset demonstrate that: (a) the end-to-end method basd on LLMs (7B parameters or larger) show promising results, and successfully outperform the pipeline methods.

Self-Contrast: Better Reflection Through Inconsistent Solving Perspectives,"Wenqi Zhang, Yongliang Shen, Linjuan Wu, Qiuying Peng, Jun Wang, Yueting Zhuang, Weiming Lu","The reflection capacity of Large Language Model (LLM) has garnered extensive attention. A post-hoc prompting strategy, e.g., reflexion and self-refine, refines LLM's response based on self-evaluated or external feedback. However, recent research indicates without external feedback, LLM's intrinsic reflection is unstable. Our investigation unveils that the key bottleneck is the quality of the self-evaluated feedback. We find LLMs often exhibit overconfidence or high randomness when self-evaluate, offering stubborn or inconsistent feedback, which causes poor reflection. To remedy this, we advocate Self-Contrast: It adaptively explores diverse solving perspectives tailored to the request, contrasts the differences, and summarizes these discrepancies into a checklist which could be used to re-examine and eliminate discrepancies. Our method endows LLM with diverse perspectives to alleviate stubborn biases. Moreover, their discrepancies indicate potential errors or inherent uncertainties that LLM often overlooks. Reflecting upon these can catalyze more accurate and stable reflection. Experiments conducted on a series of reasoning and translation tasks with different LLMs serve to underscore the effectiveness and generality of our strategy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02009v3,2024-01

Position bias captures the tendency of a model unfairly prioritizing information from certain parts of the input text over others, leading to undesirable behavior. Through numerous experiments on four diverse real-world datasets, we study position bias in multiple LLM models such as GPT 3.5-Turbo, Llama-2, and Dolly-v2, as well as state-of-the-art pretrained encoder-decoder abstractive summarization models such as Pegasus and BART.

Kummerfeld, Rada Mihalcea","While alignment algorithms are now commonly used to tune pre-trained language models towards a user's preferences, we lack explanations for the underlying mechanisms in which models become ``aligned'', thus making it difficult to explain phenomena like jailbreaks. In this work we study a popular algorithm, direct preference optimization (DPO), and the mechanisms by which it reduces toxicity. Namely, we first study how toxicity is represented and elicited in a pre-trained language model, GPT2-medium. We then apply DPO with a carefully crafted pairwise dataset to reduce toxicity. We examine how the resulting model averts toxic outputs, and find that capabilities learned from pre-training are not removed, but rather bypassed. We use this insight to demonstrate a simple method to un-align the model, reverting it back to its toxic behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01967v1,2024-01

We then build instruct-imagen by fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with a two-stage framework. First, we adapt the model using the retrieval-augmented training, to enhance model's capabilities to ground its generation on external multimodal context. Subsequently, we fine-tune the adapted model on diverse image generation tasks that requires vision-language understanding (e.g., subject-driven generation, etc.), each paired with a multi-modal instruction encapsulating the task's essence. Human evaluation on various image generation datasets reveals that instruct-imagen matches or surpasses prior task-specific models in-domain and demonstrates promising generalization to unseen and more complex tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01952v1,2024-01
Generalist embedding models are better at short-context clinical semantic search than specialized embedding models,"Jean-Baptiste Excoffier, Tom Roehr, Alexei Figueroa, Jens-Michalis Papaioannou, Keno Bressem, Matthieu Ortala","The increasing use of tools and solutions based on Large Language Models (LLMs) for various tasks in the medical domain has become a prominent trend. Their use in this highly critical and sensitive domain has thus raised important questions about their robustness, especially in response to variations in input, and the reliability of the generated outputs. This study addresses these questions by constructing a textual dataset based on the ICD-10-CM code descriptions, widely used in US hospitals and containing many clinical terms, and their easily reproducible rephrasing. We then benchmarked existing embedding models, either generalist or specialized in the clinical domain, in a semantic search task where the goal was to correctly match the rephrased text to the original description. Our results showed that generalist models performed better than clinical models, suggesting that existing clinical specialized models are more sensitive to small changes in input that confuse them. The highlighted problem of specialized models may be due to the fact that they have not been trained on sufficient data, and in particular on datasets that are not diverse enough to have a reliable global language understanding, which is still necessary for accurate handling of medical documents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01943v2,2024-01

A commonly used analytical expression in the literature claims that the KL divergence between the best-of-$n$ policy and the base policy is equal to $\log (n) - (n-1)/n.$ We disprove the validity of this claim, and show that it is an upper bound on the actual KL divergence. We also explore the tightness of this upper bound in different regimes.

Although LLM-generated images do not look like natural images, results on image generation and the ability of models to correct these generated images indicate that precise modeling of strings can teach language models about numerous aspects of the visual world. Furthermore, experiments on self-supervised visual representation learning, utilizing images generated with text models, highlight the potential to train vision models capable of making semantic assessments of natural images using just LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01862v1,2024-01

In this work, we investigate how multilinguality during instruction tuning of a multilingual LLM affects instruction-following across languages from the pre-training corpus. We first show that many languages transfer some instruction-following capabilities to other languages from even monolingual tuning. Furthermore, we find that only 40 multilingual examples integrated in an English tuning set substantially improve multilingual instruction-following, both in seen and unseen languages during tuning. In general, we observe that models tuned on multilingual mixtures exhibit comparable or superior performance in multiple languages compared to monolingually tuned models, despite training on 10x fewer examples in those languages. Finally, we find that diversifying the instruction tuning set with even just 2-4 languages significantly improves cross-lingual generalization. Our results suggest that building massively multilingual instruction-tuned models can be done with only a very small set of multilingual instruction-responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01854v4,2024-01
GLIDE-RL: Grounded Language Instruction through DEmonstration in RL,"Chaitanya Kharyal, Sai Krishna Gottipati, Tanmay Kumar Sinha, Srijita Das, Matthew E. Taylor","One of the final frontiers in the development of complex human - AI collaborative systems is the ability of AI agents to comprehend the natural language and perform tasks accordingly. However, training efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents grounded in natural language has been a long-standing challenge due to the complexity and ambiguity of the language and sparsity of the rewards, among other factors. Several advances in reinforcement learning, curriculum learning, continual learning, language models have independently contributed to effective training of grounded agents in various environments. Leveraging these developments, we present a novel algorithm, Grounded Language Instruction through DEmonstration in RL (GLIDE-RL) that introduces a teacher-instructor-student curriculum learning framework for training an RL agent capable of following natural language instructions that can generalize to previously unseen language instructions. In this multi-agent framework, the teacher and the student agents learn simultaneously based on the student's current skill level. We further demonstrate the necessity for training the student agent with not just one, but multiple teacher agents. Experiments on a complex sparse reward environment validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02991v1,2024-01
Investigating Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithms in Text Datasets,"Himmet Toprak Kesgin, Mehmet Fatih Amasyali","Using large training datasets enhances the generalization capabilities of neural networks. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is useful when there are few labeled data and a lot of unlabeled data. SSL methods that use data augmentation are most successful for image datasets. In contrast, texts do not have consistent augmentation methods as images. Consequently, methods that use augmentation are not as effective in text data as they are in image data. In this study, we compared SSL algorithms that do not require augmentation; these are self-training, co-training, tri-training, and tri-training with disagreement. In the experiments, we used 4 different text datasets for different tasks. We examined the algorithms from a variety of perspectives by asking experiment questions and suggested several improvements. Among the algorithms, tri-training with disagreement showed the closest performance to the Oracle; however, performance gap shows that new semi-supervised algorithms or improvements in existing methods are needed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01843v2,2024-01
Iterative Mask Filling: An Effective Text Augmentation Method Using Masked Language Modeling,"Himmet Toprak Kesgin, Mehmet Fatih Amasyali","Data augmentation is an effective technique for improving the performance of machine learning models. However, it has not been explored as extensively in natural language processing (NLP) as it has in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a novel text augmentation method that leverages the Fill-Mask feature of the transformer-based BERT model. Our method involves iteratively masking words in a sentence and replacing them with language model predictions. We have tested our proposed method on various NLP tasks and found it to be effective in many cases. Our results are presented along with a comparison to existing augmentation methods. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly improves performance, especially on topic classification datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01830v1,2024-01
Physio: An LLM-Based Physiotherapy Advisor,"Rúben Almeida, Hugo Sousa, Luís F. Cunha, Nuno Guimarães, Ricardo Campos, Alípio Jorge","The capabilities of the most recent language models have increased the interest in integrating them into real-world applications. However, the fact that these models generate plausible, yet incorrect text poses a constraint when considering their use in several domains. Healthcare is a prime example of a domain where text-generative trustworthiness is a hard requirement to safeguard patient well-being. In this paper, we present Physio, a chat-based application for physical rehabilitation. Physio is capable of making an initial diagnosis while citing reliable health sources to support the information provided. Furthermore, drawing upon external knowledge databases, Physio can recommend rehabilitation exercises and over-the-counter medication for symptom relief. By combining these features, Physio can leverage the power of generative models for language processing while also conditioning its response on dependable and verifiable sources.

Navigating Uncertainty: Optimizing API Dependency for Hallucination Reduction in Closed-Book Question Answering,"Pierre Erbacher, Louis Falissar, Vincent Guigue, Laure Soulier","While Large Language Models (LLM) are able to accumulate and restore knowledge, they are still prone to hallucination. Especially when faced with factual questions, LLM cannot only rely on knowledge stored in parameters to guarantee truthful and correct answers. Augmenting these models with the ability to search on external information sources, such as the web, is a promising approach to ground knowledge to retrieve information. However, searching in a large collection of documents introduces additional computational/time costs. An optimal behavior would be to query external resources only when the LLM is not confident about answers. In this paper, we propose a new LLM able to self-estimate if it is able to answer directly or needs to request an external tool. We investigate a supervised approach by introducing a hallucination masking mechanism in which labels are generated using a close book question-answering task. In addition, we propose to leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques to train our model on a small amount of data. Our model directly provides answers for $78.2\%$ of the known queries and opts to search for $77.2\%$ of the unknown ones. This results in the API being utilized only $62\%$ of the time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01780v1,2024-01
Cross-target Stance Detection by Exploiting Target Analytical Perspectives,"Daijun Ding, Rong Chen, Liwen Jing, Bowen Zhang, Xu Huang, Li Dong, Xiaowen Zhao, Ge Song","Cross-target stance detection (CTSD) is an important task, which infers the attitude of the destination target by utilizing annotated data derived from the source target. One important approach in CTSD is to extract domain-invariant features to bridge the knowledge gap between multiple targets. However, the analysis of informal and short text structure, and implicit expressions, complicate the extraction of domain-invariant knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Perspective Prompt-Tuning (MPPT) model for CTSD that uses the analysis perspective as a bridge to transfer knowledge. First, we develop a two-stage instruct-based chain-of-thought method (TsCoT) to elicit target analysis perspectives and provide natural language explanations (NLEs) from multiple viewpoints by formulating instructions based on large language model (LLM). Second, we propose a multi-perspective prompt-tuning framework (MultiPLN) to fuse the NLEs into the stance predictor. Extensive experiments results demonstrate the superiority of MPPT against the state-of-the-art baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01761v2,2024-01
VGA: Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network for Rumor Detection,"Lin Bai, Caiyan Jia, Ziying Song, Chaoqun Cui","With the development of social media, rumors have been spread broadly on social media platforms, causing great harm to society. Beside textual information, many rumors also use manipulated images or conceal textual information within images to deceive people and avoid being detected, making multimodal rumor detection be a critical problem. The majority of multimodal rumor detection methods mainly concentrate on extracting features of source claims and their corresponding images, while ignoring the comments of rumors and their propagation structures. These comments and structures imply the wisdom of crowds and are proved to be crucial to debunk rumors. Moreover, these methods usually only extract visual features in a basic manner, seldom consider tampering or textual information in images. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) for rumor detection to utilize propagation structures among posts so as to obtain the crowd opinions and further explore visual tampering features, as well as the textual information hidden in images. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, demonstrating that VGA can effectively detect multimodal rumors and outperform state-of-the-art methods significantly.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01759v1,2024-01
Evaluating Large Language Models in Semantic Parsing for Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs,"Phillip Schneider, Manuel Klettner, Kristiina Jokinen, Elena Simperl, Florian Matthes","Conversational question answering systems often rely on semantic parsing to enable interactive information retrieval, which involves the generation of structured database queries from a natural language input. For information-seeking conversations about facts stored within a knowledge graph, dialogue utterances are transformed into graph queries in a process that is called knowledge-based conversational question answering. This paper evaluates the performance of large language models that have not been explicitly pre-trained on this task. Through a series of experiments on an extensive benchmark dataset, we compare models of varying sizes with different prompting techniques and identify common issue types in the generated output. Our results demonstrate that large language models are capable of generating graph queries from dialogues, with significant improvements achievable through few-shot prompting and fine-tuning techniques, especially for smaller models that exhibit lower zero-shot performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01711v1,2024-01

We address the challenge of simplifying artistic typography for non-professionals by offering a dynamic, adaptive, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional rigid templates. Our approach leverages the power of LLMs to understand and interpret user input, facilitating a more intuitive design process. We demonstrate through various case studies how users can articulate their aesthetic preferences and functional requirements, which the system then translates into unique and creative typographic designs. Our evaluations indicate significant improvements in user satisfaction, design flexibility, and creative expression over existing systems. The WordArt Designer API not only democratizes the art of typography but also opens up new possibilities for personalized digital communication and design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01699v2,2024-01
Patterns of Persistence and Diffusibility across the World's Languages,"Yiyi Chen, Johannes Bjerva","Language similarities can be caused by genetic relatedness, areal contact, universality, or chance. Colexification, i.e. a type of similarity where a single lexical form is used to convey multiple meanings, is underexplored. In our work, we shed light on the linguistic causes of cross-lingual similarity in colexification and phonology, by exploring genealogical stability (persistence) and contact-induced change (diffusibility). We construct large-scale graphs incorporating semantic, genealogical, phonological and geographical data for 1,966 languages. We then show the potential of this resource, by investigating several established hypotheses from previous work in linguistics, while proposing new ones. Our results strongly support a previously established hypothesis in the linguistic literature, while offering contradicting evidence to another. Our large scale resource opens for further research across disciplines, e.g.~in multilingual NLP and comparative linguistics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01698v2,2024-01
Predicting challenge moments from students' discourse: A comparison of GPT-4 to two traditional natural language processing approaches,"Wannapon Suraworachet, Jennifer Seon, Mutlu Cukurova","Effective collaboration requires groups to strategically regulate themselves to overcome challenges. Research has shown that groups may fail to regulate due to differences in members' perceptions of challenges which may benefit from external support. In this study, we investigated the potential of leveraging three distinct natural language processing models: an expert knowledge rule-based model, a supervised machine learning (ML) model and a Large Language model (LLM), in challenge detection and challenge dimension identification (cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and technical/other challenges) from student discourse, was investigated. The results show that the supervised ML and the LLM approaches performed considerably well in both tasks, in contrast to the rule-based approach, whose efficacy heavily relies on the engineered features by experts. The paper provides an extensive discussion of the three approaches' performance for automated detection and support of students' challenge moments in collaborative learning activities. It argues that, although LLMs provide many advantages, they are unlikely to be the panacea to issues of the detection and feedback provision of socially shared regulation of learning due to their lack of reliability, as well as issues of validity evaluation, privacy and confabulation. We conclude the paper with a discussion on additional considerations, including model transparency to explore feasible and meaningful analytical feedback for students and educators using LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01692v1,2024-01
MLPs Compass: What is learned when MLPs are combined with PLMs?,"Li Zhou, Wenyu Chen, Yong Cao, Dingyi Zeng, Wanlong Liu, Hong Qu","While Transformer-based pre-trained language models and their variants exhibit strong semantic representation capabilities, the question of comprehending the information gain derived from the additional components of PLMs remains an open question in this field. Motivated by recent efforts that prove Multilayer-Perceptrons (MLPs) modules achieving robust structural capture capabilities, even outperforming Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), this paper aims to quantify whether simple MLPs can further enhance the already potent ability of PLMs to capture linguistic information. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective probing framework containing MLPs components based on BERT structure and conduct extensive experiments encompassing 10 probing tasks spanning three distinct linguistic levels. The experimental results demonstrate that MLPs can indeed enhance the comprehension of linguistic structure by PLMs. Our research provides interpretable and valuable insights into crafting variations of PLMs utilizing MLPs for tasks that emphasize diverse linguistic structures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01667v1,2024-01
Social Media Ready Caption Generation for Brands,"Himanshu Maheshwari, Koustava Goswami, Apoorv Saxena, Balaji Vasan Srinivasan","Social media advertisements are key for brand marketing, aiming to attract consumers with captivating captions and pictures or logos. While previous research has focused on generating captions for general images, incorporating brand personalities into social media captioning remains unexplored. Brand personalities are shown to be affecting consumers' behaviours and social interactions and thus are proven to be a key aspect of marketing strategies. Current open-source multimodal LLMs are not directly suited for this task. Hence, we propose a pipeline solution to assist brands in creating engaging social media captions that align with the image and the brand personalities. Our architecture is based on two parts: a the first part contains an image captioning model that takes in an image that the brand wants to post online and gives a plain English caption; b the second part takes in the generated caption along with the target brand personality and outputs a catchy personality-aligned social media caption. Along with brand personality, our system also gives users the flexibility to provide hashtags, Instagram handles, URLs, and named entities they want the caption to contain, making the captions more semantically related to the social media handles. Comparative evaluations against various baselines demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both qualitatively and quantitatively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01637v1,2024-01
A Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Semantic Text Analytics Approach to Explore Topical Features in Charity Crowdfunding Campaigns,"Prathamesh Muzumdar, George Kurian, Ganga Prasad Basyal","Crowdfunding in the realm of the Social Web has received substantial attention, with prior research examining various aspects of campaigns, including project objectives, durations, and influential project categories for successful fundraising. These factors are crucial for entrepreneurs seeking donor support. However, the terrain of charity crowdfunding within the Social Web remains relatively unexplored, lacking comprehension of the motivations driving donations that often lack concrete reciprocation. Distinct from conventional crowdfunding that offers tangible returns, charity crowdfunding relies on intangible rewards like tax advantages, recognition posts, or advisory roles. Such details are often embedded within campaign narratives, yet, the analysis of textual content in charity crowdfunding is limited. This study introduces an inventive text analytics framework, utilizing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract latent themes from textual descriptions of charity campaigns. The study has explored four different themes, two each in campaign and incentive descriptions. Campaign description themes are focused on child and elderly health mainly the ones who are diagnosed with terminal diseases. Incentive description themes are based on tax benefits, certificates, and appreciation posts. These themes, combined with numerical parameters, predict campaign success. The study was successful in using Random Forest Classifier to predict success of the campaign using both thematic and numerical parameters. The study distinguishes thematic categories, particularly medical need-based charity and general causes, based on project and incentive descriptions. In conclusion, this research bridges the gap by showcasing topic modelling utility in uncharted charity crowdfunding domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02988v1,2024-01
Can AI Be as Creative as Humans?,"Haonan Wang, James Zou, Michael Mozer, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Linjun Zhang, Weijie J Su, Zhun Deng, Michael Qizhe Xie, Hannah Brown, Kenji Kawaguchi","Creativity serves as a cornerstone for societal progress and innovation. With the rise of advanced generative AI models capable of tasks once reserved for human creativity, the study of AI's creative potential becomes imperative for its responsible development and application. In this paper, we prove in theory that AI can be as creative as humans under the condition that it can properly fit the data generated by human creators. Therefore, the debate on AI's creativity is reduced into the question of its ability to fit a sufficient amount of data. To arrive at this conclusion, this paper first addresses the complexities in defining creativity by introducing a new concept called Relative Creativity. Rather than attempting to define creativity universally, we shift the focus to whether AI can match the creative abilities of a hypothetical human. The methodological shift leads to a statistically quantifiable assessment of AI's creativity, term Statistical Creativity. This concept, statistically comparing the creative abilities of AI with those of specific human groups, facilitates theoretical exploration of AI's creative potential. Our analysis reveals that by fitting extensive conditional data without marginalizing out the generative conditions, AI can emerge as a hypothetical new creator. The creator possesses the same creative abilities on par with the human creators it was trained on. Building on theoretical findings, we discuss the application in prompt-conditioned autoregressive models, providing a practical means for evaluating creative abilities of generative AI models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, this study provides an actionable training guideline, bridging the theoretical quantification of creativity with practical model training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01623v4,2024-01
Large Language Model Capabilities in Perioperative Risk Prediction and Prognostication,"Philip Chung, Christine T Fong, Andrew M Walters, Nima Aghaeepour, Meliha Yetisgen, Vikas N O'Reilly-Shah","We investigate whether general-domain large language models such as GPT-4 Turbo can perform risk stratification and predict post-operative outcome measures using a description of the procedure and a patient's clinical notes derived from the electronic health record. We examine predictive performance on 8 different tasks: prediction of ASA Physical Status Classification, hospital admission, ICU admission, unplanned admission, hospital mortality, PACU Phase 1 duration, hospital duration, and ICU duration. Few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting improves predictive performance for several of the tasks. We achieve F1 scores of 0.50 for ASA Physical Status Classification, 0.81 for ICU admission, and 0.86 for hospital mortality. Performance on duration prediction tasks were universally poor across all prompt strategies. Current generation large language models can assist clinicians in perioperative risk stratification on classification tasks and produce high-quality natural language summaries and explanations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01620v1,2024-01
"GPT-4V(ision) is a Generalist Web Agent, if Grounded","Boyuan Zheng, Boyu Gou, Jihyung Kil, Huan Sun, Yu Su","The recent development on large multimodal models (LMMs), especially GPT-4V(ision) and Gemini, has been quickly expanding the capability boundaries of multimodal models beyond traditional tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. In this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V as a generalist web agent that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks on any given website. We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent that harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated visual understanding and acting on the web. We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark. In addition to standard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online evaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live websites. We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agents -- it can successfully complete 51.1 of the tasks on live websites if we manually ground its textual plans into actions on the websites. This substantially outperforms text-only LLMs like GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2) specifically fine-tuned for web agents. However, grounding still remains a major challenge. Existing LMM grounding strategies like set-of-mark prompting turns out to be not effective for web agents, and the best grounding strategy we develop in this paper leverages both the HTML structure and visuals. Yet, there is still a substantial gap with oracle grounding, leaving ample room for further improvement.

PLLaMa: An Open-source Large Language Model for Plant Science,"Xianjun Yang, Junfeng Gao, Wenxin Xue, Erik Alexandersson","Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities in understanding and interacting with natural language across various sectors. However, their effectiveness is limited in specialized areas requiring high accuracy, such as plant science, due to a lack of specific expertise in these fields. This paper introduces PLLaMa, an open-source language model that evolved from LLaMa-2. It's enhanced with a comprehensive database, comprising more than 1.5 million scholarly articles in plant science. This development significantly enriches PLLaMa with extensive knowledge and proficiency in plant and agricultural sciences. Our initial tests, involving specific datasets related to plants and agriculture, show that PLLaMa substantially improves its understanding of plant science-related topics. Moreover, we have formed an international panel of professionals, including plant scientists, agricultural engineers, and plant breeders. This team plays a crucial role in verifying the accuracy of PLLaMa's responses to various academic inquiries, ensuring its effective and reliable application in the field.

MedSumm: A Multimodal Approach to Summarizing Code-Mixed Hindi-English Clinical Queries,"Akash Ghosh, Arkadeep Acharya, Prince Jha, Aniket Gaudgaul, Rajdeep Majumdar, Sriparna Saha, Aman Chadha, Raghav Jain, Setu Sinha, Shivani Agarwal","In the healthcare domain, summarizing medical questions posed by patients is critical for improving doctor-patient interactions and medical decision-making. Although medical data has grown in complexity and quantity, the current body of research in this domain has primarily concentrated on text-based methods, overlooking the integration of visual cues. Also prior works in the area of medical question summarisation have been limited to the English language. This work introduces the task of multimodal medical question summarization for codemixed input in a low-resource setting. To address this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Medical Codemixed Question Summarization MMCQS dataset, which combines Hindi-English codemixed medical queries with visual aids. This integration enriches the representation of a patient's medical condition, providing a more comprehensive perspective. We also propose a framework named MedSumm that leverages the power of LLMs and VLMs for this task. By utilizing our MMCQS dataset, we demonstrate the value of integrating visual information from images to improve the creation of medically detailed summaries. This multimodal strategy not only improves healthcare decision-making but also promotes a deeper comprehension of patient queries, paving the way for future exploration in personalized and responsive medical care.

Hallucinations in Neural Automatic Speech Recognition: Identifying Errors and Hallucinatory Models,"Rita Frieske, Bertram E. Shi","Hallucinations are a type of output error produced by deep neural networks. While this has been studied in natural language processing, they have not been researched previously in automatic speech recognition. Here, we define hallucinations in ASR as transcriptions generated by a model that are semantically unrelated to the source utterance, yet still fluent and coherent. The similarity of hallucinations to probable natural language outputs of the model creates a danger of deception and impacts the credibility of the system. We show that commonly used metrics, such as word error rates, cannot differentiate between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models. To address this, we propose a perturbation-based method for assessing the susceptibility of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to hallucination at test time, which does not require access to the training dataset. We demonstrate that this method helps to distinguish between hallucinatory and non-hallucinatory models that have similar baseline word error rates. We further explore the relationship between the types of ASR errors and the types of dataset noise to determine what types of noise are most likely to create hallucinatory outputs. We devise a framework for identifying hallucinations by analysing their semantic connection with the ground truth and their fluency. Finally, we discover how to induce hallucinations with a random noise injection to the utterance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01572v1,2024-01

By employing a compact 7B-parameter LLaMA-2 model and focusing exclusively on a curated set of astronomy corpora -- comprising abstracts, introductions, and conclusions -- we achieve notable improvements in specialized topic comprehension. While general LLMs like GPT-4 excel in broader question-answering scenarios due to superior reasoning capabilities, our findings suggest that continual pre-training with limited resources can still enhance model performance on specialized topics. Additionally, we present an extension of AstroLLaMA: the fine-tuning of the 7B LLaMA model on a domain-specific conversational dataset, culminating in the release of the chat-enabled AstroLLaMA for community use.

GOAT-Bench: Safety Insights to Large Multimodal Models through Meme-Based Social Abuse,"Hongzhan Lin, Ziyang Luo, Bo Wang, Ruichao Yang, Jing Ma","The exponential growth of social media has profoundly transformed how information is created, disseminated, and absorbed, exceeding any precedent in the digital age. Regrettably, this explosion has also spawned a significant increase in the online abuse of memes. Evaluating the negative impact of memes is notably challenging, owing to their often subtle and implicit meanings, which are not directly conveyed through the overt text and imagery. In light of this, large multimodal models (LMMs) have emerged as a focal point of interest due to their remarkable capabilities in handling diverse multimodal tasks. In response to this development, our paper aims to thoroughly examine the capacity of various LMMs (e.g., GPT-4V) to discern and respond to the nuanced aspects of social abuse manifested in memes. We introduce the comprehensive meme benchmark, GOAT-Bench, comprising over 6K varied memes encapsulating themes such as implicit hate speech, sexism, and cyberbullying, etc. Utilizing GOAT-Bench, we delve into the ability of LMMs to accurately assess hatefulness, misogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, and harmful content. Our extensive experiments across a range of LMMs reveal that current models still exhibit a deficiency in safety awareness, showing insensitivity to various forms of implicit abuse. We posit that this shortfall represents a critical impediment to the realization of safe artificial intelligence. The GOAT-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://goatlmm.github.io/, contributing to ongoing research in this vital field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01523v3,2024-01
Utilizing Neural Transducers for Two-Stage Text-to-Speech via Semantic Token Prediction,"Minchan Kim, Myeonghun Jeong, Byoung Jin Choi, Semin Kim, Joun Yeop Lee, Nam Soo Kim","We propose a novel text-to-speech (TTS) framework centered around a neural transducer. Our approach divides the whole TTS pipeline into semantic-level sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling and fine-grained acoustic modeling stages, utilizing discrete semantic tokens obtained from wav2vec2.0 embeddings. For a robust and efficient alignment modeling, we employ a neural transducer named token transducer for the semantic token prediction, benefiting from its hard monotonic alignment constraints. Subsequently, a non-autoregressive (NAR) speech generator efficiently synthesizes waveforms from these semantic tokens. Additionally, a reference speech controls temporal dynamics and acoustic conditions at each stage. This decoupled framework reduces the training complexity of TTS while allowing each stage to focus on semantic and acoustic modeling. Our experimental results on zero-shot adaptive TTS demonstrate that our model surpasses the baseline in terms of speech quality and speaker similarity, both objectively and subjectively. We also delve into the inference speed and prosody control capabilities of our approach, highlighting the potential of neural transducers in TTS frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01498v1,2024-01
A Two-Stage Multimodal Emotion Recognition Model Based on Graph Contrastive Learning,"Wei Ai, FuChen Zhang, Tao Meng, YunTao Shou, HongEn Shao, Keqin Li","In terms of human-computer interaction, it is becoming more and more important to correctly understand the user's emotional state in a conversation, so the task of multimodal emotion recognition (MER) started to receive more attention. However, existing emotion classification methods usually perform classification only once. Sentences are likely to be misclassified in a single round of classification. Previous work usually ignores the similarities and differences between different morphological features in the fusion process. To address the above issues, we propose a two-stage emotion recognition model based on graph contrastive learning (TS-GCL). First, we encode the original dataset with different preprocessing modalities. Second, a graph contrastive learning (GCL) strategy is introduced for these three modal data with other structures to learn similarities and differences within and between modalities. Finally, we use MLP twice to achieve the final emotion classification. This staged classification method can help the model to better focus on different levels of emotional information, thereby improving the performance of the model. Extensive experiments show that TS-GCL has superior performance on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets compared with previous methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01495v1,2024-01
Natural Language Processing and Multimodal Stock Price Prediction,"Kevin Taylor, Jerry Ng","In the realm of financial decision-making, predicting stock prices is pivotal. Artificial intelligence techniques such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), support-vector machines (SVMs), and natural language processing (NLP) models are commonly employed to predict said prices. This paper utilizes stock percentage change as training data, in contrast to the traditional use of raw currency values, with a focus on analyzing publicly released news articles. The choice of percentage change aims to provide models with context regarding the significance of price fluctuations and overall price change impact on a given stock. The study employs specialized BERT natural language processing models to predict stock price trends, with a particular emphasis on various data modalities. The results showcase the capabilities of such strategies with a small natural language processing model to accurately predict overall stock trends, and highlight the effectiveness of certain data features and sector-specific data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01487v1,2024-01
Studying and Recommending Information Highlighting in Stack Overflow Answers,"Shahla Shaan Ahmed, Shaowei Wang, Yuan Tian, Tse-Hsun, Chen, Haoxiang Zhang","Context: Navigating the knowledge of Stack Overflow (SO) remains challenging. To make the posts vivid to users, SO allows users to write and edit posts with Markdown or HTML so that users can leverage various formatting styles (e.g., bold, italic, and code) to highlight the important information. Nonetheless, there have been limited studies on the highlighted information. Objective: We carried out the first large-scale exploratory study on the information highlighted in SO answers in our recent study. To extend our previous study, we develop approaches to automatically recommend highlighted content with formatting styles using neural network architectures initially designed for the Named Entity Recognition task. Method: In this paper, we studied 31,169,429 answers of Stack Overflow. For training recommendation models, we choose CNN-based and BERT-based models for each type of formatting (i.e., Bold, Italic, Code, and Heading) using the information highlighting dataset we collected from SO answers. Results: Our models achieve a precision ranging from 0.50 to 0.72 for different formatting types. It is easier to build a model to recommend Code than other types. Models for text formatting types (i.e., Heading, Bold, and Italic) suffer low recall. Our analysis of failure cases indicates that the majority of the failure cases are due to missing identification. One explanation is that the models are easy to learn the frequent highlighted words while struggling to learn less frequent words (i.g., long-tail knowledge). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that it is possible to develop recommendation models for highlighting information for answers with different formatting styles on Stack Overflow.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01472v3,2024-01
Question-Answering Based Summarization of Electronic Health Records using Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Walid Saba, Suzanne Wendelken, James. Shanahan","Summarization of electronic health records (EHRs) can substantially minimize 'screen time' for both patients as well as medical personnel. In recent years summarization of EHRs have employed machine learning pipelines using state of the art neural models. However, these models have produced less than adequate results that are attributed to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient annotated data for training. Moreover, the requirement to consider the entire content of an EHR in summarization has resulted in poor performance due to the fact that attention mechanisms in modern large language models (LLMs) adds a quadratic complexity in terms of the size of the input. We propose here a method that mitigates these shortcomings by combining semantic search, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and question-answering using the latest LLMs. In our approach summarization is the extraction of answers to specific questions that are deemed important by subject-matter experts (SMEs). Our approach is quite efficient; requires minimal to no training; does not suffer from the 'hallucination' problem of LLMs; and it ensures diversity, since the summary will not have repeated content but diverse answers to specific questions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01469v1,2024-01
To Diverge or Not to Diverge: A Morphosyntactic Perspective on Machine Translation vs Human Translation,"Jiaming Luo, Colin Cherry, George Foster","We conduct a large-scale fine-grained comparative analysis of machine translations (MT) against human translations (HT) through the lens of morphosyntactic divergence. Across three language pairs and two types of divergence defined as the structural difference between the source and the target, MT is consistently more conservative than HT, with less morphosyntactic diversity, more convergent patterns, and more one-to-one alignments. Through analysis on different decoding algorithms, we attribute this discrepancy to the use of beam search that biases MT towards more convergent patterns. This bias is most amplified when the convergent pattern appears around 50% of the time in training data. Lastly, we show that for a majority of morphosyntactic divergences, their presence in HT is correlated with decreased MT performance, presenting a greater challenge for MT systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01419v1,2024-01
Quantifying the Uniqueness of Donald Trump in Presidential Discourse,"Karen Zhou, Alexander A. Meitus, Milo Chase, Grace Wang, Anne Mykland, William Howell, Chenhao Tan","Does Donald Trump speak differently from other presidents? If so, in what ways? Are these differences confined to any single medium of communication? To investigate these questions, this paper introduces a novel metric of uniqueness based on large language models, develops a new lexicon for divisive speech, and presents a framework for comparing the lexical features of political opponents. Applying these tools to a variety of corpora of presidential speeches, we find considerable evidence that Trump's speech patterns diverge from those of all major party nominees for the presidency in recent history. Some notable findings include Trump's employment of particularly divisive and antagonistic language targeting of his political opponents and his patterns of repetition for emphasis. Furthermore, Trump is significantly more distinctive than his fellow Republicans, whose uniqueness values are comparably closer to those of the Democrats. These differences hold across a variety of measurement strategies, arise on both the campaign trail and in official presidential addresses, and do not appear to be an artifact of secular time trends.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01405v1,2024-01
Self-Play Fine-Tuning Converts Weak Language Models to Strong Language Models,"Zixiang Chen, Yihe Deng, Huizhuo Yuan, Kaixuan Ji, Quanquan Gu","Harnessing the power of human-annotated data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is pivotal for advancing Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we delve into the prospect of growing a strong LLM out of a weak one without the need for acquiring additional human-annotated data. We propose a new fine-tuning method called Self-Play fIne-tuNing (SPIN), which starts from a supervised fine-tuned model. At the heart of SPIN lies a self-play mechanism, where the LLM refines its capability by playing against instances of itself. More specifically, the LLM generates its own training data from its previous iterations, refining its policy by discerning these self-generated responses from those obtained from human-annotated data. Our method progressively elevates the LLM from a nascent model to a formidable one, unlocking the full potential of human-annotated demonstration data for SFT. Theoretically, we prove that the global optimum to the training objective function of our method is achieved only when the LLM policy aligns with the target data distribution. Empirically, we evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets including the HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard, MT-Bench, and datasets from Big-Bench. Our results show that SPIN can significantly improve the LLM's performance across a variety of benchmarks and even outperform models trained through direct preference optimization (DPO) supplemented with extra GPT-4 preference data. This sheds light on the promise of self-play, enabling the achievement of human-level performance in LLMs without the need for expert opponents.

This means that the same question might yield varied answers, contingent on the user's profile and preferences. The challenge lies in enabling Conversational Search Agents (CSA) to incorporate personalized context to effectively guide users through the relevant information to them. iKAT's first year attracted seven teams and a total of 24 runs. Most of the runs leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) in their pipelines, with a few focusing on a generate-then-retrieve approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01330v2,2024-01
An Autoregressive Text-to-Graph Framework for Joint Entity and Relation Extraction,"Urchade Zaratiana, Nadi Tomeh, Pierre Holat, Thierry Charnois","In this paper, we propose a novel method for joint entity and relation extraction from unstructured text by framing it as a conditional sequence generation problem. In contrast to conventional generative information extraction models that are left-to-right token-level generators, our approach is \textit{span-based}. It generates a linearized graph where nodes represent text spans and edges represent relation triplets. Our method employs a transformer encoder-decoder architecture with pointing mechanism on a dynamic vocabulary of spans and relation types. Our model can capture the structural characteristics and boundaries of entities and relations through span representations while simultaneously grounding the generated output in the original text thanks to the pointing mechanism. Evaluation on benchmark datasets validates the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating competitive results.

LLM Maybe LongLM: Self-Extend LLM Context Window Without Tuning,"Hongye Jin, Xiaotian Han, Jingfeng Yang, Zhimeng Jiang, Zirui Liu, Chia-Yuan Chang, Huiyuan Chen, Xia Hu","It is well known that LLMs cannot generalize well to long contexts whose lengths are larger than the training sequence length. This poses challenges when employing LLMs for processing long input sequences during inference. In this work, we argue that LLMs themselves have inherent capabilities to handle long contexts without fine-tuning. To achieve this goal, we propose SelfExtend to extend the context window of LLMs by constructing bi-level attention information: the grouped attention and the neighbor attention. The grouped attention captures the dependencies among tokens that are far apart, while neighbor attention captures dependencies among adjacent tokens within a specified range. The two-level attentions are computed based on the original model's self-attention mechanism during inference. With minor code modification, our SelfExtend can effortlessly extend existing LLMs' context window without any fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and the results show that our SelfExtend can effectively extend existing LLMs' context window length.

A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques in Large Language Models,"S. M Towhidul Islam Tonmoy, S M Mehedi Zaman, Vinija Jain, Anku Rani, Vipula Rawte, Aman Chadha, Amitava Das","As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to write human-like text, a key challenge remains around their tendency to hallucinate generating content that appears factual but is ungrounded. This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives. The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01313v3,2024-01
Large Legal Fictions: Profiling Legal Hallucinations in Large Language Models,"Matthew Dahl, Varun Magesh, Mirac Suzgun, Daniel E. Ho","Do large language models (LLMs) know the law? These models are increasingly being used to augment legal practice, education, and research, yet their revolutionary potential is threatened by the presence of hallucinations -- textual output that is not consistent with legal facts. We present the first systematic evidence of these hallucinations, documenting LLMs' varying performance across jurisdictions, courts, time periods, and cases. Our work makes four key contributions. First, we develop a typology of legal hallucinations, providing a conceptual framework for future research in this area. Second, we find that legal hallucinations are alarmingly prevalent, occurring between 58% of the time with ChatGPT 4 and 88% with Llama 2, when these models are asked specific, verifiable questions about random federal court cases. Third, we illustrate that LLMs often fail to correct a user's incorrect legal assumptions in a contra-factual question setup. Fourth, we provide evidence that LLMs cannot always predict, or do not always know, when they are producing legal hallucinations. Taken together, our findings caution against the rapid and unsupervised integration of popular LLMs into legal tasks. Even experienced lawyers must remain wary of legal hallucinations, and the risks are highest for those who stand to benefit from LLMs the most -- pro se litigants or those without access to traditional legal resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01301v2,2024-01

Traditionally, these models are assessed through fine-tuned downstream tasks. However, this raises the question of how to evaluate these models more efficiently and more effectively. In this study, we explore a novel approach where we leverage the meta-features associated with each entity as a source of worldly knowledge and employ entity representations from the models. We propose using the consistency between these representations and the meta-features as a metric for evaluating pre-trained models. Our method's effectiveness is demonstrated across various domains, including models with relational datasets, large language models and image models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02987v4,2024-01

However, a primary limitation lies in the significant computational demands during training, arising from their extensive parameterization. This challenge is further intensified by the dynamic nature of the world, necessitating frequent updates to LLMs to correct outdated information or integrate new knowledge, thereby ensuring their continued relevance. Note that many applications demand continual model adjustments post-training to address deficiencies or undesirable behaviors. There is an increasing interest in efficient, lightweight methods for on-the-fly model modifications. To this end, recent years have seen a burgeoning in the techniques of knowledge editing for LLMs, which aim to efficiently modify LLMs' behaviors within specific domains while preserving overall performance across various inputs. In this paper, we first define the knowledge editing problem and then provide a comprehensive review of cutting-edge approaches. Drawing inspiration from educational and cognitive research theories, we propose a unified categorization criterion that classifies knowledge editing methods into three groups: resorting to external knowledge, merging knowledge into the model, and editing intrinsic knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark, KnowEdit, for a comprehensive empirical evaluation of representative knowledge editing approaches. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of knowledge location, which can give a deeper understanding of the knowledge structures inherent within LLMs. Finally, we discuss several potential applications of knowledge editing, outlining its broad and impactful implications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01286v5,2024-01
Quality and Quantity of Machine Translation References for Automatic Metrics,"Vilém Zouhar, Ondřej Bojar","Automatic machine translation metrics typically rely on human translations to determine the quality of system translations. Common wisdom in the field dictates that the human references should be of very high quality. However, there are no cost-benefit analyses that could be used to guide practitioners who plan to collect references for machine translation evaluation. We find that higher-quality references lead to better metric correlations with humans at the segment-level. Having up to 7 references per segment and taking their average (or maximum) helps all metrics. Interestingly, the references from vendors of different qualities can be mixed together and improve metric success. Higher quality references, however, cost more to create and we frame this as an optimization problem: given a specific budget, what references should be collected to maximize metric success. These findings can be used by evaluators of shared tasks when references need to be created under a certain budget.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01283v5,2024-01
CharacterEval: A Chinese Benchmark for Role-Playing Conversational Agent Evaluation,"Quan Tu, Shilong Fan, Zihang Tian, Rui Yan","Recently, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized generative agents. Among them, Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs) attract considerable attention due to their ability to emotionally engage users. However, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark impedes progress in this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CharacterEval, a Chinese benchmark for comprehensive RPCA assessment, complemented by a tailored high-quality dataset. The dataset comprises 1,785 multi-turn role-playing dialogues, encompassing 23,020 examples and featuring 77 characters derived from Chinese novels and scripts. It was carefully constructed, beginning with initial dialogue extraction via GPT-4, followed by rigorous human-led quality control, and enhanced with in-depth character profiles sourced from Baidu Baike. CharacterEval employs a multifaceted evaluation approach, encompassing thirteen targeted metrics on four dimensions. Comprehensive experiments on CharacterEval demonstrate that Chinese LLMs exhibit more promising capabilities than GPT-4 in Chinese role-playing conversation.

Fairness Certification for Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models,"Vincent Freiberger, Erik Buchmann","Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays an important role in our daily lives, particularly due to the enormous progress of Large Language Models (LLM). However, NLP has many fairness-critical use cases, e.g., as an expert system in recruitment or as an LLM-based tutor in education. Since NLP is based on human language, potentially harmful biases can diffuse into NLP systems and produce unfair results, discriminate against minorities or generate legal issues. Hence, it is important to develop a fairness certification for NLP approaches. We follow a qualitative research approach towards a fairness certification for NLP. In particular, we have reviewed a large body of literature on algorithmic fairness, and we have conducted semi-structured expert interviews with a wide range of experts from that area. We have systematically devised six fairness criteria for NLP, which can be further refined into 18 sub-categories. Our criteria offer a foundation for operationalizing and testing processes to certify fairness, both from the perspective of the auditor and the audited organization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01262v2,2024-01
VideoStudio: Generating Consistent-Content and Multi-Scene Videos,"Fuchen Long, Zhaofan Qiu, Ting Yao, Tao Mei","The recent innovations and breakthroughs in diffusion models have significantly expanded the possibilities of generating high-quality videos for the given prompts. Most existing works tackle the single-scene scenario with only one video event occurring in a single background. Extending to generate multi-scene videos nevertheless is not trivial and necessitates to nicely manage the logic in between while preserving the consistent visual appearance of key content across video scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely VideoStudio, for consistent-content and multi-scene video generation. Technically, VideoStudio leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to convert the input prompt into comprehensive multi-scene script that benefits from the logical knowledge learnt by LLM. The script for each scene includes a prompt describing the event, the foreground/background entities, as well as camera movement. VideoStudio identifies the common entities throughout the script and asks LLM to detail each entity. The resultant entity description is then fed into a text-to-image model to generate a reference image for each entity. Finally, VideoStudio outputs a multi-scene video by generating each scene video via a diffusion process that takes the reference images, the descriptive prompt of the event and camera movement into account. The diffusion model incorporates the reference images as the condition and alignment to strengthen the content consistency of multi-scene videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoStudio outperforms the SOTA video generation models in terms of visual quality, content consistency, and user preference.

Self-Supervised Position Debiasing for Large Language Models,"Zhongkun Liu, Zheng Chen, Mengqi Zhang, Zhaochun Ren, Pengjie Ren, Zhumin Chen","Fine-tuning has been demonstrated to be an effective method to improve the domain performance of large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs might fit the dataset bias and shortcuts for prediction, leading to poor generation performance. Previous works have proven that LLMs are prone to exhibit position bias, i.e., leveraging information positioned at the beginning or end, or specific positional cues within the input. Existing debiasing methods for LLMs require external bias knowledge or annotated non-biased samples, which is lacking for position debiasing and impractical in reality. In this work, we propose a self-supervised position debiasing (SOD) framework to mitigate position bias for LLMs. SOD leverages unsupervised responses from pre-trained LLMs for debiasing without relying on any external knowledge. To improve the quality of unsupervised responses, we propose an objective alignment (OAM) module to prune these responses. Experiments on eight datasets and five tasks show that SOD consistently outperforms existing methods in mitigating three types of position biases. Besides, SOD achieves this by sacrificing only a small performance on biased samples, which is general and effective. To facilitate the reproducibility of the results, we share the code of all methods and datasets on https://github.com/LZKSKY/SOD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01218v3,2024-01
Uncertainty Resolution in Misinformation Detection,"Yury Orlovskiy, Camille Thibault, Anne Imouza, Jean-François Godbout, Reihaneh Rabbany, Kellin Pelrine","Misinformation poses a variety of risks, such as undermining public trust and distorting factual discourse. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have been shown effective in mitigating misinformation, particularly in handling statements where enough context is provided. However, they struggle to assess ambiguous or context-deficient statements accurately. This work introduces a new method to resolve uncertainty in such statements. We propose a framework to categorize missing information and publish category labels for the LIAR-New dataset, which is adaptable to cross-domain content with missing information. We then leverage this framework to generate effective user queries for missing context. Compared to baselines, our method improves the rate at which generated questions are answerable by the user by 38 percentage points and classification performance by over 10 percentage points macro F1. Thus, this approach may provide a valuable component for future misinformation mitigation pipelines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01197v1,2024-01
Unifying Structured Data as Graph for Data-to-Text Pre-Training,"Shujie Li, Liang Li, Ruiying Geng, Min Yang, Binhua Li, Guanghu Yuan, Wanwei He, Shao Yuan, Can Ma, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li","Data-to-text (D2T) generation aims to transform structured data into natural language text. Data-to-text pre-training has proved to be powerful in enhancing D2T generation and yields impressive performances. However, previous pre-training methods either oversimplified structured data into a sequence without considering input structures or designed training objectives tailored for a specific data structure (e.g., table or knowledge graph). In this paper, we unify different types of structured data (i.e., table, key-value data, knowledge graph) into the graph format and cast different data-to-text generation tasks as graph-to-text generation. To effectively exploit the structural information of the input graph, we propose a structure-enhanced pre-training method for D2T generation by designing a structure-enhanced Transformer. Concretely, we devise a position matrix for the Transformer, encoding relative positional information of connected nodes in the input graph. In addition, we propose a new attention matrix to incorporate graph structures into the original Transformer by taking the available explicit connectivity structure into account.

"Identification of Regulatory Requirements Relevant to Business Processes: A Comparative Study on Generative AI, Embedding-based Ranking, Crowd and Expert-driven Methods","Catherine Sai, Shazia Sadiq, Lei Han, Gianluca Demartini, Stefanie Rinderle-Ma","Organizations face the challenge of ensuring compliance with an increasing amount of requirements from various regulatory documents. Which requirements are relevant depends on aspects such as the geographic location of the organization, its domain, size, and business processes. Considering these contextual factors, as a first step, relevant documents (e.g., laws, regulations, directives, policies) are identified, followed by a more detailed analysis of which parts of the identified documents are relevant for which step of a given business process. Nowadays the identification of regulatory requirements relevant to business processes is mostly done manually by domain and legal experts, posing a tremendous effort on them, especially for a large number of regulatory documents which might frequently change. Hence, this work examines how legal and domain experts can be assisted in the assessment of relevant requirements. For this, we compare an embedding-based NLP ranking method, a generative AI method using GPT-4, and a crowdsourced method with the purely manual method of creating relevancy labels by experts. The proposed methods are evaluated based on two case studies: an Australian insurance case created with domain experts and a global banking use case, adapted from SAP Signavio's workflow example of an international guideline. A gold standard is created for both BPMN2.0 processes and matched to real-world textual requirements from multiple regulatory documents. The evaluation and discussion provide insights into strengths and weaknesses of each method regarding applicability, automation, transparency, and reproducibility and provide guidelines on which method combinations will maximize benefits for given characteristics such as process usage, impact, and dynamics of an application scenario.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02986v1,2024-01

DialCLIP: Empowering CLIP as Multi-Modal Dialog Retriever,"Zhichao Yin, Binyuan Hui, Min Yang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li","Recently, substantial advancements in pre-trained vision-language models have greatly enhanced the capabilities of multi-modal dialog systems. These models have demonstrated significant improvements by fine-tuning on downstream tasks. However, the existing pre-trained models primarily focus on effectively capturing the alignment between vision and language modalities, often ignoring the intricate nature of dialog context. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient prompt-tuning method named DialCLIP for multi-modal dialog retrieval. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-modal context prompt generator to learn context features which are subsequently distilled into prompts within the pre-trained vision-language model CLIP. Besides, we introduce domain prompt to mitigate the disc repancy from the downstream dialog data. To facilitate various types of retrieval, we also design multiple experts to learn mappings from CLIP outputs to multi-modal representation space, with each expert being responsible to one specific retrieval type. Extensive experiments show that DialCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely recognized benchmark datasets (i.e., PhotoChat and MMDialog) by tuning a mere 0.04% of the total parameters. These results highlight the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed approach, underscoring its potential to advance the field of multi-modal dialog retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01076v2,2024-01
Discovering Significant Topics from Legal Decisions with Selective Inference,Jerrold Soh,"We propose and evaluate an automated pipeline for discovering significant topics from legal decision texts by passing features synthesized with topic models through penalised regressions and post-selection significance tests.

In this paper, we focus on how to effectively transfer the capabilities of language generation and following instructions to a non-English language. To answer this question, we conduct an extensive empirical investigation based on LLaMA, accumulating over 1440 GPU hours. We analyze the impact of key factors such as vocabulary extension, further pretraining, and instruction tuning on transfer. To accurately assess the model's level of knowledge, we employ four widely used standardized testing benchmarks: C-Eval, MMLU, AGI-Eval, and GAOKAO-Bench. Furthermore, a comprehensive evaluation of the model's response quality is conducted, considering aspects such as accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical coherence, and harmlessness, based on LLM-Eval, a benchmarks consisting instruction tasks from 17 diverse categories. Our evaluation results demonstrate that comparable performance to state-of-the-art transfer models can be achieved with less than 1% of the pretraining data, both in terms of knowledge alignment and response quality.

Text-to-Audio (TTA), a burgeoning AIGC application designed to generate audio from natural language prompts, is attracting increasing attention. However, existing TTA studies often struggle with generation quality and text-audio alignment, especially for complex textual inputs. Drawing inspiration from state-of-the-art Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models, we introduce Auffusion, a TTA system adapting T2I model frameworks to TTA task, by effectively leveraging their inherent generative strengths and precise cross-modal alignment. Our objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that Auffusion surpasses previous TTA approaches using limited data and computational resource. Furthermore, previous studies in T2I recognizes the significant impact of encoder choice on cross-modal alignment, like fine-grained details and object bindings, while similar evaluation is lacking in prior TTA works. Through comprehensive ablation studies and innovative cross-attention map visualizations, we provide insightful assessments of text-audio alignment in TTA. Our findings reveal Auffusion's superior capability in generating audios that accurately match textual descriptions, which further demonstrated in several related tasks, such as audio style transfer, inpainting and other manipulations. Our implementation and demos are available at https://auffusion.github.io.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01044v1,2024-01
Evaluating Large Language Models on the GMAT: Implications for the Future of Business Education,"Vahid Ashrafimoghari, Necdet Gürkan, Jordan W. Suchow","The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the domain of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI, has opened new avenues for application across various fields, yet its role in business education remains underexplored. This study introduces the first benchmark to assess the performance of seven major LLMs, OpenAI's models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and GPT-4 Turbo), Google's models (PaLM 2, Gemini 1.0 Pro), and Anthropic's models (Claude 2 and Claude 2.1), on the GMAT, which is a key exam in the admission process for graduate business programs. Our analysis shows that most LLMs outperform human candidates, with GPT-4 Turbo not only outperforming the other models but also surpassing the average scores of graduate students at top business schools. Through a case study, this research examines GPT-4 Turbo's ability to explain answers, evaluate responses, identify errors, tailor instructions, and generate alternative scenarios. The latest LLM versions, GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 2.1, and Gemini 1.0 Pro, show marked improvements in reasoning tasks compared to their predecessors, underscoring their potential for complex problem-solving. While AI's promise in education, assessment, and tutoring is clear, challenges remain. Our study not only sheds light on LLMs' academic potential but also emphasizes the need for careful development and application of AI in education. As AI technology advances, it is imperative to establish frameworks and protocols for AI interaction, verify the accuracy of AI-generated content, ensure worldwide access for diverse learners, and create an educational environment where AI supports human expertise. This research sets the stage for further exploration into the responsible use of AI to enrich educational experiences and improve exam preparation and assessment methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02985v1,2024-01
Detection of Machine-Generated Text: Literature Survey,Dmytro Valiaiev,"Since language models produce fake text quickly and easily, there is an oversupply of such content in the public domain. The degree of sophistication and writing style has reached a point where differentiating between human authored and machine-generated content is nearly impossible. As a result, works generated by language models rather than human authors have gained significant media attention and stirred controversy.Concerns regarding the possible influence of advanced language models on society have also arisen, needing a fuller knowledge of these processes. Natural language generation (NLG) and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models have revolutionized a variety of sectors: the scope not only permeated throughout journalism and customer service but also reached academia. To mitigate the hazardous implications that may arise from the use of these models, preventative measures must be implemented, such as providing human agents with the capacity to distinguish between artificially made and human composed texts utilizing automated systems and possibly reverse-engineered language models. Furthermore, to ensure a balanced and responsible approach, it is critical to have a full grasp of the socio-technological ramifications of these breakthroughs. This literature survey aims to compile and synthesize accomplishments and developments in the aforementioned work, while also identifying future prospects. It also gives an overview of machine-generated text trends and explores the larger societal implications. Ultimately, this survey intends to contribute to the development of robust and effective approaches for resolving the issues connected with the usage and detection of machine-generated text by exploring the interplay between the capabilities of language models and their possible implications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01642v1,2024-01
Fast and Effective Weight Update for Pruned Large Language Models,Vladimír Boža,"Pruning large language models (LLMs) is a challenging task due to their enormous size. The primary difficulty is fine-tuning the model after pruning, which is needed to recover the lost performance caused by dropping weights. Recent approaches have either ignored fine-tuning entirely, focusing on efficient pruning criteria, or attempted layer-wise weight updates, preserving the behavior of each layer. However, even layer-wise weight updates can be costly for LLMs, and previous works have resorted to various approximations.   In our paper, we propose a fast and effective weight update algorithm for pruned layers based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We further extend it with a simple gradual pruning mask selection and achieve state-of-the-art pruning performance across a wide range of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/fmfi-compbio/admm-pruning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02938v2,2024-01
"Graph-Convolutional Autoencoder Ensembles for the Humanities, Illustrated with a Study of the American Slave Trade",Tom Lippincott,"We introduce a graph-aware autoencoder ensemble framework, with associated formalisms and tooling, designed to facilitate deep learning for scholarship in the humanities. By composing sub-architectures to produce a model isomorphic to a humanistic domain we maintain interpretability while providing function signatures for each sub-architectural choice, allowing both traditional and computational researchers to collaborate without disrupting established practices. We illustrate a practical application of our approach to a historical study of the American post-Atlantic slave trade, and make several specific technical contributions: a novel hybrid graph-convolutional autoencoder mechanism, batching policies for common graph topologies, and masking techniques for particular use-cases. The effectiveness of the framework for broadening participation of diverse domains is demonstrated by a growing suite of two dozen studies, both collaborations with humanists and established tasks from machine learning literature, spanning a variety of fields and data modalities. We make performance comparisons of several different architectural choices and conclude with an ambitious list of imminent next steps for this research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00824v1,2024-01
Large Language Models in Mental Health Care: a Scoping Review,"Yining Hua, Fenglin Liu, Kailai Yang, Zehan Li, Hongbin Na, Yi-han Sheu, Peilin Zhou, Lauren V. Moran, Sophia Ananiadou, Andrew Beam, John Torous","The integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care is an emerging field. There is a need to systematically review the application outcomes and delineate the advantages and limitations in clinical settings. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of LLMs in mental health care, assessing their efficacy, challenges, and potential for future applications. A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv in November 2023. All forms of original research, peer-reviewed or not, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023, are included without language restrictions if they used LLMs developed after T5 and directly addressed research questions in mental health care settings. From an initial pool of 313 articles, 34 met the inclusion criteria based on their relevance to LLM application in mental health care and the robustness of reported outcomes. Diverse applications of LLMs in mental health care are identified, including diagnosis, therapy, patient engagement enhancement, etc. Key challenges include data availability and reliability, nuanced handling of mental states, and effective evaluation methods. Despite successes in accuracy and accessibility improvement, gaps in clinical applicability and ethical considerations were evident, pointing to the need for robust data, standardized evaluations, and interdisciplinary collaboration. LLMs hold substantial promise for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized, emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations to address current limitations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02984v2,2024-01
A Computational Framework for Behavioral Assessment of LLM Therapists,"Yu Ying Chiu, Ashish Sharma, Inna Wanyin Lin, Tim Althoff","The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has increased interest in their use as therapists to address mental health challenges and the widespread lack of access to care. However, experts have emphasized the critical need for systematic evaluation of LLM-based mental health interventions to accurately assess their capabilities and limitations. Here, we propose BOLT, a proof-of-concept computational framework to systematically assess the conversational behavior of LLM therapists. We quantitatively measure LLM behavior across 13 psychotherapeutic approaches with in-context learning methods. Then, we compare the behavior of LLMs against high- and low-quality human therapy. Our analysis based on Motivational Interviewing therapy reveals that LLMs often resemble behaviors more commonly exhibited in low-quality therapy rather than high-quality therapy, such as offering a higher degree of problem-solving advice when clients share emotions. However, unlike low-quality therapy, LLMs reflect significantly more upon clients' needs and strengths. Our findings caution that LLM therapists still require further research for consistent, high-quality care.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00820v2,2024-01
"If LLM Is the Wizard, Then Code Is the Wand: A Survey on How Code Empowers Large Language Models to Serve as Intelligent Agents","Ke Yang, Jiateng Liu, John Wu, Chaoqi Yang, Yi R. Fung, Sha Li, Zixuan Huang, Xu Cao, Xingyao Wang, Yiquan Wang, Heng Ji, Chengxiang Zhai","The prominent large language models (LLMs) of today differ from past language models not only in size, but also in the fact that they are trained on a combination of natural language and formal language (code). As a medium between humans and computers, code translates high-level goals into executable steps, featuring standard syntax, logical consistency, abstraction, and modularity. In this survey, we present an overview of the various benefits of integrating code into LLMs' training data. Specifically, beyond enhancing LLMs in code generation, we observe that these unique properties of code help (i) unlock the reasoning ability of LLMs, enabling their applications to a range of more complex natural language tasks; (ii) steer LLMs to produce structured and precise intermediate steps, which can then be connected to external execution ends through function calls; and (iii) take advantage of code compilation and execution environment, which also provides diverse feedback for model improvement. In addition, we trace how these profound capabilities of LLMs, brought by code, have led to their emergence as intelligent agents (IAs) in situations where the ability to understand instructions, decompose goals, plan and execute actions, and refine from feedback are crucial to their success on downstream tasks. Finally, we present several key challenges and future directions of empowering LLMs with code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00812v2,2024-01
PerSHOP -- A Persian dataset for shopping dialogue systems modeling,"Keyvan Mahmoudi, Heshaam Faili","Nowadays, dialogue systems are used in many fields of industry and research. There are successful instances of these systems, such as Apple Siri, Google Assistant, and IBM Watson. Task-oriented dialogue system is a category of these, that are used in specific tasks. They can perform tasks such as booking plane tickets or making restaurant reservations. Shopping is one of the most popular areas on these systems. The bot replaces the human salesperson and interacts with the customers by speaking. To train the models behind the scenes of these systems, annotated data is needed. In this paper, we developed a dataset of dialogues in the Persian language through crowd-sourcing. We annotated these dialogues to train a model. This dataset contains nearly 22k utterances in 15 different domains and 1061 dialogues. This is the largest Persian dataset in this field, which is provided freely so that future researchers can use it. Also, we proposed some baseline models for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. These models perform two tasks for NLU: intent classification and entity extraction. The F-1 score metric obtained for intent classification is around 91% and for entity extraction is around 93%, which can be a baseline for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00811v1,2024-01
SecFormer: Fast and Accurate Privacy-Preserving Inference for Transformer Models via SMPC,"Jinglong Luo, Yehong Zhang, Zhuo Zhang, Jiaqi Zhang, Xin Mu, Hui Wang, Yue Yu, Zenglin Xu","With the growing use of Transformer models hosted on cloud platforms to offer inference services, privacy concerns are escalating, especially concerning sensitive data like investment plans and bank account details. Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC) emerges as a promising solution to protect the privacy of inference data and model parameters. However, the application of SMPC in Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) for Transformer models often leads to considerable slowdowns or declines in performance. This is largely due to the multitude of nonlinear operations in the Transformer architecture, which are not well-suited to SMPC and difficult to circumvent or optimize effectively. To address this concern, we introduce a comprehensive PPI framework called SecFormer to achieve fast and accurate PPI for Transformer models. We successfully eliminate the high-cost exponential and maximum operations in PPI without sacrificing model performance and develop a suite of efficient SMPC protocols by employing suitable numerical computation methods to boost other complex nonlinear functions in PPI, including GeLU, LayerNorm, and a redesigned Softmax. Our extensive experiments reveal that SecFormer outperforms MPCFormer in performance, showing improvements of $3.4\%$ and $24.7\%$ for BERT$_{\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\text{LARGE}}$, respectively. In terms of efficiency, SecFormer is 3.57 and 3.58 times faster than PUMA for BERT$_{\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\text{LARGE}}$, demonstrating its effectiveness and speed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00793v4,2024-01
Astraios: Parameter-Efficient Instruction Tuning Code Large Language Models,"Terry Yue Zhuo, Armel Zebaze, Nitchakarn Suppattarachai, Leandro von Werra, Harm de Vries, Qian Liu, Niklas Muennighoff","The high cost of full-parameter fine-tuning (FFT) of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a series of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. However, it remains unclear which methods provide the best cost-performance trade-off at different model scales. We introduce Astraios, a suite of 28 instruction-tuned OctoCoder models using 7 tuning methods and 4 model sizes up to 16 billion parameters. Through investigations across 5 tasks and 8 different datasets encompassing both code comprehension and code generation tasks, we find that FFT generally leads to the best downstream performance across all scales, and PEFT methods differ significantly in their efficacy based on the model scale. LoRA usually offers the most favorable trade-off between cost and performance. Further investigation into the effects of these methods on both model robustness and code security reveals that larger models tend to demonstrate reduced robustness and less security. At last, we explore the relationships among updated parameters, cross-entropy loss, and task performance. We find that the tuning effectiveness observed in small models generalizes well to larger models, and the validation loss in instruction tuning can be a reliable indicator of overall downstream performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00788v1,2024-01
FinDABench: Benchmarking Financial Data Analysis Ability of Large Language Models,"Shu Liu, Shangqing Zhao, Chenghao Jia, Xinlin Zhuang, Zhaoguang Long, Jie Zhou, Aimin Zhou, Man Lan, Qingquan Wu, Chong Yang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their proficiency and reliability in the specialized domain of financial data analysis, particularly focusing on data-driven thinking, remain uncertain. To bridge this gap, we introduce \texttt{FinDABench}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the financial data analysis capabilities of LLMs within this context. \texttt{FinDABench} assesses LLMs across three dimensions: 1) \textbf{Foundational Ability}, evaluating the models' ability to perform financial numerical calculation and corporate sentiment risk assessment; 2) \textbf{Reasoning Ability}, determining the models' ability to quickly comprehend textual information and analyze abnormal financial reports; and 3) \textbf{Technical Skill}, examining the models' use of technical knowledge to address real-world data analysis challenges involving analysis generation and charts visualization from multiple perspectives.

Temporal Validity Change Prediction,"Georg Wenzel, Adam Jatowt","Temporal validity is an important property of text that is useful for many downstream applications, such as recommender systems, conversational AI, or story understanding. Existing benchmarking tasks often require models to identify the temporal validity duration of a single statement. However, in many cases, additional contextual information, such as sentences in a story or posts on a social media profile, can be collected from the available text stream. This contextual information may greatly alter the duration for which a statement is expected to be valid. We propose Temporal Validity Change Prediction, a natural language processing task benchmarking the capability of machine learning models to detect contextual statements that induce such change. We create a dataset consisting of temporal target statements sourced from Twitter and crowdsource sample context statements. We then benchmark a set of transformer-based language models on our dataset. Finally, we experiment with temporal validity duration prediction as an auxiliary task to improve the performance of the state-of-the-art model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00779v1,2024-01
"New Job, New Gender? Measuring the Social Bias in Image Generation Models","Wenxuan Wang, Haonan Bai, Jen-tse Huang, Yuxuan Wan, Youliang Yuan, Haoyi Qiu, Nanyun Peng, Michael R. Lyu","Image generation models can generate or edit images from a given text. Recent advancements in image generation technology, exemplified by DALL-E and Midjourney, have been groundbreaking. These advanced models, despite their impressive capabilities, are often trained on massive Internet datasets, making them susceptible to generating content that perpetuates social stereotypes and biases, which can lead to severe consequences. Prior research on assessing bias within image generation models suffers from several shortcomings, including limited accuracy, reliance on extensive human labor, and lack of comprehensive analysis. In this paper, we propose BiasPainter, a novel evaluation framework that can accurately, automatically and comprehensively trigger social bias in image generation models. BiasPainter uses a diverse range of seed images of individuals and prompts the image generation models to edit these images using gender, race, and age-neutral queries. These queries span 62 professions, 39 activities, 57 types of objects, and 70 personality traits. The framework then compares the edited images to the original seed images, focusing on the significant changes related to gender, race, and age. BiasPainter adopts a key insight that these characteristics should not be modified when subjected to neutral prompts. Built upon this design, BiasPainter can trigger the social bias and evaluate the fairness of image generation models. We use BiasPainter to evaluate six widely-used image generation models, such as stable diffusion and Midjourney. Experimental results show that BiasPainter can successfully trigger social bias in image generation models. According to our human evaluation, BiasPainter can achieve 90.8% accuracy on automatic bias detection, which is significantly higher than the results reported in previous work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00763v3,2024-01
The Earth is Flat? Unveiling Factual Errors in Large Language Models,"Wenxuan Wang, Juluan Shi, Zhaopeng Tu, Youliang Yuan, Jen-tse Huang, Wenxiang Jiao, Michael R. Lyu","Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are foundational in various applications due to their extensive knowledge from pre-training and fine-tuning. Despite this, they are prone to generating factual and commonsense errors, raising concerns in critical areas like healthcare, journalism, and education to mislead users. Current methods for evaluating LLMs' veracity are limited by test data leakage or the need for extensive human labor, hindering efficient and accurate error detection. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel, automatic testing framework, FactChecker, aimed at uncovering factual inaccuracies in LLMs. This framework involves three main steps: First, it constructs a factual knowledge graph by retrieving fact triplets from a large-scale knowledge database. Then, leveraging the knowledge graph, FactChecker employs a rule-based approach to generates three types of questions (Yes-No, Multiple-Choice, and WH questions) that involve single-hop and multi-hop relations, along with correct answers. Lastly, it assesses the LLMs' responses for accuracy using tailored matching strategies for each question type. Our extensive tests on six prominent LLMs, including text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003, ChatGPT~(gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4), Vicuna, and LLaMA-2, reveal that FactChecker can trigger factual errors in up to 45\% of questions in these models. Moreover, we demonstrate that FactChecker's test cases can improve LLMs' factual accuracy through in-context learning and fine-tuning (e.g., llama-2-13b-chat's accuracy increase from 35.3\% to 68.5\%). We are making all code, data, and results available for future research endeavors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00761v1,2024-01
LogicAsker: Evaluating and Improving the Logical Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models,"Yuxuan Wan, Wenxuan Wang, Yiliu Yang, Youliang Yuan, Jen-tse Huang, Pinjia He, Wenxiang Jiao, Michael R. Lyu","We introduce LogicAsker, a novel approach for evaluating and enhancing the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Despite LLMs' prowess in tasks like writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation, assessing their ability to reason has been challenging. Traditional evaluations often prioritize accuracy on downstream tasks over direct assessments of reasoning processes. LogicAsker addresses this gap by employing a set of atomic reasoning skills grounded in propositional and predicate logic to systematically examine and improve the reasoning prowess of LLMs. Our methodology reveals significant gaps in LLMs' learning of logical rules, with identified reasoning failures ranging from 29\% to 90\% across different models. Moreover, we leverage these findings to construct targeted demonstration examples and fine-tune data, notably enhancing logical reasoning in models like GPT-4o by up to 5\%. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to utilize test case outcomes to effectively refine LLMs' formal reasoning capabilities. We make our code, data, and results publicly available (https://github.com/yxwan123/LogicAsker) to facilitate further research and replication of our findings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00757v3,2024-01
Machine Translation Testing via Syntactic Tree Pruning,"Quanjun Zhang, Juan Zhai, Chunrong Fang, Jiawei Liu, Weisong Sun, Haichuan Hu, Qingyu Wang","Machine translation systems have been widely adopted in our daily life, making life easier and more convenient. Unfortunately, erroneous translations may result in severe consequences, such as financial losses. This requires to improve the accuracy and the reliability of machine translation systems. However, it is challenging to test machine translation systems because of the complexity and intractability of the underlying neural models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel metamorphic testing approach by syntactic tree pruning (STP) to validate machine translation systems. Our key insight is that a pruned sentence should have similar crucial semantics compared with the original sentence. Specifically, STP (1) proposes a core semantics-preserving pruning strategy by basic sentence structure and dependency relations on the level of syntactic tree representation; (2) generates source sentence pairs based on the metamorphic relation; (3) reports suspicious issues whose translations break the consistency property by a bag-of-words model. We further evaluate STP on two state-of-the-art machine translation systems (i.e., Google Translate and Bing Microsoft Translator) with 1,200 source sentences as inputs. The results show that STP can accurately find 5,073 unique erroneous translations in Google Translate and 5,100 unique erroneous translations in Bing Microsoft Translator (400% more than state-of-the-art techniques), with 64.5% and 65.4% precision, respectively. The reported erroneous translations vary in types and more than 90% of them cannot be found by state-of-the-art techniques. There are 9,393 erroneous translations unique to STP, which is 711.9% more than state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, STP is quite effective to detect translation errors for the original sentences with a recall reaching 74.0%, improving state-of-the-art techniques by 55.1% on average.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00751v1,2024-01
ToolEyes: Fine-Grained Evaluation for Tool Learning Capabilities of Large Language Models in Real-world Scenarios,"Junjie Ye, Guanyu Li, Songyang Gao, Caishuang Huang, Yilong Wu, Sixian Li, Xiaoran Fan, Shihan Dou, Tao Ji, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang","Existing evaluations of tool learning primarily focus on validating the alignment of selected tools for large language models (LLMs) with expected outcomes. However, these approaches rely on a limited set of scenarios where answers can be pre-determined, diverging from genuine needs. Furthermore, a sole emphasis on outcomes disregards the complex capabilities required for LLMs to effectively use tools. To tackle this issue, we propose ToolEyes, a fine-grained system tailored for the evaluation of the LLMs' tool learning capabilities in authentic scenarios. The system meticulously examines seven real-world scenarios, analyzing five dimensions crucial to LLMs in tool learning: format alignment, intent comprehension, behavior planning, tool selection, and answer organization. Additionally, ToolEyes incorporates a tool library boasting approximately 600 tools, serving as an intermediary between LLMs and the physical world. Evaluations involving ten LLMs across three categories reveal a preference for specific scenarios and limited cognitive abilities in tool learning. Intriguingly, expanding the model size even exacerbates the hindrance to tool learning.

Large Language Models aren't all that you need,"Kiran Voderhobli Holla, Chaithanya Kumar, Aryan Singh","This paper describes the architecture and systems built towards solving the SemEval 2023 Task 2: MultiCoNER II (Multilingual Complex Named Entity Recognition) [1]. We evaluate two approaches (a) a traditional Conditional Random Fields model and (b) a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned with a customized head and compare the two approaches. The novel ideas explored are: 1) Decaying auxiliary loss (with residual) - where we train the model on an auxiliary task of Coarse-Grained NER and include this task as a part of the loss function 2) Triplet token blending - where we explore ways of blending the embeddings of neighboring tokens in the final NER layer prior to prediction 3) Task-optimal heads - where we explore a variety of custom heads and learning rates for the final layer of the LLM. We also explore multiple LLMs including GPT-3 and experiment with a variety of dropout and other hyperparameter settings before arriving at our final model which achieves micro & macro f1 of 0.85/0.84 (on dev) and 0.67/0.61 on the test data . We show that while pre-trained LLMs, by themselves, bring about a large improvement in scores as compared to traditional models, we also demonstrate that tangible improvements to the Macro-F1 score can be made by augmenting the LLM with additional feature/loss/model engineering techniques described above.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00698v1,2024-01
Benchmarking Large Language Models on Controllable Generation under Diversified Instructions,"Yihan Chen, Benfeng Xu, Quan Wang, Yi Liu, Zhendong Mao","While large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive instruction-following capabilities, it is still unclear whether and to what extent they can respond to explicit constraints that might be entailed in various instructions. As a significant aspect of LLM alignment, it is thus important to formulate such a specialized set of instructions as well as investigate the resulting behavior of LLMs. To address this vacancy, we propose a new benchmark CoDI-Eval to systematically and comprehensively evaluate LLMs' responses to instructions with various constraints. We construct a large collection of constraints-attributed instructions as a test suite focused on both generalization and coverage. Specifically, we advocate an instruction diversification process to synthesize diverse forms of constraint expression and also deliberate the candidate task taxonomy with even finer-grained sub-categories. Finally, we automate the entire evaluation process to facilitate further developments. Different from existing studies on controllable text generation, CoDI-Eval extends the scope to the prevalent instruction-following paradigm for the first time. We provide extensive evaluations of representative LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Vicuna) on CoDI-Eval, revealing their limitations in following instructions with specific constraints and there is still a significant gap between open-source and commercial closed-source LLMs. We believe this benchmark will facilitate research into improving the controllability of LLMs' responses to instructions.

Sentiment analysis provides a mechanism to study the emotions expressed in text. Recently, sentiment analysis has been used to study and compare translations of the Bhagavad Gita, which is a fundamental and sacred Hindu text. In this study, we use sentiment analysis for studying selected chapters of the Bible. These chapters are known as the Sermon on the Mount. We utilize a pre-trained language model for sentiment analysis by reviewing five translations of the Sermon on the Mount, which include the King James version, the New International Version, the New Revised Standard Version, the Lamsa Version, and the Basic English Version. We provide a chapter-by-chapter and verse-by-verse comparison using sentiment and semantic analysis and review the major sentiments expressed.

Digger: Detecting Copyright Content Mis-usage in Large Language Model Training,"Haodong Li, Gelei Deng, Yi Liu, Kailong Wang, Yuekang Li, Tianwei Zhang, Yang Liu, Guoai Xu, Guosheng Xu, Haoyu Wang","Pre-training, which utilizes extensive and varied datasets, is a critical factor in the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across numerous applications. However, the detailed makeup of these datasets is often not disclosed, leading to concerns about data security and potential misuse. This is particularly relevant when copyrighted material, still under legal protection, is used inappropriately, either intentionally or unintentionally, infringing on the rights of the authors.   In this paper, we introduce a detailed framework designed to detect and assess the presence of content from potentially copyrighted books within the training datasets of LLMs. This framework also provides a confidence estimation for the likelihood of each content sample's inclusion. To validate our approach, we conduct a series of simulated experiments, the results of which affirm the framework's effectiveness in identifying and addressing instances of content misuse in LLM training processes. Furthermore, we investigate the presence of recognizable quotes from famous literary works within these datasets.

Brown, Gail Rosen","During times of increasing antibiotic resistance and the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19, it is important to classify genes related to antibiotic resistance. As natural language processing has advanced with transformer-based language models, many language models that learn characteristics of nucleotide sequences have also emerged. These models show good performance in classifying various features of nucleotide sequences. When classifying nucleotide sequences, not only the sequence itself, but also various background knowledge is utilized. In this study, we use not only a nucleotide sequence-based language model but also a text language model based on PubMed articles to reflect more biological background knowledge in the model. We propose a method to fine-tune the nucleotide sequence language model and the text language model based on various databases of antibiotic resistance genes. We also propose an LLM-based augmentation technique to supplement the data and an ensemble method to effectively combine the two models. We also propose a benchmark for evaluating the model. Our method achieved better performance than the nucleotide sequence language model in the drug resistance class prediction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00642v1,2024-01
